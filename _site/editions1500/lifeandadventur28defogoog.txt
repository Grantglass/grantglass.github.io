PREFACE TO THIS EDITION. 



In this edition of Robinson Crusoe the text of the original has 
been carefully followed, and no attempt has been made to polish 
the strong unstudied diction of the author, or to improve on his 
homely vigorous language. In only a few instances, and those 
very few and imimportant, has the original text been departed 
from: namely, where there occur in that text (in five or six places) 
evident misprints, or sentences uncorrected by the author and 
standing meaningless or contradictory till the obvious corrections 
were made; and also where, in as few instances, names of places 
were so misspelt (according to modern usage) as to present an 
almost insuperable geographical difficulty to youthful readers. 
For the sake of youthful readers also there have been omitted in 
three or four places certain gross or profane expressions, which, 
though characteristic of the persons supposed to use them, were 
quite superfluous to the text, and formed no essential or desirable 
part of the dialogue. 

These alterations are so slight and unimportant as hardly to 
form actual departures from the original text, and it may there- 
fore be claimed that the present edition of De Foe's immortal 
work (unlike many that have been published) is a faithful repro- 
duction of the original, and that the following pages contain 
"the Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe," as 
they were written nearly a hundred and seventy years ago. 

The Work (as here published) being mainly intended for the 
younger class of readers, many obscure expressions and obsolete 
words have their meaning explained in brief footnotes. 

London, September, 188U.

NOTICE OF 
THE OKIGINAL EDITION OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



The original edition of this masterpiece of De Foe was published 
in 1719, and contained the adventures of Robinson Crusoe up to 
the time of his leaving the island on which he was so long com- 
pelled to reside. Its title was: "The Life and Strange Surprizing 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoey of York, Mariner : who lived eight 
and twenty Years all alone in an uninhabited Island on the 
Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River Oroonoque; 
having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men 
perished but himself: With an Account how he was at last as 
strangely delivered by Pyrates. Written by himself." The work 
was not put forth under De Foe's name, but had prefixed to it a 
short preface, in which " the editor " expresses his high opinion 
of the narrative, as both entertaining and instructive, and gravely 
states that he "believes the thing to be a just History of Fact; 
neither is there any Appearance of Fiction in it." The success of 
this volume was very great (there being four editions of it in the 
same year), and in a few months a second volume was published, 
with the following title: "The farther Adventures of Robinson 
Crusoe, being the Second and last Part of his Life, and strange, 
surprising Accounts of his Travels round Three Parts of the 
Globe. Written by himself." The present edition comprises the 
whole of these two volumes. A sort of supplementary volume 
was published in 1720, consisting of "Serious Reflections" by 
Robinson Crusoe, together with his "Vision of the Anglick 
World." This volume seems never to have had any popularity, 
and is long since utterly forgotten. It has, indeed, no real con- 
nection with the history of Crusoe, nor any interest for readers 
in general.

THE MAN WHO WROTE ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



For more than a century and a half the story of Robinson 
Crusoe has been the most popular narrative ever written. Its 
fascinations have attracted old and young. 

At the time that it was first published (in 1719) it gained such 
a reputation that it was bought by all classes, and it is still a fore- 
most favourite not only with those who read it for amusement, 
but with literary critics, who appreciate the consummate skill of 
the writer, who describes every circumstance and each detail with 
such an easy simplicity as to give the whole story an air of truth 
which at once arrests the attention and controls the imagination. 
Our great^great-grandfathers when they were boys had an 
intimate acquaintance with Robinson Crusoe. To them he was a 
real character; and boys still regard him not so much as the hero 
oi a fiction as an historical person, and talk of his adventures as 
events which really happened. 

Dr. Johnson speaking of this remarkable story asks, "Was 
there ever anything written by mere man that the reader wished 
longer except Robinson Crusoe, Don Quixote, and the Pilgrim's 
Progress f 

One of De Foe's numerous opponents, who endeavoured to 
ridicule and to ruin him at the time that the book was first issued, 
wrote, " There is not an old woman that can go to the price of it 
but buys the 'Life and Adventures,' and leaves it as a legacy with 
the Pilgrim's Progress." This was rare praise though it was 
meant for a snarl, and shows how great must have been the popu- 
larity of the tale, for, if the old folks bought it, we may be sure

xii THE MAN WHO WROTE ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

the young folks either bought or borrowed it, and they have con- 
tinued to do so ever since. 

Perhaps now that you take this book into your hand you may 
hke to hear something about the man who wrote it. He played 
a conspicuous part in several of the most exciting occurrences of 
the time in which he lived, and some of his own adventures and 
vicissitudes were of a very extraordinary kind, especially as he 
began life in a commonplace and humble manner, and might never 
have been heard of but for his courage and industry and for the 
determination with which he constantly opposed tyranny and 
injustice. 

Daniel De Foe was bom in the year 1661. He was the son 
of James Foe, who was "a tradesman in London, and it is not 
known for what reason he placed the "De" before his name, 
unless he discovered that his family was of foreign extraction. 
As his father was a dissenter from the Church of England, Daniel 
was sent to a school kept by a member of the same community at 
Newington Green, where he appears to have studied weU. He was 
an assiduous reader, and it is believed learnt Latin, Dutch, and 
Italian; but he was also a keen observer, and retained in his 
memory nearly everything that he saw or heard, so that as he 
went a great deal into the company of various kinds of people he 
acquired a great deal of information, which he was able to put to 
good account in the large number of essays, pamphlets, and stories 
which he afterwards wrote. 

It was intended that he should be a Nonconformist minister, 
and perhaps his studies and his strong religious convictions were 
in favour of the choice; but for some reason he did not carry out 
this design. At nineteen he wrote his first pamphlet, and soon 
afterwards became known as a satirical writer and a bold opponent 
of the tyrannical measures which the government and the church 
were at that time putting in force against the liberties and the 
consciences of the people. The persecution of the Nonconformists 
and Dissenters naturally excited his indignation, and afterwards 
(when James II. came to the throne), his detestation of the principles

of the government and his strong desire to support Protestantism 
Jed him foolishly to join the rebellion which was attempted by the 
Buke of Monmouth. 

On the failure of this attempt De Foe, more fortunate than 
many others, escaped with life and liberty. He then went into 
business as a hosier or dealer in wool in Freeman's Yard, Com- 
LiiJ, but he continued to write and publish political pamphlets, in 
which he satirized the government and advocated justice and 
constitutional laws. He also wrote on public events and on com- 
mercial and financial subjects. His industry was extraordinary, 
and his caustic satire and humorous reasoning made numerous 
and powerful enemies at the court. While he was in business he 
went on more than one journey to Spain, but he did not succeed 
very well with his trade, possibly because he devoted too much 
attention to politics. Though the number of pamphlets and essays 
which he wrote could have left him little leisure, he had a project 
for making the kind of bricks and tiles which at that time were 
brought to this country from Holland, and accordingly he com- 
menced a manufactory on the banks of the Thames. But while 
he thus introduced a new industry to England he did not profit 
by it, for the persecutions of his opponents prevented him from 
pursuing the enterprise, and he became bankrupt. He then devoted 
his energies to the payment of his creditors in full, and in this he 
succeeded 

When William of Orange came to the throne De Foe's position 
was improved. As a friend to civil and religious liberty and a 
firm Protestant, William III. had his loyal support. Early in 1700 
he published a pamphlet in answer to a libel on the king, and 
called it " The True Bom Englishman." It was in verse, and was 
a defence of William and a satirical attack on his enemies. The 
effect of it was that De Foe was invited to court and received 
a present of a considerable sum of money, which, with the large 
sale of the book, placed him for a time in easy circumstances. 
He hoped to obtain some employment from the government, but 
the death of William III., the accession of Anne, and the influence

years previously had given an account of his being cast away 
on an uninhabited island; but there is little or no resemblance 
between the adventures of Selkirk and the story of Robinson 
Crusoe. De Foe was above fifty years old when he commenced 
his new career as a story-teller, and he lived till he was seventy. 
He died on the 24th of April, 1731, and was buried in the parish 
of St. Giles, Cripplegate, leaving a widow and several children. 

De Foe was a man of true genius and of indomitable pluck. 
Nothing daunted him or prevented him from denouncing oppres- 
sion or upholding the right of liberty of conscience; but time has 
proved that his greatest ability lay in what may be called the art 
of story-telling. The book that is now before you is a proof that 
in this he was a consummate master. There is no need to enter 
into any description of the merits or the style of the story itself, 
but as in this special edition the original language of the author 
has been preserved, it may be well to remind the young reader, 
first, that where that language is not in grammatical accordance 
with modem rules, it is such as was used at the period in which 
Eobinson Crusoe was supposed to have lived; and secondly that 
De Foe was such an accomplished narrator, that he would use 
just the modes of expression that a man like Robinson Crusoe 
would have used at that time. This latter particular is one of the 
reasons why De Foe's story is so real^ and therefore so attractive.

I WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good 
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner 
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull: he got a good estate by 
merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York, 
from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were 
named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from 
whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual cor- 
ruption of words in England, we are now called, nay, we call our- 
selves, and write our name Crusoe, and so my companions always 
called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieutenant -colon el

by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near 
Dunkirk against the Spaniards: what became of my second brother

2 ROBINSON CRAVES FOR THE SEA. 

I never knew, any more than my father or mother did know what 
was become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, 
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. 
My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share 
of learning, as far as house education and a country free school 
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I would be 
satisfied with nothing but going to sea, and my inclination to this 
led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my 
father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother 
and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that 
propension of nature tending directly to the life of misery which 
was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent 
counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me 
one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, 
and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He 
asked me what reasons more than a mere wandering inclination I 
had for leaving my father's house and my native country, where I 
might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my for- 
tune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. 
He told me it was for men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or 
of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon 
adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in 
undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these 
things were all either too far above me, or too far below me; that

4 FATHERLY WARNINGS. 

natural consequences of their* way of living; that the middle 
station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind 
of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a 
middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, 
society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were 
the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way 
men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfort- 
ably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of 
the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed 
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and 
the body of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret 
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in easy circum- 
stances sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting 
the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are 
happy, and learning by every day's experience to know it more 
sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate 
manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself into 
miseries which nature and the station of life I was bom in seemed 
to have provided against; that i was under no necessity of seek- 
ing my bread ; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to 
enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been just 
recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy 
in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder 
it, and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus 
discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he 
knew would be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do very 
kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home, as he 
directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes, 
as to give me any encouragement to go away. And, to close all, 
he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he 
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going 
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young 
desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed ; 
and though, he said, he would not cease to pray for me, yet he 
would venture to say to me that, if I did take this foolish step, God 
would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect

A boy's importunity. 5 

upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to 
assist in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly 
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so 
himself, I say I observed the tears run down his face very plenti- 
fully, and especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed; 
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none 
to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and 
told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse — as indeed who could 
be otherwise? — and I resolved not to think of going abroad any 
more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. But, 
alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of 
«iy father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved 
to run quite away from him. However, I did not act so hastily 
neither as my first heat of resolution prompted; but I took my 
mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than 
ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent 
upon seeing the world, that I should never settle to anything with 
resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had better 
give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was 
now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a 
trade, or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did, I should 
never serve out my time, and I should certainly run away from 
^ master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she 
^ould speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I 
came home again and did not like it, I would go no more, and I 
^ould promise by a double diligence to recover that time I had 
lost 

This put my mother into a great passion. She told me she 
^ew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any 
SQch subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to give 
lis consent to any such thing so much for my hurt, and that she 
Pondered how I could think of any such thing, after such a 
fcourse as I had had with my father, and such kind and tender 
expressions as she knew my father had used to me ; and that, in 
short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I

might depend I should never have their consent to it. That, for 
her part, she would not have so much hand in my destruction; 
and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing 
when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as I 
have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, and 
that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her 
with a sigh, — "That boy might be happy if he would stay at 
home; but if he goes abroad he will be the most miserable wretch 
that was ever born. I can give no consent to it." 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all pro- 
posals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating with 
my father and mother about their being so positively determined 
against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But 
being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any 
purpose of making an elopement that time; but, I say, being 
there, and one of my companions being going by sea to London 
in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the 
common allurement of seafaring men — namely, that it should cost 
me nothing for my passage — I consulted neither father nor mother 
any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them 
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's blessing, or my 
father's; without any consideration of circumstances or conse- 
quences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September, 
1651, 1 went on board a ship bound for London. Never any young 
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued 
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the 
Humber but the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a 
most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I 
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in my mind. I 
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how 
justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked 
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty; all the good 
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's entrea- 
ties, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which 
was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has been

WISE AND SOBER THOUGHTS. 7 

since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach 
of my duty to God and my father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had 
never been upon before, went very high, though nothing Hke what 
I have seen many times since; no, nor like what I saw a few 
days after. But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a 
young sailor and had never known anything of the matter. I 
expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every 
time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of 
the sea, we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind I 
made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please God here 
to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon 
dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never 
set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, 
and never run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now 
I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle 
station of life; how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his 
days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles 
onshore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting pro- 
digal, go home to my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the 
stonn continued, and indeed some time after; but the next day 
the wind was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little 
inured to it. However, I was very grave for all that day, being 
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared 
up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; 
the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; 
and having httle or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining 
Hpon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever 
I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick 
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so 
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so 
pleasant in so little time after. And now, lest my good resolutions 
should continue, my companion, who had indeed enticed me away, 
comes to me, — "Well, Bob," says he, clapping me on the shoulder, 
"how do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wa'n't

To make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way of 
all sailors. The punch was made, and I was made drunk with it. 
And in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, 
all my reflections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions 
for my future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smooth-

IN YARMOUTH ROADS. 9 

stonn, 80— the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and 
apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, 
and the current of my former desires returned — I entirely forgot 
the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I found, 
indeed, some intervals of reflection, and the serious thoughts did, 
as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook 
them off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, 
and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the 
return of those fits — for so I called them — and I had in five or six 
days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow, 
that resolved not to be troubled with it, could desire. But I was 
to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases 
generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excusa 
For if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be 
such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us 
would confess both the danger and the mercy. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; 
the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made 
but httle way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to 
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary — namely, 
at south-west — for seven or eight days, during which time a great 
°^Dy ships from Newcastle came into the same roads, as the com- 
Kion harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river. 

^e had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have 
tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and after 
we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads 
being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our 
gwund-tackle^ very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in 
"le least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and 
^h, after the manner of the sea;^ but the eighth day, in the 
horning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to 
strike our top-masts, and make everything snug and close, that 
the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went 
^ery high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle^ in, shipped several

seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home, 
upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor; so that we 
rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the 
better^ end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and now I began 
to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen 
themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business of pre- 
serving the ship, yet, as he went in and out of his cabin by me, 
I could hear him softly to himself say several times, "Lord, be 
merciful to us; we shall be all lost, we shall be all undone," and 
the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my 
cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper. 
I could ill reassume the first penitence, which I had so apparently 
trampled upon and hardened myself against. I thought the 
bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be nothing, 
too, like the first. But when the master himself came by me, as 
I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully 
frighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a 
dismal sight I never saw. The sea went mountains high, and 
broke upon us every three or four minutes. When I could look 
about, I could see nothing but distress round ua Two ships that 
rid near us we found had cut their masts by the board, being 
deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship which rid about a 
mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships being driven 
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea at all adven- 
tures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships fared 
the best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or three of 
them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their 
sprit-sail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of 
our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he was very 
unwilling to; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did 
not the ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut 
away the foremast, the main-mast stood so loose and shook the 
ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away also, and make a 
clear deck.

SPRUNG A leak! 11 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, 
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright 
before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance the 
thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more 
horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the 
having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken 
at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the terror 
of the storm, put me into such a condition that I can by no words 
describe it But the worst was not come yet. The storm con- 
tinued with such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged 
they had never known a worse. We had a good ship; but she 
was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every 
now and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage 
in one respect that I did not know what they meant by founder 
tiH I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that I saw 
what is not often seen — the master, the boatswain, and some 
others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting 
every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the 
middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one 
of the men that had been down on purpose to see, cried out we 
W sprang a leak; another said there was four foot water in the 
hold. 

Then all hands were called to the pump. At that very word 
my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon 
the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men 
roused me, and told me that I that was able to do nothing before 
^as as well able to pump as another, at which I stirred up and 
^ent to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was 
wg, the master, seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride 
o^t the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would 
come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who 
'mew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought 
fte ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had happened. In a 
^ord, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this 
^8s a time when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody 
^ded me, or what was become of me ; but another man stepped

12 HELP AT HAND. 

thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came 
to myself. 

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was 
apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm 
began to abate a little, yet, as it was not possible she could swim 
till we might run into a port, so the master continued firing guns 
for help, and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, 
ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard 
the boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get on 
board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at last, the men 
rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our 
men cast them a rope over the stem with a buoy to it, and then 
veered it out a great length, which they, after great labour and 
hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stem, 
and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us 
after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship, 
so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore 
as much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the 
boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their 
master ; so, partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away 
to the norward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as 
Winterton Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our 
ship when we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time 
what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknow- 
ledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she 
was sinking; for from that moment they rather put me into the 
boat than that I might be said to go in. My heart was, as it 
were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of 
mind and the thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the 
oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see, when our boat, 
mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore, a great many 
people running along the shore to assist us when we should come 
near; but we made but slow way towards the shore, nor were we 
able to reach the shore, till, being past the lighthouse at Winter- 
ton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the

SAFE ON SHORE. 13 

land broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, 
and though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and 
walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate 
men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates 
of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular 
merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient 
to carry us either to London or back'to Hull, as we thought fit 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have 
gone honae, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our 
blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; 
for, hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth 
Road, it was a great while before he had any assurance that I was 
not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that 
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls 
from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, 
yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor 
will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on 
^ be the mstruments of our own destruction, even though it be 
^fore us, and that we push upon it with our eyes open. Certainly 
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and 
wUch it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me 
forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most 
retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I 
liad met with in my first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who 
was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first 
*|nie he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not 
tul two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several 
^^arters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was 
^^red, and looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, asked 
^e how I did, and telling his father who I was, and how I had 
^ome this voyage only for a trial, in order to go further abroad. 
^ father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone, 
'Young man," says he, " you ought never to go to sea any more;

uot to be a seafaring man." — " Why, sir," said I ; " will you go to

sea no more]" — "That is another case," said he. "It is my call- 
ing, and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a- 
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are 
to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your 
account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," continues he, 
"what are you? and on what account did you go to sea?" Upon 
that I told him some of my story, at the end of which he burst 
out with a strange kind of passion, "What had I done," says he, 
"that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship? I 
would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a 
thousand pounds." This, indeed, was, as I said, an excursion of 
his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and 
was further than he could have authority to go. However, he 
afterwards talked very gravely to me; exhorted me to go back to 
my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; told me I might 
see a visible hand of Heaven against me; "And, young man," 
said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go 
you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till 
your father's words are fulfilled upon you." 

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I saw 
him no more. Which way he went I know not. As for me, 
having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land; 
and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with myself 
— what course of life I should take, and whether I should go 
home or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered 
to my thoughts : and it immediately occurred to me how I should 
be laughed at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to 
see, not my father and mother only, but even everybody else, from 
whence I have since often observed how incongruous and irrational 
the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that 
reason which ought to guide them in such cases — namely, that they 
are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not 
ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed 
fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make them 
be esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain

what measures to take and what course of life to lead. An irre- 
sistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed a 
while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off; 
and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to a 
return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts 
of it, and looked out for a voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away from my father's 
house, that hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of 
raising my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly 
upon me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the 
entreaties and even command of my father — I say, the same in- 
fluence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of all 
enterprises to my view, and I went on board a vessel bound to 
the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to 
Guinea.^ 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did 
not ship myself as a sailor, whereby, though I might indeed have 
worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time 1 had 
learned the duty and office of a foremast man, and in time might 
have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. 
But as it was always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did 
here; for, having money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my 
back, I would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman, 
-^d so I neither had any business in the ship, or learned to do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in 
London, which does not always happen to such loose and unguided 
young fellows as I then was, the devil generally not omitting to 
^ay some snare for them very early. But it was not so with me.

^y I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the

16 A SUCCESSFUL TRIP. 

I should have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit, 
and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement. 

I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict friendship with 
this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man, I went the 
voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with me, which, 
by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased 
very considerably; for I carried about £40 in such toys and trifles 
as the captain directed me to buy. This £40 I had mustered 
together by the assistance of some of my relations whom I corre- 
sponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or at least my 
mother, to contribute so much as that to my first adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all 
my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of 
my friend the captain, under whom also I got a competent 
knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned 
how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an observation, 
and, in short, to understand some things that were needful to be 
imderstood by a sailor. For, as he took delight to introduce me, 
I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both 
a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine 
ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded me in London 
at my return almost £300, and this filled me with those aspiring 
thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too, particularly 
that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture 
by the excessive heat of the climate, our principal trading being 
upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north even to 
the line itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my 
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the 
same voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one 
who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the 
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever 
man made; for though I did not carry quite £100 of my new 
gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, and which I lodged with 
my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into ter- 
rible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first was this — namely,

our ship makiiig her course towards the Canary Islands, or rather 
between those islands and the African shore, was surprised in the

18 ROBINSON A PRISONER. 

US again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on board the 
next time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our 
decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and 
rigging. We plied them with small-shot, half -pikes, powder-chests, 
and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to 
cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, 
and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged 
to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belong- 
ing to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I appre- 
hended, nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, 
as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain of the 
rover as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and 
nimble and fit for his business. At this surprising change of my 
circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly 
overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's prophetic 
discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and have none to 
' relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to 
pass, that it could not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven 
had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption. But, 
alas ! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as 
will appear in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron or master had taken me home to his house, 
so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went 
to sea again, believing that it would some time or other be his 
fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war; and that 
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon 
taken away; for when he went to sea he left me on shore to look 
after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves 
about his house; and when he came home again from his cruise, 
he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I 
might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least pro- 
bability in it. Nothing presented to make the supposition of it 
rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to that would 
embark with me, no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or 
Scotsman there but myself; so that for two years, though I often

myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least 
encouraging prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years an odd circumstance presented itself, 
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty 
agam in my head. My patron lying at home longer than usual 
without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of 
money, he used constantly, once or twice a-week, sometimes 
oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and go 
out into the road a-fishing; and as he always took me and a young 
Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and 
I proved very dexterous in catching fish, insomuch that some- 
times he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the 
youth— the Maresco, as they called him — to catch a dish of fish 
for him. 

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a stark^ calm 
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a 
league from the shore we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew 
not whither or which way, we laboured all day and all the next 
night, and when the morning came we found we had pulled off 
to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were at 
feast two leagues from the shore. However, we got well in 
*gain, though with a great deal of labour and some danger; for 
the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning : but particu- 
Wy we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more 
ewe of himself for the future; and having lying by him the long- 
boat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he would not 
goa^fishing any more without a compass and some provision. So 
^e ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English 
^^ave, to build a little state-room or cabin in the middle of the 
fengboat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to 
^r and hale home the main-sheet; and room before for a hand 
Of two to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what we call 
*8houlder-of -mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of the 
^bin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him

out, and everytliing to accommodate his guests. When by-and-by 
my patron came on board alone, and told me his guests had put 
off going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered me with 
the man and boy as usual to go out with the boat and catch them 
some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house; and com- 
manded that as soon as I had got some fish, I should bring it 
home to his house; all which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my 
thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my 
command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish 
myself, not for a fishing business, but for a voyage; though I 
knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I should 
steer; for anywhere to get out of that place was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this 
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told 
Wm we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread. He said 
that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of 
their kind, and three jars with fresh water into the boat I knew 
where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was evident by 
the make were taken out of some English prize, and I conveyed 
them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had 
l^u there before for our master. I conveyed also a great lump 
of bees'-wax into the boat, which weighed above half a hundred- 
with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a 
ner, all which were of great use to us afterwards, especially 
the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which 
ke innocently came into also. His name was Ismael, who they 
^ Muly or Moely; so I called to him — " Moely," said I, " our 
patron's guns are on board the boat; can you not get a little 
powder and shot] It may be we may kill some alcamies (a fowl 
Mke our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner's 
stores in the ship." " Yes," says he, " I'll bring some." And 
^cordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held about 
* pound and a half of powder, or rather more, and another with 
shot, that had five or six pound, with some bullets, and put all 
^to the boat. At the same time, I had found some powder 
of my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the

22 A STROKE FOR LIBERTY. 

large bottles in the case, wliich was almost empty, pouring what 
was in it into another; and thus furnished with everything 
needful, we sailed out of the port to fisL The castle, which is at 
the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice 
of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we 
hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind blew 
from the north-north-east, which was contrary to my desire; for 
had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the 
coast of Spain, and at least reached to the Bay of Cadiz; but 
my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be 
gone from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to 
fate. 

After we had fished some time and catched nothing — for when 
I had fish on my hook, I would not pull them up, that he might 
not see them — I said to the Moor, "This will not do; our master 
will not be thus served; we must stand farther oflF." He, thinking 
no harm, agreed; and being in the head of the boat, set the sails: 
and as I had the helm, I run the boat out near a league farther, 
and then brought her to, as if I would fish; when, giving the 
boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and 
making as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by 
surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him clear over- 
board into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, 
and called to me, begged to be taken in; told me he would go all 
over the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat that 
he would have reached me very quickly, there being but little 
wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of 
the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had done 
him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none. "But," 
said I, " you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the sea 
is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you no 
harm, but if you come near the boat I'll shoot you through the 
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty." So he turned him- 
self about and swam for the shore; and I make no doubt but he 
reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me 
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust

him. When he was gone I turned to the boy, who they called 
Xury, and said to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll 
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke your face to be 
true to me — that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's beard — I 
must throw you into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and 
spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him; and swore to 
be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me. 
While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood

oevoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human 
land. 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I changed my 
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my course

24 AFRAID TO LAND. 

a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the shore; and 
having a fair fresh gale of wind and a smooth, quiet sea, I made 
such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the 
afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less than 150 
miles south of Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's 
dominions, or, indeed, of any other king thereabouts, for we saw 
no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the 
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I 
would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor, the vrind 
continuing fair, till I had sailed in that manner five days ; and 
then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that if 
any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would now give 
over. So I ventured to make to the coast, and came to an anchor 
in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, or where; neither 
what latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I neither 
saw, nor desired to see, any people; the principal thing I wanted 
was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening, re- 
solving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the 
country; but as soon as it was quite dark we heard such dreadful 
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of 
we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die 
with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. " Well, 
Xury," said I, " then I won't; but it may be we may see men by 
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions." " Then we give 
them the shoot gun,* says Xury, laughing; "make them run 
way." Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. 
However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a 
dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up. After 
all, Xur/s advice was good, and I took it. We dropped our 
little anchor, and lay still all night — I say still, for we slept none — 
for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew 
not what to call them) of many sorts come down to the sea-shore, 
and run into the water, wallowing and washing theinselves for the 
pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made such hideous 
bowlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too. But

SEARCH FOR WATER. 25 

we were both more frightened when we heard one of these mighty 
creatures come swimming towards om* boat. We could not see 
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous, 
huge, and furious beast Xury said it was a lion, and it might 
be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the 
anchor, and row away. "No," says I; "Xury, we can slip our 
cable with the buoy to it, and go off to sea. They cannot follow 
us far." I had no sooner said so but I perceived the creature 
(whatever it was) within two oars' length, which something sur- 
prised me. However, I immediately stepped to the cabin-door, 
and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon which he immediately 
turned about, and swam towards the shore agaia. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous 
cries and howlings, that were raised as well upon the edge of the 
shore as higher within the country, upon the noise or report of 
the gun— a thing I have some reason to beheve those creatures 
had never heard before. This convinced me that there was no 
going on shore for us in the night upon that coast; and how to 
venture on shore in the day was another question too, for to have 
fallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to 
have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers; at least we were 
equally apprehensive of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere 

or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat. When 

or where to get to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him 

go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any 

^ater, and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go — 

^by I should not go and he stay in the boat] The boy answered 

^th so much affection that made me love him ever after. Says 

H "If wild mans come, they eat me; you go way." "Well, 

^iiry," said I, " we will both go; and if tie wild mans come, we 

^ kill them. They shall eat neither of us." So I gave Xury 

* piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case 

0^ bottles which I mentioned before ; and we haled the boat in 

*8 near the shore as we thought was proper, and waded on shore, 

^^arrying nothing but our arms and two jars for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming

26 CRUSOE'S CALCULATIONa 

of caDoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low 
place about a mile up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I 
saw him come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by 
some savage, or frightened with some wild beast, and I ran forward 
towards him to help him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw 
something hanging over his shoulders — which was a creature that 
he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour and longer legs. 
However, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat; but 
the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had 
found good water and seen no wild mans. 

But we found aftei-wards that we need not take such pains for 
water, for a little higher up the creek where we were, we found the 
water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way 
up. So we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, 
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any 
human creature in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well 
that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd Islands also, 
lay not far off from the coast But as I had no instruments to 
take an observation to know what latitude we were in, and did 
not exactly know, or at least to remember, what latitude they 
were in, I knew not where to look for them, or when to stand off 
to sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily have found 
some of these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along 
this coast till I came to that part where the English traded, I 
should find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade, 
that would relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was, must 
be that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's 
dominions and the negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by 
wild beasts — the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther 
south, for fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth 
inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness. And, indeed, both forsak- 
ing it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers, Hons, leopards, 
and other furious creatures which harbour there; so that the 
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, 
two or three thousand men at a time. And, indeed, for near a

A DREADFUL MONSTER. 27 

hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a 
waste uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but bowlings 
and roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the daytime, I thought I saw the Pico^ of 
Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain Teneriffe in the 
Canaries; and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reach- 
ing thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again by con- 
trary winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel, so I 
resolved to pursue my first design and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we had 
left this place; and once in particular, being early in the morning, 
we came to an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty 
high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 
Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, 
calls softly to me and tells me that we had best go farther off the 
shore:— "For," says he, "look, yonder hes a dreadful monster on the 
side of that hillock fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, and 
saw a dreadful monster indeed; for it was a terrible great lion that 
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the 
hill, that hung as it were a little over him. ** Xury," says I, " you 
shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frightened, and said, 
"Me kill! he eat me at one mouth" — one mouthful, he meant. 
However, I said no more to the boy, but bad him lie still; and I 
took our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded 
It with a good charge of powder and with two slugs, and laid it 
^0^; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third 
"-for we had three pieces — I loaded with five smaller bullets. I 
took the best aim I could with the first piece to have shot him 
^to the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his 
^086, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. 
He started up, growling at first; but finding his leg broke, fell 
^own again; and then got up upon three legs, and gave the most 
Wdeous roar that ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I had 
Jiot hit him on the head. However, I took up the second piece 
immediately; and though he began to move off, fired again, and 
shot him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop, and

make but little noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury took 
heart, and would have me let him go on shore. " Well, go," said 
I. So the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in 
one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to 
the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him 
into the head again, which despatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was 
very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature 
that was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would 
have some of him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give 
him the hatchet. "For what, Xuryl" said I. "Me cut off his 
head," said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head; but 
he cut off a foot and brought it with him — and it was a monstrous 
great one. 

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him might 
one way or other be of some value to us; and I resolved to take 
off his skin if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him; 
but Xury was much the better workman at it — for I knew very ill 
how to do it. Indeed, it took us up both the whole day; but at 
last we got off the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our 
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it after- 
wards served me to lie upon. 

After this stop we made on to the southward continually for ten 
or twelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which began 
to abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore than we 
were obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make 
the river Gambia or Senegal — that is to say, anywhere about the 
Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European 
ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but 
to seek for the islands or perish there among the negroes. I knew 
that all the ships from Europe — which sailed either to the coast 
of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East Indies — made this cape or 
those islands; and in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon 
this single point, either that I must meet with some ship or must 
perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I 
have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two

or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the 
shore to look at us. We could also perceive they were quite black 
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore to 
them. But Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, " No 
go, no go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might 
talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good 
way. I observed they had no weapons in their hands — except 
one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, 
and that they would throw them a great way with good aim. So 
I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I 
could; and particularly made signs for something to eat They 
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some 
meat Upon this I lowered the top of my sail and lay by; and 
two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an 
hour came back and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh 
and some com, such as is the produce of their country — but we 
neither knew what the one or the other was. However, we were 
^Ag to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute; 
fcr I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as 
much afraid of us. But they took a safe way for us all — for they 
brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a 
great way off" till we fetched it on board, and then came close to 
usagam. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make 
them amends. But an opportunity offered that very instant to 
oblige them wonderfully — ^for while we were lying by the shore, 
came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) 
^th great fury, from the mountains towards the sea. Whether it 
^as the male pursuing the female, or whether they were in sport 
or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell whether 
It was usual or strange; but I believe it was the latter — ^because, 
in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in 
the night; and, in the second place, we. found the people terribly

the sea, and swam about as if they had come for their diversion. 
At last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I 
expected, but I lay ready for him; for I had loaded my gun with 
all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the other. As 
soon as he came fairly within my reach I fired, and shot him 
directly into the head. Immediately he sank down into the water, 
but rose instantly and plunged up and down as if he was struggling 
for life. And so indeed he was. He immediately made to the 
shore; but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and 
the strangling of the water, he died just before he reached the 
shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor 
creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun; some of thfem were 
even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the very 
terror. But when they saw the creature dead and sunk in the 
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore, they 
took heart and came to the shore, and began to search for the 
creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; and by 
the help of a rope which I slung round him, and gave the negroes 
to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most 
curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable degree; and the 
negroes held up their hands with admiration to think what it was 
I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and the 
noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the moun- 
tains from whence they came, nor could I at that distance know 
what it was. I found quickly the negroes were for eating the 
flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as a 
favour from me; which, when I made signs to them that they 
might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they 
fell to work with him; and though they had no knife, yet with a 
sharpened piece of wood they took off" his skin as readily — and 
much more readily than we could have done with a knife. They 
offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I 
would give it them; but made signs for the skin, which they gave 
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their pro- 
vision, which, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then

THE VOYAGE RESUMED. 31 

I made signs to them for some water, and held out one of my jars 
to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, 
and that I wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to 
some of their friends; and there came two women, and brought a 
great vessel made of earth, and burned as I suppose in the sun. 
This they set down for me as before; and I sent Xury on shore 
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were as 
stark naked as the mea 

I was now furnished with roots and corn — such as it was — and 
water; and leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about 
eleven days more without offering to go near the shore, till I saw 
the land run out a great length into the sea, at about the distance 
of four or five leagues before me, and the sea being very calm, I 
kept a large offing to make this point. At length, doubling the 
point at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on 
the other side to seaward. Then I concluded, as it was most 
certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd Islands. However, 
they were at a great distance; and I could not well tell what I had 
best to do, for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might 
neither reach one nor the other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin 
and sat me down, Xury having the helm, when on a sudden the 
boy cried out, " Master, master, a ship vnth. a sail!" and the fooHsh 
boy was frightened out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some 
of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were 
gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, 
and immediately saw not only the ship, but what she was — namely, 
that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the 
coast of Guinea for negroes. But when I observed the course she 
steered I was soon convinced they were bound some other way, 
and did not design to come any nearer to the shore. Upon which 
I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with 
tbem if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to 
^onie m their way, but that they would be gone by before I could 
^e any signal to them. But after I had crowded to the utmost 
^d began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their

them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese and in Spanish a 
in French, but I understood none of them; but at last a Scot 
sailor who was on board called to me; and I answered him, a 
told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out 
slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade me come 
board, and very kindly took me in and all my goods.

ON BOARD SHIP. 33 

It was an inexpressible joy to me — that any one will believe — that 
I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and 
almost hopeless condition as I was in, and I immediately offered 
aU I liad to the captain of the ship as a return for my deliverance- 
but he generously told me he would take nothing from me, but 
that all I had should be delivered safe to me when I came to the 
Brazils. "For," says he, "I have saved your life on no other 
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself, and it may one 
time or other be my lot to be taken up in the same condition; 
besides," said he, " when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a 
way from your own country, if I should take from you what you 
bave, you will be starved there, and then I only take away that 
life I have given. No, no, Seignor Inglese," says he, " Mr. English- 
nian, I will carry you thither in charity, and those things will help 
you to buy your subsistence there and your passage home again." 
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the 
performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none 
should offer to touch anything I had. Then he took everything 
into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of 
them, that I might have them, even so much as my three earthen 
jars. 

As to my boat it was a very good one, and that he saw, and 
told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked me 
^hat I would have for it? I told him he had been so generous to 
Die in everything, that I could not offer to make any price of the 
w, but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he would 
give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it 
at Brazil, and when it came there, if any one offered to give more 
he would make it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight 
^ore for my boy Xury ; which I was loath to take : not that I was 
Dot willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to 
^^U the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in 
Procuring my own. However, when I let him know my reason, 
De owned it to be just, and offered me this medium — that he 
^ould give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if 
De turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing 
^go to him, I let the captain have him.

34 THE GENEROUS CAPTAIN. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the 
Bay de Todos los Santos, or All-Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two 
days after. And now I was once more delivered from the most 
miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next with 

myself I was now to 
consider. 

The generous treat- 
ment the captain gave 
me I can never enougL

and what I was will-

I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all mjr 
cargo; and with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here, but being recommended to the house 
of a good honest man like himself, who had an " ingeino," as they 
call it — that is, a plantation and a sugar-house — I lived with him 
some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the manner 
of their planting and making of sugar. And seeing how well the 
planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, if I 
could get license to settle there, I would turn planter among them;

CRUSOE TURNS PLANTER. 35 

resolving in the meantime to find out some way to get my money 
which I had left in London remitted to me. To this purpose, 
getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I purchased as much 
land that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a 
plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a one as might be 
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from 
England. 

I had a neighbour — a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bom of English 
parents— whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances 
as I was. I call him my neighbour, because his plantation lay 
next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock 
was but low as well as his; and we rather planted for food than 
anything else for about two years. However, we began to increase, 
and our land began to come into order; so that the third year we 
planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground 
ready for planting canes in the year to come. But we both wanted 
lielp; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in 
parting with my boy Xury. 

But alas 1 for me to do wrong that never did right was no great 

vender. I had no remedy but to go on. I was gotten into an 

employment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to 

the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's house, 

and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into 

the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which my 

lather advised me to before, and which, if I resolved to go on with, 

^niight as well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued 

Myself in the world as I had done. And I used often to say to 

Myself, I could have done this as well in England among my 

Wends as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among 

strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at such a distance as 

Jiever to hear from any part of the world that had the least know- 

'edge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the 

Qtmost regret. I had nobody to converse with but now and then 

this neighbour — no work to be done but by the labour of my 

hands; and I used to say I lived just like a man cast away upon 

some desolate island that had nobody there but himself. But how

36 THE captain's advice. 

just has it been, and how should all men reflect, that when they 
compare their present conditions with others that are worse, 
Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced 
of their former felicity by their experience, — I say how just has it 
been that the truly solitary life J reflected on, in an island of mere 
desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared 
it with the life which I then led; in which, had I continued, I 
had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich I 

I was in some degree settled in my measures for caiTying on 
the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that 
took me up at sea, went back — for the ship remained there in 
providing his loading and preparing for his voyage near three 
months — when, telling him what Uttle stock I had left behind 
me in London, he gave me this friendy and sincere advice. 
" Seignor Inglese," says he, — for so he always called me, — " if you 
will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me, with 
orders to the person who has your money in London, to send your 
effects to Lisbon to such persons as I shall direct, and in such 
goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce 
of them, God willing, at my return. But since human affairs are 
all subject to changes and to disasters, I would have you give 
orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which you say is half 
your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so that if it 
come safe you may order the rest the same way, and if it mis- 
carry you may have the other half to have recourse to for your 
supply." 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I 
could not but be convinced it was the best course I could take; so 
I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I 
had left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, 
as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my 
adventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the 
Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and in 
what condition I was now in, with all other necessary directions 
for my supply. And when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he 
found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send

INCREASING PROSPERITY. 37 

over, not the order only, but a full account of my story, to a mer- 
chant at London, who represented it eflfectually to her; whereupon 
she not only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket sent 
the Portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity 
and charity to me. 

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in 
English goods such as the captain had writ for, sent them directly 
to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the 
Brazils; among which, without my direction — ^for I was too young 
in my business to think of them — he had taken care to have all 
sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my plantation, 
and which were of great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was 
surprised with joy of it; and my good steward the captain had 
Wd out the five pounds, which my friend had sent him for a 
present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant under 
^nd for six years' service, and would not accept of any considera- 
tion except a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, beiug 
^^ my own produce. 

Neither was this all. But my goods being all English manu- 
factures, such as cloth, stuffs, bays,^ and things particularly valuable 
and desirable in the country, I found means to sell them to a very 
^at advantage; so that I may say I had more than four times 
^he value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my 
poor neighbour — I mean in the advancement of my plantation ; 
^orthe first thing I did I bought me a negro slave, and an European 
^rvant also — I mean another besides that which the captain 
Drought me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of 

^Qf greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next 

year with great success in my plantation. I raised fifty great rolls 

of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for 

Necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls being each 

of above a hundredweight, were well cured and laid by against 

^ie return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now, increasing in 

business and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and

38 NEW PROJECXa 

undertakings beyond my reach — such as are indeed often the ruin 
of the. best heads in business. 

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all 
the happy things to have yet befallen me for which my father so 
earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and of which he had 
so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of. Bufc 
other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of 
all my own miseries, and particularly to increase my fault and 
double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I 
should have leisure to make. All these miscarriages were pro- 
cured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination, 
of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination in contradiction, 
to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pur- 
suit of those prospects and those measures of life which Nature 
and Providence concurred to present me with and to make my 
duty. 

As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, 
so I could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy 
view I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, 
only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than 
the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down 
again into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell 
into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health 
in the world. 

To come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this 
part of my story. You may suppose that having now lived almost 
four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very 
well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language, but 
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow- 
planters, as well as among the merchants at St Salvadore, which 
was our port; and that, in my discourses among them, I had 
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast 
of Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes there, and how 
easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles — such as beads, 
toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — not only 
gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but negroes for 
the service of the Brazils in great numbers.

A FAIR PR01>0SAL. 39 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these 
heads, but especially to that part which related to the buying 
negroes; which was a trade at that time not only not far entered 
into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by the assientOy or 
permission of the Kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in 
the public;^ so that few negroes were brought, and those exces- 
sively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants and 
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very 
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and told 
me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed 
with them of the last night, and they came to make a secret 
proposal to me. And after enjoining me secrecy, they told me 
that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they 
had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so 
much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried 
on, because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they 
came home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the 
negroes on shore privately, and divide them among their own 
plantations; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would 
go their supercargo in the ship to manage the trading part upon 
<ie coast of Guinea And they offered me that I should have 
^J equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of the 
stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made 

^ any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of his 

0^ to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very 

considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me that was 

^ius entered and established, and had nothing to do but go on as 

^ had begun for three or four years more, and to have sent for the 

other hundred pound from England, and who in that time, and 

^'th that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth 

three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too, — 

for me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing 

that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of.

CRUSOE SAILS FOR AFRICA. 41 

never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking— leaving all 
the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone upon a 
voy^^e to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say 
nothmg of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to 
myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my 
fancy rather than my reason. And accordingly, the ship heing 
fitted out and the cargo furnished, and all things done as by 
agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an 
evil hour — ^being the same day eight year^ that I went from my 
father and mother at Hull in order to act the rebel to their 
authority and the fool to my own interest. 

Our ship was about 120 ton burthen; carried six guns and 
fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had 
ou board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit 
for our trade with the negroes — such as beads, bits of glass, shells 
^nd odd trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, 
hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to 
the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over 
for the African coast when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of 
[lorthem latitude; which, it seems, was the manner of their course 
^^ those days. We had very good weather, only excessively hot, 
^ the way upon our own coast, till we came the height of Cape 
^ Augustino; from whence, keeping farther off at sea; we lost 
^ht of land, and steered as if we were bound for the Isle Fernand 
^^ Noronha, holding our course north-east by north, and leaving 
those isles on the east In this course we passed the line in about 
twelve days' time; and were by our last observation in 7 degrees 
22 minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado or hurricane 
took UB quite out of our knowledge. It began from the south- 
fiast^ came about to the north-west, and then settled into the 
fiorth-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner that 
for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and scud- 
ding away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury 
of the winds directed. And during these twelve days I need not

42 CAUGHT IN A STORM. 

say that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, 
did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of 
our men died of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed 
overboard About the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, 
the master made an observation as well as he could, and found 
that he was in about 11 degrees north latitude, but that he 
was 22 degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St- 
Augustino; so that he found he was gotten upon the coast a: 
Guiana,^ or the north part of Brazil, beyond the Kiver AmazoneB 
toward that of the Kiver Oronoque,^ commonly called the Grea- 
Eiver, and began to consult with me what course he should take 
for the ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he was goinj 
directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts op 
the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was n^ 
inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came withi* 
the circle of the Carribbe Islands, and therefore resolved to stanc 
away for Barbadoes; which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid th« 
indraught of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform 
as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail; whereas we could not 
possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some 
assistance both to our ship and to ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and steered awajr 
north-west by west, in order to reach some of our English islands^ 
where I hoped for relief. But our voyage was otherwise deter- 
mined; for, being in the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes, eu 
second storm came upon us, which carried us away with the sam» 
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all 
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved as to the sea, 
we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever 
returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our 
men early in the morning cried out "Land!" and we had no 
sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hopes of seeing where- 
abouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand,

and expecting death every moment, and every man acting accor- 
dingly as preparing for another world, for there was little or 
nothing more for us to do in this. That which was our present 
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our 
expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master said 
the wind began to abate. 

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet 
the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast 
for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition 
indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives afi 
well as we could. We had a boat at our stern just before th< 
storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's ruddex 
and in the next place she broke away, and either sunk or w£i 
driven off to sea; so there was no hope from her. We had anothe 
boat on board; but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtf't 
thing. However, there was no room to debate, for we fancied tk» 
ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us she w^ 
actually broken already. 

In this distress the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat, qjl^ 
with the help of the rest of the men, they got her slung over th- 
ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and committed ou^

wild zee," as the Dutch call the sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all sa\i? 
plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and 
that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had 
none; nor, if we had, could we have done anything with it: so we 
worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, 
like men going to execution; for we all knew that when the boat 
came nearer the shore she would be dashed in a thousand pieces 
by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to 
God in the most earnest manner, and the wind driving us towards 
the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, 
pulling as well as we could towards land.

CRUSOE S NARROW ESCAPE. 45 

shoal— we knew not; the only hope that could rationally give us 
the least shadow of expectation, was if we might happen into some 
bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we 
might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and 
perhaps made smooth water. But there was nothing of this 
appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land 
looked more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a half, 
as ve reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling 
astern of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup-de-ffrace. In a 
word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once, 
and separating us as well from the boat as from one another, gave 
Qs not time hardly to say, God ! for we were ail swallowed up 
in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when 
I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could 
not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that 
* wave, having driven me or rather carried me a vast way on 
towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me 
Qpon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. 
I had so much presence of mind as well as breath left that, seeing 
myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet, 
and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could 
before another wave should return and take me up again. But I 
soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come 
^r me as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy which 
^ had no means or strength to contend with. My business was to 
nold my breath and rise myself upon the water if I could, and 
^ by swimming to preserve my breathing and pilot myself towards 
^he shore if possible; my greatest concern now being that the 
86a, as it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it 
^e on, might not carry me back again with it when it gave back 
towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty 

or thirty feet deep in its own body; and I could feel myself carried 

^th a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great 

.^ay; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still

forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with holding 
my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so to my immediate 
relief I found my head and hands shoot out above the surface oi 
the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I coixV^ 
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath aJ3-^ 
new courage. I was covered again with water a good while, b'*^^ 
not so long but I held it out; and finding the water had sp^^^^ 
itself and began to return, I struck forward against the return -^ 
the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still * 
few moments to recover breath, and till the water went from n^^ — ®> 
and then took to my heels and ran with what strength 1 h^^^ 
farther towards the shore. But neither would this deliver 0::=:^^® 
from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me agaic^^^' 
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forwarc:;^^^^^ 
as before, the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me; i(^^^^ 
the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rathe^^^'^ 
dashed me against a piece of a rock, and that with such force, : 
it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance 
for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were 
quite out of my body, and had it returned again immediately, 
must have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little 
before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be covered^^ 
again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the 
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went 
back. Now as the waves were not so high as at first, being near 
land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another 
run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, 
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry 
me away; and the next run I took I got to the mainland, where, 
to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat 
me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite out of the 
reach of the water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and 
thank God that my life was saved in a case wherein there was some 
minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impos- 
sible to express to the life what the ecstasies and transports of

"A DREADFUL DELIVERANCE." 47 

the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very 
grave; and I do not wonder now at that custom, namely, that 
when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up, 
and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him 
— I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let 
him blood^ that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise 
may not drive the animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm 
him: 

" For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.'* 

I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my 
whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the contemplation of 
my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and motions which 
I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that were 
drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved but myself; 
for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of 
them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were 
not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and 
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far 
off, and considered, "Lord, how was it possible I could get on 
shore 1" 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my 
condition, I began to look round me to see what kind of place 
I was in, and what was next to be done, and I soon found my 
comforts abate, and that in a word I had a dreadful deliverance; 
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to 
eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I see any prospect before 
me but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by 
wild beasts. And that which was particularly afflicting to me 
was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature 
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature 
that might desire to kill me for theirs ; — in a word, I had noth- 
ing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in 
a box. This was all my provision, and this threw me into 
terrible agonies of mind, and for a while I ran about like a

)r, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured 
to place myself so as that if I should sleep I might not fall; and 
having cut me a short stick like a truncheon for my defence, 
I took up my lodging, and having been excessively fatigued, 
I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could 
have done in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed 
with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the 
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; 
but that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted 
off in the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of 
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I 
first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing me 
agaimt it; this being within about a mile from the shore where 
I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished 
myself on board, that at least I might have some necessary things 
for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked 
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which 
W as the wind and the sea had tossed her up upon the land, 
about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I could 
upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of 
water between me and the boat which was about half a mile 
broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon 
gettmg at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my 
present subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm and the tide 
ebbed 80 far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of 
*he ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for 
^ saw evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all safe 
■^that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been 
^ Biiserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and

50 CRUSOE PALLS TO WORK. 

as she lay aground and high out of the water, there was nothing 
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and 
the second time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered 
I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low as that 
with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope 
got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship 
was bulged,^ and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that 
she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, 
and her stem lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low 
almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was free, 
and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my 
first work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what was 
tree. And first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry 
and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed to eat, 
I went to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and 
eat it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose. 
I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large 
dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me for 
what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to 
furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very 
necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, 
and this extremity roused my application. We had several spare 
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast 
or two in the ship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and 
flung as many of them overboard as I could manage of their 
weight, tying every one with a rope that they might not drive 
away. When this was done, I went down the ship's side, and 
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both 
ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or 
three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could 
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any 
great weight, the pieces being too light. So I went to work, and 
with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, 
and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains; 
but hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to

what I should have been able to have done upon 

another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight 
My next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve 
what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea. But I was not long 
considering this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that 
I could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I 
first got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open 
and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft The first 
of these I filled with provisions — namely, bread, rice, three Dutch 
cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much 
upon, and a Kttle remainder of European com which had been 
laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us; but the 
fowls were killed. There had been some barley and wheat to- 
gether, but to my great disappointment I found afterwards that 
the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I f oirnd several 
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some 
cordial waters, and in all about five or six gallons of rack.i These 
I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the 
chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this I found the 
tide began to flow, though very calm, and I had the mortification 
to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore 
upon the sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which were only 
linen and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings. 
However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which 
I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, 
for I had other things which my eye was more upon — as, first, 
tools to work with on shore, and it was after long searching that 
I fomid out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful 
prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship loading of gold 
would have been at that time. I got it down to my raft even 
]^hole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew 
^ general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There 
^6re two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two 
pistols; these I secured first, with some powder-horns, and a 

^Arrack, a spirit distilled from rice or other grain, resembling gin or whisky.

THE RAFT AGkOUKD. 63 

I my ftdt Went very wi^U, only that I found it drive a little 
ftom the pkce where I had landed before; by which 
I perceived that there was some indraught of the water, and 
consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, 
which I might make use of as a port to get to land with my 
cargo. 

As I imagilied, so it was. There appeared before me a little 
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set 
into it; so I guided my raft as well as I could to keep in the 
middle of the stream. But here I had like to have suffered a 
second shipwreck, Which if I had, I think verily would have broken 
my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground 
at one end of it upon a shoal, and hot being aground at the other 
end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off 
towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I 
did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep 
them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my 
^^ngth, neither durst I stir from the posture I was in, but hold- 
nig up the chests with all my might, stood in that manner near 
half an hour, in which time the rising of the Water brought me a 
little more upon a level; ^nd a little after, the water still rising, 
my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I had into 
the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself 
^the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong 
'torrent or tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper 
place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high 
'^P the river, hoping in time to see some ship at sea, and therefore 
^solve to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, 
^ which with great pain and diflHculty I guided my raft, and at 
iast got so near as that, reaching ground with my oar, I could 
thrust her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all my 
^gom the sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep — that is 
^ say, sloping — there was no place to land, but where one end of 
^y float if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink 
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All that 
I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the

shore, near a fiat piece of ground, which I expected the watei 
would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I found water enougt 
— for my raft drew about a foot of water — I thrust her on upoB 
that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her by 
sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side near 
one end, and one on the other side near the other end; and thus 
I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo 
safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place 
for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them 
from whatever might happen. Where I was I yet knew not, 
whether on the continent or on an island, whether inhabited oi 
not inhabited, whither in danger of wild beasts or not There 
was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep anc 
high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills which lay a; 
in a ridge from it northward. I took out one of the fowling-piece 
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, and thus armed 
travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, after 
had with great labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw my i3^ 
to my great affliction — namely, that I was in an island enviroa^ 
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rod 
which lay a great way off", and two small islands, less than tbJ 
which lay about three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I s^ 
good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts — 
whom, however, I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, b^ 
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them could I t^ 
what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, I sh<

for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell 
to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest 
of that day. And what to do with myself at night I knew not, 
nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to He down on the 
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me, 
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those 
fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself round with 
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a 
Wild of hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not 
which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or three 
creatures Uke hares run out of the wood where I shot the fowl 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many 
things out of the ship which would be useful to me, and particu- 
larly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things as might 
come to land; and I resolved to make another voyage on board 
the vessel, if possible; and as L knew that the first storm that 
Wew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all 
other things apart, till I got everything out of the ship that I 
could get Then I called a council — that is to say, in my thoughts 
^whether I should take back the raft; but this appeared imprac- 
ticable. So I resolved to go as before, when the tide was down; 
*Qd I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my hut, 
saving nothing on but a checkered shirt, and a pair of linen 
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet I got on board the

perience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy nor loaded

^ of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of

gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could

I was under some apprehensions during my absence from the 
land that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore; but> 
when I came back I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat sl

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain ^

and a barrel of fine flour. This was surprising to me, because E 
had given over exjiecting any more provisions, except what was 
spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, 
and wrapped it up parcel by parcel in pieces of the sails, which I 
cut out; and in a word, I got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now having plundered 
the ship of what was 7)ortable and fit to hand out, I began with 
the cables; and cutting the great cable into pieces such as I could 
move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron- 
work I could get; and having cut down the spritsail-yard, and 
the mizzen-yard, and everything I could to make a large raft, I 
loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came away. But my 
good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy 
and so overloaden, that after I was entered the little cove where I 
had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so 
handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my 
cargo into the water. As for myself it was no great harm, for I 
was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, 
especially the iron, which I expected would have been of great use 
to ma However, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces 
of cable ashore and some of the iron, though with infinite labour: 
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued 
me very much. After this I went every day on board, and brought 
away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven 
times on board the ship, in which time I had brought away all 
that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring; 
though I believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should have 
brought away the whole ship piece by piece. But preparing the 
twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind begin to rise. How- 
ever, at low water I went on board; and though I thought I had 
rummaged the cabin so efi'ectually as that nothing more could be 
found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which 
I found two or three razors and one pair of large scissors, with 
some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in another I found 
about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin, some 
Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.

THE VALUE OF MONEY. 69 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " drug !" said 
I aloud, " what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me, no 
not the taking off of the ground; one of those knives is worth all 
this heap. I have no manner of use for thee; even remain where 
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is not worth 
saving." However, upon second thoughts, I took it away, and 
wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think of making 
another raft; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky over- 
cast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it 
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me 
that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off 
shore, and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of 
flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at 
all Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam across 
the channel which \a.y between the ship and the sands, and even that 
with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had 
about me, and partly the roughness of the water, for the wind rose 
very hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm. 
, But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with all 
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that night; 
and in the morning when I looked out, behold, no more ship was 
^ be seen ! I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with 
this satisfactory reflection, namely, that I had lost no time nor 
abated any diligence to get everything out of her that could be 
useful to me, and that indeed there was little left in her that 1 
^as able to bring away, if I had had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything 
out of her, except what might drive on shore from her wreck, as 
indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were 
of small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself 

against either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any 

were in the island; and I had many thoughts of the method how 

to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should 

make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth. And, in 

short, I resolved upon both, the manner and description of which 

it may not be improper to give an account of.

60 A PLACE FOR RESlbENCE. 

I soon found the place I was in was not fot my settletnettt, par- 
ticularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near th(^ sea. 
and I believed could not be wholesome, and more patticulariy, be- 
cause their was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more 
healthy and more convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation which I found would 
be proper for me. First, health, and fresh water I just now men- 
tioned. Secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun. Thirdly, fe6- 
curity from ravenous creatures, whether men or bea&t^. Fourthly, 
a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight I tnight liot 
lose any advantage for toy deliverance, of which I was not Willing 
to banish all my expectation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found k little plain on the 
side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain wad steep 
as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from 
the top. On the side of this rock there was a holloW pla6e worli 
a little way in like the entrance or door of ia cave; but there was 
not really any cave or way into the rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved 
to pitch my tent. This plain was not above an hundred yards 
broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green before my 
door, and at the end of it descended irregularly every way down 
into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was on the north-north- 
west side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat every 
day till it came to a West and by south sun, or thereabouts, which 
in those countries is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hollow 
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the 
rock, and twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and 
ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving 
them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the big- 
gest end being out of the ground about five foot and a half, and 
sharpened on the top. The two rows did not stand above six 
inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and 
laid them in rows one upon another within the circle, between

these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in 
the iAside, leaning against them, about two foot and a half high, 
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong that neither 
maft nor beast could get into it or over it. This cost me a great 
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, 
bri^g them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

Th^ entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by 



* siiQrt ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I 
%(i pver after me. And so I was completely fenced in and f orti- 
fcd, a9 I thought, from all the world, and consequently slept 
secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done; though, 
as it appeared afterward, their was no need of all this caution from 
the enemies that I apprehended danger from. 

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my 
riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you

have the account above. And I made me a large tent, which, to 
preserve me from the rains that in one part of the year are very 
violent there, I made double — namely one smaller tent within, and 
one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a large 
tarpaulin which I had saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had 
brought on shore, but in a hammock; which was indeed a very 
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions and everything that 
would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods I 
made up the entrance, which till now I had left open, and so 
passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, 
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through 
my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, 
that so it raised the ground within about a foot and a half; and 
thus I made me a cave just behind my tent, which served me like 
a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labour and many days before all these things 
were brought to perfection, and therefore I must go back to some 
other things which took up some of my thoughts. At the same 
time it happened after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my 
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick 
dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that a 
great clap of thunder, as is naturally the eflfect of it. I was not 
so much surprised with the lightning as I was with a thought 
which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning itself— 
my powder ! My very heart sank within me when I thought that 
at one blast all my powder might be destroyed, on whieh not my 
defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely 
depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, 
though had the powder taken fire, I had never known who had 
hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm 
was over I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, 
and applied myself to make bags and boxes to separate the powder 
and keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever

come it might not all take fire at once, and to keep it so 
apart that it should not be possible to make one part fire another. 
I finished this work in about a fortnight; and I think my 
powder, which in all was about two hundred and forty pounds 
weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As to the

64 A DISMAL PHOSPECT. 

acquaint myself with what the island produced The first time 1 
went out I presently discovered that there were goats in the island 
— which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended 
with this misfortune to me, namely, that they were so shy, sc 
subtile, and so swift of foot, that it was the difficultest thing ic 
the world to come at them. But I was not discouraged at thi*. 
not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soor 
happened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wail 
in this manner for them : I observed if they saw me in the valleys^: 
though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as in g 
terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was 
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I coa- 
eluded that by the position of their optics their sight was sc 
directed downward that they did not readily see objects that were 
above them. So afterward I took this method, I always chmbeJ 
the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently a fair 
mark. The first shot I made among these creatures I killed 9 
she-goat which had a little kid by her which she gave suck to, which 
grieved me heartily. But when the old one fell the kid stooJ 
stock-still by her till I came and took her up; and not only so, 
but when I carried the old one with me upon my shoulders, the 
kid followed me quite to my enclosure : upon which I laid down 
the dam and took the kid in my arms, and carried it over mf 
pale, in hopes to have it bred up tame; but it would not eat, so I 
was forced to kill it and eat it myself. These two supplied m^ 
with flesh a great "while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my pro- 
visions (my bread especially) as much as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neces- 
sary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to bum; an J 
what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave and what 
conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its place. 
But I must first give some little account of myself and of my 
thoughts about living, which it may well be supposed were not 
a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast 
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a 
violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and

HOPEFUL CONSIDERATIONS. 65 

a great way, namely, some hmidreds of leagues, out of the 
ordinary course of the trade of mankind I had great reason to 
consider it as a • determination of Heaven that in this desolate 
place and in this desolate manner I should end my life. The 
tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these 
reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why 
Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures and render 
them so absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so 
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful 
for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me to check these 
thoughts and to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking 
with my gun in my hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon 
the subject of my present condition, when reason, as it were, ex- 
postulated with me the other way, thus : Well, you are in a deso- 
late condition it is true, but pray remember, where are the rest of 
youl Did you not come eleven of you into the boat, — where are 
the ten? Why were not they saved and you lost? Why were 
yoQ singled out? Is it better to be here or there?— and then I 
pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good 
that is in them, and with what worse attends them. 
Then it occurred to me again how well I was furnished for my 
and what would have been my case if it had not 
d, which was an hundred thousand to one, that the ship 
from the place where she first struck, and was driven so 
Dear to the shore that I had time to get all these things out of 
her. What would have been my case if I had been to have lived 
^ the condition in which I at first came on shore, without 
necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and procure them? 
Particularly, said I aloud (though to myself), what should I have 
<ione without a gun, without ammunition; without any tools to 
^ake anything, or to work with; without clothes, bedding, a tent 
or any manner of covering; and that now I had all these to a 
sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in 
such a manner, as to live without my gun when my ammunition 
^as spent ; so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting without 
any want as long as I lived : for I considered from the beginning

66 SILENT LIFE. 

how I would provide for the accidents that might happen, and 
for the time that was to come, even not only after my ammu- 
nition should be spent, but even after my health or strength 
should decay. 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammuni- 
tion being destroyed at one blast — I mean my powder being 
blown up by lightning — and this made the thoughts of it so 
surprising to me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed 
just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene 
of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world 
before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its 
order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September when, in the 
manner as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island, when 
the sun being, to us, in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over 
my head; for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the 
latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days it came into 
my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of 
books and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days 
from the working days; but, to prevent this, I cut it with my 
knife upon a large post, in capital letters, and making it into a 
great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed — namely, 

I CAME ON SHORE HERE ON THE 30TH OF SEPTEMBER 1659. Upon 

the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my 
knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and 
every first day of the month as long again as that long one, and 
thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning 
of time. 

In the next place we are to observe, that among the many 
things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages 
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of 
less value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting 
down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper, severaJ 
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, 
three or four compasses, some mathematical instniments, dials, 
perspectives, charts, and books of navigation ; all which I huddled

together, whether I might want them or no. Also, I fomid three 
very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England,

books also, and among them two or three Popish prayer-books,

its place: for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, 
he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me

68 SLOW WORK AT FIRST. 

a trusty servant to me many years. I wanted nothing that ho 
could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to me; 
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do. 
As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I hus- 
banded them to the utmost; and I shall show that, while my ink 
lasted, I kept things very exact; but after that was gone I could 
not, for I could not make any ink by any means that I could 
devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwith- 
standing all that I had amassed together; and of these, this of ink 
was one; as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the 
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon learned to 
want that without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and it 
was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale 
or surrounded habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as 
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre- 
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing home; so that 
I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home one of 
those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground: for 
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last be- 
thought myself of one of the iron crows; which, however, though 
I found it, yet it made driving those posts or piles very laborious 
and tedious work 

But what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of any- 
thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor had 
I any other employment if that had been over, at least that I 
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food, which 
I did more or less every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circum- 
stance I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my affairs in 
writing, not so much to leave them to any that were to come after 
me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts 
from daily poring upon them, and afflicting my mind; and as my 
reason began now to master my despondency, I began to comfort 
myself as well as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that 
I might have something to distinguish my case from worse; and I

Stated it very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I 
enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus : — 



Evil. 

I am cast upon a horrible desolate 
island, void of all hope of recovery. 

I am singled out and separated, as 
it were, from all the world, to be mis- 
erable. 



I am divided from mankind, a soU- 
taire, one banished from human so- 
ciety. 

I have not clothes to cover me. 



I am without any defence or means 
to resist any violence of man or beast. 



I have no soul to speak to, or relieve 



Good. 

But I am alive, and not drowned, as 
all my ship's company was. 

But I am singled out, too, from all 
the ship's crew to be spared from 
death; and He that miraculously saved 
me from death can deUver me from 
this condition. 

But I am not starved and perish- 
ing on a barren place, affording no 
sustenance. 

But I am in a hot climate, where, 
if I had clothes, I could hardly wear 
them. 

But I am cast on an island where I 
see no wild beasts to hurt me, as I saw 
on the coast of Africa; and what if I 
had been shipwrecked there? 

But God wonderfully sent the ship 
in near enough to the shore, that I 
have gotten out so many necessary 
things as will either supply my wants, 
or enable me to supply myself even as 
long as I live. 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there 
was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but there was 
something negative or something positive to be thankful for in it; 
*Dd let this stand as a direction from the experience of the most 
^erable of all conditions in this world, that we may always find 
^ it something to comfort ourselves from, and to set in the de-

of wall up against it of turfs, about two foot thick on the outside; 
and after some time, I think it was a year and a half, I raised 
rafters from it leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with 
boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep out the 
rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this 
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me; but I must 
observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which.

as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place. I had no 
room to turn myself, so I set myself to enlarge my cave and works 
farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, which jdelded 
easily to the labour I bestowed on it : and so, when I found I 
was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the 
right hand into the rock; and then, turning to the right again, 
worked quite out, and made me a door to come out, on the outside 
of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back-way 
to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my 
^oods.

LESSONS IN CARPENTRY. 71 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things 
as I found I most wanted, as particularly a chair and a table ; for 
without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in 
the world— 1 could not write or eat, or do several things with so 
much pleasure without a table. 

So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as 
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by 
stating and squaring everything by reason, and by making the 
most rational judgment of things, every man may be in time 
master of every mechanic art I had never handled a tool in my 
hfe, and yet in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I 
found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, 
especially if I had had tools; however, I made abundance of things, 
even without tools, and some with no more tools than an adze 
Jwid a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, 
and that with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board, 
I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge 
! me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had 
ht it to be thin as a plank, and then dubb it smooth with 
^7 adze. It is true, by this method I could make but one board 
out of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but patience, 
^ymore than I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour 
^Mch it took me up to make a plank or board. But my time or 
labour was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way 
as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, 
ID the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces of boards 
"^at I brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had 
bought out some boards, as above, I made large shelves of the 
breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all along one side 
w my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work, and, in a 
^ord, to separate everything at large in their places, that I might 
come easily at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock 
^ tang my guns and all things that would hang up. 

So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked Hke a general 
'^azine of all necessary things; and I had everything so ready at 
^y hand that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in

down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of 
being devoured." 

Some days after this, and after I bad been on board the ship 
and got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting 
up to the top of a little mountain and looking out to sea in hopes 
of seeing a ship, then fancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, please 
myself with the hopes of it, and then after looking steadily till I 
was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a child, 
and thus increase my misery by my folly. 

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and 
having settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a table 
and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to 
keep my journal, of which I shall here give you the copy (though 
ui it will be told all these particulars over again) as long as it 
l^ted, for, having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off 

THE JOURNAL 

September 30, 1659. I, poor, miserable Eobinson Crusoe, being 
sMpwrecked during a dreadful storm in the ofl&ng, came on shore 
on this dismal unfortunate island, which I called the Island of 
I^espair, all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and 
layself ahnost dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal 
circumstances I was brought to — namely, I had neither food, house, 
clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to, and, in despair of any relief, 
saw nothing but death before me — either that I should be devoured 
^y^d beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death for want 
o{ food At the approach of night I slept in a tree for fear of wild 
creatures, but slept soundly though it rained all night. 

OcUihr 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship 
had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again 
Diuch nearer the island; which as it was some comfort, on one 
hand, for, seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I 
hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board and get some 
'ood and necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on the other 
it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I

imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have saved th^ 
ship, or at least that they would not have been all drowned aj 
they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhapj 
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carriec 
us to some other part of the world. I spent great part of thi 
day in perplexing myself on these things; but at length, seeinj 
the ship almost diy, I went upon the sand as near as I could, an( 
then swam on board; this day also it continued raining, thougl 
with no wind at all. 

From the \st of October to the 2Uh. All these days entirely spen 
in many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, whicl 
I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rai] 
also in these days, though with some intervals of fair weather 
but, it seems, this was the rainy season. 

October 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upoi 
it; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, 
recovered many of them when the tide was out. 

October 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts o 
wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind bloin 
ing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen, excep 
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent this da; 
in covering and securing the goods which I had saved, that th 
rain might not spoil them. 

October 26. I walked about the shore almost all day to find on 
a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure mysel 
from an attack in the night either from wild beasts or men. Tc 
wards night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marke< 
out a semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthe: 
with a work, wall, or fortification made of double piles, line" 
within with cables and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying al 
my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time i 
rained exceeding hard. 

The 31st in the morning I went out into the island with m; 
gun to see for some food, and discover the country, when I kille< 
a she-goat, and her kid followed me home, which I afterward 
killed also, because it would not feed.

76 LOSES HIS RECKONING. 

then in the evening to work agaia The working part of this day 
and of the next were wholly employed in making my table; for I 
was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity 
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe it 
would do any one else. 

November 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, 
and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for 
nothing. Every creature I killed I took off the skins and pre- 
served them. Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of 
sea-fowls which I did not understand; but was surprised and 
almost frightened with two or three seals, which while I was 
gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and 
escaped me for that time. 

November 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my 
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it 
long before I learned to mend it. 

November 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday), 
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought 
it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me ; and even in the 
making I pulled it in pieces several times. Note, — I soon ne- 
glected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for them on 
my post, I forgot which was which. 

November 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceed- 
ingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible 
thunder and hghtning, which frightened me dreadfully for fear of 
my powder. As soon as it was over I resolved to separate my 
stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it 
might not be in danger. 

November 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making httle 
square chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two 
pound at most, of powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed 
it in places as secure and remote from one another as possible. 
On one of these three days I killed a krge bird that was good to 
eat, but I know not what to call it. 

November 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the 
rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. Note. — Three

THE raON-TREE. 77 

I wanted exceedingly for this work — namely, a pick-axe, a 
i\y and a wheelbarrow or basket. So I desisted from my 
work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and make 
me some tools. As for a pick-axe I made use of the iron crows 
which were proper enough though heavy. But the next thing 
was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that 
indeed I could do nothing effectually without it. But what kind 
of one to make I knew not. 

Nmmber 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a 
tree of that wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the 
iron tree, for its exceeding hardness. Of this, with great labour 
and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home 
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. 

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other way, 
made me a long while upon this machine; for I worked it effec- 
tually by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade, the 
handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the broad 
part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me 
80 long. However, it served well enough for the uses which I 
liad occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made 
^r that fashion, or so long a-making. 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow. 
A basket I could not make by any means, having no such things 
*s twigs that would bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet 
fonnd out And as to a wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all 
but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither did I know 
now to go about it; besides, I had no possible way to make the 
iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I 
gave it over. And so, for carrying away the earth which I dug 
out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the labourers 
^ mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. 

This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel; and 
yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to 
"^ke a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days — I mean 
^^ays excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom 
failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home something fit to 
eat.

78 AN AWKWARD ACCIDENT. 

November 23. My other work having now stood still becj 
my making these tools, when they were finished I went o 
working every day as my strength and time allowed, I 
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my cav 
it might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note, — During all this time I worked to make this re 
cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or 
zine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for my k 
I kept to the tent, except that sometimes, in the wet season 
year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry; 
caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pa] 
long poles in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, ar 
them with flags and large leaves of trees like a thatch. 

December 10. I began now to think my cave or vault fi] 
when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great 
tity of earth fell down from the top and one side, so mucl 
in short, it frightened me; and not without reason too, f 
had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger. Up< 
disaster I had a great deal of work to do over again; for 
the loose earth to carry out, and, which was of more impo 
I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure n( 
would come down. 

December 11. This day I went to work with it according] 
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two 
of boards across over each post. This I finished the nes 
and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week i 
had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows, sen 
for partitions to part off ray house. 

December 17. From this day to the 20th I placed shelve 
knocked up nails on the posts to hang everything u] 
could be hung up; and now I began to be in some order 
doors. 

December 20. Now I carried everything into the cave and 
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, 
dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to I 
scarce with me. Also I made me another table.

80 THE FENCE BEGUN. 

was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food. Tbi^ 
time I spent in putting all my things in order within doors. 

January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and \&X* 
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This eve^^ 
ing, going farther into the valleys which lay towards the centx 
of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though exceed 
ing shy and hard to come at. However, I resolved to try if 
could not bring my dog to hunt them down. 

January 2. Accordingly, the next day I went out with my do^ 
and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they a- 
faced about upon the dog, and he knew his danger too well, fc 
he would not come near them. 

January 3. I began my fence or wall, which, being still jealoia 
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thic' 
and strong. 

KB, This wall being described before, I purposely omit wha 
was said in the journal. It is sufficient to observe that I was n. 
less time than from the 3rd of January to the 14th of April work 
ing, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it was no more tha3 
about twenty-four yards in length, being a half circle from on. ' 
place in the rock to another place about eight yards from it, tL^ 
door of the cave being in the centre behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me man^ 
days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I shoulc 
never be perfectly secure till this wall was finished. And it ij 
scarce credible what inexpressible labour everything was don^ 
with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods and driving 
them into the ground, for I made them much bigger than I neec 
to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced witf^ 
a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if anj 
people were to come on shore there, they would not perceive anjr 
thing like a habitation. And it was very well I did so, as ma5 
be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion. 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for gam^ 
every day when the rain admitted me, and made frequent di* 
coveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage

MANY THINGS WANTED. 81 

Particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as 
wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons in the holes 
of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to 
breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they 
flew all away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding 
them, for I had nothing to give them. However, I frequently 
found their nests, and got their young ones, which were very good 
meat. 

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found my- 
self wanting in many things, which I thought at first was impos- 
sible for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it was. For 
instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small 
nmlet or two, as I observed before, but I could never arrive to the 
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks 
about it. I could neither put in the heads, nor joint the staves 
so true to one another as to make them hold water. So I gave 
that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so that as 
soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I 
was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-wax 
with which 1 made candles in my African adventure, but I had 
none of that now. The only remedy I had was, that when I had 
Med a goat, I saved the tallow; and with a little dish made of 
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some 
<^*feun, I made me a lamp, and this gave me light, though not a 
J^lear, steady light, like a candle. In the middle of all my labours 
It happened that, rummaging my things, I found a little bag, 
which, as I hinted before, had been filled with com for the feeding 
0^ poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when 
^le ship came from Lisbon. What little remainder of com had 
}^n in the bag was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing 
in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have the bag 
'or some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when I 
it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the 
of com out of it on one side of my fortification under the 
rock. 
It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I

astonished when, after a longer time, I saw about ten or twe

as our European, nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of 
thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religi

head, nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befal

these things, or his order in governing events in the world. But 
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I know was not 
proper for com, and especially that I knew not how it came there, 
it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God had 
miraculously caused this grain to grow without any help of seed 
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that 
wild miserable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my 
eyes; and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature 
should happen upon my account. And this was the more strange 
to me, because I saw near it still all along by the side of the rock 
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, 
and which I knew because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I 
was ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for 
^y support, but not doubting but that there was more in the place, 
A went all over that part of the island where I had been before, 
peering in every comer and under every rock, to see for more of 
^t; but I could not find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts 
that I had shaken a bag of chickens' meat out in that place, and 
then the wonder began to cease; and I must confess my religious 
tnankfulness to God's providence began to abate too upon the dis- 
^vering that all this was nothing but what was common ; though 
1 ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen 
providence as if it had been miraculous : for it was really the work 
of Providence as to me, that should order or appoint that ten or 
twelve grains of com should remain unspoiled (when the rats had 
destroyed all the rest), as if it had been dropped from heaven ; as 
ako that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it 
^ing in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately; 
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had been 
burned up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be sure, in their 
^28on, which was about the end of June ; and laying up every 
^"i, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have 
^^^ quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But it was not

84 A TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE. 

corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterward* 
in its order; for I lost all that I sowed the first season by not ob- 
serving the proper time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, 
so that it never came up at all, at least not as it would have done 
— of which in its place. 

Besides this barley there was, as above, twenty or thirty stalks 
of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and whose use was 
of the same kind or to the same purpose — namely, to make me 
bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it up without bak- 
ing, though I did that also after some time. But to return to my 
journal. 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months to get my 
wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go 
into it, not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there 
might be no sign in the outside of my habitation. 

April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with the ladder 
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on 
the inside. This was a complete enclosure to me — for within I 
had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without, 
unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost 
had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The 
case was thus : As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, 
just in the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frightened with 
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for all on a sudden I 
found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave 
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts 
I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was 
heartily scared, but thought nothing of what was really the cause 
— only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as some of 
it had done before; and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran 
forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, 
I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I 
expected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped 
down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible 
earthquake, for the ground I stood on shook three times at about 
eight minutes* distance with three such shocks as would have;

A DREADFUL HURRICANE. 85 

overturaed the strongest building that could be supposed to 
\iave stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, 
wbich stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell down 
with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I per- 
ceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it, and 
1 l)elieve the shocks were stronger under the water than on the 
island. 

I was so amazed with the thing itself — having never felt the Kke 
or discoursed with any one that had — that I was like one dead or 
stapified; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, Kke 
one that was tossed at sea. But the noise of the falling of the rock 
awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupified condition 
I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but 
the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and bury- 
ing all at once; and this sunk my very soul within me a second 
time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some 
tune, I began to take courage; and yet I had not heart enough 
to go over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat 
still upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not know- 
ing what to do. All this while I had not the least serious religious 
thought, nothing but the common "Lord have mercy upon me;' 
and when it was over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as 
if it would rain. Soon after that the wind rose by little and little, 
so that m less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. 
The sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth, the 
shore was covered with the breach of the water, the trees were 
torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and this held 
^Wt three hours and then began to abate, and in two hours more 
It was calm and began to rain very hard. 
All this while I sat upon the ground very much terrified and 
d, when on a sudden it came into my thoughts that these 
and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the 
^hquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into 
^y cave again. With this thought my spirits began to revive, 
and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down

86 VIOLENT RAIN. 

in my tent — but the rain was so violent that my tent was read^ 
to be beaten down with it, and I was forced to go into my cav^ 
though very much afraid and uneasy for fear it should fall on m^ 
head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work — ^namely, to cut ^ 
hole through my new fortification like a sink to let the water go 
out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I had beeni 
in my cave some time and found still no more shocks of the earths 
quake follow, I began to be more composed; and now to support 
my spirits — which indeed wanted it very much — I went to my 
little store and took a small sup of rum, which however I did then 
and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when 
that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night and great part of the next 
day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more 
composed, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding that 
if the island was subject to these earthquakes there would be no 
living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building me some 
little hut in an open place which I might surround with a wall as 
I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or 
men; but concluded, if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, 
one time or other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the 
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice 
of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly 
fall upon my tent. And I spent the two next days, being the 
19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove 
my habitation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never 
slept in quiet, and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without 
any fence was almost equal to it; but still when I looked about 
and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly con- 
cealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to 
remove. 

In the meantime it occurred to me that it would require a vast 
deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to 
run the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself?

CRUSOE*S GRINDSTONE. 87 

and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution 

I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to 

work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c.> 

in a circle as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished, 

but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished 

and fit to remove to. This was the 21st. 

A]^nl 22. The next morning I began to consider of means to 
put this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about my 
took I had three large axes and abundance of hatchets (for we 
carried the hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much 
choppmg and cutting knotty hard wood they were all full of 
notches and dull ; and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn 
it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a 
statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or 
a judge upon the life and death of a njan. At length I contrived 
a wheel with a string to turn it with my foot, that I might have 
both my hands at liberty. — Note. I had never seen any such thing 
in England, or at least not to take notice how it was done, though 
since I have observed it is very common there; besides that, my 
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me a 
full week's work to bring it to perfection. 

^]^l 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding my 
tools, my machine for turning my grindstone performing very 
well 

^FU 30. Having perceived my bread had been low a great 
™le, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one bis- 
cuitKiake a day, which made my heart very heavy. 

^^y 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the tide 
'^ing low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, 
*nd it looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small 
barrel and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which 
were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towards 
tbe wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water

WORKING ON THE WRECK. 89 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing 
my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, 
in searching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I 
found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the 
inside of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as I had 
learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything 
to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that everything I 
could get from her would be of some use or other to me. 

May 3. 1 began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, 
which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck 
%ther; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand 
^ well as I could from the side which lay highest; but the tide 
coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time. 

Mayi I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst 
eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when just going to leave off, 
1 caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some 
^peyarn, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently caught fish enough, 
as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and ate 



1 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder, and 
t three great fir planks off from the decks, which I tied to- 
5r, and made swim on shore when the tide of flood came on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of her, 
a^d other pieces of iron- work, worked very hard, and came home 
^ery much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not to 
^wk; but found the weight of the wreck had broken itself down, 
"le beams being cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie 
joose, and the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into 
^t, but ahnost full of water and sand. 

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench 
^P the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I 
inched open two planks, and brought them on shore also with 
^^ tide. I left the iron crow in the wreck for next day. 

May^, Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way

roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy ^ 
remove. 

May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the wreck, and gc 
a great deal of pieces of timber and boards, or planks, and two < 
three hundredweight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets to try if I could not cut a pie 
off of the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet ai 
driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half 
the water, I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the wreck a 
peared more broken by the force of the water; but I stayed 
long in the woods to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevents 
me going to the wreck that day. 

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at 
great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see wh 
they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too hea^ 
for me to bring away. 

May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, ar 
with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the croi 
that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and two of tl 
seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, nothir 
came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead whic 
had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and the sand ha 
spoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except tl 
time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during th 
part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I migl 
be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I had gqtU 
timber and plank and iron-work enough to have built a good boa 
if I had known how; and also, I got at several times and in sever 
pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead. 

June 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise < 
turtle. This was the first I had seen; which, it seems, was on 
my misfortune, not any defect of the place or scarcity; for had 
happened to be on the other side of the island, I might have ha 
hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; but, perhap 
had paid dear enough for thena.

92 A FIT OF AGUE. 

JuTie 22. A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions oi 
sickness. 

June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent 
headache. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague, very violent. The fit held me seven hoursPj 
cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun^ 
but found myself very weak However, I killed a she-goat, anJ 
with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate. 
I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no 
pot. 

June 27. The ague again, so violent that I lay a-bed all day, 
and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but 
so weak, I had not strength to stand up or to get myself any water 
to drink. Prayed to God again; but was light-headed, and when 
I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say; only I 
lay and cried, "Lord, look upon me; Lord, pity me; Lord, have 
mercy upon me!" I suppose I did nothing else for two or three 
hours, till the fit wearing off I fell asleep, and did not wake till far 
in the night. When I waked I found myself much refreshed, 
but weak and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no water 
in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and 
went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible 
dream : — 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside of my 
wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and 
that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright 
flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright 
as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him. His 
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words 
to describe. When he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I 
thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earth- 
quake; and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had 
been filled with flashes of fire. 

He was no sooner landed upon the earth but he moved forward 
towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill ma

CRUSOE'S TERRIBLE DREAM. 93 

And when he came to a rising ground at some distance, he spoke 
to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to express 
the terror of it. All that I can say I understood was this, "Seeing 
all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now thou 
shalt die." At which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that 
was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should 
be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision, 
I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those 
horrors. Nor is it any more possible to describe the impression 
that remained upon my mind, when I awaked and found it was but 
a dream. 

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the 
good instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninter- 
rupted series, for eight years, of sea-faring wickedness, and a con- 
stant conversation with nothing but such as were like myself, 
wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not remember that 
I had in all that time one thought that so much as tended either 
to looking upwards toward God, or inwards towards a reflection 
upon my own ways. But a certain stupidity of soul, without 
desire of good or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, 
and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature 
^ong our common sailors can be supposed to be, not having the 
least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness 
to God in deliverances. 

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the 
more easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the variety 
* of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much 
as one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just 
punishment for my sin, my rebellious behaviour against my father, 
or my present sins, which were great; or so much as a punish- 
inent for the general course of my wicked life. When I was on 
the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I never 
nad so much as one thought of what would become of me; or 
one wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me 
froni the danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from 
voracious creatures as cruel savages. But I was merely thoughtless

94 WHOLESOME THOUGHTS. 

of a God, or a Providence; acted like a mere brute from the prU^' 
ciples of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, an^ 
indeed hardly that. 

When I was delivered and taken up, at sea by the Portug^- 
captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as wel 
as charitably, I had not the least thankfulness on my thoughts- 
When again I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning 
on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it as a 
judgment; I only said to myself often that I was an unfortunate 
dog, and born to be always miserable. 

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship's 
crew dro^vned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of 
ecstasy and some transports of soul, which, had the grace of God 
assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness. But it ended 
where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, 
being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon the distin- 
guishing goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had 
singled me out to be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed ; 
or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me — even 
just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have 
after they have got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown 
all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is 
over; and all the rest of my life was like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sen- 
sible of my condition, how I was cast on this dreadful place, out 
of the reach of hiunan kind, out of all hope of relief or prospect of 
redemption, as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I 
should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my affic- 
tion wore off", and I begun to be very easy, applied myself to the 
works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough 
from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from heaven, 
or as the hand of God against me. These were thoughts which 
very seldom entered into my head. 

The growing up of the com, as is hinted in my journal, had at 
first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with 
seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous 
in it; but as soon as ever that part of the thought was removed.

A father's advice recalled. 95 

all the impression which was raised from it wore oflF also, as I have 
noted already. 

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in 
its nature, or more immediately directing to the Invisible Power 
which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright 
over, but the impression it had made went oflf also. I had no 
more sense of God or his judgments, much less of the present 
affliction of my circumstances being from his hand, than if I had 
been in the most prosperous condition of life. 

But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the 
miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits 
began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature 
was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had 
slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself 
^th my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon 
wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncom- 
mon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. 

These reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of 
my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever as of the 
dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from 
me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were either a 
prayer attended with desires or with hopes; it was rather the 
voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts were confused, 
the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in 
such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the 
mere apprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul I know not 
^Qat my tongue might express. But it was rather exclamation, 
such as, " Lord, what a miserable creature am I ! If I should be 
sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and what will become 
of me?" Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no 
more for a good while. 

^ this interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, 
^d presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning 
01 this story, namely that if I did take this foolish step, God would 
^ot bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon 
J^^g neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist 
'^ my recovery. "Now," said I aloud, "my dear father's words

are come to pass: God's justice has overtaken me, and ] 
none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Provi 
which had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life w 
I might have been happy and easy; but I would neither 
myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parer 
left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to : 
under the consequences of it. I refused their help and assi 
who would have Kfted me into the world, and would have 
everything easy to me; and now I have difficulties to st 
with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no assii 
no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, "Lord, 
help; for I am in great distress." 

This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had 
for many years. But I return to my journal 

June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep 
had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and thou^ 
fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I cons 
that the fit of the ague would return again the next day, an 
was my time to get something to refresh and support myseli 
I should be ill. And the first thing I did, I filled a large 
case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach 
bed; and to take off* the chill or aguish disposition of the w 
put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it and mixed then 
ther. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh and broilec 
the coals, but could eat very. little. I walked about, but wa 
weak, and withal very sad and heavy;hearted in the sense 
miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper th 
day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's 
which I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the 
and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's bl 
to, even as I could remember, in my whole life. 

After I had eaten I tried to walk, but found myself sc 
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out w 
that) ; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the g] 
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and ver 
and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these oc<

THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE. 97 

What is this earth and sea of which I have seen so much, 
whence is it produced; and what am I and all the other creatures, 
mid and tame, human and brutal, whence are we 1 

Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who formed the 
eaith and sea, the air and sky; and who is that? 

Then it followed most naturally. It is God that has made it all. 

Well, but then it came on strangely. If God has made all these 

tilings, he guides and governs them all, and all things that concern 

tliem; for the Power that could make all things must certainly 

liave power to guide and direct them. 

If 80, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works, 
either without his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that 
I am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing 
happens without his appointment, he has appointed all this to 
befall me. 

Nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these con- 
closions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force, 
that it must needs be that God had appointed all this to befall 
me; that I was brought to this miserable circumstance by his 
fection, he having the sole power, not of me only, but of every- 
thing that happened in the world. Immediately it followed, — 

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done to be thus 
osedl 

My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had 
Wasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a voice : Wretch I 
^ost thou ask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful 
^^spent Ufe, and ask thyself what thou hast not done! Ask, 
Why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert 
4ounot drowned in Yarmouth Eoads? killed in the fight when 
Aeship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war? devoured by the 
^d beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned here, when all the 
^few perished but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I done? 

I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and 

' Wnot a word to say — no, not to answer to myself; but rose up 

P^iisive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my

98 A PRECIOUS INVITATION. 

disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down ii 
chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark Now a 
apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me 
much, it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no p! 
but their tobacco for almost all distempers; and I had a pie 
a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured 
some also that was green and not quite cured. 

I Avent, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I f 
a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest \nd f 
what I looked fpr, namely, the tobacco; and as the few bo( 
had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles wh: 
mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found lei 
or so much as inchnation to look into — I say, I took it out 
brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my dii 
per, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried se 
experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one w, 
other. I first took a piece of a leaf and chewed it in my m< 
which indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco 1 
green and strong and that I had not been much used to it; 
I took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum^ 
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly I bu 
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the si 
of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as almos 
sufibcation. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible and b 
to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobac 
bear reading, at least that time. Only, having opened the 
casually, the first Avords that occurred to me were these, * 
upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou 
glorify me." ^ 

The words were very apt to my case, and made some imprei 
upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though nc 
much as they did afterwards; for, as for being delivered, the ^ 
had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remot 
impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to sa

A STRONG DOSE. 99 

t\ie children of Israel did, when they were promised flesh to eat, 

"Can God spread a table in the wilderness?" so I began to say. 

Can God himself deliver me from this place] and as it was not for 

many years that any hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon 

my thoughts; but, however, the words made a great impression 

upon me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew now late, 

and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much that I 

inched to sleep; so 

I left my lamp hum- ; j 

ing in the cave lest I ' ' 

should want anything 

in the night, and went 

to bed: but, before I 

lay down, I did what 

I never had done in ^ 

all my life — I kneeled 

down and prayed to 

God to fulfil the 

promise to me, that \ 

if I called upon him 

ia the day of trouble, 

ie would deliver me. ^ 

After my broken and ~" ^^^ii^/--" 

imperfect prayer was -I took up the Blble and began to r«ML» 

over, I drank the rum 

ifl which I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank 
of the tobacco that indeed I could scarce get it down. Im- 
JQediately upon this I went to bed. I found presently it flew up 
in my head violently, but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no 
inore till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in 
4e afternoon the next day. Nay, to this hour I am partly of the 
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost 
tkree that day after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose 
* % out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared 
some years after I had done. For if I had lost it by crossing and 
^crossing the line, I should have lost more than one day; but, 
<^ertainly, I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.

100 HE BEGINS TO RECOVER. 

Be that, however, one way or the other, when I awaked I found 
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful; 
when I got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and my 
stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the 
next day, but continued much altered for the better. This was 
the 29tb. 

The 30th was my well-day, of course, and I went abroad with 
my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a sea-fowl or 
two, something like a brand-goose,^ and brought them home, but 
was not very forward to eat them; so I ate some more of the 
turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the 
medicine which I had supposed did me good the day before— 
namely, the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much 
as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over 
the smoke. However, I was not so well the next day, which was 
the 1st of July,, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little 
spice of the cold fit, but it was not much. 

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, and dosed 
myself with it as at first; and doubled the quantity which I 
drank. 

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not 
recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus 
gathering strength my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scrip- 
ture, "I will deliver thee;" and the impossibility of my deliver- 
ance lay much upon my mind in bar of my ever expecting it 
But as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts it occurred 
to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the 
main affliction that I disregarded the deliverance I had received; 
and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions as these 
— namely. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from 
sickness — from the most distressed condition that could be, and 
that was so frightful to me] And what notice I had taken of it-: 
Had I done my part? God had delivered me, but I had noi 
glorified him; that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful! 
for that as a deliverance. And how could I expect greater deliver- 
ance?

A GOOD RESOLUTION. 101 

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I kneeled 
down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my sick- 
ness. 

My 4. In the morning I took the Bible, and, beginning at the 
New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon 
myself to read a while every morning and every night, not tying 
niTself to the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts 
should engage me. It was not long after I set seriously to this 
work, but I found my heart more deeply and sincerely affected 
with the wickedness of my past life. The impression of my dream 
revived, and the words, " All these things have not brought thee 
to repentance," ran seriously in my thought. I was earnestly 
beting of God to give me repentance, when it happened provi- 
dentially the very day that, reading the Scripture, I came to these 
Words, " He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, 
and to give remission." I threw down the book and with my 
heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy 
of joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou 
exalted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance! " 

This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense of the 

words, that I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with a sense 

oi my condition, and with a true Scripture view of hope founded 

on the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I 

may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call on 
Die, and I will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I had

102 INWARD COMFORT. 

whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense 
of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater 
blessing than deliverance from affliction. 

But leaving this part, I return to my journal. 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to 
my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my thoughts 
being directed, by a constant reading the Scripture and praying 
to God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of com- 
fort within, which till now I knew nothing of. Also as my health 
and strength returned, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with 
everything that I wanted, and make my way of living as regular 
as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th I vras chiefly employed in 
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at 
a time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of 
sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to 
what weakness I was reduced. The application which I made use 
of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague 
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to practise, by this 
experiment; and though it did carry ofi" the fit, yet it rather con- 
tributed to weakening me, for I had frequent convulsions in my 
nerves and limbs for some time. 

I learned from it also this in particular, that being abroad in. the 
rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could 
be, especially in those rains which came attended with storms 
and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came in the dry 
season was always most accompanied with such storms, so I found 
that rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in 
September and October. 

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all 
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely 
taken from me, and I firmly believed that no human shape had 
ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured my habitation, 
as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a 
more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what other pro- 
ductions I might find which I yet knew nothing of. 

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular

A SURVEY OF THE ISLAND. 103 

survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I 
binted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about 
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it 
was no more than a little brook of running water, and very fresh 
and good; but this being the dry season, there was hardly any 
water in some parts of it, at least not enough to run in any stream 
80 as it could be perceived. On the bank of this brook I found 
many pleasant savannas, or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered 
with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher 
grounds, where the water, as it might be supposed, never over- 
flowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a 
great and very strong stalk There were divers other plants which 
I had no notion of, or understanding about, and might perhaps 
have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. 

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians in all that 
climate make their bread of; but I could find none. I saw large 
plants of aloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several 
sugar canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I 
contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came 
back musing with myself what course I might take to know the 
^rtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should 
^cover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for in short, I had 
Diade so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew 
little of the plants in the field, at least very little that might serve 
Die to any purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the. same way again, and 
after going something farther than I had gone the day before, I 
tad the brook, and the savannas began to cease, and the country 
became more woody than before. In this part I found different 
Wts, and, particularly, I found melons upon the ground in great 
abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread in- 
deed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in 
tneir prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, 
^^ I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my 
^^erience to eat sparingly of them, remembering that, when I

they were, as wholesome as agreeable to eat, when no grapes 
might be to be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habita- 
tion, which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had 
lain from home. In the night I took my first contrivance, and 
got up into a tree, where I slept well; and the next morning pro- 
ceeded upon my discovery, travelling near foiu* miles, as I might 
judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north, with a 
ridge of hills on the south and north side of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the

A STORE OF FRUIT. 105 

country seemed to descend to the west, and a little spring of fresh 
water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other 
way, that is due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, 
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure, or flourish 
of spring, that it looked Hke a planted garden. 

I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, survejring 
it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with my other 
afllieting thoughts) — to think that this was all my own, that I was 
king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of 
possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in inherit- 
ance, as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw 
here abimdance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees, 
but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then. 
However, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant 
to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards 
with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool, and re- 
freshmg. 

I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; 
^ud I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and 
lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was 
approaching. 

In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, 
Mid a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and 
lemons in another place; and, taking a few of each with me, I 
ttavelled homeward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag 
or sack, or what I could make to carry the rest home. 

Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came 
home;— so I must now call my tent and my cave. But, before I 
got thither the grapes were spoiled — the richness of the fruits and 
the weight of the juice having broken them, and bruised them, 
they were good for little or nothing; as to the hmes, they were 
good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me 
tvo small bags to bring home my harvest. But I was surprised 
^hen, coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine 
^hen I gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod to 
pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abimdance

106 A SUMMER BOWER. 

eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild 
creatures thereabouts which had done this, but what they were I 
knew not. 

However, as I found that there was no laying them up on heaps, 
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would 
be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their 
own weight, I took another course ; for I gathered a large quantity 
of the grapes, and hung them up upon the out branches of the 
trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the 
limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand 
under. 

When I came home from this journey I contemplated with great 
pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley and the pleasantness of the 
situation, the security from storms on that side the water, and the 
wood, and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my 
abode which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the 
whole I began to consider of removing my habitation, and to look 
out for a place equally safe as where I now was situate, if possible, 
in that pleasant fruitful part of the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond 
of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me ; 
but when I came to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was 
now by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that something 
might happen to my advantage, and by the same ill fate that 
brought me hither might bring some other unhappy wretches to 
the same place; and though it was scarce probable that any such 
thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills 
and woods, in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my bond- 
age, and to render such an affair not only improbable but impos- 
sible; and that, therefore, I ought not by any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much 
of my time there for the whole remaining part of the month of 
July; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not 
to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded 
it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high 
as I could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood; 
and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together.

INCREASE OF CATS. 107 

always going over it with a ladder as before; so that I fancied 
now I had my country house and my sea-coast house. And this 
work took me up to the beginning of August. 

1 had but newly finished my fence and begun to enjoy my 
labour, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my 
first habitation. For though I had made me a tent like the other, 
witii a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the 
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to 
retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my 
bower and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August I found 
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and, indeed, were 
excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down 
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains 
which followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best 
part of my winter food, for I had above two hundred large bunches 
of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most 
of them home to my cave, but it began to rain, and from hence, 
which was tl:e 14th of August, it rained more or less every day 
till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently that I could 
not stir out of my cave for several days. 

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my 
family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, 
who ran away from me, or as I thought had been dead, and I 
keard no more tale or tidings of her till, to my astonishment, she 
came home about the end of August with three kittens I This 
was the more strange to me because, though I had killed a wild 
^ as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite 
<lifferent kind from our European cats; yet the young cats were 
the same kind of house breed like the old one; and both my cats 
heing females, I thought it very strange. But from these three 
^ts I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats that I was 
forced to kill them like vermin or wild beasts, and to drive them 
from my house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th incessant rain, so that I 
^^d not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In 
this confinement I began to be straitened for foodj but venturing

out twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day, which was the 
26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me; and 
my food was regulated thus: — I eat a bunch of raisins for my 
breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh or of the turtle for my dinner 
broiled — for to my great misfortune I had no vessel to boil or 
stew anything — and two or three of the turtle's eggs for my supper. 

_- ^--^^ V^ 




" To my agtonishment the came home with three kittens 1 " 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain I worked daily 
two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked 
it on towards one side till I came to the outside of the hill, and 
made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and 
so I came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at 
lying so open; for as I had managed myself before, I was in & 
perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay exposed and open 
for anything to come in upon me. And yet I could not perceive 
that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature that> 
I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.

versary of my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and 

iound I had been on shore 365 days. I kept this day as a solemn 

last, setting it apart to reHgious exercise, prostrating myself on 

t!be ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins 

to (jod, acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and 

praying to him to have inercy on me through Jesus Christ. And 

kving not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till 

the gouig down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit cake and a bunch 

of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I hegan it 

1 had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first I 
W no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after sometime 
omitted to distinguish the weeks by making a longer notch than 
ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what 
Miyof the days were. But now having cast up the days as above, 
1 found I had been there a year, so I divided it into weeks, and 
set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found at the 
end of my account I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I contented 
myself to use it more sparingly, and to write, down only the most 
remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memo- 
randum of other things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regu- 
^to me; and I learned to divide them, so as to provide for them 
accordingly. But I bought all my experience before I had it; 
and this I am going to relate was one of the most discouraging 
experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned that I had 
saved the few ears of barley and rice which I had so surprisingly 
fonnd springing up, as I thought of themselves, and believe there 
^ereahout thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley. And 
now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains, the sun 
•^ing m its southern position going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with 
^y wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my 
?am; but as I was sowing it casually occurred to my thoughts 
^t I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when 
^as the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the 
^ leaving about a handful of each.

110 THE TIME FOR SOWING. 

It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not 
one grain of that I sowed this time came to an3rthing; for the dry 
months following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was 
sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never c^me u^ 
at all till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if i 
had heen hut newly sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagine 
was by the drought, I sought for a mqister piece of ground 1 
make another trial in; and I dug up a piece of ground near nc 
new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a litfc 
before the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months 
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, a«: 
yielded a very good crop. But having part of the seed left onB 
and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantL 
at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of ea-- 
kind. 

But by this experiment I was made master of my business, ar: 
knew exactly when the proper season was to sow; and that 
might expect two seed-times and two harvests every year. 

While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, whi^ 
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over air 
the weather began to settle, which was about the month of N - 
vember, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where, thoug 
I had not been some months, yet I found all things just as I le:: 
them. The circle, or double hedge, that I had made was not onl 
firm and entire, but the stakes, which I had cut out of some tree 
that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with Ion- 
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first yeai 
after loppirg its head. I could not tell what tree to call it thai 
these stakes were cut from. I was surprised and yet very wel 
pleased to see the yoimg trees grow; and I pruned them, and le* 
them up to grow as much alike as I could; and it is scarce credibl 
how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years. So tha-s 
though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards L 
diameter, yet the trees (for such I might now call them) so(^ 
covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge und^ 
all the dry Reason.

DIVISIONS OF THE SEASONS. Ill 

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me 
a hedge like this in a semicircle romid my wall — I mean that of 
my first dwelling — which I did ; and placing the trees or stakes 
in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, 
they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habita- 
tion, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe 
in its order. 

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be 
<iivided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the

TWO GREAT WANTS. 113 

I carried them to my cave, and here during the next season I em- 
ployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets, 
both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up anything as I had occa- 
sion; and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I 
made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; and thus after- 
wards I took care never to be without them. And as my wicker- 
vare decayed I made more; especially I made strong deep baskets 
to place my com in instead of sacks, when I should come to have 
any quantity of it 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time 
about it, I bestirred myself to see if possible how to 'supply two 
vants. I had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid except 
two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and some glass bottles, 
8ome of the common size, and others which were case-bottles 
square, for the holding of water, spirits, &c. I had not so much 
*s a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I saved out 
of the ship, and which was too big for such use as I designed — 
tamely, to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The 
^cond thing I would fain have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was 
^possible to me to make one; however I found a contrivance for

my powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she- 
goat if I could, which I could better feed on; and though there 
were many goats here — more than on my side the island — yet it 
was with much more difficulty that I could come near them, the 
country being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than 
when I was on the hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than 
mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I

all the while I was here to be as it were upon a journey, and from 
homa However, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards 
the east, I suppose about twelve miles; and then, setting up a 
great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go 
home again, and that the next journey I took should be on the 
other side of the island east from my dwelling, and so round till 
I came to my post again : of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I 
could easily keep all the island so much in my view that I could 
not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country. But 
I found myself mistaken; for being come about two or three miles, 
I found myself descended into a very large valley, but so sur- 
rounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I could 
not see which was my way by any direction but that of the sun, 
nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun at 
that time of the day. 

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved 
hazy for three or four days while I was in this valley; and not 
being able to see the sun, I wandered about very'uncomfortably, 
and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post, 
and come back the same way I went. And then by easy journeys 
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my 
gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon 
it, and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it 
alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I 
could; for I had often been musing whether it might not be pos- 
sible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,

which might supply me when my powder and shot should be all 
spent 

I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string which 
I made of some rope-yam, which I always carried about me, I led 
him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower ; 
and there I enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to 
be at home, from whence I had been absent above a month. 

1 cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into 

my old hutch and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little 

wandering journey, without settled place of abode, had been so 

unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, was 

a perfect settlement to me compared to that; and it rendered 

everything about me so comfortable that I resolved 1 would never 

go a great way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on 

the island. 

1 reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after 
my long journey; during which most of the time was taken up in 
the weighty affair of making a cage for my poll, who began now 
tote a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me. 
Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had penned in 
vithin my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home or 
give it some food. Accordingly I went, and found it where I left 
It; for, indeed, it could not get out, but almost starved for want 
of food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such 
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and having fed it, I tied 
^t as I did before, to lead it away. But it was so tame with being 
hungry that I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like 
a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so 
loving, 80 gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time one 
of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and 
I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as 
"^ore; being the anniversary of my landing on the island, having 
^ow been there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered 
than the first day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble 
^i thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies 
which my solitary condition was attended with, and without which

it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and 
hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me even 
that it was possible I might be more happy in this solitary con- 
dition than I should have been in a liberty of society and in all 
the pleasures of the world; that he could fully make up to me the 
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society, 
by his presence, and the communications of his grace to my soul — 
supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his 
providence here, and hope for his eternal presence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy 
this life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than 
the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my 
days. And now I changed both my sorrows and my joys: my 
very desires altered, my aflfections changed their gusts, and my 
delights were perfectly new from what they were at my first 
coming, or indeed for the two years past. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing 
the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break 
out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me 
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and 
how I was a prisoner locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of 
the ocean, in an uninhabited vrilderness, without redemption. In 
the midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this would 
break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands 
and weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in the middle 
of my work; and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and 
look upon the ground for an hour or two together. And this was 
still worse to me; for if I could burst out into tears or vent 
myself by words it would go oflf, and the grief, having exhausted 
itself, would abata 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts. I 
daily read the Word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to 
my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the 
Bible upon these words, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake 
thee."^ Immediately it occurred that these words were to ma

moment when I was mourning over my condition as one forsaken 
of God and mLan*? " Well, then," said I, " if God does not forsake 
me, of wliat ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though 
the world should all forsake me, seeing on the other hand if I had 
all the world, and should lose the favour and blessing of Grod, 
there would be no comparison in the lossi" 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was 
possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary con- 
dition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any other 
particular state in the world; and with this thought I was going 
to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place* I know not 
what it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought, 
and I durst not speak the words. " How canst thou be such a 
hypocrite," said I, even audibly, " to pretend to be thankful for a 
condition which, however thou mayst endeavour to be contented 
with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered fromi" 
So I stopped there. But though I could not say I thanked God 
for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening 
my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to see the former con- 
dition of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness and repent I 
never opened the Bible or shut it but my very soul within me 
blessed God for directing my friend in England, without any order 
of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me after- 
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year. 
And though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular 
account of my works this year as the first, yet in general it may 
he observed that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly 
divided my time according to the several daily employments that 
were before me — such as, first, my duty to God and the reading 
the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time for thrice 
every day; secondly,' the going abroad with my gun for food, 
wMch generally took me up three hours in every morning when it 
did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and cook- 
ing what I had killed or caught for my supply, — these took up 
great part of the day. Also it is to be considered that the middle 
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the

heat ivas too great to stir out, so that about four hours in the 
evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in; with 
this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and 
working, and went to work in the morning and abroad with my 
gun in the afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added 
the exceeding laboriousness of my work — the many hours which, 
for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did 
took up out of my time. For example, I was full two-and-forty 
days making me a board for a long shelf which I wanted in my 
cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would 
have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this : It was to be a large tree which was to be 
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree I 
was three days a cutting down, and two more cutting oflf the 
boughs, and reducing it to a log or piece of timber. With inex- 
pressible hacking and hewing I reduced both the sides of it into 
chips till it begun to be light enough to move; then I turned it, 
and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to 
end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other side, till I 
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on 
both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a 
piece of work; but labour and patience carried me through that 
and many other things. I only observe this in particular, to show 
the reason why so much of my time went away with so little 
work — ^namely, that what might be a little to be done with help 
and tools, was a vast labour and required a prodigious time to do 
alone and by hand. 

But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went 
through many things; and, indeed, everything that my circum- 
stances made necessary to me to do, as will appear by what follows. 
I was now — in the months of November and December — expect- 
ing my crop of barely and rice. The ground I had manured or 
dug up for them was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of 
each was not above the quantity of half a peck, for I had lost one 
whole crop by sowing in the dry season. But now my crop 
promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger of

HIS CROP THREATENED. 121 

it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce 

le to keep from it : as, first, the goats, and wild creatures 

vr\uch I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay 

in it night and day as soon as it came up, and ate it so close that 

it could get no time to shoot up into stalk. This I saw no remedy 

ior but by making an enclosure about it with a hedge; which I did 

vitli a great deal of toil, and the more because it required speed 

However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I 

got it totally well fenced in about three weeks' time; and shooting 

some of the creatures in the day-time, I set my dog to guard it in 

the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would 

and bark all night long. So in a little time the enemies 

the place, and the com grew very strong and well, and 

began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before while my com was in the

the ear; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw 
Diy Kttle crop surrounded with fowls of I know not how many 
sorts, who stood as it were watching till I should be gone. I 
UDmediately let fly among them, for I always had my gun with 
n^e. I had no sooner shot but there rose up a little cloud of fowls 
—which I had not seen at all — from among the com itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they 
would devour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never 
he able to raise a crop at all : and what to do I could not telL 
However, I resolved not to lose my com, if possible, though I

the loss was not so great but that the remainder was like to be a

I stayed by it to load my gun; and then coming away I could

came on, knowing that every grain that they ate now was, as it

what I wished for : so I took them up, and served them as we 
serve notorious thieves in England — namely, hanged them in 
chains for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost

that this should have such an effect as it had; for the fowls would 
not only not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that 
part of the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as 
long as my scarecrows hung there. 

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the latter 
end of December, which was our second harvest of the year, I 
reaped my crop. I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to 
cut it down; and all I could do was to make one as well as I 
could out of one of the broad swords or cutlasses which I saved 
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop was

WORKING FOR BREAD. 123 

but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down. In short, I 

reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried 

it away in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out 

with my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting I found that 

out of my half-peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice and 

above two bushels and a half of barley — that is to say, by my guess, 

ioT I had no measure at that time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw 
tkt in time it would please God to supply me with bread And 
yet here I was perplexed again : for I neither knew how to grind 
or make meal of my corn, or, indeed, how to clean it and part it; 
i^or, if made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how to 
make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things being 
added to my desire of having a good quantity of store, and to 
secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this 
crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and 
in the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working to 
accomplish this great work of providing myself with com and 



It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. It is 
a Kttle wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought 
niuch upon — namely, the strange multitude of little things neces- 
sary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and 
tolling this one article of bread. I that was reduced to a mere 
state of nature found this to my daily discouragement, and was 
Diade Inore and more sensible of it every hour, even after I had 
got the first handful of seed-corn; which, as I have said, came up 
^expectedly, and indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth, no spade or shovel 
^ dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as 
I observed before. But this did my work in but a wooden 
inanner; and though it cost me a great many days to make it, yet 
for want of iron it not only wore out the sooner, but made my 
^ork the harder, and made it be performed much wor& How-

124 INCREASE OF GRAIN. 

and drag a groat heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it 
may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. 

When it was growing and grown, I have observed already, how 
many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure 
and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it. 
Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt 
to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and yet all these 
things I did without, as shall be observed; and yet the com was 
an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too. All this, as I 
said, made everything laborious and tedious to me, but that there 
was no help for, neither was my time so much loss to me, 
because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day 
appointed to these works. And as I resolved to use none of the 
com for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next 
six months to apply myself wholly by labour and invention to 
furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the 
operations necessary for the making the com (when I had it) fit 
for my use. 

But, first, I was to prepare more, land, for I had now seed 
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this I had 
a week's work at least to make me a spade ; which, when it was 
done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required 
double labour to work with it However, I went through that^ 
and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground as near my 
house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with 
a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that wood which 
I had set before, and knew it would grow; so that in one year's 
time I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would 
want but little repair. This work was not so little as to take me 
up less than three months, because great part of that time was of 
the wet season, when I could not go abroad. 

Within doors — that is, when it rained, and I could not go out 
— I found employment on the following occasions, always observ- 
ing that all the while I was at work I diverted myself with talking 
to my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learned 
him to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty 
loud — Poll, which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the

126 EFFORTS AT POT-MAKING. 

I resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand 
like jars to hold what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to 
tell how many awkward ways 1 took to raise this paste ; what odd, 
misshapen, ugly things I made; how many of them fell in, and 
how many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own 
weight; how many cracked' by the over-violent heat of the sun, 
being set out too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only 
removing as well before as after they were dried; and, in a word, 
how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, tc 
temper it, to bring it home and work it, I could not make above 
two large earthen ugly things — I cannot call them jars — in abou^ 
two months' labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I 
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two grea^ 
wicker baskets which I had made on purpose for them, that the^ 
might not break; and as between the pot and the basket ther- 
was a little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barle3 
straw. And these two pots being to stand always dry, I though' 
would hold my dry com, and perhaps the meal, when the corr 
was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, ye^ 
I made several smaller things with better success — such as little 
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my 
hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely 
hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an 
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none 
of these could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty 
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after I 
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen- 
ware vessels in the fire burned as hard as a 43tone, and red as a 
tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself that 
certainly they might be made to bum whole if they would bum 
broken. 

This set me to studying how to order my fire, so as to make it 
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters

could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the 
running of the sand. 

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of 
earthenware for my use; but I must needs say, as to the shapes 
of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, 
when I had no way of making them but as the children make 
dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that never learned to 
raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine 
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; 
and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set 
one upon the fire again with some water in it to boil me some 
meat, which it did admirably well. And with a piece of a kid I 
made some very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and several 
other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would have had 
it been. 

My next concern was, to get me a stone mortar to stamp or 
beat some com in; for as to the mill, there was no thought at> 
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To 
supply this want I was at a great loss; for of all trades in the 
world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any" 
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent 
many a day to find out a great stone big enough ta cut hollow, 
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what 
was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; 
nor, indeed, were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, 
but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would 
bear the weight of a heavy pestle, or would break the com without 
filling it with sand. So after a great deal of time lost in searching 
for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great 
block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting 
one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it ia. 
the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of 
fire and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians

pared and laid by against I had my next crop of com, when X

proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my com into meal 
to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress my 

meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I 

did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most 

difficult thing so much as but to think on; for to be sure I had 

nothing like the necessary thing to make it — I mean fine thin 

canvas, or stuff to search the meal through. And here I was at 

a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do. 

linen I had none left, but what was mere rags. I had goats' hair, 

but neither knew I how to weave it or spin it; and had I known 

bow, here were no tools to Work it witL All the remedy that I 

found for this was, that at last I did remember I had among the 

seamen's clothes which were saved out of the ship some neckcloths 

of calico or muslin; and with some pieces of these I made three 

small sieves, but proper enough for the work. And thus I made 

sliift for some years. How I did afterwards I shall show in its 

place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how 
I should make bread when I came to have com; for, first, I had 
DO yeast As to that part, as there was no supplying the want, 
so I did not concern myself much about it; but for an oven I was 
indeed in great pain. At length I found out an experiment for 
that also, which was this — I made some earthen vessels very broad, 
hut not deep; that is to say, about two foot diameter, and not 
ahove nme inches deep, these I burned in the fire, as I had done 
the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made 
* great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square 
fc of my own making and burning also — but I should not call 
them square. 

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or 
five coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it

then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves,

husbandry to manage; for I reaped my com in its season, anc 
carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear in mj 
large baskets till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor ti 
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now indeed my stock of com increasing, I really wanted t 
build my bams bigger. I wanted a place to lay it up in, for tb 
increase of the corn now yielded me so much that I had of tk 
barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much or moir 
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it freely, for nc 
bread had been quite gone a great while. Also I resolved to ai 
what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to so 
but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley aii< 
rice was much more than I could consume in a year, so I resolvec 
to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed the last^ in 
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread, &c 

All the while these things were doing you may be sure my 
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had 
seen from the other side of the island; and I was not without 
secret wishes that I were on shore there, fancjdng the seeing the 
mainland, and in an inhabited country I might find some way or 
other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some 
means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such 
a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and 
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the 
lions and tigers of Africa. That if I once came into their power^ 
I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being killed, 
and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the people of tb®

VISITS THE ship's BOAT. 131 

Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or man-eaters; and I knew by 

tbe latitude that I could not be far off from that shore: that 

suppose they were not cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as 

many Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, 

even when they had been ten or twenty together, much more I 

t^atwas but one, and could make little or no defence; all these 

tinugs, I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and did 



" I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat." 

^ up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my appre- 
iensions at first; but my head ran mi'ghtily upon the thought of 
getting over to the shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury and the long-boat with the 
Aoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles 
on the coast of Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I 
^ould go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was 
Mown up upon the shore a great way in the storm when we were 
first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not 
^^ite; and was turned by the force of the waves and the winds 
*^ost bottom upward against a high ridge of beachy rough sand, 
^ut no water about her as before.

182 THS CANOE OR PERIAGUA. 

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched 
her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I 
might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough; 
but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set 
her upright upon her bottom than I could remove the island. 
However, I went to the woods and cut levers and rollers, and 
brought them to the boat, resolved to try what I could do, sug- 
gesting to myself that if I could but turn her down, I might easily 
repair the damage she had received, and she would be a very good 
boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. 

I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, 
I think, three or four weeks about it. At last, finding it impossible 
to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the 
sand to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces 
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall 

But when I had done this I was unable to stir it up again or 
to get under it, much less to move it forward towards the water, 
so I was forced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the 
hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased 
rather than decreased as the means for it seemed impossible. 

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible 
to make myself a canoe, or periagua,^ such as the natives of those 
climates make, even without tools, or, as I might say, without 
hands — namely, of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only 
thought possible but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the 
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more convenience 
for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at aU con- 
sidering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than 
the Indians did — ^namely, want of hands to move it, when it was 
made, into the water, a difficulty much harder for me to surmount 
than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them. For 
what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree in th© 
woods, I might with much trouble cut it down, if after I might bo 
able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the propeir 
shape of a boat, and bum or cut out the inside to make it hollow^ 
so to make a boat of it, — if, after all this, I must leave it jus'O

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflec- 
tion upon my mind of my circumstance, while I was making this 
boat, but I should haye immediately thought how I should get it 
into the sea. But my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage 
over the sea in it, that I never once considered how I should get

into my head, but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by

warrant I'll find some way or other to get it along when 'tis done."

134 THE BOAT FINISHED. 

question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the build- 
ing of the temple at Jerusalem 1 It was five feet ten inches 
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven 
inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it 
lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was not 
without infinite labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty days 
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom. I was fourteen more 
getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head of it 
cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet, 
and inexpressible labour. After this it cost me a month to shape 
it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of 
a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me 
near three months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as 
to make an exact boat of it. This I did indeed without fire, by 
mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had 
brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to 
have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to 
have carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted 
with it The boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a canoe 
or periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary 
stroke it had cost, j'^ou may be sure, and there remained nothing 
but to get it into the water; and had I gotten it into the water, I 
make no question but I should have begun the maddest voyage, 
and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken* 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though, 
they cost me infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred yard* 
from the water, and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it> 
was up-hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this discourage- 
ment, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so mak^ 
a declivity. This I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of 
pains; — but who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view^ 
But when this was worked through, and this difl&culty managed, 
it was still much at one; for I could no more stir the canoe than I 
could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut ^ 
dock or canal to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I coultl

not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work, 
and when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was 
to be dug, how broad, how the stuJBF to be thrown out, I found, 
that by the number of hands I had, being none but my own, it 
must have been ten or twelve years before I should have gone 
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper end 
it must have been at least twenty foot deep. So at length, though 
with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the 
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we 
judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it 

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this 
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with 
as much comfort as ever before; for by a constant study and serious 
application of the Word of God, and by the assistance of his grace, 
I gained a different knowledge from what I had before. I enter- 
tained different notions of things. I looked now upon the world 
as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expectation 
irom, and indeed no desires about : in a word, I had nothing indeed 
to do with it, nor was ever like to have. So I thought it looked 
as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter — namely, as a place I 
liad lived in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as 
Father Abraham to Dives, " Between me and thee is a great gulf 
fixed." 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the 
vorld here; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, 
nor the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I 
^as now capable of enjoying. I was lord of the whole manor; or, 
^ I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole 
country which I had possession of. There were no rivals ; I had 
110 competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command with me. 
^niight have raised ship-loadings of com, but I had no use for it; 
80 1 let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had 
tortoise or turtles enough; but now and then one was as much as 
I could put to any use. I had timber enough to have built a fleet 
of ships. I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured 
Uito raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been built.

USELESS stuff! 



ly^^\ ^ 



But all I could make use of was all that waa valuable. I had 
enough to eat and to supply my wants, and what was all the rest 
to me? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat 
it, or the vermin. If I sowed more com than I could eat, it must 

be spoiled. The trees that 
I cut down were lying to 
rot on the ground; I could 
make no more use of them 
than for fuel, and that I had 
no occasion for but to dress 
my food. 

In a word, the nature and 
experience of things dictated 
to me, upon just reflection, 
that all the good things of 
this world are no further 
good to us than they are for 
our use; and that whatever 
we may heap up indeed to 
give others, we enjoy just 
as much as we can use, and 
no more. The most covet- 
ous griping miser in the 
world would have been cured 
of the vice of covetousness 
if he had been in my case, 
for I possessed infinitely 
more than I knew what to 
do with I had no room for 
desire, except it was of things 
which I had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed of great 
use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well 
gold as silver, about thirty-six poimds sterling. Alas ! there the 
nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of business for it; 
and I often thought with myself that I would have given a handful 
of it for a gross of tobacco pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my 
corn; nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of turnip 



"There the nasty, iorry, uselesa stuff lay."

WISE REFLECTIONS. 137 

and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of pease and beans 
and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by 
it or benefit from it, but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy 
with the damp of the cave in the wet season; and if I had had the 
drawer full of diamonds it had been the same case, and they had 
been of no manner of value to me, because of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself 

than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my 

body. I frequently sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and 

admired the hand of God's providence, which had thus spread my 

table in the wilderness. I learned to look more upon the bright 

side of my condition and less upon the dark side, and to consider 

what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted; and this gave me 

sometimes such secret comforts that I cannot express them, and 

which I take notice of here to put those discontented people in 

mind of it who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them 

because they see and covet something that he has not given them. 

All our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring 

irom the want of thankfulness for what we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would 
be 80 to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was, 
and this was, to compare my present condition with what I at first 
expected it should be, nay, with what it would certainly have been 
i^the good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship 
^ be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only could come at 
W, but could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my 
^lief and comfort; without which I had wanted for tools to 
^ork, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and shot for getting 
niyfood 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to 
Diyself in the most lively colours how I must have acted if I had 
got nothing out of the ship ; how I could not have so much as got 
^7 food except fish and turtles, and that as it was long before I 
i any of them, I must have perished first : that I should have 
if I had not perished, like a mere savage; that if I had

cut it up, but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my 
claws like a beast. 

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Pro- 
vidence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with 
all its hardships and misfortunes. And this part also I cannot 
but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt in their 
misery to say, "Is any affliction like mine?" Let them consider 
how much worse the cases of some people are, and their case 
have been if Providence had thought fit. 

I had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort my 
mind with hopes, and this was, comparing my present condition 
with what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from 
the hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly des- 
titute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had been well in- 
structed by father and mother, neither had they been wanting to 
me, in their early endeavours, to infuse a religious awe of God into 
my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the nature and end of 
my being required of me. But, alas I falling early into the sea- 
faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute of the fear 
of God, though his terrors are always before them; I say, falling 
early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that 
little sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of 
me by my messmates, by a hardened despising of dangers and the 
views of death, which grew habitual to me, by my long absence 
from all manner of opportunities to converse with anything but 
what was like myself, or to hear anything that was good, or tended 
towards it. 

So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least sense 
of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances I en- 
joyed — such as my escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the 
Portuguese master of the ship, my being planted so well in the 
Brazils, my receiving the cargo from England, and the like — I 
never had once the word " Thank God " so much as on my mind, 
or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much as a 
thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, " Lord, have mercy 
upon me;" no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to 
swear by and blaspheme it.

RESIGNATION TO GOD. 139 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I 
have already observed, on the accoxmt of my wicked and hardened 
life past; and when I looked about me, and considered what par- 
ticular providences had attended me since my coming into this 
place, and how God had dealt bountifully with me — had not only 
punished me less than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plenti- 
fully provided for me; this gave me great hopes that my repentance 
was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for me. 

With these reflections I worked my mind up not only to resig- 
nation to the will of God in the present disposition of my circum- 
stances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and 
that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I 
had not the due punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many 
mercies which I had no reason to have expected in that place; that 
I ought never more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and 
to give daily thanks for that daily bread which nothing but a 
crowd of wonders could have brought: that I ought to consider I 
had been fed even by miracle, even as great as that of feeding 
Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles: and that I 
could hardly have named a place in the unhabitable part of the 
vorld where .1 could have been cast more to my advantage — a 
place where, as I had no society, which was my affliction on one 
liand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, 
to threaten my life, no venomous creatures or poisonous, which I 
might feed on to my hurt, no savages to murder and devour me. 

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a 
life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of 
comfort but to be able to make my sense of God's goodness to me 
and care over me in this condition be my daily consolation. And 
after I did make a just improvement of these things, I went away 
and was no more sad. 

I had now been here so long that many things which I brought 
OD shore for my help were either quite gone or very much wasted 
and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but a 
very little, which I eked out with water a little and a little till it 
^as so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.

140 FATAL OR FORTUNATE DAYS. 

As long as it lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of 
the month on which any remarkable thing happened to me, and 
first by casting up times past. I remember that there was a 
strange concurrence of days in the various providences which befel 
me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe 
days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have looked 
upon with a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from 
my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go 
to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of- 
war, and made a slave. 

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of 
that ship in Yarmouth Eoads, that same day-year afterwards I 
made my escape from Sallee in the boat. 

The same day of the year I was bom on — ^namely the 30th of 
September — the same day I had my life so miraculously saved 
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore on this island, so 
that my wicked life and my solitary Ufe began both on a day. 

The next thing to my ink's being wasted was that of my bread 
— I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship. This I had 
husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of 
bread a day for above a year, and yet I was quite without bread 
for near a year before I got any com of my own; and great reason 
I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, 
as has been already observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes began to decay too mightily. As to linen, I had had 
none a good while, except some checkered shirts which I found 
in the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, 
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt: 
and it was a very great help to me that I had among all the men's 
clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts. There were also 
several thick watch-coats of the seamen's, which were left indeed, 
but they were too hot to wear. And though it is trae that the 
weather was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet 
I could not go quite naked : no, though I had been inclined to it, 
which I was not, nor could not abide the thoughts of it, though 
I was all alone.

CRUSOE'S CLOTfflNG. 141 

The reason why I could not go quite naked was, I could not 
bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some 
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin, where- 
as, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling 
under that shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more 
could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sim without 
a cap or a hat, the heat of the sun beating with such violence as 
it does in that place would give me the headache presently, by 
darting so directly on my head without a cap or hat on, so that I 
could not bear it, whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently 
go away. 

Upon those views I began to consider about putting the few 

rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn 

out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I 

could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had 

by me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set to work 

a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching, for I made most piteous 

work of it. However I made shift to make two or three new 

waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while. As for 

breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed till 

afterward. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures 
that I killed — I mean four-footed ones — and I had hung them up 
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them 
vere so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others it 
seems were very useful. The first thing I made of these was a 
great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off 
^6 ram; and this I performed so well, that after this I made me 
a suit of clothes wholly of these skins — that is to say, a waistcoat, 
wd breeches open at knees, and both loose, for they were rather 
vantmg to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not 
OBait to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was 
* W carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, they were such

Opened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being outer- 
most I was kept very dry. 
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me

an umbrella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great 
mind to make one. I had seen them made in the Brazils, where 
they are very useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt 
the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the

most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took 
a world of pains at it, and was a great while before I could make 
anything likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I 
spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind, but at last I 
made one that answered indifferently well The main difficulty I 
found was to make it to let down. I could make it to spread, 
but if it did not let down too and draw in, it was not portable for 
me any way but just over my head, which would not do. How-

ir, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered it with 

ns, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rains Hke a pent- 

luse, and kept off the sun so effectually that I could walk out in 

le hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could 

(ftiore in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, could close it 

Hid carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely com- 

^aed by resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly 

upon the disposal of his providence. This made my life better 

tliaa sociable; for when I began to regret the want of conversation 

1 would ask myself whether thus conversing mutually with my 

own thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, with even God himself 

V ejaculations, was not better than the utmost enjoyment of 

hman society in the world. 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary 
tiling happened to me, but I Hved on in the same course, in the 
8aine posture and place, just as before. The chief things I was 
employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and 
rice and curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just 
enough to have sufl&cient stock of one year's provisions beforehand; 
I say, besides this yearly labour and my daily labour of going out 
^ith my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe, which at last 
I finished; so that, by digging a canal to it of six feet wide and 
four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. 
As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it without 
considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be able 
to launch it, so never being able to bring it to the water, or bring 
tke water to it, I was obHged to let it He where it was, as a me- 
inorandum to teach me to be wiser next time. Indeed, the next 
*iae, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and in a place 
^here I could not get the water to it, at any less distance than as 
liave said, near half a mile; yet, as I saw it was practicable at 
last, I never gave it over: and though I was near two years about 
i^ yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go 
of to sea at last. 

However, though my httle periagua was finished, yet the size 
of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view

when I made the first — I mean, of venturing over to the terra 
firmaf where it was above forty miles broad. Accordingly, the 
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and 
now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat, my next 
design was to make a tour round the island; for as I had been 
on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already 
described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that 
little journey made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; 
and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the 
island. 

For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion 
and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and made 
a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sail, which lay 
in store, and of which I had a great stock by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she 
would sail very well. Then I made little lockers, or boxes, at 
either end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammu- 
nition, &c., into, to be kept dry either from rain or the spray of 
the sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of the 
boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over 
it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to 
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me like an 
awning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon 
the sea, but never went far out, not far from the little creek. 
But at last, being eager to view the circumference of my little 
kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly I victualled 
my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes 
I should rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of 
parched rice — a food I ate a great deal of — a little bottle of rum, 
half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two large 
watch-coats of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved 
out of the seamen's chests : these I took, one to lie upon, and the 
other to cover me in the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or 
my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and 
I found it much longer than I expected. For though the island

14:6 A DANGEROUS CURRENT. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood,. I perceived 
a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, 
and even came close to the point. And I took the more notice 
of it, because I saw there might be some danger that when I came 
into it I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not 
be able to make the island again. And, indeed, had I not gotten 
first up upon this hill, I believe it would have been so; for there 
was the same culrent on the other side the island, only that it set 
off at a farther distance. And I saw there was a strong eddy under 
the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first 
current, and I should presently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty 
fresh at east-south-east, and that being just contrary to the said 
current, made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so that 
it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, 
nor to go too far off because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over- 
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured. But I am a warning 
piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I 
come to the point, when even I was not my boat's length from the 
shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current 
like the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with it with 
such violence that all I could do could not keep her so much as 
on the edge of it; but I foimd it hurried me farther and farther 
out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. There was no 
wind stirring to help me; and all I could do with my paddlers 
signified nothing. And now I began to give myself over for lost; 
for as the current was on both sides the island, I knew in a few 
leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably 
gone. Nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had 
no prospect before me but of perishing — not by the sea, for that 
was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I had, indeed, 
found a tortoise on the shore as big almost as I could lift, and 
had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water 
— that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this 
to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no 
shore, no mainland or island for a thousand leagues at least!

CRUSOE'S DESPAIR. 147 

And now T saw how easy it was for the providence of God to 
make the most miserable condition mankind could be in, worse. 
Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary island as the most 
pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my heart could 
wish for was to be but there again. I stretched out my hands to 
it with eager wishes. " happy desert," said I, " I shall never

and how I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what 
vould I give to be on shore there again ! Thus we nevei: see the 
true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its con- 
traries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want 
0^ it. It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now 
in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me 
now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the 
ntmost despair of ever recovering it again. However, I worked

148 A JOYFUL SURPRISE. 

current which the feddy lay on — as pdssibly I cotild; when About 
noon, as the sun passed the meridiAti, I thbught I felt a little 
breeze bf wind in my face, sbringing tip frbm the feouth-south-easi 
This cheered tny heart a little, and especially wheti in about 
half dn hour more it blew a pretty small getitle gale. By this 
time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the island, and 
had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I had been 
undone another way too; for I had no compass on board, and 
should never have known how to have steered towards the island, 
if I had but once lost sight of it. But the weather continuing 
clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my 
sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of 
the current. 

Just as I had set my mast And sail, and the boat began to 
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water some 
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was so 
strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found 
the current abate, and presently I found to the east, at about half 
a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks. These rocks, I found, 
caused the current to part again, and as the main stress of it ran 
away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the 
other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong 
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very sharp 
stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them 
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just goitig to 
murder them, or who have been in such like extremities^ mAy 
guess what my present sUrprise bf joy was, and how gladly t })ut 
my boat into the stream of this eddy, and, the trind Also freshetiing, 
how gladly I sptead my sail to it, tninnitig cheerfully before the 
wind, and with A strong tide or eddy uilder fbot. 

This eddy carried me about d league in liiy x^ay bact again 
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more to the 
northward than the current which catried me away at fil^st; so 
that when I came near the island, I found myself open to the 
northern shore of it — that is to say, the other end bf the island 
opposite to that which I went out from.

REACUES THE ISIAND. 149 

Wbeu I had made soi^ething more tbai^ a league of way by the 
help of this current or e(i(Jy, I found it ^^s spent, 4pd served mq 
no fartjier. However, I found that being betweei^ the t^o great 
currents, nan^ply, that on the south side, which had hurried me 
away, and that on the north, which lay ^bout a leagifp on the 
other side : I say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I 
found the w^ter at least still and running no way; and having still 
a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the 
isl^di though nqt making such fresh way as I did before. 

About f oui" p'clock in the evening, being then within about a 
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occa- 
sioned this disaster stretching out, as is described before, to the 
southward, and casting off the current more southwardly bad of 
course made another eddy to the north; and this I found very 
strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was 
due west, but Jilpaost full north. However, having a fresji gale, I 
stretched across this eddy slanting north-west, and in about an 
hour cap^e within about a mile of the shore, where, it being 
smooth \yater, I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees and gave God thanks 
for ray deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my 
deliverance by n^y boat; and refreshing myself with such things 
as I h^d, I brought my boat close to the shore in a little cove 
that I had spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, 
being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat. 
I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the case, to think 
of attempting it by the way I went out; and what might be at 
the other side (I inean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any 
°ihid to run any niore ventures ; so I only resolyed in the morning 
to make my way westward along the shore, and to see if there 
^as no creek where J might lay up my f^-igate in safety, so as to 
have her again if I wanted her. In about three mile, or thereabout, 
coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay about a 
^e over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or 
hrook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and 
vhere she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose

154 HIS THREE KIDS. 

carried him some water to drink, and then a little com, he would 
have been as tame as one of the kids — for they are mighty saga- 
cious, tractable creatures where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at 
that tima Then I went to the three kids; and taking them one 
by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some difficulty 
brought them all homa 

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them 
some sweet com, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. 
And now I found that if I expected to supply myself with goat- 
flesh when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame 
was my only way; when, perhaps, I might have them about my 
house like a flock of sheep. 

But then it presently occurred to me that I must keep the tame 
from the wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew 
up. And the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece 
of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in 
so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those 
without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands. Yet, as I 
saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first piece of 
work was to find out a proper piece of ground — namely, where 
there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to 
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very 
little contrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for 
all these, being a plain open piece of meadow-land or savanna (as 
our people call it in the westem colonies), which had two or three 
little rills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody. I 
say they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I began 
my enclosing of this piece of ground in such a manner that my 
hedge or pale must have been at least two mile about I Nor was 
the madness of it so gi*eat as to the compass, for if it was ten mile 
about, I was like to have time enough to do it in. But I did not 
consider that my goats would be as wild in so much compass as if 
they had had the whole island, and I should have so much room 
to chase them in that I should never catch them.

GOATS FLESH AND MILK. 155 

My hedge 'was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards, 
when this thought occurred to me. So I presently stopped short, 
and for the first beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about 
one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in 
breadth; which, as it would maintain as many as I should have in 
any reasonable time, so, as my flock increased, I could add more 
ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with 
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece; 
and till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part of 
it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make them 
familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some ears 
of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; 
so that, after my enclosure was finished and I let them loose, 
they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a hand- 
ful of com. 

This answered my end And in about a year and half I had a 
flock of about twelve goats — kids and all; and in two years more, 
I had three-and-forty — besides several that I took and killed for 
my food And after that I enclosed five several pieces of ground 
to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take them 
as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of groimd iYito another. 

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed 
on when I pleased, but milk too — a thing which, indeed, in my 
beginning, I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came 
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise. For now I 
set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in 
a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to every 
creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it; so I that 
bad never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese 
made, very readily and handily, though after a great many essays 

and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last, and 

never wanted it afterwards. 
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures, even 

in those conditions in which they seem to be overwhelmed in 

destruction ! How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and 

give us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons 1 What a

Crusoe's sketch. 157 

But these were Hot the two cats which I brought on shore at 
first— for they were both of them dead, and had been interred 
near my habitation by my own hand; but one of them having 
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two 
which I had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, 
and became indeed troublesome to me at last — for they would 
often cotne itito nay house, and plunder me too, till at last I was 
obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many. At length they 
left me with this attendance, and in this plentiful manner I lived. 
Neither feould I be said to want anything but Society; and of that, 
in some time after this, I was like to have too much. 

I was something impatientj as I have observed, to have the use 
df my boat — ^though very loath to run any more hazards; and 
therefote sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the 
islandj and at other times I sat tnyself down contented enough 
without her. fittt I had a strangfe unfeasiness iu my mind to go 
down to the point of the island where, as I have Said, in tny last 
ramblfej I went up the hill to see how the shore lay and how the 
curteht Set, that I might see what I had to do. This inclination 
increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to travel 
thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so. But 
had any One in England been to meet such a man as I was, it 
must either have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laughter. 
And as I fretjuently stood still to look at myself, I could not but 
smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with such 
an equipage ahd in such a dress. Bfe pleased to take a sketch of 
my figure as follows. 

I had a great high shapeless cdp, made of a goat's skin, with a 
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to 
shoot the rain off from running into my neck — nothing being so 
hurtftd in these climates as the rain upon the flesh imder the 
clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat-skin, the skirts coming down to 
about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of open -kneed breeches 
of the same — the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, 
whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that like 
pantaloons it reached to the middle of my legs; stockings and shoes

158 crusoeVs moustaches. 

I had none, but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know 
what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs and lace on 
either side like spatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape — ^as 
indeed were all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat-skin dried, which I drew together 
with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles, and in a kind of 
a frog ^ on either side of this. Instead of a sword and a dagger 
hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the other. 
I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, 
which hung over my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left 
arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too — in one of 
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I 
carried my basket; on my shoulder my gun; and over my head a 
great clumsy, ugly goat-skin umbrella — but which, after all, was 
the most necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As 
for my face, the colour of it was really not so Mulatto-like as one 
might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within 
nineteen degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered 
to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had 
both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except 
what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large 
pair of Mohammedan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some 
Turks whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such, 
though the Turks did. Of these moustaches or whiskers I will 
not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them; but 
they were of a length and shape monstrous enough, and such as 
in England would have passed for frightful 

But all this is by-the-by. For as to my figure, I had so few to 
observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say 
no more to that part. In this kind of figure I went my new 
journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along the 
sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my boat to 
an anchor to get up upon the rocks; and having no boat now to 
take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the same height

WATCHES THE CURRENT. 159 

that I was upon before; when looking forward to the point of the 

rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my 

boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth 

and quiet — no rippling, no motion, no current any more there 

llian in other places. 

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend 

some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of 

the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it 

¥88— namely, that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and 

ioining with the current of waters from some great river on the 

shore, must be the occasion of this current ; and that according as 

the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the north, 

this current came near, or went farther from the shore. For 

waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again; and 

then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again 

as before, only that it ran farther off, being near half a league 

from the shore; whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, 

and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at another 

time it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to 
observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very 
easily bring my boat about the island again But when I began 
to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my 
spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I 
could not think of it again with any patience. But on the con- 
trary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe, though 
more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or rather make 
me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side of the 
ishmd, and one for the other. 

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two 
plantations in the island : one my little fortification or tent, with 
the wall about it under the rock, with the cave behind me, which 
l>y this time I had enlarged into several apartments, or caves, one 
^thin another. One of these, which was the driest and largest, 
*^d had a door out beyond my wall or fortification — that is to say 
^yond where my wall joined to the rock — was all filled up with 
the large earthen pots of which I have given an account, and with

fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five of six 
bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provision, especially my 
com, some in the ear cut off short from the straw, and the other 
rubbed out with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes of piles, those 
piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and 
spread so very much, that therfe Was not the least aj)pearance to 
any one's view of ahy habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine^ but a little farther within the land, 
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces Of corn-ground, which I 
kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their 
harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for more com, 
I had more land adjoining as fit as that 

Besides this I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable 
plantation there also ; for first, I had my little boWel*, as I called 
it, which I kept in repait— r^that is to say, I kept the hedge which 
circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder 
standing always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first 
were no more than my stakes, but were now groWn very firm and 
tall — I kept them always so cut that they might spread and grow 
thick and wild, and make the more agt-eeable shade, which they 
did effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent 
always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles set up 
for that purpose, and which tletiEjr wanted atiy repair or renewing; 
and under this I had made me a squAb or cotlch. With the skins 
of the creatures I had killed, and with othet soft things, and a 
blanket laid on them; such as belofaged to our sea-bedding, which 
I had saved, and a great wAtfch-coat to cdvet me; and here, when- 
ever I had occasion to be absent from my chief s6at, I took up my 
country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to 
say, my goats; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains 
to fence and enclose this ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept 
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off 
till with infinite labour I had stuck the outside of the hedge so 
full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather 
a pale than a hfedge, and there Wsts scarce room to put a hand

through between them; which, afterwards, when those stakes grew, 
as they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure strong 
like a wall; indeed, stronger than any wall 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared 
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my com- 
fortable support; for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame 
creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, 
milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if 
it were to be forty years; and that keeping them in my reach 
depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a 
degree that I might be sure of keeping them together; which by 
this method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that when these Uttle 
stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick I was 
forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place, also, I had my grapes growing, which I princi- 
pally depended on for my winter store of raisins; and which I 
never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agree- 
able dainty of my whole diet; and, indeed, they were not agree- 
able only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to 
the last degree. 

As this was also about half way between my other habitation 
and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and 
lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently to visit my 
boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to her in very good 
order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself ; but no 
more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a 
stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of 
being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents, or 
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene 
of my hf e. 

It happened one day about noon, going towards my boat, I was 
exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the 
shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like 
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, 
I looked round me; I could hear nothing, nor see anything. I 
vent up to a rising ground to look farther. I went up the shore 
and down the shore; but it was all one, I could see no other im-

pression but that one. I went to it again to see if there were any 
more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but there was 
no room for that, for there was exactly the very print of a foot, 
toes, heel, and every part of a foot; — how it came thither I knew 
not, nor could in the least imagine. But after innumerable flutter- 
ing thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I

Crusoe's alarm. 163 

I called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the 
next morning; for never frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to 
earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat 

I slept none that night The further I was from the occasion 
of my fright the greater my apprehensions were, which is some- 
thing contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the 
mxdl practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed 
with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing 
but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was now a great 
way off it Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and 
reason joined in with me upon this supposition. For how should 
any other thing in human shape come into the place ? Where 
was the vessel that brought themi What marks were there of 
any other footsteps? And how was it possible a man should come 
there] But, then, to think that Satan should take human shape 
upon him in such a place, where there could be no manner of 
occasion for it but to leave the print of his foot behind him, and 
that even for no purpose, too, for he could not be sure I should 
see it; this was an amusement^ the other way. I considered that 
the devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have 
terrified me, than this of the single print of a foot; — that, as I lived 
quite on the other side of the island, he would never have been 
80 simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand 
to one whether I should ever see it or not; and in the sand, too, 
which the first surge of the sea upon a high wind would have 
defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing 
itself, and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtilty 
of the devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of 
all apprehensions of its being the devil. And I presently con- 
cluded, then, that it must be some more dangerous creature — 
uamely, that it must be some of the savages of the mainland 
over against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, 
*ud either driven by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made 
the island; and had been on shore, but were gone away again to

sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate 
as I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I wi 
thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be 
abouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by 
they would have concluded that some inhabitants had been 
place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. Then 1 
thoughts racked my imagination about their having found m 
and that there were people here; and that if so, I should ce 
have them come again in greater numbers and devour me; 
it should happen so that they should not find me, yet they 
find my enclosure, destroy all my com, carry away all my i 
tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all that 
confidence in God which was founded upon such wonder 
perience as I had had of his goodness, now vanished, ai 
that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve 
power the provision which he had made for me by his go( 
I reproached myself with my easiness, that would not sc

that was upon the ground; and this I thought so just a r 
that I resolved for the future to have two or three year 
beforehand, so that whatever might come, I might not pei 
want of bread.

and by what secret differing springs are the affections 1 
about, as differing circumstances present ! To-day we lovi 
to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we

DIVINE COMFORT. 165 

f my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from 
eath to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to 
le supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow; — I say, that I 
lould now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, 
id was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent 
)pearance of a man's having set his foot in the island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life. And it afforded me 
great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little 
covered my first surprise. I considered that this was the station 
■ life the infinitely wise and good providence of God had deter- 
ined for me; that as I could not foresee what the ends of divine 
isdom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his sove- 
3ignty, who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted right by 
reation to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit; 
nd who, as I was a creature who had offended him, had likewise 

judicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought fit; 
Jid that it was my part to submit to bear his indignation, because 

had sinned against him. 

I then reflected that God, who was not only righteous but 
>mmpotent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so 
le was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, 
t was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and 
'ntirely to his will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also 
'^ hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates 
^^d directions of his daily providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, 
^eeks and months; and one particular effect of my cogitations on 
'*^8 occasion I cannot omit — namely, one morning early, lying 
^ my bed, and filled with thought about my danger from the 
appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me very much; upon 
'^hich those words of the Scripture came into my thoughts, " Call 
ipon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt 
glorify me.'' 

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not 
^nly comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly 
^0 God for deliverance. When I had done praying I took up my 
^ihle, and opening it to read, the first words that presented to me

166 HE FEELS CHEERED. 

were, "Wait on the Lord and be of good cheer, and he shall 
strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible 
to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully 
laid down the book, and was no more sad — at least, not on that 
occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflec- 
tions, it came into my thought one day that all this might be a 
mere chimera of my own; and that this foot might be the print 
of my own foot when I came on shore from my boat This 
cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade myself it 
was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot; 
and why might not I come that way from the boat as well as I 
was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also that I 
could by no means tell for certain where I had trod and where I 
had not; and that if at last this was only the print of my own 
foot, I had played the part of those fools who strive to make 
stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are frighted at them 
more than anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again; for I 
had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that 
I began to starve for provision; for I had little or nothing within 
doors but some barley cakes and water. Then I knew that my 
goats wanted to be milked, too, which usually was my evening 
diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain and incon- 
venience for want of it: and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of 
them, and almost dried up their milk. 

Heartening myself therefore with the belief that this was noth- 
ing but the print of one of my own feet, and so I might be truly 
said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and 
went to my country house to milk my flock; but to see with what 
fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was 
ready every now and then to lay down my basket and run for my 
life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted 
with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly 
frighted, and so indeed I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having 
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was

realJj nothing in it but my own imagination. But I could not 
persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the shore

see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured 
it was my own foot. But when I came to the place. First, It ap-

Dew imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the highest 
degree; so that I shook with cold like one in an ague. And I

168 THE FEAR OF DANGER. 

Oh, what ridiculous resolution men take when possessed 
fear I It deprives them of the use of those means which re 
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself wj 
throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild 
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and then freq 
the island in prospect of the same or the like booty; then tc 
simple thing of digging up my two corn-fields, that they n 
not find such a grain there, and still be prompted to frequeni 
island; then to demolish my bower and tent, that they mighl 
see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look far 
in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night's cogitation, afi 
was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so < 
run my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vap< 
as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more tei 
ing than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we fine 
burden of anxiety greater by much than the evil which w€ 
anxious about; and, which was worse than all this, 1 had not 
relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to practise t] 
hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who compla 
not only that the Philistines were upon him, but that God 
forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways to compose 
mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upor 
providence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliven 
which if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully suppc 
under his new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with : 
resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night; 
in the morning I fell asleep, and having by the amusement o; 
mind been as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept 
soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever 
before; and now I began to think sedately. And upon the ut 
debate with myself, I concluded, That this island, which wi 
exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the mail 
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I c 
imagine. That although there were no stated inhabitants 
lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come ]

ALTERS HIS DWEIXING. 169 

off from the shore, who either with design, or perhaps never 
but when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this 
place. 

That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with 
tlie least shadow or figure of any people yet; and that if at any 
time they should be driven here, it was probable they went away 
agam as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought 
fit to fix there upon any occasion, to this time. 

That the most I could suggest any danger from was, from any 
such casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main, 
who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against 
their wills; so they made no stay here, but went ofi* again with all 
possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they should 
not have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and that, 
therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, 
in case I should see any savages land upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large 
as to bring a door through again; which door, as I said, came out 
beyond where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely 
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second forti- 
fication, in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my 
wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve 
years before, of which I made mention. These trees having been 
planted so thick before, they wanted but a few piles to be driven 
between them that they should be thicker and stronger, and my 
wall would be soon finished. 

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was 
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could 
tbink of to make it strong; having in it seven little holes about 
^ big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of this I 
^ckened my wall to above ten foot thick, with continual bring- 
^g earth out of my cave and laying it at the foot of the wall and 
walking upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant 
tlie muskets, of which I took notice that I got seven on shore out 
of the ship ; these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted 
them into frames that held them like a carriage, that so I could 
fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time. This wall I was

men, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was an^

by setting two ladders : one to a part of the rock which was low, 
and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon 
that So, when the two ladders were taken down, no man living 
could come down to me without mischieving himself; and if they 
kd come down, they were still on the outside of my outer walL 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for 
my own preservation; and it will be seen at length that they were 
not altogether without just reason, though I foresaw nothing at 
that time more than my mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other 
affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of 
goats. They were not only a present supply to me upon every 
occasion, and began to be sufficient to me, without the expense of 
powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after 
the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the advantage of them, and 
to have them all to nurse up over again. 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but 
t\ro ways to preserve them : one was, to find another convenient 
place to dig a cave underground, and to drive them into it every 
^ight; and the other was, to enclose two or three little bits of 
Jand, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I could, 
^herQ I might keep about half-a-dozen young goats in each place; 
^ that, if any disaster happened to the flock in general, I might 
*^ able to raise them again with little trouble and time. And 
^H though it would require a great deal of time and labour, I 
thought was the most rational design. 

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired 
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one which was as private 
iideed as my heart could wish for. It was a little damp piece of 
^und in the middle of the hollow and thick woods where, as is 
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come 
Wk that way from the eastern part of the island. Here I foimd

172 THE FEAR OF MAN. 

less than a month's time I had so fenced it round that my flock or 
herd — call it which you please — ^who were not so wild now as at 
first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it. 
So, without any further delay, I removed ten young she-goats and 
two he-goats to this piece; and when they were there I continued 
to perfect the fence till I had made it as secure as the other; which, 
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by a 
great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of purely from my appre- 
hensions on the account of the print of a man's foot which I had 
seen ; for as yet I never saw any human creature come near the 
island, and I had now lived two years under these uneasinesses, 
which indeed made my life much less comfortable than it was 
before — as may well be imagined by any who know what it is to 
live in the constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must 
observe with grief, too, that the discomposure of my mind had too 
great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for 
the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and canni- 
bals lay so upon my spirits that I seldom found myself in a due 
temper for application to my Maker — at least, not with the sedate 
calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do. I rather 
prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, sur- 
rounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being 
murdered and devoured before morning. And I must testify from 
my experience that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and 
affection, is much more the proper frame for prayer than that of 
terror and discomposure; and that, under the dread of mischief 
impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of 
the duty of praying to God tjian he is for repentance on a sick- 
bed : for these discomposures affect the mind as the others do the 
body; and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as 
great a disability as that of the body — and much greater, praying 
to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body. 

But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of my littla 
living stock, I went about the whole island searching for another 
private place to make such another deposit, when, wandering mora 
to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and

A HORRID DISCOVERY. 173 

looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the soa at a great 
distance. I had found a prospective-glass or two in one of the 
seamen's chests which I saved out of our ship; but I had it not 
about me, and this was so remote that I could not tell what to 
make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to 
bold to look any longer. Whether it was a boat or not I do not 
know; but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it; 
80 I gave it over — only I resolved to go no more out without a 
prospective-glass in my pocket. 
When I was come down the hill to the end of the island — 
. where, indeed, I had never been before — I was presently convinced 
that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange 
thing in the island as I imagined. And but that it was a special 
providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the 
savages never came, I should easily have known that nothing 
was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when they 
liappened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side 
of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often met and fought 
m their canoes, the victors having taken any prisoners would bring 
them over to the shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, 
l>€ing all cannibals, they would kill and eat them: of which here- 
after. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, 
l^eing the south-west point of the island, I was perfectly confounded 
and amazed — nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my 
^d~at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and 
other bones of human bodies ; and particularly I observed a place 
^here there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth 
fte a cockpit, where it is supposed the savage wretches had sat 
<iown to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow- 
creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things that I enter- 
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while. 
^ my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch 
of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of 
human nature; which though I had heard of often, yet I never 
had 80 near a view of before. In short, I turned away my face

174 CRUSOE'S AMAZEMENT. 

from the horrid spectacle : my stomach grew sick, and I was just 
at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from 
my stomach; and having vomited with an uncommon violence, I 
was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a 
moment. So I gat me up the hill again with all the speed I could, 
and walked on towards my own habitation.

** I was confounded to see the shore spread with bones of human bodies." 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still 
a while as amazed; and then recovering myself, I looked up with 
the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my 
eyes, gave God thanks that had cast my first lot in a part of the 
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures aS 
these; and that though I had esteemed my present condition very 
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had still 
more to give thanks for than to complain of; and this above all, 
that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted witU

knowledge of himself and the hope of his blessing — which was 
elicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which 
lad suffered or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and 
3gan to he much easier now as to the safety of my circumstances 
lan ever I was before; for I observed that these wretches never 
ame to this island in search of what they could get — perhaps not 
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here, and having 
often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it without 
finding anything to their purpose. I knew I had been here now 
almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human 
creature there before; and I might be here eighteen more, as 
entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to 
them— which I had no manner of occasion to do, it being my only 
business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I 
found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself 
known to. 

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches 
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom 
of their devouring and eating one another up, that I continued 
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost 
t^o years after this. When I say my own circle, I mean by it my 
three plantations — namely, my castle, my country seat, which I 
^ed my bower, and my enclosure in the woods. Nor did I look 
^er this for any other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for 
the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was 
^ch that I was fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil him- 
^11 Nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in all this 
^e, but began rather to think of making me another; for I could 
^ot think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other 
Wt round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these 
creatures at sea, in which, if I had happened to have fallen into 
feir hands, I knew what would have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no 
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my 
^easiness about them; and I began to live just in the same corn- 
iced manner as before — only with this difference, that I used more

176 REASONS FOR CONTENTMENT. 

caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did before, lest 
I should happen to be seen by any of them; and, particularly, I 
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them being on the 
island should happen to hear of it. And it was therefore a very 
good providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame 
breed of goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the woods 
or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was 
by traps and snares, as I had done before : so that for two years 
after this I behave I never fired my gun once off, though I never 
went out without it And, which was more, as I had saved three 
pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out with me — or at 
least two of them — sticking them in my goat-skin belt; also I fur- 
bished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and 
made me a belt to put it on also : so that I was now a most formi- 
dable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the 
former description of myself the particular of two pistols, and a 
great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a 
scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, 
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate 
way of living. All these things tended to showing me more and 
more how far my condition was from being miserable, compared to 
some others; nay, to many other particulars of life which it might 
have pleased God to have made my lot It put me upon reflect- 
ing how little repining there would be among mankind at any 
condition of life, if people would rather compare their condition 
with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always 
comparing them with those which are better, to assist their mur- 
murings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really many things 
which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been 
in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for 
my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention for 
my own conveniences ; and I had dropped a good design which 1 . 
had once bent my thoughts too much upon, and that was to try 
if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to 
brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical thought^

PLANS AGAINST THE SAVAGES. 177 

and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I 

presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary 

to the making my beer that it would be impossible for me to 

supply. As, first, casks to preserve it in; which was a thing that, 

as I have observed already, I could never compass — no, though 

I spent, not many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, 

but to no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make 

it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make 

it "boil. And yet all these things notwithstanding, I verily 

believe had not these things intervened — I mean the frights and 

terrors I was in about the savages — I had undertaken it, and 

perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything over 

without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my head enough 

to begin it. 

But my invention now run quite another way; for night and 
day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of 
these monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and, if possi- 
ble, save the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It would 
take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be, 
to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon 
in my thought, for the destroying these creatures, or at least 
them, so as to prevent their coming hither any more, 
all was abortive: nothing could be possible to take effect 
I was to be there to do it myself. And what could one 
Dian do among them when perhaps there might be twenty or 
thirty of them together, with their darts or their bows and arrows, 
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my 
girn? 

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place where 
they made their fire, and put in five or six pound of gunpowder, 
which when they kindled their fire would consequently take fire, 
and blow up all that was near it. But as, in the first place, I 
should be very loath to waste so much powder upon them, my 
store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither 
could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might 
surprise them, and at best that it would do little more than just 
blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient

178 THOUGHTS OF REVENGE. 

to make them forsake the place : so I laid it aside, and then pro- 
posed that I would place myself in ambush, in some convenient 
place, with my three gims all double-loaded, and in the middle of 
their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I should be sure to 
kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then fall- 
ing in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no 
doubt but that if there was twenty I should kill them alL This 
fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so full of 
it that I often dreamed of it, and sometimes that I was just going 
to let fly at them in my sleep. 

I went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed my- 
self several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambus- 
cade, as I said, to watch for them; and I went frequently to the 
place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me: and 
especially while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge, 
and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as 
1 may call it; the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of 
the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated my malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where I 
was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats 
coming, and might then, even before they would be ready to come 
on shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees, in one of 
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely, and 
where I might sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take 
my full aim at their heads, when they were so close together as 
that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shoot, 
or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first 
shoot. 

In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design, and accordingly 
I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two 
muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five 
smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling- 
piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size; 
I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each, and in this 
posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third 
charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in na}'

180 CALMER THOUGHTS. 

abandoned of Heaven and acted by some hellish degeneracy, could 
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to 
be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long, and 
80 far, every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself 
began to alter, and I began with cooler and calmer thoughts to 
consider what it was I was going to engage in; — what autho- 
rity or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon 
these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for so many 
ages to suffer unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the 
executioners of his judgments one upon another. How far these 
people were offenders against me, and what right I had to engage 
in the quarrel of that blood, which they shed promiscuously one 
upon another. I debated this very often with myself thus: How 
do 1 know what God himself judges in this particular case 1 It is 
certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it is not against 
their own consciences reproving or their light reproaching them. 
They do not know it to be an offence, and then commit it in 
defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we com- 
mit. They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in 
war, than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat human flesh, than we do 
to eat mutton. 

When I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily that 
I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were not 
murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in my 
thoughts; any more than those Christians were murderers who often 
put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or, more frequently, 
upon many occasions put whole troops of men to the sword, 
without giving quarter, though they threw down their arms and 
submitted. 

In the next place, it occurred to me that albeit the usage they 
thus gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was 
really nothing to me; these people had done me no injury. That 
if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate pre- 
servation to fall upon them, something might be said for it; but 
that as I was yet out of their power, and they had really no 
knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me; and 
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them. That

A WISE CONCLUSION. 181 

tills would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their 
tobarities practised in America, and where they destroyed millions 
oi these people, who, however they were idolaters, and barbarians, 
and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such 
as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the 
Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them out 
oi the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and 
detestation, by even the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and 
by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a 
bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God 
or man; and such as for which the very name of a Spaniard is 
reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity, or 
of Christian compassion — as if the kingdom of Spain were particu- 
larly eminent for the product of a race of men who were without 
principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the 
niiserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in 
the mind 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of 
a full stop; and I began by little and little to be off" of my design, 
and to conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolutions to 
attack the savages; that it was not my business to meddle with 
ttem, unless they first attacked me, and this it was my business 
^possible to prevent; but that, if I were discovered and attacked, 
taen I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really was 
4e way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy 
"myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only 
should be on shore at that time, but that should ever come on 
shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country- 
People what had happened, they would come over again by thou- 
sands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only 
bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at present I had no 
^winner of occasion for. 

Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in principles nor in 
PoUcy I ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair ; — 
that my business was by all possible means to conceal myself from 
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by that

182 A BETTER DISPOSITION. 

there were any living creatures upon the island, — I mean of human 
shape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was convinced 
now many ways that I was perfectly out of my duty, when I was 
laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent crea- 
tures, — I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were 
guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them; 
they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of 
God, who is the Governor of nations, and knows how by national 
punishments to make a just retribution for national offences, and 
to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public man- 
ner, by such ways as best pleases him. 

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater 
satisfaction to me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing 
which I now saw so much reason to believe would have been no 
less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed it. And 
I give most humble thanks on my knees to God, that had thus 
delivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me 
the protection of his providence, that I might not fall into the 
hands of the barbarians ; or that I might not lay my hands upon 
them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in 
defence of my own life. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this, and so 
far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, 
that in all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether 
there were any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them 
had been on shore there or not, that I might not be tempted to 
renew any of my contrivances against them, or be provoked by 
any advantage which might present itself, to fall upon them; only 
this I did, I went and removed my boat, which I had on the other 
side the island, and carried it down to the east end of the whole 
island, where I ran it into a little cove which I found under some 
high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the 
savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats upon 
any account whatsoever. 

With my boat I carried away everything that I had left there 
belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither —

FURTHER PRECAUTIONS. 183 

namely, a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing 
like an anchor, but indeed which could not be called either anchor 
orgraphng^ — however, it was the best I could make of its kind. 
All these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow of 
any discovery, or any appearance of any boat or of any human 
habitation upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, 
and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant 
employment — namely, to milk my she-goats and manage my little 
flock in the wood; which, as it was quite on the other part of the 
island, was quite out of danger ; for certain it is, that these savage 
people who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any 
of finding anything here, and consequently never wan- 
i ofif from the coast. And I doubt not but they might have 
been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had 
made me cautious as well as before; and, indeed, I looked back 
with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would 
bave been, if I had chopped upon them, and been discovered 
before that, when naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and 
that loaded often only with small shot. I walked everywhere 
peepmg and peeping about the island to see what I could get; — 
what a surprise should I have been in, if, when I discovered the 
print of a man's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty 
savages, and found them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of 
4eir running, no possibility of my escaping them ! 

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, 
^^ distressed my mind so much that I could not soon recover it, 
to think what I should have done, and how I not only should not 
^ave been able to resist them, but even should not have had pre- 
sence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much less 
^hat now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might 
be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I 
should be very melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great 
vhile; but I resolved it at last all into thankfulness to that Pro- 
^dence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, 
^d had kept me from those mischiefs which I could no way have

184 SECRET DICTATES. 

been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had not the 
least notion of any such thing depending, or the least supposition 
of it being possible. 

This renewed a contemplation which often had come to my 
thoughts in former time, when first I began to see the merciful 
dispositions of Heaven in the dangers we run through in this life; 
How wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it: 
how, when we are in a quandary, as we call it, a doubt or hesita- 
tion whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct 
us this way when we intended to go that way; nay, when sense, 
our own inclination, and perhaps business, has called to go the 
other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from we know 
not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule 
us to go this way; and it shall afterwards appear that had we 
gone that way which we should have gone, and even to our imar 
gination ought to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost 
Upon these and many like reflections, I afterwards made it a 
certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or 
pressings of my mind to doing or not doing anything that pre- 
sented, or to going this way or that way, I never failed to obey 
the secret dictate, though I knew no other reason for it than that 
such a pressure or such a hint hung upon my mind. I could give 
many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my 
life, but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this 
unhappy island, besides many occasions which it is very likely I 
might have taken notice of if I had seen with the same eyes then 
that I saw with now. But it is never too late to be wise ; and I 
cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended 
with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so 
extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence. 
Let them come from what invisible intelligence they will — that I 
shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for — but certainly 
they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret com- 
munication between those embodied and those unembodied, and 
such a proof as can never be withstood. Of which I shall have 
occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the remainder 
of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

ANXIETY AND DANGER. 185 

I believe the reader of this will not think strange if I confess 
that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the 
concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention and 
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accom- 
modations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more 
now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive a 
nail or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I should make 
should he heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the same 
reason. And, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any 
fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, 
should betray me; and for this reason I removed that part of my 
business which required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, 
&c, into my new apartment in the woods, where, after I had been 
some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation a mere natural 
cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare 
say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy 
te to venture in, nor indeed would any man else; but one who, 
Kke me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, 
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant 
feason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was cutting 
down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal. And before 
I go on I must observe the reason of my making this charcoal, 
which was thus : — 

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said 
before; and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, 
cooking my meat, &c. So I contrived to bum some wood here, 
^ I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark, 
or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal 
to cany home and perform the other services which fire was waYit- 
H for at home without danger of smoke. 

But this by-the-by. While I was cutting down some wood here, 
I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brushwood 
or underwood there was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to 
look into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I 
found it was pretty large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand 
'ipright in it, and perhaps another with ma But I must confess

186 AN ALARM. 

to you I made more haste out than I did in, when looking further 
into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad 
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, 
which twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the cave's mouth 
shining directly in and making the reflection. 

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to 
call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself that he that was afraid 
to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all 

alone; and that I

a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat 
on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have 
lifted it off! But still, plucking up my spirits as well as I could, 
and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power 
and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, 
upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light of the fire-

will, as we say, and gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere 
old age. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed 
to get up, but was not able to raise himself. And I thought with 
myself he might even lie there; for if he had frighted me so, he 
would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be 
80 hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.

might be about twelve foot over, but in no manner of shape, either 

round or square, no hands having ever been employed in making 

it but those of mere Nature. I observed also that there was a 

place at the farther side of it that went in farther, but was so low 

that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into 

it, and whither I went I knew not. So, having no candle, I gave 

it over for some time, but resolved to come again the next day, 

provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the 

lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire^ in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles 
of my own making — for I made very good candles now of goat's 
tallow— and going into this low place, I was obhged to creep upon 
all-fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I 
thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I knew not 
how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I was got 
through the strait I found the roof rose higher up — I believe near 
twenty foot. But never was such a glorious sight seen in the 
island, I dare say, as it was to look round the sides and roof of 
this vault or cave. The walls reflected a hundred thousand lights 
to me from my two candles. What it was in the rock, whether 
diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather 
supposed it to be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its 
Wnd as could be expected, though perfectly dark. The floor was 
dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so 
that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither

188 REMOVES HIS AMMUNITION. 

was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The only diffi- 
culty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place of 
security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a 
convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and 
resolved without any delay to bring some of those things which 
I was most anxious about to this place. Particularly, I resolved 
to bring hither my magazine of powder and all my spare arms— 
namely, two fowling-pieces, for I had three in all; and three 
muskets, for of them I had eight in alL So I kept at my castle 
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on 
my outmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon any ex- 
pedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took occasion 
to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, and 
which had been wet; and I found that the water had penetrated 
about three or four inches into the powder on every side, which, 
caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel 
in a shell. So that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder 
in the centre of the cask, and this was an agreeable discovery to 
me at that time. So I carried all away tluther, never keeping 
above two or three pound of powder with me in my castle for fear 
of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither all the lead I had 
left, for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were 
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come 
at them. For I persuaded myself, while I was here, if five hun- 
dred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out; or 
if they did, they would not ventiu-e to attack me hera 

The old goat, who I found expiring, died in the mouth of the 
cave the next day after I made this discovery ; and I found it 
much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover 
him with earth, than to drag him out So I interred him there 
to prevent offence to my nose. 

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island, 
and was so naturalized to the place and to the manner of living, 
that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would 
come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to

DIVERSIONS AND AMUSEBfENTS. 189 

have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there even to 

the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old 

goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions and 

amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me 

a great deal than it did before. As first, I had taught my Poll, 

as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked 

80 articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me : and he 

lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years. How long he 

might live afterwards I know not; though I know they have a 

notion in the Brazils that they Uve a hundred years. Perhaps 

poor Poll may be alive there still, calling after poor Robin 

Crusoe to this day. I wish no Englishman the ill-luck to come 

there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe it 

was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and loving companion 

to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of 

mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, 

to that degree that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, 

to keep them from devouring me and all I had. But at length, 

when the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after 

some time continually driving them from me, and letting them 

have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods except 

two or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, 

when they had any, I always drowned. And these were part of 

Day family. Besides these, I always kept two or three household 

kids about me, which I taught to feed out of my hand. And I 

W two more parrots which talked pretty well, and would all call 

Robin Crusoe, but none like my first. Nor indeed did I take the 

pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had also 

several tame sea-fowls, whose names I know not, which I caught 

tipon the shore and cut their wings. And the little stakes which 

J had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good 

ihick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred 

there; which was very agreeable to me. So that, as I said above, 

I began to be very well contented with the life I led, if it might 

but have been secured from the dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed. And it may not be amiss for 
aU people who shall meet with my story to make this just obser-

190 A FIRE ON THE SHORE. 

vation from it — namely, how frequently in the course of our lives 
the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when 
we are fallen into is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the 
very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be 
raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give 
many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life, 
but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the 
circumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my 
twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice,' for 
winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of my harvest, and 
required my being pretty much abroad in the fields : when going 
out pretty early in the morning, even before it was thorough day- 
light, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, 
at a distance from me of about two mile, towards the end of the 
island where I had observed some savages had been as before; but 
not on the other side, but, to my great affliction, it was on my side 
of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stepped short 
within my grove, not daring to go out lest I might be surprised; 
and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I 
had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find 
my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and improvements, 
they would immediately conclude that there were people in the 
place, and would then never give over till they had found me out 
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the 
ladder after me, and made all things without look as wild and 
natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of 
defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them — that is to 
say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification 
— and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last 
gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine 
protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the

lands of the barbarians. And in this posture^ I continued about 
wo hours, but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence 
ibroad, for I had no spies to send out. 

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in 
this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer;

nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they had made, not 

to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being 

extreme hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous

192 A DREADFUL SIGHT. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up 
upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed 
to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It is 
not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, espe- 
cially seeing them come on my side the island, and so near me too; 
but when I observed their coming must be always with the current 
of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, 
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time of 
the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before. And having 
made this observation, I went abroad about my harvest- work with 
the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the 
westward, I saw them all take boat, and row, or paddle, as we call 
it, all away. I should have observed that for an hour and more 
before they went off they went to dancing, and I could easily dis- 
cern their postures and gestures by my glasses. I could not per- 
ceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were stark naked, 
and had not the least covering upon them; but whether they were 
men or women, that I could not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon 
my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great sword 
by my side without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able 
to make, I went away to the hill where I had discovered the first 
appearance of all ; and as soon as I gat thither, which was not less 
than two hours (for I could not go apace, being so laden with arms 
as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes more of savages 
on that place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea 
together, making over for the main. 

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, going down to 
the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work 
they had been about had left behind it — namely, the blood, the 
bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured 
by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with 
indignation at the sight, that I began now to premeditate the 
destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be who or how 
many soever. 

It seemed evident to me that the visits which they thus makft

PERPLEXITY AND ANXIETY. 193 

tliia island are not very frequent; for it was above fifteen 
intha before any more of them came on shore there again; — that 
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them, 
II all that time ; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure 
Qot to come abroad, at least not so far. Yet all this while I lived 
mcomiortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I was in 
oi their coming upon me by surprise ; from whence I observe that 
tke expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering, especially 
if there is no rooin to shake off that expectation or those ap- 
prehensions. 

During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and took 
up most of my hom*s, which should have been better employed, 
in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next 
time I should see them, especially if they should be divided, as 
they were the last time, into two parties. Nor did I consider at 
all that if I killed one party — suppose ten or a dozen — I was still 
the next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so another, 
even ad infinitum^ till I should be at length no less a murderer 
than they were in being man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. 

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, 
expecting that I should one day or other fall into the hands of 
these merciless creatures ; and if I did at any time venture abroad, 
it was not without looking round me with the greatest care and 
caution imaginable. And now I found to my great comfort how 
happy it was that I provided for a tame flock or herd of goats; 
for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that 
side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm 
the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have 
them come back again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes 
^ith them, in a few days, and then I knew what to expect. 

However, I wore out a year and three months more before I 
ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, 
^ I shall soon observe. It is true they might have been there 
once or twice, but either they made no stay, or at least I did not 
hear them; but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, 
and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter 
^th them, of which in its place.

194 AN EVENTFUL DAY. 

The perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen 
months' interval was very great. I slept unquiet, dreamed always 
frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night. 
In the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind, and in the night 
I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of the reasons why I 
might justify the doing of it. But to waive all this for a while, it 
was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well 
as my poor wooden calendar would reckon; for I marked all upon 
the post still. I say it was the sixteenth of May, that it blew a 
very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning 
and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I know not 
what was the particular occasion of it; but as I was reading in the 
Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present 
condition, I was surprised with a noise of a gun, as I thought, 
fired at sea. 

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature from 
any I had met with before; for the notions this put into my 
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest 
haste imaginable, and in a trice clapped my ladder to the middle 
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the 
second time, got to the top of the hill, the very moment that a 
flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which accordingly in 
about half a minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it was 
from that part of the sea where I was driven down the current in 
my boat. 

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress, 
and that they had some comrade or some other ship in company, 
and fired these guns for signals of distress and to obtain help. ^ 
had this presence of mind at that minute as to think that though 
I could not help them, it may be they might help me; so I brought 
together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good 
handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry 
and blazed freely, and though the wind blew very hard, yet it 
burned fairly out, that I was certain if there was any such thing ^ 
a ship they must needs see it ; and no doubt they did, for as soon 
as ever my fire blazed up I heard another gun, and after that 
several others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night

A WRECK ON THE ISLAND. 195 

long till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the air 
cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of 
tlie island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no not 
with my glasses, the distance was so great, and the weather still 
Bomething hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that 
it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at an 
anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took 
my gun in my hand, and ran toward the south side of the island, 
to the rocks where I had formerly been carried away with the 
corrent; and getting up there, the weather by this time being 
perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck 
of a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which 
Hound when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they 
checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter- 
stream or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the 
most desperate hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all 
my life. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction; 
for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their 
knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had been 
driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at east and 
east-north-east Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily 
suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured 
to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat. But 
4eir firing of guns for help, especially when they saw, as I 
unagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I 
iiQagined that upon seeing my light they might have put them- 
selves into their boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore; 
hut that the sea going very high, they might have been cast away. 
Other times I imagined that they might have lost their boat 
tere, as might be the case many ways, as particularly by the 
hreaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliges 
Dien to stave or take in pieces their boat, and sometimes to throw 
it overboard with their own hands. Other times I imagined they 
^ some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of 
distress they had made, had taken them up and carried them off.

196 THANKFULNESS TO GOD. 

Other whiles I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, 
and being hurried away by the current that I had been formerly 
in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing 
but misery and perishing, and that perhaps they might by this 
time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one 
another. 

As all these were but conjectures at best, so in the condition I 
was in I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the 
poor men and pity them; which had still this good effect on my 
side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, 
who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate 
condition; and that of two ships' companies who were now cast 
away upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared 
but mine. I learned here again to observe that it is very rare 
that the providence of God casts us into any condition of life so 
low, or any misery so great, but we may see something or other 
to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances than 
our own. 

Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not 
so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved. Nothing 
could make it rational, so much as to wish or expect that they did 
not all perish there, except the possibility only of their being taken 
up by another ship in company; and this was but mere possibility 
indeed, for I saw not the least signal or appearance of any such 
thing. 

I cannot explain by any possible energy of words what a strange 
longing or hankering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, 
breaking out Sometimes thus: "Oh that there had been but one or 
two — nay, or but one soul saved out of this ship, to have escap€<^ 
to me; that I might but have had one companion, one fellow- 
creature to have spoken to me, and to have conversed with." I" 
all the time of my solitary life I never felt so earnest, so strong * 
desire after the society of my fellow-creatiu-es, or so deep a regre** 
at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the affections, which,

object, though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by

HIS EARNEST WISHES. 197 

the power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul by its 
impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the object, that 
the absence of it is insupportable. 

Such were these earnest wishings that but one man had been 
saved! "Oh, that it had been but one!" I believe I repeated 
the words, "Oh, that it had been but one!" a thousand times; and 
the desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my 
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press the palms of my 
hands, that if I had had any soft thing in my hand, it would have 
crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in my head would strike 
together, and set against one another so strong, that for some time 
I could not part them again. 

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and 
manner of them. All I can say to them is, to describe the fact, 
which was even siu^rising to me when I found it; though I knew 
not from what it should proceed. It was doubtless the effect of 
wdent wishes and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing the 
comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-Christians 
would have been to me. 

But it was not to be. Either their fate or mine, or both, forbid 
^t; for until the last year of my being on this island, I never knew 
whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only 
the affliction some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy 
<^me on shore, at the end of the island which was next the ship- 
^k. He had on no clothes, but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of 
<)pen-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to 
^rect me so much as to guess what nation he was of. He had 
Nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe. 
file last was to me of ten times more value than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my 
•^at to this wreck; not doubting that I might find something on 
wd that might be useful to me. But that did not altogether 
press me so much as the possibility that there might be yet some 
*i^g creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but 
''^ht, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree; 
^d this thought clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet,

198 A STRONG IMPRESSION. 

wreck; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought the 
impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be re- 
sisted, that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I 
should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my 
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of 
bread, a great pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle 
of rum, — for I had still a great deal of that left, — a basket full of 
raisins. And thus loading myself with everything necessary, I 
went down to my boat, got the water out of her, and got her afloat, 
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more 
My second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the umbrella to set 
up over my head for shade, another large pot full of fresh water, 
and about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley cakes, more 
than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese; all which, 
with great labour and sweat, I brought to my boat; and praying 
to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the 
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the 
island on that side — namely, north-east. And now I was to 
launch out into the ocean, and either to venture, or not to venture. 
I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides 
of the island, at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, 
from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my 
heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven in^ 
either of those currents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea, 
and perhaps out of my reach or sight of the island again; and that 
then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should 
rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over 
my enterpiise, and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the 
shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising bit oi 
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire about 
my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide 
was turned and the flood come on, upon which my going was for 
so many hours impracticable. Upon this, presently it occuned to 
me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could 
find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents

VISITS THE NEW WRECK. 199 

lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was 
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way 
home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was 
no sooner in my head, but I cast my eye upon a little hill, which 
sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had 
a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I 
was to guide myself in my return. Here I found that as the cur- 
rent of the ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so 
the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side, 
and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the island 
in my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next morning 
to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the 
night in the canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I 
launched out. I made first a little out to sea full north, till I 
began to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and 
which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as 
the southern side current had done before, and so as to take from 
me all government of the boat; but having a strong steerage with 
my paddle, I went at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in 
kss than two hours I came up to it. 

It was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which by its build- 
ing was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks ; all 
the stem and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea; 
*nd as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with 
great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by the 
board-— that is to say, broken short off; but her boltsprit was 
sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I came close to 
W, a dog appeared upon her, who seeing me coming, yelped and 
cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come 
to me, and I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead 
fcr hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and he 
*te it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight 
in the snow. I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, 
^th which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself. 

After this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was 
two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship.

two pots of very

THE PLAGUE OF MANKIND. 203 

head, that was always to let me know it was bom to make my body 
miserable, was all the two years filled with projects and designs 
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this island : for 
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck, though 
my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the 
hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes 
another; and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went 
from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I 
hew not whither. 

1 have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who 
are touched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for 
aught I know, one-half of their miseries flow — I mean, that of not 
being satisfied with the station wherein God and nature hath placed 
them. For, not to look back upon my primitive condition, and 
the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which was, 
as I may call it, my original sin; my subsequent mistakes of the 
same kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable 
condition : for had that Providence which so happily had seated 
me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, 
and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I 
might have been by this time, I mean in the time of my being in 
this island, one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils. 
%, I am persuaded that, by the improvements I had made in 
that httle time I lived there, and the increase I should probably 
have made if I had stayed, I might have been worth a hundred 
thousand moidores. And what business had I to leave a settled 
tamie, a well-stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to 
torn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when patience and 
time would have so increased our stock at home that we could 
We bought them at our own door from those whose business it 
^as to fetch them? And though it had cost us something more, 
yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at 
80 great a hazard. 

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflection

204 PROFITABLE REFLECTIONS. 

that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually 
poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from this 
place. And that I may, with the greater pleasure to the reader, 
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper 
to give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this 
foolish scheme for my escape, and how and upon what foundation 
I acted. 

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle after my late 
voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water 
as usual, and my condition restored to what it was before. I had 
more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the 
richer: for I had no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had 
before the Spaniards came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four- 
and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitari- 
nees. I was lying in my bed or hammock awake, very well in 
health; had no pain, no distemper, no imeasiness of body; no, nor 
any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary: but could by no 
means close my eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink alJ 
night long : otherwise that as follows. 

It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable 
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of 
the brain, the memory, in this night's time. I ran over the whole 
history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call 
it, to my coming to this island, and also of the part of my He 
since I came to this island. In my reflections upon the state of 
my case since I came on shore on this island, I was comparing the 
happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation 
here, compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care which I had 
lived ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand Not 
that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even 
all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at 
times on shore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable 
of any apprehensions about it. My satisfaction was perfect, though 
my danger was the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my 
danger as if I had never really been exposed to it This furnished 
my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and particularly

HIS GREAT SECURITY. 205 

this one: How infinitely good that Providence is which has pro- 
vided, in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his 
sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks in the midst 
of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to 
him, would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene 
and calm by having the events of things hid from his eyes, and 
bowing nothing of the dangers which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some tim^ entertained me, I came 
to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many 
years in this very island, and how I had walked about in the 
greatest security and with all possible tranquillity, even when 
perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual 
approach of night, had been between me and the worst kind of 
destraction; namely, that of falling into the hands of cannibals and 
savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I 
did of a goat or a tui-tle, and have thought it no more a crime to 
kill and devour me than I did of a pigeon or a curlew. I would 
unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not sincerely thank- 
fal to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknow- 
ledged, with great humility, that all these unknown deliverances 
were due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into 
their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time 
^en up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I 
iQean, the savages; and how it came to pass in the world that the 
^se Governor of all things should give up any of his creatures to 
such inhumanity, nay, to something sa much below even brutality 
itself, as to devour its own kind. But as this ended in some, at 
that time fruitless, speculations, it occurred to me to inquire what 
part of the world these wretches lived in; how far off the coast 
was from whence they came; what they ventured over so far from 
home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I might not 
order myself and my business so that I might be as able to go 
over thither as they were to come to me. 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should 
do with myself when I came thither, what would become of me if 
I fell into the hands of the savages, or how I should escape from

206 MENTAL EXCITEMENTX 

them if they attempted me ; no, nor so much as how it was possible 
for me to reach the coast and not be attempted by some or other 
of them without any possibility of delivering myself; and if I 
should not fall into their hands, what I should do for provision, or 
whither I should bend my course; — none of these thoughts, I say, 
so much as came in my way, but my mind was wholly bent upon 
the notion of my passing over in my boat to the mainland 1 
looked back upon my present condition as the most miserable that 
could possibly be : that I was not able to throw myself into any- 
thing but death that could be called worse; that if I reached the 
shore of the main I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might 
coast along, as I did on the shore of Africk, till I came to some 
inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and, after 
all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might 
take me in; and if the worse came to the worst I could but die, 
which would put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, 
all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, 
made as it were desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, 
and the disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on 
board of, and where I had been so near the obtaining what I so 
earnestly longed for, namely, somebody to speak to, and to learn 
some knowledge from of the place where I was, and of the probable 
means of my deliverance : I say, I was agitated wholly by these 
thoughts; all my calm of mind in my resignation to Providence, 
and waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be 
suspended; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts 
to anything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which 
came upon me with such force and such an impetuosity of desire 
that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more 
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and 
my pulse beat as high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the 
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it — nature, as if I had 
been fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it, threw 
me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should have 
dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of anything relating to it Bu^ 
I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual froi^

A DREAM. 207 

I, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages 
) land, and that they brought with them another savage,' 
' were going to kill in order to eat him; when on a 
le savage that they were going to kill jumped away and 
s life. And I thought in my sleep that he came running 
ittle thick grove before my fortification to hide himself; 
I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the others 
im that way, showed myself to him, and, smiling upon 
>uraged him: that he kneeled down to me, seeming to 
.0 assist him; upon which I showed my ladder, made him 
d carried him into my cave, and he became my servant : 
as soon as I had gotten this man I said to myself; Now 
tainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve 
lilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for 
3, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what 
venture into, and what to escape. — I waked with this 
Euad was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at 
ect of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments 
felt upon coming to myself and finding it was no more 
eam were equally extravagant the other way, and threw 
, very great dejection of spirit. 

ihis, however, I made this conclusion, that my only way 
)ut an attempt for an escape was, if possible, to get a 
ito my possession, and, if possible, it should be one of 
joners who they had condemned to be eaten and should 
ther to kill But these thoughts still were attended with 
ulty, that it was impossible to effect this without attack- 
)le caravan of them, and killing them all. And this was 
a very desperate attempt and might miscarry, but, on the 
id, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to me; and 
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, 
i was for my deliverance. I need not repeat the argu- 
iiich occurred to me against this, they being the same 
d before. But though I had other reasons to offer now

208 A NEW RESOLVR 

acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assault- 
ing me, and the like; — I say, though these things argued for it, 
yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance 
were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means recon- 
cile myself to a great while. 

However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and 
after great perplexities about it — for all these arguments one way 
and another struggled in my head a long time — the eager, prevail- 
ing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I 
resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages into my hands, 
cost what it would. My next thing then was to contrive how to 
do it; and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve on. But as 
I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put 
myself upon the watch to see them when they came on shore, and 
leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as the opportunity 
should present, let be what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the 
scout as often as possible; and indeed so often till I was heartily 
tired of it, for it was above a year and half that I waited, and 
for great part of that time went out to the west end and to the 
south-west corner of the island almost every day to see for canoes, 
but none appeared. This was very discouraging, and began to 
trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did in this case as 
it had done some time before that— namely, wear off the edge of 
my desire to the thing. But the longer it seemed to be delayed, 
the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so care- 
ful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by 
them, as I was now eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three 
savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, 
to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being 
able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a gi^eat while that 1 
pleased myself with this affair ; but nothing still presented. All 
my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near 
me for a great while. 

About a year and half after I had entertained these notions* 
and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing

THE SAVAGES LAND. 209 

ioT want of an occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised 
one morning early with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore 
together on my side the island, and the people who belonged to 
them all landed and out of my sight 1 The number of them broke 
all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they 
always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not 
tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures to attack 
twenty or thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my castle, 
perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into all the 
same postiures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was 
just ready for action if anything had presented. Having waited 
a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, 
being very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and 
clambered up to the top of the hill by my two stages, as usual; 
standing so, however, that my head did not appear above the hill, 
so that they could not perceive me by any means. Here I observed, 
by the help of my perspective-glass, that they were no less than 
thirty in number, that they had a fire kindled, that they had had 
meat dressed. How they had cooked it, that I knew not, or what 
it was; but they were all dancing, in I know not how many bar- 
barous gestures and figures, their own way roimd the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them I perceived by my perspec- 
tive two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where it 
seems they were laid by, and were now brought out for the 
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being 
hocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, — for that 
^as their way, — and two or three others were at work immediately 
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was 
^eft standing by himself till they should be ready for him. In 
ftat very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at 
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started 
iway from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands 
Erectly towards me; I mean, towards that part of the coast where 
^y habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted, that I must acknowledge, when I 
perceived him to run my way; and especially when, as I thought, 
I saw him pursued by the whole body ; and now I expected that

THE SAVAGES BURIED. 213 

too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of 
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with abimdance of 
gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down with the head 
of the savage that he had killed just before me. 

But that which astonished him most, was to know how I had 
killed the other Indian so far off. So pointing to him, he made 
signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade him go as well as I 
could. When he came to him he stood like one amazed, looking 
at him, turned him first on one side, then on the other, looked at 
the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was just in his 
breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood 
had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. 
He took up his bow and arrows and came back, so I turned to go 
away, and beckoned to him to follow me, making signs to him 
that more might come after them. 

Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with sand, 
that they might not be seen by the rest if they followed; and so 
I made signs again to him to do so. He fell to work, and in an 
instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big 
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and 
covered him, and did so also by the other. I believe he had 
buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away 
I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the 
farther part of the island. So I did not let my dream come to 
pass in that part; namely, that he came ihto my grove for shelter. 

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a 
^ught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress 
for by his running. And having refreshed him, I made signs for 
Mm to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid 
'^ great parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to 
sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down and 
^ent to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome feUow, perfectly well made, with 
Wght strong limbs^ not too large, taU and well shaped, and as I

last he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and 
sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done before; and 
after this made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and 
submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me as 
long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him 
know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began 
to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me. And first, I 
made him know his name should be Friday, which was the day I 
saved his life. I called him so for the memory of the time. I 
likewise taught him to say Master, and then let him know that 
was to be my name. I Hkewise taught him to say Yes and No, 
and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an

bread in it And I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which

I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was day I 
t>eckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give 
lim some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark 
naked. As we went by the place where he had buried the two 
men he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks 
^liat he had made to find them again, making signs to me that we 
should dig them up again and eat them 1 At this I appeared very 
"^ngry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at 
the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come 
*vay; which he did immediately, with great submission. I then 
led bun up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone; 
H pulling out my glass, I looked and saw plainly the place 
where they had been, but no appearance of them, or of their canoes; 
80 that it was plain that they were gone, and had left their two 
comrades behind them, without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery; but having now 
Jiiore courage, and consequently more curiosity, I takes my man 
Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand with the bow 
and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexter- 
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two for myself,

all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making 
after a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five 
kad the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundt 
other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me 
stand that they brought over four prisoners to feast upoE 
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himse 
the fourth : That there had been a great battle between the

that they had taken a great number of prisoners, all whicl 
carried to several places by those that had taken them in th( 
in order to feast upon them, as was done here by these wi 
upon those they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and 
ever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and make i 
fire upon it, and bum them all to ashes. I found Friday h 
a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was still 
nibal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhorrence

CRUSOE'S PRECAUTIONS. 217 

trae, he went awkwardly in these things at first: wearing the 
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat 
galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little eas- 
ing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself 
to them, at length he took to them very well 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I began 
to consider where I should lodge him; and that I might do well 
for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for 
him in the vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside 
of the last, and in the outside of the first. And as there was a 
door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed door- 
case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, 
a little within the entrance; and causing the door to open on the 
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so 
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- 
most wall without making so much noise in getting over, that it 
must needs waken me. For my first wall had now a complete 
wof over it of long poles covering all my tent, and leaning up to 
the side of the hill, which was again laid cross with smaller sticks 
mstead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the 
rice straw, which was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place 
^hich was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed ^ kind 
of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would 
Dot have opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a 
S^t noise; and as to weapons, I took them all in to my side 
every night 

But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had a 
^ore faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me; 
^thdat passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and 
^Dgaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a child 
^ a father, and I daresay he would have sacrificed his life for 
the saving mine upon any occasion whatsoever. The many testi- 
^Jiionies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt, and soon convinced 
^e that I needed to use no precautions as to my safety on his 
account 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with 
bonder, that however it had pleased God, in his providence, and

218 SOVEREIGNTY OP GOD. 

in the government of the works of his hands, to take from so great 
a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to which their 
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted; yet that he 
has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, the 
same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and obligation, 
the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of 
gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good 
and receiving good, that he has given to us; and that when he 
pleases to offer to them occasions of exerting these, they are as 
ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which 
they were bestowed than we are. And this made me very melan- 
choly sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, 
how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have these 
powers enlightened by the great Lamp of instruction, the Spirit 
of God, and by the knowledge of his Word, added to our under- 
standing; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving know- 
ledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this 
poor savage, would make a much better use of it than we did. 

From hence I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sore 
reignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of ^ 
arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that light fro^ 
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from botS 
But I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusiod 
first. That we did not know by what light and law these shouL 
be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the naturr 
of his being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be but thj* 
if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from himself, i 
was on account of sinning against that light which, as the Scrip 
ture says, was a law to themselves; and by such rules as thei^ 
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation 
was not discovered to us. And, secondly, That still as we are al

LESSONS FOR FRIDAY. 219 

the aptest scholar that ever was, and particularly was so merry, so 
constantly diligent, and so pleased, when he could but understand 
me, or make me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me 
to talk to him. And now my life began to be so easy, that I began 
to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from more 
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place while 
Ilived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I 
thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of 
feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let 
him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one morning to 
the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own 
flock, and bring him home and dress it; but, as I was going, I saw 
& she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting 
by her. I catched hold of Friday. "Hold," says I, "stand still;" 
and made signs to him not to stir. Immediately I presented my 
piece, shot, and Idlled one of the kids. The poor creature, who 
had at a distance indeed seen me kill the savage his enemy, but 
did not know, or could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly 
surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed, that I 
thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had 
shot at, or perceive I had Idlled it, but ripped up his waistcoat to 
feel if he was not wounded, and, as I found, presently thought I 
^as resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled down to me, 
*nd embracing my knees, said a great many things I did not 
^derstand, but I could easily see that the meaning was to pray 
^e not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no 

tann, and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and point- 

^g to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and 

fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and looking 

^ see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again, and 

V and by I saw a great fowl like a hawk sit upon a tree within 

^ot; 80, to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I 

called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a 

Pwrot, though I thought it had been a hawk. I say, pointing to

HE IS SET TO WORK. 221 

Well, after his astomshment was a little over at this, I pointed 

to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot; which he did, but 

sfcayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, was 

fluttered a good way off from the place where she fell; however, 

he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I had 

perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage 

to charge the gun again, and not let him see me do it, that I might 

be ready for any other mark that might present. But nothing 

more offered at that time ; so I brought home the kid, and the 

same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could; 

and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the 

flesh, and made some very good broth; and after I had begun to 

eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, 

and liked it very well. But that which was strangest to him was 

to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt 

"w-as not good to eat, and putting a little into his own mouth, he 

seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing 

his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other hand, I took 

some meat in my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and 

sputter for want of salt as fast as he had done at the salt. But it 

'^^ould not do, he would never care for salt with his meat, or in 

■^is broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved 
^^ feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid. This 
-"^ did by hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen many 
People do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side the 
^^^, and one cross on the top, and tying the string to the cross- 
^^ck, letting the meat turn continually. This Friday admired 
^^rymuch; but, when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many 
^ays to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but under- 
stand him; and at last he told me he would never eat man's flesh 
^^Y more — which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and 
lifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he 
s<H)n understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had 
^n what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread

t everything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I 
tad to Bend him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in 
short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which 
indeed I had very little occasion for before — that is to say, about 
speech. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular 
satisfaction in the fellow himself. His simple unfeigned honesty 
appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to 
love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he loved me more 
than it was possible for him ever to love anything before.

his own country again; and having learned him English so well 
that he could answer me almost any questions, I asked him 
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle?

better;" that is, he meant always get the better in fight; and so

and that they had killed much mans, — that was his word. By all 
^hich I understood he meant the Spaniards^ whose cruelties in 
America had been spread over the Whole countries, and were 
remembered by all the nations from father to son. 

I enquired if he could tell me how I might come from this 
island, and get among those white men. He told me, " Yes, yes, 
I might go in two canoe." I could not understand what he 
meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by two canoe, 
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a 
large, great boat, as big as two canoes. 

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very 
well, and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time 
or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from 
tliis place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help me 
to do it.

U8, take everything from us : and thus, by degrees, 1 opened bis 
eyes. He hstened with great attention, and received with pleasure 
the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us; and of the 
manner of making our prayers to God, and his being able to hear 
us, even into heaven. He told me one day that if our God could 
hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than 
their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could 
not hear, till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt, 
to speak to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to 
him ? He said, " No, they never went that were young men;" 
none went thither but the old men, who he called their Oowookakee 
— that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; 
and that they went to say (so he called saying prayers), and 
then came back and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I 
observed that there is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded 
ignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret 
religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the 
clergy, is not only to be found in the Eoman, but perhaps among 
all religions in the world, even among the most brutish and bar- 
barous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and told 
him that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains 
to say to their god Benamuckee was a cheat, and their bringing 
word from thence what he said was much more so; that if they 
met with any answer, or spoke with any one there, it must be with 
an evil spirit. And then I entered into a long discourse with \^^ 
about the devil — the original of him, his rebellion against God, ^^ 
enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the i^^ 
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as Go^' 
and the many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind ^

affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations as to caus^

in the notion of an evil spirit, of his original, his being, 
re, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to 
in to do sd too; and the poor creature puzzled me once 
. manner, by a question merely natural and innocent, that 
knew what to say to him. I had been talking a great 
\dm of the power of God, his omnipotence, his dreadful 
to sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of 
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us and all 
i in. a moment; and he listened with great seriousness to 
e while. 

this I had been telling him how the devil was God's 
I the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to 
e good designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of 
I the world, and the like. "Well," says Friday; "but 
Grod is so strong, so great, is he i;iot much strong, much

than the devil, God is above the devil, and therefore we 
jrod to tread him down under our feet, and enable us to

" if God much strong, much might as the devil, why God 
le devil, so make him no more do wicked?" 
strangely surprised at his question; and, after all, though 
)w an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill

nld not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, 
id him what he said. But he was too earnest for an

ken words as above. By this time I had recovered my- 
Je, and I said, "God will at last punish him severely; he 
5d for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottomless 
veil with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday;

a while at this. "Well, well," says he, mighty aflfect: 
"that well; so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, rep 
pardon all." Here I was run down again by him to 
degree; and it was a testimony to me how the mere n< 
nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to tl: 
ledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the 
being of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet not] 
divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Chris 
a redemption purchased for us, of a Mediator of the new c 
and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God's throne; 
nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in 1 
and that, therefore, the Gospel of our Lord and Savioi 
Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, j 
for the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the al 
necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving kr 
of God and the means oi salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me 
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion < 
out; then sending him for something a good way off, I t 
prayed to God that he would enable me to instruct savh 
poor savage; assisting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor 
creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God ii 
reconciling him to himself; and would guide me to speak s 
from the Word of God, as his conscience might be convii 
eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again 
entered into a long discourse with him upon the subjec 
redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, and 
doctrine of the gospel preached from Heaven; namely, oi 
ance towards God and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus, 
explained to him, as well as I could, why our blessed R 
took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of A 
and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no shar

Israel, and the like.

A SCiQBST JOY. 229 

I took for tlu9 poor preature's instruction; and must 
acbowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same principle 
will find, that, in laying things open to him, I really informed and 
instructed myself in many things that either I did not know or 
had not fully considered before, but which occurred naturally to 
my mind upon my searching into them for the information of this 
poor savage. And I had more aflfection in my inquiry after things 
upon this occasion than ever I felt before; so that whether this 
poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had great reason 
to be thankful that ever he came to me. My grief set lighter 
upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure; 
and when I reflected that in this solitary life which I had been 
confined to, I had not only been moved myself to look up to 
Heaven, and to seek to the hand that had brought me there, but 
^as now to be made an instrument under Providence to save the 
life, and, for aught I know, the soul of a poor savs^e, and bring 
him to the true knowledge of religion and of the Christian doc- 
trine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom is life 
eternal; — I say, when I reflected upon all these things, a secret 
Joy ran through every part of my soul; and I frequently rejoiced 
that ever I was brought to this place, which I had so often 
thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly 
^ve befallen me. 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my

bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understj 
enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great 
of sincere repentance for my sins and laying hold of a S 
for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in practi( 
obedience to all God's commands, and this without any t

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife and contention 
has happened in the world about religion, whether nice 
doctrines or schemes of church government, they were all pe 
useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they have been to 
rest in the world. We had the sure guide to heaven — name 
Word of God; and we had, blessed be God, comfortable vi 
the Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by his 
leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and o\ 
to the instruction of his Word; and I cannot see the least u

frog; instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not 
only as good a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon 
other occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, and particularly 
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped 
God, how we behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships 
to all parts of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck 
which I had been on board of, and showed him as near as I could 
the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces before, 
and gone. 

I showed him the ruins of our boat which we lost when we 
escaped, and which I could pot stir with my whole strength then, 
but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, 
Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked 
him what it was he studied upon. At last says he, " Me see such 
boat like come to place at my nation." 

I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had 
examined farther into it, I understood by him that a boat, such as 
that had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived; 
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. 
I presently imagined that some European ship must have been 
cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and 
drive ashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought of men 
Daaking escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might 
come; so I only inquired after a description of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me 
l>etter to understand him when he added, with some warmth, "We 
^ve the white mans from drown." Then I presently asked him 
if there were- any white mans, as he called them, in the boat. 
**Yes," he said; "the boat full of white mans." I asked him how 
^Jiany. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him then 
'^hat became of them. He told me, "They live, they dwell at my 
nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined 
that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast 
*^ay in sight of my island, as I now call it; and who, after the 
8hip was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had

saved themaelvea in their boat, and were lauded upon that wild 
shore among the savages. 

Upon this I enquired of him more critically what was become 
of them. He assured me they lived still there; that they had 
been there about four years; that the savages let them alone, and 
gave them victuals to live. I asked him how it came to^pass they 
did not kill them and eat them. He said, "No, they make 
brother with them ; " that is, as I understood him, a truce. And 
then he added, " They no eat mans but when make the war fight;" 
that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to fight 
with them and are taken in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that being on the top 
of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have 
said, I had in a clear day discovered the main, or continent of 
America, Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very 
earnestly towards the mainland, and in a kind of surprise fall^ a 
jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some 
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter. "Oh, 
joy!" says he, "oh, glad! There see my country, there my 
nation!" 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his 
face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a 
strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country 
again; and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts 
into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new man 
Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that if Friday 
could get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget 
all his religion, but all his obligation to me; and would be forward 
enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come bacJt 
perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast m^^ 
me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those o* 
his enemies when they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for whi^^ 
I was very sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy increas^^ 
and held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and n^

could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being 
upon the continent, and a good company together, better than 1 
could from an island forty miles off the shore and alone without 
help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by way 
of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to go back to 
his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate, which 
lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared it of water, 
for I always kept it sunk in the water, I brought it out, showed 
it him, and we both went into it 

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it, would 
make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could. So when he 
was in, I said to him, " Well now, Friday, shall we go to your 
nation 1" He looked very dull at my sajdng so; which it seems 
was because he thought the boat too small to go so far. I told 
him then I had a bigger. So the next day I went to the pla«e 
where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not 
get into water. He said that was big enough. But then, as I 
had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty 
years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner 
rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and 
would carry "much enough vittle, drink, bread;" that was his 
way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of 
going over with him to the continent, that I told him we would 
go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it He 
answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked 
him, "What was the matter with him?" He asked me again thus, 
"Why you angry mad with Friday, what me done?" I asked 
him what he meant; I told him I was not angry with him »t 
all. "No angry! no angry!" says he, repeating the words several 
times; "why send Friday home away to my nation?" "Why, 
says I, "Friday, did you not say you wished you were there? 
"Yes, yes," says he; "wish be both there — no wish Friday there, 
no master there." In a word, he would not think of going the^* 
without me. "I go there, Friday!" says I; "what shall I do 
there?" He turned very quick upon me at this. " You do p^ 
deal much good," says he; "you teach wild mans be good sober

tame mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new 
lifa" "Alas! Friday,'' says I, "thou knowest not what thou 
sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself." " Yes, yes," says he; 
"70U teachee me good, you teachee them good." "No, no, 
Friday," says I; "you shall go without me; leave me here to live 
l)y myself, as I did before." He looked confused again at that 
»^ord, and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, 
le takes it up hastily, and gives it me. " What must I do with 
iisi" says I to him. "You take kill Friday," says he. "What 
nust I kill you for 1 " said I again. He returns very quick, " What 
^ou send Friday away for? — take kill Friday, no send Friday 
tway." This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his 
syes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in 
lim to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and 
>ften after, that I would never send him away from me, if he was 
nlling to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection 
me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all 
he foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in 
is ardent affection to the people and his hopes of my doing them 
ood; a thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not 
be least thought or intention or desire of undertaking it. But 
till I found a strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as 
bove, founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse — 
amely, that there were seventeen bearded men there; and there- 
)re, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday to find 
ut a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua or canoe 
3 undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the island 
5 liave built a little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes, but even of 
ood large vessels. But the main thing I looked at, was to get 
ne so near the water that we might launch it when it was made, 
avoid the mistake I committed at first. 

At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew much 
better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell, 
^ this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it 
'^as very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the 
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell.

the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay by a certain 
qnantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage ; and in- 
tended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock and 
lannch out our boat I was busy one morning upon something 
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the sea- 
shore and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise — a thing which 
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as 
the flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came running 
back, and flew over my. outer wall or fence like one that felt not 
h ground or the steps he set his feet on; and before I had time 
» speak to him, he cries out to me, "0 master! master! — 
«rrow!— bad !" "What's the matter, Friday?" says L " 0— 
'onder — there," says he; "one, two, three canoe! — one, two, 
bree!" By his way of speaking I concluded there were six; but 
n inquiry, I found it was but three. " Well, Friday," says I, "do 
ot be frighted." So I heartened him up as well as I could, 
[owever, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared; for 
othing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, 
nd would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow 
rembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I com- 
Drted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much 
iinger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him : " But," 
ays I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, 
''riday]" "Me shoot," says he; "but there come many great 
lumber." "No matter for that," said I again; "our guns will 
right them that we do not kill;" so I asked him, "Whether, if I 
^ved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, 
aid do just as I bid him?" He said, " Me die, when you bid die, 
laaster." So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave 
lim; for I had been so good a husband of my rum that I had a 
^at deal left. When he had drank it, I made him take the two 
owling-pieces, which we always carried, and load them "wdth large

240 THE SAVAGES AGAIN. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective^lass, 
and went up to the side of the hill to see what I could diBCoyer. 
And I found quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty 
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole 
business seemed to be the triumphal banquet upon these three 
human bodies (a barbarous feast indeed), but nothing more than 
as I had observed was usual with them. 

I observed, also, that they were landed, not where they had 
done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where 
the shore was low, and where a thick wood came close ahnost 
down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman 
errand these wretches came about, filled me with such indigna- 
tion, that I came down again to Friday and told him I was 
resolved to go down to them and kill them all; and asked him 
if he would stand by me ? He was now gotten over his fright, 
and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, 
he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, " he would die, when 
I bid die." 

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms which I 
had charged, as before, between us. I gave Friday one pistol to 
stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I took 
one pistol and the other three myself; and in this posture we 
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and 
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullet And as 
to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, 
or shoot, or do anything till I bid him; and in the meantime not 
to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my rigbt 
hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get intwthe 
wood; so that I might come within shot of them before I fihould 
be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, 
I began to abate my resolution. I do not mean that I entertained 
any fear of their number; for as they were naked, unarro^ 
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them — nay, though I ^^ 
been alone; but it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what 
occEision, much less what necessity, I was in to go and dip wy 
hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done nor in*

me any wrong — who as to me were innocent; and whose 
barbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token, 
indeed, of God's having left them, with the other nations of that 
part of the world, to such stupidity and to such inhuman courses, 
but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, 
much less an executioner of his justice : that whenever he thought 
fit, he would take the cause into his own hands, and by national 
vengeance punish them as a people for national crimes; but that, 
in the meantime, it was none of my business : that it was true 
Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in 
a state of war with those very particular people, and it was lawful 
for him to attack them; but I could not say the same with respect 
to me. These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts, 
all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and place 
myself near them, that I might observe their barbarous feast, and 
that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless some- 
thing oflfered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I 
would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all possible 
Wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched 
till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to 
ftem; only that one comer of the wood lay between me and them. 
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which 
^as just at the comer of the wood, I bade him go to the tree and 
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing. 
Be did so, and came immediately back to me and told me they 
J^ht be plainly viewed there; that they were all about their fire, 
^ting the flesh of one of their prisoners; and that another lay 
l>ound upon the sand, a little from them, which he said they would 
kill next, and which fired all the very soul within me. He told 
^e it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men 
^ho he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat. 
I was filled with horror at the very naming the white bearded man, 
^d going to the tree I saw plainly by my glass a white man who 
M upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied 
^th flags, or things like rushes; and that he was a European, and 
had clothes on.

242 THE SAVAGES ATTACKED. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about 
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by 
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and 
that then I should be within half shot of them: so I withheld my 
passion, though I was, indeed, enraged to the highest degree, and 
going back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which 
held all the way till I came to the other tree; and then I came to 
a little rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the 
distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of the dreadful 
wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had 
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and I 
him perhaps limb by limb to their fire, and they were st( 
down to untie the bands at his feet I turned to Friday. "Now, 
Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee." Friday said he would 
" Then, Friday," says I, " do exactly as you see me do— fail in 
nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling- 
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with 
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do 
the like. Then asking him if he was ready, he said, "Yes. 
" Then fire at them," said I; and the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that 
he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on 
my side, I killed one and wounded two. They were, you may he 
sure, in a dreadful consternation; and all of them who were not 
hurt jumped up upon their feet, but did not immediately bow 
which way to run or which way to look — for they knew not from 
whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon 
me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did. So as 
soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece and took 
up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like; he sees me cock 
and present; he (did the same again. " Are you ready, Friday^ 
said I. "Yes," says he. " Let fly, then," says I, "in the nawe 
of God!" and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches. 
and so did Friday. And as our pieces were now loaded ^'^"^ 
what I called swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we found only t^^ 
drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran about

instant For the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so 
the poor creatures were so much frighted with the noise of our 
pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement and fear; and had 
no more power to attempt their own escape than their flesh had 
to resist our shot And that was the case of those five that Friday 
shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they 
received, so the other two fell with the fright 

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being vilHng 
to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my 
pistol and sword. So I called to Friday, and bade him run up to 
the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay 
there that had been discharged — which he did with great swiftness; 
and then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all the 
rest again, and bade them come to me when they wanted. While 
I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement 
between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him 
with one of their great wooden swords, — the same weapon that 
was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it The 
Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, 
though weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him 
two great wounds on his head; but the savage, being a stout lusty 
fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down (being faint), 
and was wringing my sword out of his hand, when the Spaniard, 
though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from 
his girdle, shot the savage through the body and killed him upon 
the spot, before I, who was running to help him, could come near 
him. 

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches 
with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he 
despatched those three who, as I said before, were wounded at 
first and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with. And the 
Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling- 
pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages, and wounded 
them both: but as he was not able to run, they both got fio^

Dunded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with 
I his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which 
ffee in the canoe, with one wounded, who we know not whether

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun- 
iot; and though Friday made two or three shot at them, I did 
lot find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me 
Ake one of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was very 
^ous about their escape, lest, canying the news home to their 
>eople, they should come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred 
'f their canoes, and devour us by mere multituda So I consented 
pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I 
umped in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I was in the 
Mice I was surprised to find another poor creature lie there alive,

^ost dead with fear, not knowing what the matter was; for he 
^^ not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was 
ie<i so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he 
ad really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which they had 
■^^und him with, and would have helped him up; but he could 
K>t stand or speak^ but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems 
^ that he was only unbound in order to be killed.

246 FRIDAY FINDS HIS FATHER. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and teD 
him of his deliverance, and pulling out my bottle, made him give 
the poor wretch a dram; which, with the news of his being delivered, 
revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to 
hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved anyone 
to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, 1

cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head, and then 
sung and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a 
good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what 
was the matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me 
that it was his father ! 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what 
ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the 
sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death; no^ 
indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his affection afttf 
this— for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great m^^y

times. When he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open 
bis breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom half an 
bour together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, 
wbicb were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and 
rubbed them with his hands; and I perceiving what the case was, 
gave bim some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did 
them a great deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the 
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight. And it 
v^as happy for us that we did not; for it blew so hard within 
two hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of their 
way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that from the 
north-west, which was against them, that I could not suppose 
their boat could live, or that they ever reached to their own 
coast 

But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his father that I 
could not find in my heart to take him off for some tima But 
after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and 
became jumping and laughing and pleased to the highest extreme. 
Then I asked him if he had given his father any bread 1 He shook 
lis head and said, " None. Ugly dog eat all up self." So I gave 
lima cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; I 
also gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but 
^ed it to his father. I had in my pocket also two or three 
lunches of my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his 
father. He had no sooner given his father these raisins but I saw 
lim come out of the boat and run away as if he had been bewitched, 
keran at such a rate — for he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that 
€ver I saw; I say, he run at such a rate that he was out of sight, 
as it were, in an instant; and though I called, and hallooed too, 
after him, it was all one, away he went, and in a quarter of an hour 
I saw bim come back again, though not so fast as he went; and as 
he came nearer, I found his pace was slacker because he had some- 
^ng in his hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had been quite home for

Crusoe's sovereignty. 249 

along the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew 
pretty hard too. So he brought them both safe into our creek; 
and leaving him in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. 
And as he passed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he 
went] He told me, "Go fetch more boat" So away he went like 
the wind, for sure never man or horse run like him; and he had the 
other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land. So 
he wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests out of 
the boat, which he did. But they were neither of them able to 
walk, so that poor Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to 
Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I 
soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and 
I carried them up both together upon it between us. But when 
we got them to the outside of our wall or fortification, we were at 
a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over; 
and I was resolved not to break it down. So I set to work 
agam; and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a very 
handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with boughs 
of trees, being in the space without our outward fence, and 
between that and the grove of young wood which I had planted. 
And here we made them two beds of such things as I had; 
namely, of good rice straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, 
and another to cover them on each bed. 

My islsoid was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in 
subjects. And it was a merry reflection which I frequently made, 
bow like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my 
own mere property; so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. 
fondly, my people were perfectly subjected; I was absolute lord 
and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to 
*ay down their lives, if there had been occasion of it, for me. 
^ was remarkable, too, we had but three subjects, and they were 
0^ three different religions. My man Friday was a Protestant, his 
^ther was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist. 

However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my domin- 
ions. But this is by the way.

father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, for the Spaniard spc 
language of the savages pretty well

THE SAVAGES* ALARM. 251 

tie manner of their being attacked — the noise and the fire — that 
he believed they would tell their people they were all killed by 
thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man ; and that the two 
which appeared — namely, Fridjay and me — were two heavenly 
spirits or furies come down to destroy them, and not men with 
weapons. This he said he knew, because he heard them all cry 
out so in their language to one another; for it was impossible to 
them to conceive that a man could dart fire and speak thunder, 
and kill at a distance without lifting up the hand, as was done now. 
And this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood since 
by other hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the 
island afterwards; they were so terrified with the accounts given 
by those four men (for it seems they did escape the sea) that they 
believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed 
with fire from the gods! 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under continual 
apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, 
me and all my army; for as we were now four of us, I would 
have ventured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at 
anytime. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of 
their coming wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts of 
* voyage to the main into consideration, being likewise assured by 
Friday's father that I might depend upon good usage from their 
^tion on his account, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious 
^urse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there 
^fife sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who, 
having been cast away and made their escape to that side, lived 
there at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore put to 
1^ for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the par- 
ticulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship 
l^und from the Rio de la Plata to the Havannah, being directed 
^ leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, 
^^ to bring back what European goods they could meet with 
^^®re; that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, who

fectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the 
washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a little,

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and 
if they had formed no design of making any escape? He said

CRUSOE'S PROPOSAL. 253 

I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal 
from me which might tend towards an escape? and whether, if 
they were all here, it might not be done ? I told him with freedom 
I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me if I put my life 
in their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the 
nature of man; nor did men always square their dealings by the 
obligations they had received, so much as they did by the advan- 
tages they expected. I told him it would be very hard that I 
should be the instrument of their deliverance and that they should 
afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Eng- 
lishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity or what 
accident soever brought him thither ; and that I had rather be de- 
livered up to the savages and be devoured alive, than fall into the 
merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. 
I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we 
might with so many hands build a bark large enough to carry us 
all away, either to the Brazils southward, or to the islands or 
Spanish coast northward; but that if in requital they should, 
vhen I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force 
among their own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to 
tbem, and make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuity, that 
their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, 
that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man 
QnHndly that should contribute to their deliverance; and that if 
^ pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and discourse 
^th them about it, and return again, and bring me their answer: 
that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, 
^t they should be absolutely under my leading as their com- 
^der and captain; and that they should swear upon the holy 
'^ments and the gospel to be true to me, and go to such 
Christian country as that I should agree to, and no other; and to 
^ directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were 
lauded safely in such country as I intended; and that he would

^onld never stir from me as long as he lived till I gave him

orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his 
blood if there should happen the least breach of faith among bis 
countrymen. 

He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and 
they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither 
weapons nor clothes nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion 
of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own 
country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, 
they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them if 
possible, and to send the old savage and the Spaniard over to them 
to treat; but when we had gotten all things in a readiness to go, 
the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other 
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it; and by his 
advice put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a 
year. The case was thus : — 

He had been with us now about a month, during which time I 
had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assist- 
ance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what 
stock of com and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than 
sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least without good 
husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to number four. 
But much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, 
as he said, fourteen still alive, should come over. And least of all 
would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, 
for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America So he 
told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and the 
two other dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could 
spafe seed to sow; and that we should wait another harvest, that 
we might have a supply of com for his countrymen when they 
should come; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, 
or not to think themselyes delivered otherwise than out of one 
difficulty into another. " You know," says he, " the children w 
Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out 
of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself that delivered 
them, when they came to want bread in the wilderness."

SEASONABLE CAUTION. 255 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I' 
could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I 
was satisfied with his fidelity. So we fell to digging, all four of 
D8, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; 
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed-time, 
we had gotten as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed 
twentj-two bushels of barley on and sixteen jars of rice — ^which 
was, in short, all the seed we had to spare : nor, indeed, did we 
leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the six months 
that we had to expect our crop; that is to say reckoning from the 
time we set our seed aside for sowing, for it is not to be supposed 
it is six months in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to 
put us out of fear of the savages if they had come, unless their 
number had been very great, we went freely all over the island 
wherever we found occasion; and as here we had our escape or 
deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, 
to have the means of it out of mine. To this purpose I marked 
out several trees which I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday 
*nd his father to cutting them down; and then I caused the 
Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on that afi*air, to over- 
see and direct their work I showed them with what indefatigable 
pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused 
them to do the like, till they had made about a dozen large planks 
^^ good oak, near two foot broad, thirty-five foot long, and from 
two inches to four inches thick. What prodigious labour it took 
^^P. any one may imagine. 

At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame 
goats as much as I could, and to this purpose I made Friday and 
4e Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next 
%; for we took our turns; and by this means we got above 
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for whenever we 
^not the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our flock.

with our bread was a great part of our food; and very good 
toO) I assure you, for it is an exceeding nourishing food 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It yi 
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but b 
it was enough to answer our end; for from our twenty-twol 
of barley we brought in and thrashed out above two hundr 
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice; whi 
store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all 1 
teen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or if we ha 
ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victuall 
ship to have carried us to any part of the world — that is 
of America. 

When we had thus housed and secured our magazine c 
we fell to work to make more wicker-work, namely, great 1 
in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy ai 
terous at this part, and often blamed me that I did nol 
some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw i 
of it. 

And now having a full supply of food for all the guest 
pected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main 
what he could do with those he had left behind him tb 
gave him a strict charge in writing not to bring any me 
him who would not first swear in the presence of himself 
the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, oi 
the person he should find in the island, who was so kind 
for them in order to their deliverance; but that they wouL 
by and defend him against all such attempts, and wherevi 
went would be entirely under and subjected to his com 
and that this should be put in writing, and signed wit 
hands. How we were to have this done,' when I knew th 
neither pen or ink— that indeed was a question which w 
asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old save 
father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which the;

eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good 
liiisbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent 
occasion. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me 
in view of my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some 
%s. I gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes suffi- 
cient for themselves for many days, and sufficient for all their 
Dountrymen for about eight days' time; and wishing them a good 
royage, I see them go, agreeing with them about a signal they 
Wd hang out at their return, by which I should know them again 
^hen they came back at a distance, before they came on shore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was 
it full by my account, in the month of October. But as for an 
2xact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never re- 
X)Ter it again; nor had I kept even the number of years so punc- 
Wy as to be sure that I was right, though, as it proved when I 
ifterwards examined my account, I found I had kept a true reck- 
3ning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a 
rtrange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has 
wt perhaps been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my 
mtch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to me 
ind called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they are come!" 

I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I 
^Qld get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the 
^&y, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, re- 
j^rdless of danger, I went without my arms, which was not my 
'Qstom to do; but I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to 
•iie sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league and half s dis- 
^Dce, standing in for the shore with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as

from the shore. By my observation it appeared plainly to be an 
English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of see- 
ing a ship, and one who I had reason to believe was manned by 
my own countrymen and consequently friends, was such as I can- 
not describe. But yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, 1 
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my 
guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what bad-

it was most probable that they were here upon no good design, 
and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the hands of 
thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, which 
sometime are given him when he may think there is no possibility 
of its being real. That such hints and liotices are given us, I be- 
lieve few that have made any observations of things can deny; that 
they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse 
of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to 
be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are from 
some friendly agent — ^whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate, 
is not the question; and that they are given for our goodi 

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of 
this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret 
admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone inevi- 
tahly, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will see 



I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the boat 
draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at 
for the convenience of landing. However, as they did not come 
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly 
landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at 
about half a mile from me; which was very happy for me, for 
otherwise they would have landed just, as I may say, at my door, 
and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have 
plundered me of all I had. 

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied that they were 

fiiglishmen, at least most of them. One or two I thought were 

Dutch; but it did not prove so. There were in all eleven men, 

^hereof three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, 

bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on 

shore, they took these three out of the boat as prisoners. One of 

the three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures of 

entreaty, affiction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; 

the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, 

and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the

260 THE THREE PRISONERS. 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the 
meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English as 
well as he could, "0 master! you see English mans eat prisoner 
as well as savage mans." — " Why," says I, " Friday, do you think 
they are a going to eat them, then?" — "Yes," says Friday, "they 
will eat them." — "No, no," says I, "Friday; I am afraid they 
will murder them, indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat 
them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, 
but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every 
moment when the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I 
saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as 
the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I 
expected to see him fall every moment, at which all the blood in 
my body seemed to nm chill in my veins. 

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was 
gone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered 
within shot of them, that I might have rescued the three men, for 
I saw no firearms they had among them; but it fell out to my 
mind another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by 
the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about 
the land, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that 
the three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased; 
but they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and 
looked like men in despair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore 
and began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost; 
how wildly I looked round me; what dreadful apprehensions I 
had; and how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being 
devoured by wild beasts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by 
the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms 
and tide, by which I have since been so long nourished and sup- 
ported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how 
certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to 
them, and how efiectually and really they were in a condition of

safety, at the same time that they thought themselves lost, and 
their case desperate. 

So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason 
have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, 
that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but 
that in the worst circumstances they have always something to be 
thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they 
imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means 
hy which they seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high-water when these people came on 
shore, and while partly they stood parlejdng with the prisoners 
they brought, and partly while they rambled about to see what 
kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till the 
tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leav- 
ing their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, 
having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep; however, one 
of them waking sooner than the other, and finding the boat too 
fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who were 
straggling about, upon which they all. soon came to the boat; but 
it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being very 
keavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost 
like a quicksand. 

In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the least of 
*ll mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away 
they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of them 
8ay aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, " Why, let 
ler alone. Jack, can't ye; she will float next tide;" — ^by which I 
^as fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they 
^ere. 

All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir 
5ut of my castle any farther than to my place of observation near 
ie top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how well it was 
OTta&ed. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat 
)uld be on float again, and by that time it would be dark, and I 
ight be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their 
scourse, if they had any.

262 CRUSOE REVEALS HIMSELF. 

In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle as before 
with more caution, knowing I had to do with another 
enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, wh 
made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load hims 
arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave h 
muskets. My figure indeed was very fierce : I had my f o 
goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, 
sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun u] 
shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any 
till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat of 
I found that in short they were all gone straggling into th

tressed men, too anxious fpr their condition to get any sle- 
however, set down under the shelter of a great tree, at 
quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sigl 
of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, ai 
something of their condition. Immediately I marchec 
figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance behin 
formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so « 
spectre-like figure as I did. 

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and the 
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish,

ledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. 

"Well, then," said I, "here are three muskets for you, with 
powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be 
dona" He showed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was 
able; but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I 
thought it was hard venturing anything; but the best method I 
could think of was to fire upon them at once as they lay; and if 
any was not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we 
might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to 
direct the shot 

He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them if he 
could help it, but that those two were incorrigible villains, and 
had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they 
escaped we should be undone still; for they would go on board 
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. " Well 
then," says I, ** necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only 
Way to save our lives." However, seeing him still cautious of 
shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, and manage 
as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, 
and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if 
either of them were of the men who he had said were the heads 
of the mutiny] He said, " No." " Well then," said I, " you may 
let them escape; and Providence seems to have wakened them on 
P^se to save themselves. Now," says I, "if the rest escape 
you, it is your fault." 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in his 
hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, 
^th each man a piece in his hand. The two men who were with

THE captain's DIFFICULTY. 267 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one 
another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole 
histoiy, which he heard with an attention even to amazement; 
and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished 
with provisions and ammunition. And, indeed, as my story is a 
whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. But when 
lie reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have 
been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran 
down his face, and he could not speak a word more. 

After this communication was at end I carried him and his two 
men into my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, 
namely, at the top of the house; where I refreshed them with 
such provisions as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I 
kad made during my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; 
but above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how per- 
fectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, 
having been now planted near twenty years, and the trees growing 
much faster than in England, was become a little wood, and so 
thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it but at that one side 
^iere I had reserved my little winding passage into it. I told 
lim this was my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat 
^ the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon 
^casion, and I would show him that too another time, but at 
present our business was to consider how to recover the ship. 
He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at 
4 loss what measures to take; for that there were still six-and- 
^^enty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed con- 
spiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, 
^ould be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it 
% knowing that if they were reduced they should be brought 
^ the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of the 
^^glish colonies; and that therefore there would be no attacking 
^^^m with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was

268 THE BOAT STAVED. 

into some snare for their surprise as to prevent their landing upon 
us and destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred to me that 
in a little while the ship's crew, wondering what was become of 
their comrades and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in 
their other boat to see for them, and that then perhaps they 
might come armed, and be too strong for us. This he allowed 
was rational 

Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave 
the boat which lay upon the beach, so that they might not carry 
her off; and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless 
as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took 
the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever else 
we found there, which was a bottle of brandy and another of rum, 
a few biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar 
in a piece of canvas — the sugar was five or six pounds; all which 
was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which 
I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, 
sail, and rudder of the boat, were carried away before, as above), 
we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come 
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the 
boat. 

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able 
to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went away 
without the boat, I did not much question to make her fit again 
to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our 
friends the Spaniards, in my way, for I had them still in my 
thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first by 
main strength heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high that the 
tide would not float her off at high-water mark; and besides, had 
broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and 
were sat down musing what we should do; we heard the ship fire 
a gun, and saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signal for 
the boat to come on board; but no boat stirred; and they fired 
several times, making other signals for the boat. 

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless, and

they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my 
glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore; and 
we found as they approached that there was no less than ten men 
in her, and that they had firearms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a 
full view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the men, even 
of their faces; because the tide having set them a httle to the east 
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore to come to the same 
place where the other had landed, and where the boat lay. 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the 
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the 
boat, of whom he said that there were three very honest fellows, 
who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being 
overpowered and frighted. 

But that as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief 
officer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any 
of the ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new 
enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be 
too powerful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances

*^ou that could be was better than that which we were supposed 

to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death

ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered. But ta 
was quickly as much frighted the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but we p€rceive<i 
them all coming on shore again; but with this new measure in 
their conduct, which it seems they consulted together upon— 
namely, to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on 
shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows. 

This was a great disappointment to us; for now we were at a 
loss what to do : for our seizing those seven men on shore would 
be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they 
would then row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would 
be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would 
be lost. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue 
of things might present. The seven men came on shore, and the 
three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from 
the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it was 
impossible for us to come at them in the boat. 

Those that came on shore kept close together, marching towards 
the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay; and we 
could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We 
could have been very glad they would have come nearer to us, so 
that we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone 
farther off, that we might have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they 
could see a great way into the valleys and woods which lay towards 
the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted 
and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to 
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat down 
together under a tree to consider of it. Had they thought fit to 
have gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had done, they 
had done the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions 
of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tcU 
what the danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consul- 
tation of theirs, namely, that perhaps they would all fire a volley 
again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should

all sally upon them just at the juncture when then* pieces were all 
disciaiged, and they would certainly yield, and we should have 
them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal provided it was 
done while we were near enough to come up to them before they 
could load their pieces again. 

ht this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time very 
Solute what course to take. At length I told them there would 
^nothing to be done in my opinion till night, and then, if they 
id not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get 
'tween them and the shore, and so might use some stratagem 
ith them in the boat to get them on shore. 
We waited a great while, though very impatient for their re- 
'ving; and were very uneasy when, after long consultations, we 
r them start all up and march down toward the sea. It seems 
J had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger of 
place, that they resolved to go on board the ship again, give 
ir companions over for lost, and so go on with their intended 
age with the ship. 

is soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it 
)e, as it really was, that they had given over their search, and 
•e for going back again; and the captain, as soon as I told him 
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I 
sently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and 
ich answered my end to a tittle. 

ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little 
3k westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore 
Bn Friday was rescued; and as soon as they came to a little 
Dg ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo 
loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard 
iin; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them 
y should return it again; and then, keeping out of sight, take 
ound, always answering when the other hallooed, to draw them 
far into the island, and among the woods, as possible; and then 
M about again to me by such ways as I directed them, 
Ihey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate 
Uooed; and they presently heard them, and answering, run

274 THE BOAT TAKEN. 

they were presently stopped by the creek, where the wate 
uj>, they could not get over, and called for the boat to c 
and set them over, as indeed I expected. 

When they had set themselves over, I observed that tl 
being gone up a good way into the creek, and, as it w( 
harbour within the land, they took one of the three mei 
her to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, 
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving 
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest y 
and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised 
men before they were aware; one of them lying on shore, 
other being in the boat The fellow on shore was betwec 
ing and waking, and going to start up, the captain, who y\ 
most, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and the 
out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a single 
yield when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade 1 
down; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who y 
so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and there! 
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to jc 
sincerely with us. 

In the meantime Friday and the captain's mate so well i 
their business with the rest, that they drew them, by h 
and answering, from one hill to another, and from one ^ 
another, till they not only heartily tired them, but le 
where they were very sure they could not reach back to 1 
before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily tired the 
also by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in tl 
and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with then 

It was several hours after Friday came back to me bef 
came back to their boat : and we could hear the foremost 
long before they came quite up, calling to those behind 
along; and could also hear them answer and complain h 
and tired they were, and not able to come any faster— wl 
very welcome news to us.

THE mutineers' CONFUSION. 275 

' length they came up to the boat; but 'tis impossible to ex- 
their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in 
•eelr, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone ! We could 
bem call to one another in a most lamentable manner, telling 
other they were gotten into an enchanted island : that either 
were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered; 
there were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all 
away, and devoured. 

hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their 
I great many times ; but no answer. After some time we 
je them, by the little light there was, run about wringing 
nds like men in despair; and that sometimes they would 
sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore 
d walk about again, and so the same thing over again, 
en would fain have me give them leave to fall upon them 
in the dark; but I was willing to take them at some 
^e, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; 
Bcially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our 
Q, knowing the other were very well armed. I resolved 
to see if they did not separate; and therefore to make 
them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday 
captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close to the 
as they could, that they might not be discovered, and get 
them as they could possibly, before they oflfered to fire, 
had not been long in that posture but that the boatswain, 
s the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now 
imself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came 
towards them with two more of their crew. The captain 
sager, as having this principal rogue so much in his power, 
could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to 
of him; for they only heard his tongue before. But when 
Qe nearer, the captain and Friday starting up on their feet, 
b them. 

)oatswain was killed upon the spot, the next man was shot

two after; and the third run for it

anny, which was now eight men, namely, myself generdism, 
Friday my lieutenant-general, the captain and his two men, and 
the three prisoners of war, who we had trusted with anii& 

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they could not 
see our number; and I made the man we had left in the boat, who 
was now one of us, call to them by name, to try if I could bring 
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms; 
which fell out just as we desired. For indeed it was easy to 
think, as their condition then was, they would be very willing to 
capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one of them, 
"Tom Smith, Tom Smith." Tom Smith answered immediately, 
"Who's that, Robinson?" for it seems he knew his voice. The 
other answered, "Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw 
down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this moment" 

"Who must we yield tol where are theyl" says Smith again. 
"Here they are," says he; "here's our captain, and fifty men with 
him, have been hunting you this two hours; the boatswain is 
killed. Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do 
not yield, you are all lost." 

"Will they give us quarter, then," says Tom Smith, "and we 
will yield?" "I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield," says 
Bobinson. So he asked the captain, and the captain then calls 
himself out, " You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down 
your arms immediately and submit, you shall have your hves— all 
but WiU Atkins." 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, "For God's sake, captain, 
give me quarter; what have I done? They have been all as had 
as I;" — which, by the way, was not true neither; for it seems this 
Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when 
they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, 
and giving him injurious language. However, the captain told 
him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the 
governor's mercy; by which he meant me, for they all called ©e 
governor. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their 
lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two 
more, who bound them all; and then my great anny of fifty ^^

THEY SUE FOR QUARTEB. 277 

particularly with those three, were all but eight, came up 
zed upon them all, and upon their boat — only that I kept 
md one more out of sight, for reasons of state, 
lext work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the

th him, and at length upon the farther wickedness of their 
and how certainly it must bring them to misery and dis- 
the end, and perhaps to the gallows. 

aU appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their 
ks for that, he told them, they were none of his prisoners, 
commander of the island; that they thought they had set 
shore in a barren uninhabited island, but it had pleased 
to direct them, that the island was inhabited, and that the 
r was an Englishman : that he might hang them all there 
Based; but as he had given them all quarter, he supposed 
d send them to England to be dealt with there, as justice 
I — except Atkins, who he was commanded by the governor 
e to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in 
ning. 

gh this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired

5 governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him for

id that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows 
I hearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in 
k from them, that they might not see what kind of a 
F they had, and called the captain to me. When I called, 
jood distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, 

to the captain, " Captain, the commander calls for you." 
gently the captain replied, " Tell his excellency I am just 
g." This more perfectly amused them; and they all be- 
hat the commander was just by with his fifty men. 
I the captain's coming to me I told him my project for 
the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolved 
it in execution the next morning.

278 ' THE captain's proposal. 

But in order to execute it with more art, and secure of success, 
I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go 
and take Atkins and two more of thd worst of them, and send 
them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was com- 
mitted to Friday and the two men who came on shore with the 
captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and it was in- 
deed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition. 

The other I ordered to my hower, as I called it, of which I 
have given a full description; and as it was fenced in, and they 
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were upon 
their behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter 
into a parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me 
whether he thought they might be trusted or no to go on board 
and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, 
of the condition they were brought to ; and that though the 
governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present 
action, yet tliat if they were sent to England they would all be 
hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in so 
just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's 
engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be 
accepted by men in their condition. They fell down on their 
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest imprecations, 
that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they 
should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over the 
world ; that they would own him for a father to them as long ^ 
they lived. 

"Well," says the captain, "I must go and tell the governor what 
you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it" ^ 
lie brought me an account of the temper he found them in, ^^ 
that he verily believed they would be faithful 

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he i 
go back again, and choose out five of them, and tell them they 
might see that he did not want men, that he would take out thos^ 
five to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep ^^

THE TERMS ACCEPTED. 279 

Other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle (my 
cave) as hostages, for the fidelity of those five; and that if they 
proved unfaithful in the- execution, the five hostages should be 
hanged in chains alive upon the shore. 

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was 
in earnest. However, they had no way left them but to accept it; 
and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the 
captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: 1. The 
captam, his mate, and passenger; 2. Then the two prisoners of 
the first gang, to whom, having their characters from the captain, 
I had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms; 3. The 
other two who I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but upon 
the captain's motion had now released ; 4. These five released at 
last: so that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners 
in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands 
on board the ship; for as for me and my man Friday, I did not 
thmk it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind, 
and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder and 
supply them with victuals. 

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but 
Friday went in twice a day to them to supply them with neces- 
saries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain 
Stance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the 
captain, who told them I was the person the governor had ordered 
^ look after them, and that it was the governor's pleasure they 
should not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if they did, 
4ey should be fetched into the castle and be laid in irons. So 
^hat as we never sufiered them to see me as governor, so I now 
appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, 
the castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no diflBculty before him but to furnish his 
two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his 
passenger captain of one, with four other men; and himself, and 
Ws mate and five more, went in the other. And they contrived

their business very well, for they came up to the ship about lai 
night As soon as they came within call of the ship, he ma* 
Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off the m* 
and the boat, but that it was a long time before they had fooi 
them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came to t 
ship's side; when the captain and the mate, entering first wi 
their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and a 
penter with the butt-end of their nauskets. Being very faithfti! 
seconded by their men, they secured all the rest that were up 
the main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches 
keep them down who were below, when the other boat and th 
men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the fore-castle of the sh 
and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, maki 
three men they found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the capts 
ordered the mate with three men to break into the round-hoa 
where the new rebel captain lay, and having taken the alarm, v 
gotten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten firearms 
their hands; and when the mate with a crow split open the do 
the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wound 
the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounc 
two more of the men, but killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rushed however into the round-hoc 
wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new capt. 
through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth and came < 
again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word; uj 
which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken eflFectually, with< 
any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered se"' 
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to g 
me notice of his success; which, you may be sure, I was very g 
to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near twc 
the clock in the morning, 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; an^

DELIVERANCE AT HAND. 281 

having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till 
I was something surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently 
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of " Governor, 
governor;" and presently I knew the captain's voice, when climb- 
ing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the 
ship he embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend and deliverer,"

" He stood, pointing to the ship." 



^yshe, "there's your ship; for she is all yours, and so are we and

^e within little more than half a mile of the shore; for they

^ke weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against 
^ie mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the captain 
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I at first landed 
^y rafts, and so landed just at my door. 

Iwas at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I saw 
^y deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all things easy,

SO. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one

word; but as he had taken me in his arms I held fast by him, or 
I should have fallen to the ground. 

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle out of 
his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brougbt 
on purpose for me. After I had drank it, I sat down upon the 
ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good 
while before I could speak a word to him. 

All this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only 
not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind 
tender things to me, to compose me and bring me to myself; but 
such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits 
into confusion. At last it broke out into tears, and in a little 
while after, I recovered my speech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and 
we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man 
sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction 
seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were 
the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing 
the world, and an evidence that the eyes of an Infinite Power 
could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send help 
to the miserable whenever he pleased. 

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven: and 
what heart could forbear to bless him, who had not only iii * 
miraculous manner provided for one in such a wilderness, and ^ 
such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance Di^^ 
always be acknowledged to proceed ? 

When he had talked a while, the captain told me he b*^ 
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, ^ 
such as the wretches that had been so long his masters had ^^ 
plundered him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat, ^ 
bid his men bring the things ashore that were for the goverO^^^' 
and indeed it was a present, as if I had been one not that wa-^ . 
be carried away along with them, but as if I had been to i^ 
upon the island still, and they were to go without me. 

First he had brought me a case of bottles full of excelJ^ < 
cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles ^^ 
two quarts apiece), two pound of excellent good tobacco, tw^*

SEASONABLE SUPPLIES. 283 

good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag 

of pease, and about a hundredweight of biscuit. 

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of 
lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other 
But besides these, and what was a thousand times more 
to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good 
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one 
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which 
had been worn but very little. In a word, he clothed me from 
head to foot 

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may 
bagine, to one in my circumstances. But never was anything in 
the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it 
was to me to wear such clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies past, and after all his good things were 
brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was 
to be done with the prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering 
whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, espe- 
cially two of them, who we knew to be incorrigible and refractory 
to the last degree ; and the captain said, he knew they were such 
wgues that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry them 
away it must be in irons as malefactors to be delivered over to 
justice at the first English colony he could come at. And I found 
that the captain himself was very anxious about it. 

Upon this, I told him that if he desired it I durst undertake to 
^ring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that 
^e should leave them upon the island. " I should be very glad of 
^H" says the captain, " with all my heart" 

"Well," says I, "I will send for them up, and talk with them 
^or you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages— for they 
Were now discharged, their comrades having performed their 
promise; I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the 
"^e men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them 
*ere till I came. 

^fter some time I came thither dressed in my new habit; and 
^0^ I was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain

them I had had a full account of their villanous behaviour to the 
captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were pre- 
paring to commit farther robberies, but that Providence had en- 
snared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the 
pit which they had digged for others. 

I let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized, 
that she lay now in the road; and they might see by-and-by that 
their new captain had received the reward of his villany, for that 
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm. 

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say why 
I should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by my 
commission they could not doubt I had authority to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that 
nothing to say but this, that when they were taken the captain 
promised them their lives ; and they humbly implored iny mercy- 
But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them; for as i^^ 
myself I had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and b*^ 
ts^en passage with the captain to go for England; and as for t*^ 
captain he could not carry them to England other than as prisoi^^ 
in irons to be tried for mutiny and running away with the slJ^ 
the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be t> 
gallows : so that I could not tell which was best for them, unl ^ 
they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they desit** 
that (I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it), I had so^ 
inclination to give them their lives, if they thought they coi^ 
shift on shore. 

They seemed very thankful for it, said they would much ratb^ 
venture to stay there than to be carried to England to be hanged 
So I left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make sotne difficulty of it, 
if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a litfi 
angry with the captain, and told him that they were my prisoner 
not his; and that seeing I had offered them so much favouTsr 
would be as good as my word; and that if he did not think 
to consent to it, I would set them at liberty as I found them, a^ 
if he did not like it, he might take them again if he could cst^ 
them.

PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING. 286 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set 
them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods to the place 
whence they came, and I would leave them some firearms, some 
ammunition, and some directions how they should live very well, 
if they thought fit 

Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship, but told the cap- 
tarn that I would stay that night to prepare my things, and 
desired him to go on board in the meantime and keep all right in 
the ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for me; order- 
ing him in the meantime to cause the new captain, who was killed, 
to be hanged at the yard-arm that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my 
apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them of their 
circumstances. I told them I thought they had made a right 
choice; that if the captain carried them away, they would certainly 
t>e hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging at the yard- 
^nn of the ship^ and told them they had nothing less to expect 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then 

told them I would let them into the story of my living there, and 

pat them into the way of making it easy to them. Accordingly 

I gave them the whole history of the place and of my coming to 

^t; showed them my fortifications, the way I made my bread, 

Planted my com, cured my grapes; and in a word, all that was 

Necessary to make them easy. , I told them the story also of 

tie sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for whom I left 

* fetter, and made them promise to treat them in common with 

^iemselves.

P^^ces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and half of pow- 
^^1^ left; for after the first year or two I used but little and wasted 
^^ne. I gave them a description of the way I managed the goats, 
^d directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both butter 
^d cheese. 

In a word, I gave them every part of my own story. And I 
^Id them I would prevail with the captain to leave them two 
oarrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds, which I told 
them I would have been very glad of; also I gave them the bag

286 BIDS ADIEU TO THE ISLAND. 

of pease which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them 
be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done all this I left them the next day, and went on 
board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not 
weigh that night. The next morning early two of the five men 
came 43wimming to the ship's side, and making a most lamentable 
complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship, for 
God's sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the captain 
to take them on board though he hanged them immediately. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no power without me. 
But after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amend- 
ment, they were taken on board, and were some time after soundly 
whipped and pickled;^ after which they proved very honest and 
quiet fellows. 

Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the tide 
being up, with the things promised to the men; to which the 
captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be 
added; which they took, and were very thankful for. I also en- 
couraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my way to send 
any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island I carried on board for relics 
the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my parrot; 
also I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which 
had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty, or tar- 
nished, and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little 
rubbed and handled; as also the money I found in the wreck ^^ 
the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island the 19th of December, as I found ^y 
the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon itei^ 
and twenty years, two months, and nineteen days; being deliv^^ 
from this second captivity the same day of the month that I ^^

and my mother and all the family extinct, except that I found two 
sisters and two of the children of one of my brothers; and as I 
had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no provision 
made for me : so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or 
assist me; and that little money I had would not do much forme 
as to settUng in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not 
expect; and this was, that the master of the ship, who I had so 
happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and 
cargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners of the 
manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and the ship, they 
invited me to meet them and some other merchants concerned, and 
all together made me a very handsome compliment upon the sub- 
ject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of 
my life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in 
the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come 
by some information of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, 
and of what was become of my partner, who I had reason to sup- 
pose had some years now given me over for dead. 

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in 
April following, my man Friday accompanying me very honestly 
in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon 
all occasions. 

When I came to Lisbon I found out by inquiry, and to my 
particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship who 
first took me up at sea off the shore of Africk. He was now 
grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his son, who was 
far from a young man, into his ship, and who still used the 
Brazil trade. The old man did not know me, and indeed I hardly 
knew him; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, and ^ 
soon brought myself to his remembrance when I told him who 1 
was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance, 1 
inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partn^*

fiijpartner was living, but the trustees who I had joined with him 

to take cognizance of my part were both dead. That, however, 
he believed that I would have a very good account of the improve- 
ment of the plantation : for that, upon the general belief of my 
being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account 
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, 
vrho had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it; one 
third to the King, and two thirds to the monastery of St Augus- 
tine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the con- 
version of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared, 
31 any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it should be restored, 
)nly that the improvement or annual production being distributed 
to charitable uses could not be restored. But he assured me 
that the steward of the King's revenue (from lands) and the pro- 
veedor, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all 
along that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every 
fear a faithful account of the produce, of which they received duly 
Day moiety. 

I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had 
brought the plantation; and whether he thought it might be 
worth looking after? or whether, on my going thither, I should 
Daeet with no obstruction to my possessing my just right in the 
moietyl 

He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the planta- 
^on was improved, but this he knew, that my partner was grown 
exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half of it; and that, to 
tie best of his remembrance, he had heard that the King's third 
^^ niy paxt, which was, it seems, granted away to some other 
Monastery or religious house, amoimted to above two hundred 
^oidores a year: that as to my being restored to a quiet posses- 
^^^ of it, there was no question to be made of that, my partner 
>eing alive to witness my title, and my name being also enrolled 
^ the register of the country. Also, he told me that the sur- 
^^ors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very 
ealthy; and he believed I would not only have their assistance

^of money in their hands for my account; being the produce

of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given 
up as above, which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, 
and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the 
trustees should thus dispose my effects when he knew that I had 
made my will, and had made him, the Poi*tuguese captain, my 
universal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true; but that, as there was no proof of 
my being dead, he could not act as executor until some certain 
account should come of my death, and that, besides, he was not 
willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote; that it was true 
he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and could he 
have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would have 
acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so they 
called the sugar-house), and had given his son, who was now at 
the Brazils, order to do it. 

" But," says the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell 
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest, 
and that is, that believing you were lost, and all the world be- 
lieving so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account 
to me in your name for six or eight of the first years of profits, 
which I received; but there being at that time," says he, "gre*^ 
disbursements for increasing the works, building an ingenw, and 
buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards 
it produced. However," says the old man, "I shall give you* 
true account of what I have received in all, and how I have dis- 
posed of it." 

After a few days' farther conference with this ancient friend, he 
brought me an account of the six first years* income of my pl^^ 
lion, signed by my partner and the merchants* trustees, being 
always delivered in goods, namely, tobacco in roll, and sugtf ^ 
chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the consequence oi *

income considerably increased, but, as above, the disburseu^®^

292 THE BRAZIL PLANTATION. 

he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weepmg at what he add 
to me. Therefore first I asked him if his circumstances admitted 
him to spare so much money at that time, and if it would not 
straiten him] He told me he could not say but it might straiten 
him a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might want 
it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of aflfection, and I could 
hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, I took an hun- 
dred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a 
receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, and told him ii 
ever I had possession of the plantation, I would return the other 
to him also, as indeed I afterwards did : and that as to the bill of 
sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by any means; 
but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to 
pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave me 
reason to expect, I would never have a penny more from him. 

When this was past, the old man began to ask me if he should 
put me into a method to make my claim to my plantation? 1 
told him I thought to go over to it myself. He said I might do 
so if I pleased, but that if I did not, there were ways enough to 
secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to tny 
use. And as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready ^ 
go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public regis^^ 
with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that I was alive, and tha^ 
I was the same person who took up the land for the planting ^^ 
said plantation at first. 

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procurati^^ 
affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his writing ^ 
merchant of his acquaintance at the place, and then proposed ^ 
staying with him till an account came of the return. 

Never anything was more honourable than the proceeA^^* 
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I receiv^ 
large packet from the survivors of my trustees the merchants 
whose account I went to sea, in which were the following partic?*^ 
letters and papers enclosed. 

First, There was the account current of the produce of my f ^ 
or plantation from the year when their fathers had balanced ^^

OLD ACCOUNTS. 293 

my old Portugal captain, being for six years. The balance ap- 
peared to be 1174 moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years more while they 
kept the effects in their hands, before the Government claimed 
the administration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, 
which they call civil death; and the balance of this, the value of 
the plantation increasing, amounted to as many crusadoes^ as 
made 3241 moidores. 

Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Augustine's account, who 
had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not being 
to account for what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly 
declared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he acknow- 
to my account; as to the King's part, that refunded 



There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very 

affectionately upon my being alive; giving me an account how the 

estate was improved, and what it produced a year, with a particular 

of the number of squares or acres that it contained, how planted, 

how many slaves there were upon it; and making two and twenty 

crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to 

thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very 

passionately to come over and take possession of my own, and in 

the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver my 

effects if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender 

of his friendship and that of his family, and sent me as a present 

seven fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from 

-^rica by some other ship which he had sent thither, and who, it 

^^ms, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also five 

<^hests of excellent sweetmeats, and an hundred pieces of gold un- 

^oiiied, not quite so large as moidores. 

By the same fleet my two merchant trustees shipped me 1200 
^"ests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole 
^count in gold.

294 CRUSOE'S SUDDEN WEALTH. 

ings of my very heart when I looked over these letters, and espe- 
cially when I found all my wealth about me. For as the Brazil 
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters 
brought my goods, and the effects were safe in the river before 
the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew 
sick; and had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial,! 
believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature and I had 
died upon the spot 

Nay, after that I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till 
a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of my 
illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood,^ after which I 
had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe if it had not been 
eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits,^ I should 
have died. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above £5000 sterlisg in 
money; and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils 
of above £1000 a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England. 
And in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to 
understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it 

The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, 
my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my 
distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at ^^ 
end. I showed him all that was sent me; I told him that ti©^ 
to the providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it '^^ 
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him, whi^^''^ 
would do a hundredfold. So I first returned to him the ^ 
moidores I had received of him, then I sent for a notary, ^ 
caused him to draw up a general release or discharge for the "^ 
moidores which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the ful ^ 
and firmest manner possible: after which I caused a procurat^^ 
to be drawn empowering him to be my receiver of the ano^^ 
profits of my plantation, and appointing my partner to account^^ 
him, and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my nai^^

WHAT TO DO WITH IT. 296 

and a clause in the end, being a grant of 100 moidores a year to 
him during his life out of the effects, and 50 moidores a year to 
his son after him for his life. And thus I requited my old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and 
what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my 
hands; and indeed I had more care upon my head now than I 
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I wanted nothing 
but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted : whereas I 
had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how to 
secure it. I had never a cave now to hide my money in, or a 
place where it might lie without lock or key till it grew mouldy 
and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it. On the 
contrary, I knew not where to put it, or who to trust with it. 
My old patron the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the 
only refuge I had. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon 
tte thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going 
*^ther till I had settled my affairs, and left my effects in some 
^e hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the 
^dow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but 
hen she was in years, and but poor, and for aught I knew might 
^ in debt. So that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to 
iigland myself, and take my effects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and 
ierefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully and to his satis- 
«tion, who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think 
f my poor widow whose husband had been my first benefactor, 
^d she while it was in her power my faithful steward and 
istructor. So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon 
> write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, 
•ut to go find her out, and carry her in money an hundred pounds 
rom me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty by 
:«lling her she should, if I lived, have a farther supply. At the 
same time I sent my two sisters in the country each of them an 
hundred pounds, they being, though not in want, yet not in very 
good circumstances ; one having been married and left a widow, 

and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should

be. But among all my relations or acquaintances I could not yet 
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, 
that I might go away to the Brazils and leave things safe behind 
me ; and this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled 
myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the place; but I 
had some little scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly 
drew me back, of which I shall say more presently. However, it 
was not religion that kept me from going there for the present; 
and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the reUgion of 
the country all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; 
only that now and then having of late thought more of it (than 
formerly) when I began to think of living and dying among them, 
I began to regret my having professed myself a Papist, and thought 
it might not be the best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me 
from going to the Brazils; but that really I did not know with 
whom to leave my effects behind me. So I resolved at last to go 
to England with it; where, if I arrived, I concluded I should 
make some acquaintance, or find some relations that would be 
faithful to me. And accordingly I prepared to go for England with 
all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, the 
Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved to give answers suit- 
able to the just and faithful account of things I had from thencft 
And, first, to the prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of 
thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the 872 moidores 
which was indisposed of; which I desired might be given, 500 to 
the monastery, and 372 to the poor as the prior should direct, 
desiring the good padre s prayers for me, and the like. I wrote 
next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknowledg- 
ment that so much justice and honesty called for. As for sending 
them any present, they were far above having any occasion of it. 
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in ^® 
improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock 
of the works; giving him instructions for his future govem©*^^ 
of my part, according to the powers I had left with my old patron,

SEVERE WEATHER. 299 

^es tiat happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I 

DiQst not omit. 
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain, 

fere willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and to 
see what was worth observing; but it being the latter part of the 
sommer we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the 
iniddle of October. But when we came to the edge of Navarre, 
^e were alarmed at several towns on the way with an account that 
much snow was fallen on the French side of the mountains that 
Bveral travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after 
avmg attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself we found it so indeed; and 
) me that had been always used to a hot climate, and indeed to 
)untries where we could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was 
sofferable. Nor, indeed, was it more painful than it was sur- 
•ising to come but ten days before out of the Old Castile, where 
e weather was not only warm but very hot, and immediately 

feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very keen, so 
verely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing 
id perishing of our fingers and toes. Poor Friday was really 
ghted when he saw the mountains all covered with snow and 
It cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in his 
e. 

To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it continued 
owing with so much violence and so long that the people said 
inter was come before its time : and the roads, which were diffi- 
It before, were now quite impassable ; for, in a word, the snow 
Y in some places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard 
Dzen, as is the case in northern countries, there was no going 
ithout being in danger of being buried alive every step. We 
ayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna ; when, seeing the 
inter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was 
le severest winter all over Europe that had been known in the 
emory of man, I proposed that we should all go away to Font- 
•abia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very 
btle voyage. 

But while we were considering this, there came in four French

300 DANGERS OF THE ROAD. 

gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the 
passes as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide who, 
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought 
them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much 
incommoded with the snow; and where they met with snow in 
any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them \^ 
and their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he would L 
undertake to carry us the same way with no hazard from the snow, . 
provided we were armed sufficiently to protect us from wild | 
beasts; for he said upon these great snows it was frequent for | 
some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountaiiis, j 
being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered | 
with snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such j „ 
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two- 
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from, 
especially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied us 
there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go: 
so we readily agreed to follow him; as did also twelve other 
gentlemen with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, 
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back 
again. 

Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna with our guide, on 
the 15th of November. And indeed I was surprise when, 
instead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the 
same road that we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when, 
being past two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found 
ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was pleasant 
and no snow to be seen. But on a sudden, turning to the left, he 
approached the mountains another way; and though, it is true, 
the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many 
tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we 
were insensibly past the height of the mountains without being 
much encumbered with the snow. And all on a sudden he showed 
us the pleasant fruitful, provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all

ATTACKED BY WOLVES. 301 

Y and a night so fast that we could not travel; but he 

easy, we should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, 
>egan to descend every day, and to come more north than 
.nd so, depending upon our guide, we went on. 

about two hours before night, when, our guide being 
g before us and not just in sight, out rushed three mon- 
)lves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way adjoin- 
bhick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the guide; and 
►een half a mile before us he had been devoured indeed 
3 could have helped him. One of them fastened upon his 
id the other attacked the man with that violence that he 

time or not presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, 
)oed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday 
ict to me, I bid him ride up and see what was the matter, 
as Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud 
iher, "Oh master! oh master!" but, like a bold fellow, 
ictly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf 
eked him into the head. 

happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for 
g been used to that kind of creature in his country, had 
upon him, but went close up to him, and shot him as 
whereas any of us would have fired at a farther distance, 
3 perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shooting 

was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I, and 
alarmed all our company, when with the noise of Friday's 
J heard on both sides the dismallest howling of wolves, 
aoise redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was 
if there had been a prodigious multitude of them: and 
indeed there was not such a few as that we had no cause 
lensions. 

^er, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had 
upon the horse left him immediately, and fled; having 
astened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had 
his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt. The 
eed, was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him 
ce on the arm, and the other time a little above his knee;

302 A bear's qualities. 

and he was just as it were tumbling down by the disorder oi bis 
horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all 
mended our pace, and rid up as fast as the way, which was very 
diflficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As 
soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, i^e 
saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had disen- 
gaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern what 
kind of creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily and in such a surprising 
manner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which 
gave us all (though at first we were surprised and afraid for him) 
the greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy 
creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and 
light, so he has two particular qualities, which generally are the 
rule of his actions. First, as to men, who are not his proper 
prey; I say, not his proper prey, because, though I cannot say 
what excessive hunger might do, which was now their case, the 
ground being all covered with snow; but as to men, he does not 
usually attempt them unless they first attack him. On the con- 
trary, if you meet him in the woods, if you don't meddle with him 
he won't meddle with you. But then you must take care to be 
very civil to him, and give him the road; for he is a very nice 
gentleman, he won't go a step out of his way for a prince. NV» 
if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another way, and 
keep going on; for sometimes if you stop and stand still, and look 
steadily at him, he takes it for an afiront. But if you throw or 
toss anything at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of 
a stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an afiront, and sets all 
his other business aside to pursue his revenge ; for he will have 
satisfaction in point of honour. That is his first quality. The 
next is, that if he be once afironted, he will never leave you night 
or day till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till 
he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up 
to him he was helping him ofi* from his horse — for the man was 
both hurt and frighted, and indeed the last more than the fint—

FRIDAY'S MAN(EUVRES. 303 

^ien, on the sudden, we spied the bear come out of the wood. 
Jid a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I 
^w. We were all a little surprised, when we saw him; but when 
riday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's 
untenance. "Oh! oh! oh!" says Friday, three times, pointing 

him; "oh, master! you give me te leave; me shakee te hand 
ith him; me make you good laugh." 

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. " You fool you," 
ys I, "he will eat you up!" "Eatee me up! eatee me up!" 
fs Friday, twice over again; " me eatee him up; me make you 
od laugL You all stay here; me show you good laugh." So 
»wii he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and put on a 
ir of pumps (as we call the flat shoes ^they wear, and which he 
id in his pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and with his 
in away he flew swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with 
obody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear 
)uld understand him. "Hark ye! hark ye!" says Friday; "me 
[)eakee wit you." We followed at a distance; for now, being 
ame down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we were entered 
vast great forest, where the country was plain and pretty open, 
bough many trees in it scattered here and there. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with 
im quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws at him, and 
it him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he 
lad thrown it against a walL But it answered Friday's end; for 
be rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the 
•ear follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called it. As 
con as the bear felt the stone and saw him, he turns about and 
omes after him, taking devilish long strides, and shuffling along 
t a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling 
allop. Away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he run 
)wards us for help. So we all resolved to fire at once upon the 
Jar, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him heartily 
r bringing the bear back upon us when he was going about his 
m business another way. And especially I was angry that he 
d turned the bear upon us and then run away; and I called

304 A BEAR HUNT. 

out: "You dog," said I, "is this your making us laugh] Come 
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature." He 
hears me, and cries out, "No shoot! no shoot! Stand still; you 
get much laugL" And as the nimble creature run two foot for 
the beast's one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing 
a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; 
and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying liis gun 
down upon the ground at about five or six yards from the bottom 
of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distanca 
The first thing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it 
lie; and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though 
so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, 
of my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, 
till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small 
end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about half-way 
to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the hmb 
of the tree was weaker, " Ha," says he to us, " now you see me 
teachee the bear dance." So he falls a jumping and shaking the 
bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and began 
to look behind him to see how he should get back; then, indeed, 
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a 
great deal. When he sees him stand still, he calls out to him 
again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, "What! 
you no come farther? Pray you come farther." So he left 
jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he had 
understood what he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a 
jumping again, and the bear stopped again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him on the head, 
and I called to Friday to stand still and we would shoot the bear. 
But he cried out earnestly, "0 pray! O pray! no shoot; me 
shoot by and then." He would have said by-and-by. However, 
to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood 
so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could 
not imagine what the fellow would do : for first we thought he 
depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was

306 THE BEAR SHOT. 

with the same hinder end foremost, he come down the tree, grasp- 
ing it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. 
At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon 
the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle 
of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a stone. 

Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh, and 
when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a laughing 
himself very loud. " So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. 
"So you kill them!" says I. "Why, you have no guns." "No," 
says he; " no gun, but shoot, great much long arrow." 

This was indeed a good diversion to us; but we were still in a 
wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we 
hardly knew. The howling of wolves run much in my head; and 
indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of 
which I have said something already, I never heard anything that 
filled me with so much horror. 

These things and the approach of night called us off, or else, as 
Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the 
skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but 
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us, so we left 
him, and went forward on our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep 
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, 
as we heard afterwards, were come down to the forest and plain 
country, pressed by hunger to seek for food; and had done a 
great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the 
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and 
some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide told us, 
if there were any more wolves in the country, we should find them 
there; and this was in a small plain surrounded with woods on 
every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to 
pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to the 
village where we were to lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the ^ 
wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain. ^®

WOLVES AT HAND. 307 

ymthm the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw 
five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after another, as if 
tliej had been in chase of some prey, and had it in view. They 
took no notice of us, and were gone, and out of our sight in a few 
moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched, faint- 
hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed 
there were more wolves a coming. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw 
no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near 
half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into 
the plain we had occasion enough to look about us. The first 
object we met with was a dead horse — that is to say, a poor horse 
which the wolves had killed — and at least a dozen of them at 
work, we could not say eating of him, but picking of his bones 
rather, for they had eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast; neither 
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at 
them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found we 
were like to have more business upon our hands than we were 
aware ot We were not gone half over the plain but we began to 
hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful 
manner; and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on 
<lirectly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line as 
regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce 
inew in what manner to receive them; but found to draw our- 
selves in a close line was the only way; so we formed in a 
moment But that we might not have too much interval, I 
ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the others 
vho had not fired should stand ready to give them a second volley 
immediately if they continued to advance upon us; and that then 
those who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees 
^in, but stand ready with every one a pistol, for we were all 
*nned with a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were by 
tkis method able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time. How- 
ever, at present we had no necessity; for upon firing the first 
volley the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the

and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones, who we 
found struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with our 
swords; which answered our expectation, for the crying and howl- 
ing they made was better understood by their fellows, so that 
they all fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and 
had it been daylight, we had killed many more. The field of 
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again ; for we had still 
near a league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and 
yell in the woods, as we went, several times, and sometimes we 
fancied we saw some of them; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we 
were not certain: so in about an hour more we came to the 
town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, 
and all in arms; for it seems that, the night before, the wolves 
and some bears had broken into the village in the night, and put 
them in a terrible fright, and they were obliged to keep guard 
night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, 
and indeed their people.

with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther ;

vhere we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and 
no snow, no wolves, or anything like them. But when we told 
oar story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was 
ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, especially 
^hen the snow lay on the ground. But they inquired much what

that way in such a severe season; and told us it was very much

^ing their prey; and that at other times they are really afraid 
o' a gun; but the being excessive hungry, and raging on that 
'^unt, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them sense-

had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas 
had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired as 
horsemen, they would not have taken the horses for so much their 
own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise: and withal 
they told, that at last, if we had stood all together, and left our 
horses, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that 
we might have come off safe, especially having our firearms in our 
hands, and being so many in number. 

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for 
seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed 
to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, 1 gave 
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe I shall never care to 
cross those mountains again. I think I would much rather go a 
thousand leagues by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm 
once a week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage 
through France, nothing but what other travellers have given an 
account of with much more advantage than I can. I travelled 
from Toulouse to Paris, and without any considerable stay, came 
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of January, after 
having had a severe cold season to travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little 
time all my new discovered estate safe about me, the bills of 
exchange which I brought with me having been very cunently 
paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient 
widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought 
no pains too much or care too great to employ for me: and I 
trusted her so entirely with everything that I was perfectly easy 
as to the security of my effects; and indeed I was very happy 
from my beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity 
of this good gentlewomaa 

And now I began to think of leaving my effects with tbi^

THE FURTHER ADVENTURES 

OF 

EOBINSON CEUSOE; 

BEING THE SECOND AND LAST PAET OF HIS LIFE. 



AT homely proverb used on so many occasions in England, 
aely, " That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the 
b," was never more verified than in the story of my life. Any 
would think that after thirty-five years' affliction and a variety 
unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went 
mgh before, and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment 
he fulness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might 
flowed me to have had experience of every state of middle 
and to know which was most adapted to make a man completely 
py: I say, after all this, any one would have thought that the 
ve propensity to rambling, which I gave an account of in my 

setting out into the world, to have been so predominant in 
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be fully 
mated, or at least condensed, and I might at sixty-one years 
?e have been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done 
uring life and fortune any more. 
iy, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken 

in me ; for I had no f ortime to make, I had nothing to seek 
ad gained ten thousand pound, I had been no richer; for I had 
iy sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to : and that 
I was visibly increasing; for having no great family, I could 
pend the income of what I had, unless I would set up for an 
asive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, 
y, and the like, which were things I had no notion of, or incli- 
n to; so that I had nothing indeed to do but to sit still, and

desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, afid the^ 
left there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it al 
and my imagination run upon it all day; it was uppermoa 
my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and strong] 
it, that I talked of it out of sleep. In short, nothinj 
remove it out of my mind; it even broke so violently into 
discourses, that it made my conversation tiresome: for 
talk of nothing else; all my discourse run into it, even tc 
tinence, and I saw it myself. 

I have often heard persons of good judgment say that 
stir people make in the world about ghosts and appari 
owing to the strength of imagination and the powerful oj 
of fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as a s] 
pearing, or a ghost walking, and the like: that people's 
affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased 
so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying, upc 
extraordinary circumstances, that they see them, talk to Ui( 
are answered by them; when, in truth, there is nothi 
shadow and vapour in the thing, and they really know nol 
the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there i 
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of peo^ 
they are dead : or whether there is anything in the stori

HIS STRANGE DREAM. 319 

left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked 
at them so steadily, though I was broad awake, as at persons just 
before me; and this I did till I often frighted myself with the 
images my fancy represented to me. One time in my sleep I had 
the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively related to me 
by the first Spaniard and Friday's father, that it was surprising. 
They told me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the 
Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid 
up, on purpose to distress and starve them; things that I had 
never heard of, and that indeed were never all of them true in 
fact But it was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to 
me, that to the hour I saw them I could not be persuaded but 
that it was or would be true; also how I resented it, when the 
Spaniard complained to me, and how I brought them to justice, 
tried them before me, and ordered them all three to be hanged. 
What there was really in this shall be seen in its place; for how- 
ever 1 came to form such things in my dream, and what secret 
converse of spirits injected it, yet there was very much of it true. 
I say, I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and speci- 
fically true; but the general part was so true, the base, villanous 
behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such, and had been 
^ much worse than all I can describe, that the dream had too 
much similitude of the fact; and as I would afterwards have 
punished them severely, so if I had hanged them all I had been 
much in the right, and should have been justifiable both by the 
^W8 of God and man. 

But to return to my story. In this kind of temper I had lived 
^me years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no 
^eable diversion, but what had something or other of this in it; 
^o that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told 
^e very seriously one night that she believed there was some 
^ret powerful impulse of Providence upon me which had deter- 
ged me to go thither again; and that she found nothing hindered 
^y going but my being engaged to a wife and children. She told 
^e that it was true she could not think of parting with me, but 
^ she was assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing 
I vould do, so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined

of tie vapours, and I began to consider what I was adoing. I 
corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself 
sedately what business I had, after threescore years, and after such 
a ]}!e of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy 
and easy a manner, I say, what business I had to rush into new 
iazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only for youth and 
poverty to run into? 

With those thoughts, I considered my new engagement, that I 
had a wife, one child bom, and my wife then great with child of 
another; that I had all the world could give me, and had no need 
to seek hazards for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought 
to think rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking to 
increase it; that as to what my wife had said, of its being an im- 
pulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had 
no notion of that : so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled 
with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I 
believe people may always do in like cases, if they will; and, in 
a word, I conquered it; composed myself with such arguments as 
occurred to my thought, and which my present condition furnished 
me plentifully with, and particularly, as the most effectual method, 
1 resolved to divert myself with other things, and to engage in 
some business that might effectually tie me up from any more 
excursions of this kind; for I found that thing return upon me 
cMefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or anything of moment 
^mediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the country of Bedford, 
*iid resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient 
f^ouse upon it; and the land about it I found was capable of great 
^provement, and that it was many ways suited to my inclination, 
^iich delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving 
^^ land : and particularly, being an inland country, I was removed 
^^'om conversing among ships, sailors, and things relating to the 
^^naote part of the world. In a word, I went down to my farm, 
^ttled my family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, 
*^orses, cows, sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became in one 
half year a mere country gentleman. My thoughts were entirely 
^ken up in managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclos-

upon me inevitable and incurable, but drove me by its con- 
sequences into a deep relapse into the wandering disposition; 
which, as I may say, being bom in my very blood, soon recovered 
its hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distemper, came 
on with an irresistible force upon me, so that nothing could make 
anymore impression upon me. This blow was the loss of my 
wife. 

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, give 
a character of her particular virtues, and make my court to the 
sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, 
the stay of all my affairs; the centre of all my enterprises; the 
engine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy compass I 
was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that flut- 
tered in my head, as above; and did more to guide my rambling 
genius than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a friend's 
counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. I was happy 
in listening to her tears and in being moved by her entreaties, and 
^ the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss 
of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me. 

^ ^as as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the 

brazils when I went first on shore there; and as much alone, 

except as to the assistance of servants, as I was in my island. I 

'^ew neither what to do or what not to do. I saw the world 

"Qsy round me; one part labouring for bread, and the other part 

^^luandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures; equally miserable, 

'^use the end they proposed still fled from them; for the man 

^^ pleasure every day surfeited of his vice, and heaped up work

laboured with; so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living

of daily bread.

HIS nephew's project. 325 

hthmg can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of 
tie existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second 
caases with the ideas of things which we form in our minds per- 
fectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the world. My 
nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was 
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his 
thoughts to say, when that very morning before he came to me I 
had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every 
part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution — 
namely, that I would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea- 
captain, and so, if it was rational and practicable, I would go and 
see the island again, and see what was become of my people there. 
1 had pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the place, and 
carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a patent for the possession, 
»nd I know not what; when in the middle of all this in comes my 
nephew, as I have said, with his project of carrying me thither in 
lis way to the East Indies. 
I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him, 
'What devil," said I "sent you of this unlucky errand]" My 
nephew startled as if he had been frighted at first; but perceiv- 
ig I was not much displeased with the proposal, he recovered 
imself. " I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir," says 
e; "I daresay you would be pleased to see your new colony there, 
'here you once reigned with more felicity than most of your 
rother monarchs in the world." 
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper — that is 

> say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so 
inch — that I told him, in few words, if he agreed with the mer- 
iants I would go with him. But I told him I would not promise 

> go any farther than my own island. " Why, sir," says he, 
you don't want to be left there again, I hope?" "Why," said I, 
can you not take me up again in your return?" He told me 

could not be possible that the merchants would allow him to 
ime that way with a loaden ship of such value, it being a month's 
ill out of his way, and might be three or four. " Besides, sir, if 
should miscarry," said he, "and not return at all, then you would

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for

voyage, but also in settling my family affairs for my

ier to this I made my will, and settled the estate I had in 
lanner for my children, and placed in such hands, that I 
ectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them,

idow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care : 
h she richly deserved, for no mother could have taken

I came home, I also lived to thank her for it. 
jphew was ready to sail about the beginning of January,

isiderable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my

I carried with me some servants, who I purposed to place 
inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my 
3unt while I stayed, and either to leave them there or 
3m forward as they should appear willing: particularly I 
wo carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, 
a cooper by trade, but was also a general mechanic, for 
lexterous at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind com, 
od turner and a good pot-maker; he also made anything 
proper to make of earth or of wood; in a word, we called 
Jack-of-all-trades.

I expected to find there, and enough of them as, by my calcula- 
tion, might comfortably supply them for seven years. If I re- 
member right, the materials I carried for clothing them with, 
gloves, hats, g^oes, stockings, and all such things as they could 
want for wearing, amounted to above £200, including some beds, 
bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with 
pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c.; and near £100 more in iron- 
work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every 
necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also an hundred spare arms, muskets, and fozees, 
besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, 
and two pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not what 
time, and what extremities I was providing for, I carried an 
hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron 
part of some pikes and halberds; so that, in short, we had a large 
magazine of all sorts of stores. And I made my nephew carry 
two small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to 
leave behind, if there was occasion, that, when we came there, 
we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies*, 
and, indeed, I at first thought there was need enough for it all, 
and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of th^ 
island, as shall be seen in the course of that story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used t>^ 
meet with, and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrug:^* 
the reader, who, perhaps, may be impatient to hear how matte^^ 
went with my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds, au^^ 
bad weather happened on this first setting out, which made tfen^ 
voyage longer than I expected it at first: and I, who had nev^^-

I might be said to come back again as the voyage was afc'firr""^ 
designed, began to think the same ill fate still attended me, i 
that I was born to be never contented with being on shore^ i 
yet to be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we wei 
obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-bou

FIRE AT SEA. 329 

ty; SO that while we lay here we never touched the ship's 
IS, but rather added to them; here also I took in several live 
, and two cows, and calves, which I resolved, if I had a good 
ige, to put on shore in my island; but we found occasion to 
3se otherwise of them. 

e set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very 
gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about 
20th of February, in the evening late, when the mate, having 
watch, came into the round-house and told us he saw a flash 
re and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us of it, a 
came in and told us the boatswain heard another. This made 
U run out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a while, we h.eard 
ling; but in a few minutes we saw a very great hght, and 
d that there was some very terrible fire at a distanca Im- 
iately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all 
ed that there could be no land that way in which the fire 
red itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at 
i-north-west. Upon this we concluded it must be some ship 
ire at sea; and as, by our hearing the noise of guns just before, 
concluded it could not be far off, we stood directly towards 
^d were presently satisfied we should discover it, because 
farther we sailed the greater the light appeared, though the 
ther being hazy, we could not perceive anything but the hght 
% while. In about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair 
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, 
could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the 
die of the sea. 

was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at 
icquainted with the persons engaged in it I presently recol- 
Bd my former circumstances, and in what condition I was in 
m taken up by the Portugal captain; and how much more 
lorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to 
' ship must be if they had no other ship in company with them. 
3n this I immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, 
soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to 
01 that there was help for them at hand, and that they might 
l.eavour to save themselves in their boat; for though we could

see the flame of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see 
nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning 
ship drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great 
terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in 
the air; and immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all the 
fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk This was a 
terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor 
men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, 
or be in the utmost distress in their boat in the middle of the 
ocean, which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not see. 
However, to direct them as well as I could, I caused hghts to be 
hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could, and which 
we had lanthoms for, and kept firing gims all the night long, 
letting them know by this that there was a ship not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's 
boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there were 
two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water. 
We perceived they rowed, the wind being against them, that they 
saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient^ to let them know we saw 
them, and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on board, 
and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In little 
more than half an hour we came up with them, and in a word, 
took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, women, and 
children; for there were a great many passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant ship of 
three hundred ton, homeward bound from Quebec, in the river of 
Canada. The master gave us a long account of the distress of his 
ship; how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the 
steersman; but on his crying out for help, was, as everybody 
thought, entirely put out, when they found that some sparks of 
the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to 
come at that they could not eflfectually quench it, till, getting ^

ceeded into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the applica- 
tioii they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to go into their boats, which, 
to their great comfort, were pretty large, being their long-boat, 
and a great shallop,^ besides a small skiff, which was of no great 
service to them, other than to get some fresh water and provisions 
into her after they had secured their lives from the fire. They 
had indeed small hope of their lives by getting into these boats at 
that distance from any land, only, as they said well, that they were 
escaped from the fire, and had a possibility that some ship might 
happen to be at sea, and might take them in. They had sails, 
oars, and a compass, and were preparing to make the best of their 
way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty fair, for it 
blew an easy gale at south-east by east. They had as much pro- 
visions and water as, with sparing it so as to be next door to starv- 
ing, might support them about twelve days, in which, if they had no 
bad weather, and no contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he 
might get the Banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take 
some fish to sustain them till they might go on shore. But there 
vere so many chances against them in all these cases, such as 
stonns to overset and founder them, rains and cold to benumb and 
perish their limbs, contrary winds to keep them out and starve 
them, that it must have been next to miraculous if they had 
escaped. 

In the midst of their consultations, every one being hopeless

should, namely, that there was a ship at hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing these guns that they took down their

to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.

strange ecstasies, the variety of postures which these poor delivered 
people run into to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected 
a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described; sighs, tear*

THE people's frenzy. 333 

^as a thousand extravagances in it. There were some in tears ; 
some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the 
greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark -raving and downright 
lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others 
^nging their hands; some were dancing, some singing, some 
laaghiiig, more crying, many quite dumb, not able to speak a 
^ord; others sick and vomiting; several swooning, and ready to 
faint; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving God 



I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that 
were thankful afterward, but the passion was too strong for them 
at first, and they were not able to master it; they were thrown 
into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very few that 
were composed and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps the case may have some addition to it from the par- 
ticular circumstance of that nation they belonged to, I mean the 
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more pas- 
sionate, and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid than in 
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to determine the 
cause; but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it The 
ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found 
Ms father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the surprise of 
^e master and his two companions, who I delivered from the 
^^fllams that set them on shore in the island, came a little way 
towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw 
^Friday,. or anywhere else in my lif& 

It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show 
themselves in that diflferent manner I have mentioned in diflferent 
persons only, but all the variety would appear in a short succession

Would give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left 
him, but kept others from interrupting him also. He continued 
in that posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left 
him, then came to me, as he had said he would, and with a great 
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, 
fchanked me that had, under God, given him and so many miser- 
able creatures their lives. I told him I had no room^ to move 
him to thank God for it, rather than me; but I added, that it was 
nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men, and 
fchat we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had 
blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of his mercy to 
so many of his creatures. 

After this, the young priest applied himself to his country-folks; 
laboured to compose them, persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned 
'with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise 
of their reason; and with some he had success, though others were 
for a time out of all government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be 
useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding them- 
^ives in all the extravagances of their passions; for if an excess 
of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of 
tteir reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and 
^ provoked mind, carry us to ? And, indeed, here I saw reason 
^or keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind, 
^ well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of soitow and 
anger. 

We were something disordered by these extravagances among 
our new guests for the first day ; but when they had been retired, 
lo<igings provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and 
ttey had slept heartily, as most of them did, they were quite

of the priests came to me the next day, and desiring to speak with

should be done with them. And first they told us that, as we had 
saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a return t« 
us for that kindness received. The captain said, they had saved

ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only desired to be 
set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they mig^^

My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and to 
consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled him 
in that part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange 
country; and if the Portugal captain that took me up at sea had 
served me so, and took all I had for my deliverance, I must have 
starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been

inBarbary, the mere being sold to a Mohammedan excepted; and 
perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better master than a Turk, if 
not in some cases a much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain, that we had taken them up 
in their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so as 
we were fellow-creatures, and as we would desire to be so delivered 
if we were in the like or any other extremity; that we had done 
nothing for them but what we believed they would- have done for 
us, if we had been in their case and they in ours : but that we 
took them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it would 
he a most barbarous thing to take that little from them which 
they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore and 
leave them; that this would be first to save them from death and 
then kill them ourselves, save them from drowning and abandon 
them to starving; and therefore I would not let the least thing 
be taken from them. As to setting them on shore, I told them 
indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship 
was bound to the East Indies, and though we were driven out of 
our course to the westward a very great way, and perhaps were 
directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was 
impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on this particular 
account, nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the 
freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to pursue his 
voyage by the way of Brazil; and all I knew we could do for them 
was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships, 
homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them passage, if 
possible, to England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they 
could not but be very thankful for it; but they were in a very 
great consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of 
l>eing carried away to the East Indies; and they then entreated 
lue, that seeing I was driven so far to the westward before I met 
^th them, I would at least keep on the same course to the Banks 
of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some 
8Mp or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada, 
from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and

338 THE PASSENGERS TRANSHIPPED. 

therefore I inclined to agree to it; for, indeed, I considered that 
to carry this whole company to the East Indies, would not only 
be an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be 
ruining our whole vo^'^age by devouring all our provisions: sol 
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen 
accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one 
could 8%y we were to blame; for the laws of God and nature would 
have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of 
people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of the thing, 
as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set 
them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance. So I 
consented that we should carry them to Newfoundland, if wind 
and weather would permit, and if not, that I would carry them to 
Martin ico in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; 
and as the winds had continued in the points between north-east 
and south-east a long time, we missed several opportunities of 
sending them to France; for we met several ships bound to Europe, 
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's, but they had 
been so long beating up against the wind, that they durst take in 
no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as 
well for themselves as for those they should take in; so we were 
obliged to go on. It was about a week after this that we made 
the Banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my story, we put 
all our French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea 
there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, 
if they could get provision to victual themselves with. When I 
say all the French went on shore, I should remember that the 
young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies, 
desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the 
coast of Coromandel, which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully 
liked the man, and had very good reason, as will appear afterwards; 
also four of the seamen entered themselves on our ship, and proved 
very useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering 
away south and south by east for about twenty days together. 
sometimes little or no wind at all, when we met with another

A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS. 339 

subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as 
that before. 

It was in the latitude of 27** 5' north, and the 19th day of 
March 1694-5, when we spied a sail, our course south-east and by 
soutL We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore 
lip to us, but coidd not at first know what to make of her, till 
ifter coming a little nearer we found she had lost her maintop- 
mast, fore-mast, and boltsprit;^ and presently she fired a gun as 
i signal of distress. The weather was pretty good, wind at 
aorth-north-west, a fresh gale; and we soon came to speak with 
bar. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, 
but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before 
she was ready to sail by a terrible hurricane, while the captain 
and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that, beside the terror 
of the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for good artists 
to bring the ship home. They had been already nine weeks at 
sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the hurricane 
^vas over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to 
the westward, and in which they lost their masts, as above. They 
told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were 
then driven away again to the south-east by a strong gale of wind 
at north-north-west, the same that blew now; and having no sails 
to work the ship with but a main course, and a kind of square sail 
^pon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up, they could not lie 
liear the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the 
Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost 
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had under- 
gone; their bread and flesh was quite gone, they had not one 
ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days'. The 
only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and they 
had about half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough; some 
succades, or sweatmeats, they had at first, but they were devoured; 
and they had seven casks of rum. 
There was a youth and his mother and a maidservant on board,

340 TIMELY RELIEF. 

who were going passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to 
sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the hurricane 
began; and having no provisions of their own left, they were in a 
more deplorable condition than the rest, for the seamen, being 
reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no compas- 
sion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers, and they were 
indeed in a condition that their misery is very hard to describe. 

I had, perhaps, not known this part, if my curiosity had not led 
me, the weather being fair and the wind abated, to go on board 
the ship. The second mate, who upon this occasion commanded 
the ship, had been on board our ship, and he told me indeed they 
had three passengers in the great cabin, that they were in a 
deplorable condition: "Nay," says he, "I believe they are dead, 
for I have heard nothing of them for above two days, and I was 
afraid to inquire after them," said he, " for I had nothing to 
relieve them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we 
could spare; and, indeed, I had so far overruled things with my 
nephew, that I would have victualled them, though we had gone 
away to Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to have 
supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that 

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of 
eating too much, even of that httle we gave them. The mate, or 
commander, brought six men with him in his boat, but these poor 
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak they could hardly 
sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill and half starved; 
for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went 
share and share alike with them in every bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him im- 
mediately, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began 
to be sick and out of order. So he stopped a while, and our sur- 
geon mixed him up something with some broth, which he said 
would be to him both food and physic; and after he had taken it, 
he grew better. In the meantime I forgot not the men ; I ordered 
victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured 
than eat it. They were so exceeding hungry, that they were in » 
kind ravenous, and had no conmiand of themselves; and two oi

the deck hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen 
down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her limbs were 
distorted ; one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, 
and she griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let 
go; her other arm lay over her head; and her feet lay both 
together set fast against the frame of the cabin table; in short, 
she lay just like one in the last agonies of death, and yet she was 
alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger and terrified 
with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterwards, 
was bVoken-hearted for her mistress, who she saw djdng for two 
or three days before, and who she loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our 
surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and experience, 
had with great application recovered her as to life, he had her 
upon his hand as to her senses, for she was little less than dis- 
tracted for a considerable time after, as shall appear presently. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to con- 
sider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, 
where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place. 
Our business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not to 
lie by for them; and though they were willing to steer the same 
course with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to keep 
pace with a ship that had no masts. However, as their captain 
begged of us to help him to set up a maintop-mast, and a kind of 
a top-mast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for 
three or four days; and then, having given him five barrels of 
beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion 
of pease, flour, and what other things we could spare; and taking 
three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight of them 
for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board with us, at their 
own earnest request, the priest, the youth, and the maid, and all 
their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty, ^^' 
bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of 
his mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father but a few months 
before at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak to m® *^

lelpless widow that might have preserved her life, though it had 
>eeii but just to keep her alive. But hunger knows no friend, no 
elation, no justice, no right; and therefore is remorseless, and 
apable of no compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it would 
arry him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as 
•ad circumstances almost as those we found him in; that is to say, 
karving in the world. He said it mattered not whither he went, 
he was but delivered from the terrible crew he was among. 
hat the captain (by which he meant me, for he could know 
Jthing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would 
)fe hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to 
rself, she would be very thankful for it, let us carry them where 
would. The surgeon represented the case so affectionately to 
that I yielded, and we took them both on board with all their 
•ds, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be- 
loved or come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for 
tn, I made his commander sign a writing obliging himself to

re, to whom the youth said he was related, and to deliver a letter 
ch I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belonging to the 
eased widow; which, I suppose, was not done, for I could never 
•n that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable,

the matter, Friday?" says I. "Are you troubled because you 
may see your father?" " No, no," says he, shaking his head; " no 
see him more, no evermore see again." "Why so?" said I to 
Friday; how do you know that?" "O no, no," says Friday; 
"he long ago die, long ago; he much old man." "Well, well," 
said 1, "Friday, you don't know; but shall we see any one else 
thenl" The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he 
points just to the hill above my old house; and though we lay 
half a league off, he cries out, "We see! we see! yes, we see much 
men there, and there, and there." I looked, but I could see 
nobody, no, not with a perspective glass; which was, I suppose 
because I could not hit the place, for the fellow' was right, as I 
found upon inquiry the next day, and there was five or six men 
altogether, stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to think 
of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused the English 
ancient to be spread and fired three guns, to give them notice we 
^ere friends ; and in about half a quarter of an hour after, we per- 
ceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek; so I immediately 
ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a 
^hite flag, or flag of truce, I went directly on shore, taking with 
^e the young friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole 
story of my living there, and the manner of it, and every particu- 
lar hoth of myself and those I left there; and who was on that 
account extremely desirous to go with me. We had besides about 
sixteen men very well armed, if we had found any new guests there 
^hich we did not know of; but we had no need of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, 
^e rowed directly into the creek, and the first man I fixed my eye 
^pon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and who I knew 
V his face perfectly well ; as to his habit, I shall describe it after-

352 A RETROSPECTIVE VIEW. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first 
person, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand "said Is" 
and "said he's," and "he told me's" and "I told hun's," and tbe 
like; but I shall collect the facts historically a^; near as I can 
gather them out of my memory from what they related to me, and 
from what I met with in my conversing with them and with the 
placa 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I 
must go back to the circumstance in which I left the island, and 
in which the persons were of whom I am to speak. And first, it 
is necessary to repeat that I had sent away Friday's father and the 
Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages; I 
say, I had sent them away in a large canoe to the main, as I then 
thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions, who he had 
left behind him, in order to save them from the like calamity that 
he had been in; and in order to succour them for the present, and 
that if possible we might together find some way for our deliver- 
ance afterward. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the 
least room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had 
twenty year before; much less hgd I any foreknowledge of what 
afterward happened, I mean of an English ship coming on shore 
there to fetch me oflF; and it could not but be a very great surprise 
to them when they came back, not only to find that I was gone, 
but to find three strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that 
I had left behind me, which would otherwise have been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might 
begin where I left oflF, was of their own part; and I desired he 
would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his 
countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. 
He told me there was little variety in that part, for nothing re- 
markable happened to them on the way, they having Tery cahn 
weather and a smooth sea; for his countrjnnen it could not be 
doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him. f}^ 
seems he was the principal man among them, the captain of the 
vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time.) 
They were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because they

hew that he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they 
Fere satisfied, would devour him as they did all the rest of the 
prisoners; that when he told them the story of his deliverance, 
and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it 
was like a dream to them; and their astonishment, they said, was 
something like that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them who 
he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's 
court But when he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, 
and the provisions that he brought them for their journey or 
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share of the 
joy of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away 
with him. 

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were 
obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it, but to 
trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large 
canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a fishing or for 
pleasure. 

hx these they came away the next morning. It seems they 
banted no time to get themselves ready, for they had no baggage, 
neither clothes or provisions, or anything in the world but what 
they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to 
^e their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that time, unluckily 
^or them, I had the occasion oflFered for my escape, as I mentioned 
^ my other Part, and to get off from the island, leaving three of 
he most impudent, hardened, ungovemed, disagreeable villains 
^hind me, that any man could desire to meet with, to the poor 
paniards' great grief and disappointment, you may be sure. 
The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards 
Une on shore they gave my letter to them, and gave them pro- 
isions and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they 
ive them the long paper of directions which I had left with them, 
>ntaimng the particular methods which I took for managing 
i^'ery part of my life there; the way how I baked my bread, bred 
p tame goats, and planted my com; how I cured my grapes, 
tade my pots; and, in a word, everything I did. All this being 
Titten down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of whom under-

stand English well enough ; nor did they refuse to accommodate 
the Spaniards with everything else, for they agreed very well for 
some time. They gave them an equal admission into the house 
or cave; and they began to live very sociably. And the head 
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, and Friday's 
father together, managed all their affairs : for as for the English- 
men, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, 
and catch tortoises; and when they came home .at night, the 
Spaniards provided their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, would the 
other but have let them alone; which, however, they could not 
find in their hearts to do long, but, like the dog in the manger, 
they would not eat themselves, and would not let others eat 
neither. The differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, 
and such as are not worth relating; but at last it broke out into 
open war, and it began with all the rudeness and insolence that 
can be imagined, without reason, without provocation, contrary to 
nature, and indeed to common sense; and though it is true the 
first relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, who I 
may call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows, 
they could not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part> I must supply 
a defect in my former relation; and this was, that I forgot to set 
down among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor 
to set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our ship, which 
I was afraid once would have turned to a second mutiny; nor was 
it appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage and taking ^ 
all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making two of the 
most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons; and as 
they had been active in the former disorders, and let fall some 
ugly dangerous words the second time, he threatened to cany 
them in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny 
and running away with the ship. 

This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it» 
frighted some other men in the ship, and some of them had pnti^ 
into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them p^ 
words for the present, till they should come to some English port>

THREE DESPERADOEa 355 

md that then they should be all put into jail, and tried for their 
ives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it; 
ipon which it was desired that I, who still passed for a great man 
mong them, should go down with the mate and satisfy the men, 
nd tell them that they might be assured, if they behaved well 
be rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time past should 
•e pardoned* So I went, and after passing my honour's word to 
hem, they appeared easy; and the more so, when I caused the 
wo men who were in irons to be released and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night, 
he wind also falling calm. Next morning, we found that our two 
nen who had been laid in irons had stole each of them a musket 
md some other weapons, what powder or shot they had we know 
not, and had taken the ship's pinnance, which was not yet hauled 
up, and ran away with her to their companions in roguery on 
shore. 

As soon ^ we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, 
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek the 
rogues; but they could neither find them or any of the rest, for 
they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming on 
shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to their roguery, 
to have destroyed their plantations, burned all the household stuff 
and furniture, and left them to shift without it; but having no 
order, he let it all alone, left ever3rthing as they found it> and 
bringing the pinnace away, came on board without them. 

These two men made their number five, but the other three 
Wllains were so much wickeder than these, that after they had 
been two or three days together, they turned their two new 
vomers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have 
aothing to do with them, nor could they for a good while be 
[)ersuaded to give them any food; as for the Spaniards, they were 
act yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to 
10 forward. The Spaniards would have persuaded the three Eng- 
ish brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again, that, as 
hey said, they might be all one family; but they would not heay

S66 THE SPANIARDS' KINDNESS. 

of it So the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and i 
nothing but industry and application would make them live com- 
fortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, 
but a little more to the west, to be out of the danger of the 
savages, who always landed on the east parts of the island 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other 
to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards having 
given them some com for seed, and especially some of the pease 
which I had left them, they dug, and planted, and enclosed, after 
the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live pretty well 
Their first crop of com was on the ground, and though it was but 
a little bit of land which they had dug up at first, having had but 
a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them 
with bread and other eatables; and one of the fellows bemg the 
cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings, 
and such other preparations, as the rice and the milk, and such 
little flesh as they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the 
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humour 
and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told them the 
island was theirs; that the governor (meaning me) had given them 
possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it; and they 
should build no houses upon their ground, unless they would pay 
them rent for them. 

The two men thought they had jested at first, asked them to 
come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that 
they had built, and tell them what rent they demanded; and one 
of them merrily told them, if they were ground-landlords, he 
hoped, if they built tenements upon their land and made impro^®* 
ments, they would, according to the custom of landlords, grant 
them a long lease, and bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the 
writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told them they 
should see they were not in jest; and going to a little place at a 
distance, where the honest men had made a fire to dress their 
victuals, he takes a firebrand and claps it to the outside of their 
hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have been all burned 
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fello^'

men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. They 
did not indeed lay down their arms, but seeing him so resolute it 
brought them to a parley, and they.consented to take their wounded 
man with them and be gone — and indeed it seems the fellow was 
wounded sufficiently with the blow. However, they were much 
in the wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did not dis- 
arm them effectually, as they might have done, and have gone 
immediately to the Spaniards and given them an account how 
the rogues had treated them; for the three villains studied nothing 
but revenge, and every day gave them some intimation that they 
did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of 
their rogueries, such as treading down their com, shooting three 
young kids and a she-goat, which the poor men had got to breed 
up tame for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them night and 
day in this manner, it forced the two inen to such a desperation, 
that they resolved to fight them all three the first time they had 
a fair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved to go to the 
castle, as they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the 
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together, at that time 
intending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards should stand by 
to see fair play. So they got up in the morning before day, and 
came to the place, and called the Englishmen by their names, 
telling a Spaniard that answered that they wanted to speak with 
them. 

It happened that the day before, two of the Spaniards havmg 
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, who, for 
distinction, I call the honest men, and he had made a sad com- 
plai;it to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with 
from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined their 
plantation and destroyed their corn that they had laboured so hard 
to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three kid^ 
which was all they had provided for their sustenance; and that ^ 
he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist tb^*^^ 
again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards came hot^*

erms, and asked them, " How they could be so cruel, they being 
larmless inoflFensive fellows, and that they were only putting 
hemselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it had 
ost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection 
s they had]" 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, " What had they 
o do there? That they came on shore without leave, and they 
hould not plant or build upon the island; it was none of their 
;round." " Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, " Seignior 
nglese, they must not starva" The Englishman replied like a 
rue rough-hewn Tarpaulin,^ " They might starve and be damned, 
hey should not plant nor build." " But what must they do, then, 
eignior?" said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned, 

* Bo! hang them. They should be servants and work for them." 
*Eut how can you expect that of them?" says the Spaniard, 

* they are not bought with your money; you have no right to 
Hake them servants." The Englishman answered, "The island 
w-as theirs, the governor had given it to them, and no man had 
ttiything to do there but themselves;" and with that swore by 
^is Maker " that they would go and bum all their new huts, they 
should build none upon their land." 

"Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, "by the same rule we must 
'^eyour servants too." "Ay," says the bold dog, "and so you 
shall, too, before we have done with you;" mixing two or three 
^aths in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only 
Smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this little 
iiscourse had heated them, and starting up, one says to the 
^ther (I think it was he they called Will Atkins), "Come, 
J^ack, let us go and have t'other brush with them; well demolish 
tilieir castle, I'll warrant you, they shall plant no colony in our 
dominions." 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a gun, 
^ pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among 
t^iemselves of what they would do to the Spaniards too, when 
opportunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so per-

360 WANTON DESTRUCTION. 

in general they threatened them hard for taking the two English- 
men's part 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that even- 
ing, the Spaniards said, they did not know; but it seems they 
wandered about the country part of the night, and then lying 
down in the place which I used to call my bower, they were weary, 
and overslept themselves. The case was this : they had resolved 
to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor men when they 
were asleep; and, as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to 
set fire to their huts while they were in them, and either burn 
them in them, or murder them as they came out; and as malice 
seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should not have 
been kept waking. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I 
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and 
murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, that they 
were up and gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to 
their huts. 

When they came there and found the men gone, Atkins, who 
it seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrades, 
"Ha, Jack! here's the nest, but the birds are flown." They 
mused a while to think what should be the occasion of their being 
gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the Spaniards 
had given them notice of it; and with that they shook hands, 
and swore to one another that they would be revenged of the 
Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they 
fell to work with the poor men's habitation. They did not set 
fire indeed to anything, but they pulled down both their little 
houses, and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not 
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where 
they stood. They tore all their little collected household stuff in 
pieces, and threw everything about in such a manner, that the 
poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile off f'^''^ 
their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the young tre«* 
the poor men had planted, pulled up an enclosure they had ma^^ 
to secure their cattle and their com, and in a word, sacked 9^^

lundered everything as completely as a horde of Tartars would

The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out, and

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they

bem what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and one

[uiet civil man, was as brave as a man could be desired to be, and 
vithal a strong well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good 
vhile, and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up 
o him, and with one blow of his fist knocked him down, as an ex 
s felled with a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, insolent at 
he first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately. He missed 
us body indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, but one of

Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they 
began to cool, and giving the Spaniards better words, would have

The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially, having thus

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them that as 
ey had disarmed them they could not consent that they (the

But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, "we

864 BETTER TIMES PROMISE. 

turtles' eggs all that while, came back to the grove, and finding 
my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and two 
more with him walking by the side of the creek, they came up in 
a very submissive, humble manner, and begged to be received 
again into the family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told 
them they had acted so unnaturally by their countrjonen, and so 
very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could not come 
to any conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen and tlie 
rest; but, however, they would go to them and discourse about it, 
and they should know in half an hour. It may be guessed that 
they were very hard put to it: for it seems, as they were to wait 
this half hour for an answer, they begged they would send them 
out some bread in the meantime; which he did, and sent them at 
the same time a large piece of goat's flesh and a broiled parrot, 
which they eat very heartily, for they were hungry enough 

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and a long 
debate had among them, their two coimtrymen charging them 
with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder them— 
all which they owned before, and therefore could not deny now. 
Upon the whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator between them; 
and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three 
while they were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the 
three to go and build their fellows two huts, one of the same and 
the other of larger dimensions, than they were before; to fence 
their ground again where they had pulled up the fences, plant 
trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again for 
planting corn, where they had spoiled it; and in a word, to restore 
everything in the same state as they found it, as near as they 
could, for entirely it could not be, the season for the com and the 
growth of the trees and hedges not being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this, and as they had plenty of pro- 
visions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the 
whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together, 
only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work, I 
mean for themselves, except now and then a little, just as they 
pleased. However, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they 
would but live sociably and friendly together, and study in the

THE SPANIARD'S PREMONITION. 366 

lehole the good of the plantation, they would be content to work 
[or them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased ; 
md thus, having lived pretty well together for a month or two, 
bhe Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave them liberty to go 
ibroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms and went 
abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to be insolent and 
troublesome as before; but, however, an accident happening pre- 
sently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all, they 
were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to the 
preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spaniard governor, as I call 
him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was 
now the captain or leader or governor of the rest, found himself 
very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any sleep. 
He was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only 
found his thoughts tumultuous, his mind run upon men fighting 
And killing of one another, but was broad awake, and could not 
kj any means get any sleep. In short, he lay a great while, but 
growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, 
^ing so many of them, upon goat-skins, laid thick upon such 
Caches and pads as they made for themselves, not in hammocks 
^d ship beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had little to do, 
^ien they were willing to rise, but to get up upon their feet, and 
erhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps, and they 
ere ready for going any way that their thoughts guided them. 
Being thus gotten up he looked out, but being dark he could 
e little or nothing. And besides, the trees which I had planted, 
' in my former account is described, and which were now grown 
U, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up and see 
Lat it was a clear starlight night; and hearing no noise, he re- 
lined and laid him down again. But it was all one, he could 
>t sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything like rest; 
xt his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew 
:>t for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going 
ut and coming in, another of them waked, and calling asked.

^ t - ^^ by accident, on their usual bloody errand, they

^ ^^® . ^^^iness either to have concealed themselves as not to 



^Q see ^^tia at all, much less to have let the savages have seen

escaiped, ^ich could only have been by getting in between them 
vxA- ^^^ ^^ats. But this presence of mind was wanting to them, 
wlttich was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with 
him, surprised with this sight, run back immediately and raised 
their fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they 
were all in; and they again as readily took the alarm. But it 
was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they 
were, but that they must run all out to see how things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they 

hd opportunity enough for some hours to view them by the light 

oi three fires they had made at a distance from one another. What 

they were doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they 

hiew not: for, first, the enemy were too many; and secondly, 

ttey did not keep together, but were divided into several parties, 

^d were on shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; 
nd as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the 
lore, they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them would 
lop in upon their habitation, or upon some other place where 
ley would see the token of inhabitants. And they were in great 
srplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would have 
sen little less than starving them if they should have been 
3stroyed. So the first thing they resolved upon was to despatch 
uree men away before it was light, namely, two Spaniards and 
le Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the great valley 
here the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the very 
ive itself.

other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two different 
nations. 

And after having mused a great while on the course they should 
take, and beaten their brains in considering their present circum- 
stances, they resolved at last, while, it was dark, to send the old 
savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, some- 
thing concerning them, what they came for, and what they in- 
tended to do. The old man readily undertook it; and stripping 
himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went 
After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he 
had been among them undiscovered ; that he found they were 
two parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one 
another, and had had a great battle in their own country; and 
that both sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight, 
they were by mere chance landed all in the same island, for the 
devouring their prisoners and making merry. But their coming 
so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth; that 
they were in a great rage at one another; and that they were so 
near, that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight 
began to appear. But he did not perceive that they had any notion 
of anybody's being on the island but themselves. He had hardly 
made an end of telling his story, when they could perceive, hy the 
unusual noise they made, that the two little armies were engaged 
in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our 
people to lie close, and not be seen. He told them their safety 
consisted in it; and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and 
the savages would kill one another to their hands, and then the 
rest would go away : and it was bo to a tittle. But it was im- 
possible to prevail, especially from the Englishmen; their curiosity 
was so importunate upon their prudentials,^ that they must nm 
out and see the battle. However, they used some caution too; 
namely, they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling, ha*

A FIGHT AMONG THE SAVAGES. 369 

bought, not to be seen by them; but it seems the savages did see 
bem, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce; and if I might believe the English- 
len, one of them said he could perceive that some of them were 
len of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great policy in 
aiding the fight. The battle, they said, held two hours before 
ley could guess which party would be beaten. But then that 
arty which was nearest our people's habitation began to appear 
weakest; and after some time more some of them began to fly; 
Qd this put our men again into a great consternation, lest any 
f those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling 
3r shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place ; and that 
•y consequence the pursuers should do the like in search for them. 
Jpon this they resolved that they would stand armed within the 
Fall, and whoever came into the grove they should sally out over 
he wall and kill them : so that, if possible, not one should return 
io give an account of it. They ordered also that it should be 
ione with their swords, or by knocking them down with the 
stock of the musket; but not by shooting them, for fear of the 
uoise. 

As they expected, it fell out. Three of the routed army fled 
for life, and, xrossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in 
the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick 
^ood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice 
of this within, with this addition, to our men's great satisfaction, 
tiamely, that the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which 
My they were gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of 
humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives; but 
Sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go 
t'ound and come in behind them, surprise, and take them prisoners; 
which was done. The residue of the conquered people fled to 
their canoes, and got off to sea. The victors retired, and made no 
pursuit, or very little; but drawing themselves into a body together, 
gave two great screaming shouts, which they supposed was by way 
of triumph; and so the fight ended. And the same day, about 
three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to their canoes; 

*nd thus the Spaniards had their island again free to themselves,

THREE SAVAGES CAPTURED. 371 

le sight had filled them with horror; and the consequences 
peared terrible to the last degree, even to them, if ever they 
3uld fall into the hands of those creatures, who would not only 
1 them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we kill our cattle, 
id they professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up like 
ef or mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they 
3re dead, had something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their 
sry stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and filled 
leir minds with such unusual terror, that they were not them- 
jlves for some weeks after. 

This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I have been 
3eaking of; and for a great while after they were very tractable, 
ad went about the common business of their whole society well 
Qough; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalized 
3 the country. But some time after this they fell all into such 
leasures as brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed; and these 
bree being lusty stout young fellows, they made them servants, 
nd taught them to work for them ; and as slaves they did well 
xiough. But they did not take their measures with them as I did 
>y my man Friday, namely, to begin with them upon the prin- 
iple of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the 
^tional principles of life, much less of religion, civilizing and 
educing them by kind usage and affectionate arguings; but as 
hey gave them their food every day, so they gave them their 
^ork too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough. But 
hey failed in this by it, that they never had them to assist them 
Tid fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who was as true to

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends, 
or common danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled 
hem, they began to consider their general circumstances. And 
he first thing that came under their consideration was, whether, 
eeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island, and 
hat there were more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted 
•0 their way of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they

proper place for their safety, and especially for the security rf 
their cattle and corn? 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would 
not remove their habitation; because that, some time or other, 
they thought they might hear from their governor again (meaning 
me); and if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure 
to direct them to that side; where, if they should find the place 
demolished, they would conclude the savages had killed us all, 
and we were gone, and so our supply would go too. 

But as to their com and cattle, they agreed to remove them into 
the valley where my cave was, where the land was as proper for 
both, and where, indeed, there was land enough. However, upon 
second thought, they altered one part of that resolution too, and 
resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part 
of their com there; and so if one part was destroyed, the other 
might be saved. And one part of prudence they used, which it 
was very well they did; namely, that they never trusted those 
three savages which they had prisoners with knowing anything of 
the plantation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle they 
had there; much less of the cave there, which they kept, in case 
of necessity, as a safe retreat, and whither they carried also the 
two barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming away. 

But, however, they resolved not to change their habitation; 
yet they agreed, that as I had carefully covered it, first with a 
wall or fortification, and then with a grove of trees, so, seeing 
their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which 
they were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and 
conceal the place yet more effectually than before. To this pur- 
pose, as I had planted trees (or rather thrast in stakes, which in 
time all grew up to be trees) for some good distance before the 
entrance into my apartment, they went on in the same manner, 
and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, from the 
trees I had set quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I 
said, I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide 
flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any wp 
that there had been any landing thereabout. The stakes v^

lose which I had planted; and as they grew apace, so they 
[anted them so very thick and close together, that when they had 
sen three or four years grown there was no piercing with the eye 
ly considerahle way into the plantation. And as for that part 
hich I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's 
ligh. And among them they placed so many other short ones, 
ad so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a palisado^ a quarter of 
mile thick. And it was next to impossible to penetrate it but 
ith a little army to cut it all down; for a little dog could hardly 
et between the trees, they stood so close. 
But this was not all, for they did the same by all the ground to 
he right hand and to the left, and round even to the top of the 
lill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves to come out, 
)ut by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted 
ip, and placed again from the first stage up to the top; which 
adder when it was taken down, nothing but what had wings or 
mtchcraft to assist it could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived; nor was it less than what 
they afterwards found occasion for : which served to convince me 
that as human prudence has the authority of Providence to justify 
it, 80 it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to set it to 
Work And would we listen carefully to the voice of it, I am 
fully persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which our 
lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to. But this by 
the way, 

I return to the story. They lived two years after this in perfect 
retirement, and had no more visits from the savages. They had, 
bdeed, an alarm given them one morning, which put them into a 
great consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out early one 
tioming on the west side, or rather the end of the island (which, 
by the way, was that end where I never went, for fear of being 
discovered), they were surprised with seeing above twenty canoe? 
of Indians just coming on shore ! 

They made the best of their way home, in hurry enough; and 
givmg the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that day

374 ANOTHER BROIU 

and the next, going out only at night to make observatioiL But 
they had the good luck to be mistaken; for wherever the savages 
went, they did not land at that time on the island, but pursued 
some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; 
one of which, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of 
the three slaves which I mentioned they had taken, because the 
fellow had not done something right which he bid him do, and 
seemed a little untractable in his showing him, drew a hatchet out 
of a frog-belt in which he wore it by his side, and fell upon the 
poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the 
Spaniards who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut 
with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck into his 
shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the poor creature's arm 
off, ran to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor man, 
clapped in between him and the savage to prevent the mischie£ 

The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the 
Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he 
intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, 
avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he had in his hand (for 
they were all working in the field about their corn-land) knocked 
the brute down. Another of the Englishmen, running at the same 
time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and then 
two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a third 
Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of them any fire- 
arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except 
this third Englishman; he had one of my old rusty cutlasses, with 
which he made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both 
This fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming 
in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The next question 
was what should be done with them. They had been so often 
mutinous, and were so furious, so desperate, and so idle vithai> 
that they knew not what course to take with them; for they were 
mischievous to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they 
did to any man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them

A WICKED PROPOSAL. 375 

hem, for all laws and all governors were to preserve society, and 
hose who were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out 
f it; but as they were EngHshmen, and that it was to the generous 
dndness of an EngHshman that they all owed their preservation 
nd deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity, and 
rould leave them to the judgment of the other two EngUshmen, 
vho were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up and said they de- 
ared it might not be left to them, " for," says he, " I am sure we 
mght to sentence them to the gallows ;'* and with that gives an 
iccount how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have 
ill the five EngHshmen join together and murder all the Spaniards 
when they were in their sleep ! 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to William 
Atkins, " How, Seignior Atkins," says he, " would you murder us 
all] What have you to say to thati" That hardened villain 
was so far from denying it that he said it was true, and they 
would do it still before they had done with them. " Well, but, 
Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " what have we done to you, 
that you will kill usi And what would you get by killing usi 
And what must we do to prevent you kiUing us ? Must we kill 
you, or you will kill us ! Why will you put us to the necessity 
of this. Seignior Atkins 1" says the Spaniard, very calmly and 
smiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a 
jest of it, that had he not been held by three men, and withal 
lad no weapons with him, it was thought he would have attempted 
to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of the company. 

This hair-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously 
irhat was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard 
^ho saved the poor savage was of the opinion they should hang 
one of the three for an example to the rest, and that, particularly, 
it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with 
liis hatchet; and indeed there was some reason to believe he had 
done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition 
^th the wound he had received, that it was thought he could not 
live.

876 A HEIU^IFUL MAN. 

But the governor Spaniard still said, ''No; it was an Engluh- 
man that had saved all their lives, and he would never consent to 
put an Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of 
them ; nay," he said, " if he had been killed himself by an English- 
man, and had time left to speak, it should be that they should 
pardon him." 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard 
that there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most 
apt to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all 
came into it But then it was to be considered what should he 
done to keep them from doing the mischief they designed; for all 
agreed, governor and aU, that means were to be used for pre- 
serving the society from danger. After a Jong debate it was 
agreed, first, that they should be disarmed, and not permitted to 
have either gun, or powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon; 
and should be turned out of the society, and left to hve where 
they would, and how they would, by themselves; but that none 
of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse with 
them, speak with them, or have anything to do with them: that 
they should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the phice 
where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered to commit any dis- 
order, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the com, plant- 
ings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they 
should die without mercy, and they would shoot them whereYcr 
they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sen- 
tence, considered a little upon it, and turning to the two honest 
Englishmen, said, " Hold, you must reflect that it will be long ere 
they can raise com and cattle of their own, and they must not 
starve. We must therefore allow them provisions." So he caused 
to be added, that they should have a proportion of com given 
them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which 
time they might be supposed to raise some of their own; that 
they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids ff^^ 
them, as well for present subsistence as for a store; and that they 
should have tools given them for their work in the fields, such** 
six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like: but they should have

lone of these tools or provisions unless they would swe&r solemnl j 
hat they would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with 
hem, or of their fellow-Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to 
hift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as 
leither contented to go away or to stay; but as there was no 
emedy they went, pretending to go and choose a place where 
hey would settle themselves to plant and live by themselves, an4 
lome provisions were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, 
md gave the governor an account where they had pitched their 
bents, and marked themselves out an habitation and plantation; 
and it was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part 
of the island, north-east, much about the place where I landed in 
my first voyage when I was driven out to sea, the Lord knows 
whither, in my attempt to surround the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived 
them in a manner like my first habitation, being close under the 
side of a hill, having some trees growing already on three sides of 
it, so that by planting others it would be very easily covered fron^ 
the sight, unless narrowly searched for. They desired some dried 
goat skins for beds and covering, which were given them: and 
^pon giving their words that they would not disturb the rest, or 
iDJure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets and what 
other tools they could spare; some pease, barley, and rice fo|: 
sowing; and in a word, anything they wanted, but arms and 
ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and 
had gotten in their first harvest, though the quantity was but 
^rnall, the parcel of land they had planted being but Kttle; for, 
indeed, having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal 
^i work upon their hands. And when they came to make boards, 
^d pots, and such things, they were quite out of their element, 
^d could make nothing of it; and when the rainy reason came 
on, for want of a cave in the earth they could not keep their grain 
^, and it was in great danger of spoiling. And this humbled 
them much; so they came and begged the Spaniards to help then^.

378 A NEW FROLIC. 

which they very readily did, and in four days worked a great hole 
in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure their com 
and other things from the rain. But it was but a poor place at 
best compared to mine, and especially as mine was then, for the 
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several new apart- 
ments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new 
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former villany 
they had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and 
had very near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three new 
sociates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they 
led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstances; and 
a whim took them, that they would make a voyage to the con- 
tinent from whence the savages came, and would try if they could 
not seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, and bring 
them home, so to make them do the laborious part of their work 
for theuL 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no 
farther; but they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had 
either mischief in the design or mischief in the event And if I 
may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast froni 
Heaven; for if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible 
crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things with the 
Divine justice ? It was, certainly, an apparent vengeance on their 
crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they 
were in; and as they showed not the least remorse for the crime, 
but added new villanies to it, such as, particularly, the piece of 
monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave, because he did not^ 
or perhaps could not, understand to do what he was directed; 
and to wound him in such a manner as, no question, made him a 
cripple all his life; and in a place where no surgeon or medicine 
could be had for his cure: and what was still worse, the murderous 
intent, or, to do justice to the crime, the intentional murder, for 
such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the formed design they 
all laid to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep- 
But I leave observing, and return to the story. The thre« 
fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in '*^

THE SPANIARDS* WARNING. 379 

lumble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them. The 
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was 
his: That they were tired of living in the manner they did; 
hat they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they 
vanted; and that, having no help, they found they should be 
itarved- But if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one 
)f the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and 
immunition, proportioned for their defence, they would go over to 
ihe main, and seek their fortune, and so deliver them from the 
trouble of supplying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them, but yet 
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they 
were running into; told them they had suffered such hardships 
upon that very spot; that they could, without any spirit of pro- 
phecy, tell them that they would be starved, or be murdered, and 
bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they 
stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work; and 
they could but be starved abroad; and if they were murdered, 
there was an end of them, they had no wives or children to cry 
after them; and in short, insisted importunately upon their 
demand, declaring that they would go, whether they would give 
them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were 
Resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and be in no 
condition to defend themselves; and that though they could ill 
8pare their firearms, having not enough for "themselves, yet they 
^ould let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each 
man a hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer, and having baked them 
tread enough to serve them a month, and given them as much 
goat's flesh as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great 
hasketful of dried grapes, a potful of fresh water, and a young kid 
alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over the 
sea, where it was at least forty miles abroad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well 
carried fifteen or twenty men ; and, therefore, was rather too big

'ere all undone, for there were strangers landed upon the island, 
e could not tell who. The Spaniard, pausing a while, says to 
im, "How do you mean, you cannot tell whot They are the 
ivages, to be sure." "No, no," says the Englishman; "they are 
len in clothes, with arms." "Nay, then," says the Spaniard, 
why are you concerned] If they are not savages, they must be 
riends, for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us 
jood rather than harm." 

While they were debating thus, comes the three Englishmen, 
md standing without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed 
to them. They presently knew their voices, and so all the wonder 
3f that kind ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon 
toother question, namely. What could be the matter, and what 
made them come back again) 

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring 
^here they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave 
them a full account of their voyage in a few words, namely, that 
they reached the land in two days or something less, but finding 
the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing with bows and 
^ows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to 
the northward six or seven hours, till they came to a great open- 
^§j by which they perceived that the land they saw from our 
island was not the main, but an island : that entering that opening 
^f the sea, they saw another island on the right hand north, and 
several more west; and being resolved to land somewhere, they 
put over to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on 
store: that they found the people very courteous and friendly to 
ttem, and that they gave them several roots and some dried fish, 
^nd appeared very sociable ; and the women, as well as the men, 
'^ere very forward to supply them with anything they could get 
or them to eat, and brought it to them a great way upon their 



They continued here four days, and inquired as well as they

382 A DOUBTFUL GIFT. 

except only such as they took in the wars; and then they owned 
that they made a great feast and eat their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that kind, 
and they told them about two moons ago — pointing to the moon, 
and then to two fingers; and that their great king had two hun- 
dred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, and they 
were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast The 
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those prisoners; bat 
the other mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have 
some of them to carry away for their own eating. So they 
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun and then to 
the rising, which was to signify that the next morning at son- 
rising they would bring some for them; and accordingly the next 
morning they brought down five women and eleven men, and gave 
them to the Englishmen to carry with them on their voyage, just 
as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a seaport 
town, to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their 
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do; 
to refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the 
savage gentry that offered them ; and what to do with them they 
knew not. However, upon some debates, they resolved to accept 
of them; and in return they gave the savages that brought them 
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their 
bullets, which, though they did not understand, they seemed ex- 
tremely pleased with. And then tying the poor creatures' hands 
behind them, they (the people) dragged the poor prisoners into the 
boat for our men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had 
them, or else they that gave them this noble present would cer- 
tainly have expected that they should have gone to work with 
them, have killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. 

But having taken their leave with all the respects and thanks 
that could well pass between people where on either side they 
understood not one word they could say, they put off with their 
boat, and came back towards the first island, where, when they

AN UNACXJOUNTABLE HISTORY 383 

jrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being too 
oany of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage, they endeavoured to have some commmiication 
nth. their prisoners, but it was impossible to make them under- 
iand anything; nothing they could say to them, or give them, or 
for them, but was looked upon as going about to murder them. 
hey first of all unbound them; but the poor creatures screamed 
b that, especially the women, as if they had just felt the knife at 
[leir throats, for they immediately concluded they were unboimd 
n purpose to be killed. 

If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same thing; then 
hey concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and so not 
)e fat enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more parti- 
jnlaily, the party presently concluded it was to see whether he or 
jhe was fattest and fittest to kill Nay, after they had brought 
bhem quite over, and began to use them kindly and treat them 
well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or a supper 
for their new masters. 

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history 
or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them, "Where their 
new family was?" And being told that they had brought them 
on shore and put them into one of their huts, and were come up 
to beg some victuals for them; they (the Spaniards) and the other 
two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go 
^ down to the place and see them, and did so, and Friday's father 
"^tli them. 

Vhen they came into the hut, there they sat all bound; for 
^ien they had brought them on shore, they bound their hands 
*iat they might not take the boat and make their escape. There, 
* say, they sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three 
^en, lusty comely fellows, well shaped, straight and fair limbs, 
^Wt thirty to thirty-five years of age; and five women, whereof two 
^ght be from thirty to forty ; two more not above four or five and 
s^enty; and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or

384 THE savages' jot. 

in London itself, having pleasant agreeable countenances, and of & 
very modest behaviour, especially when they came afterwards to be 
clothed and dressed, as they called it, though the dress was very 
indifferent, it must be confessed; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our 
Spaniards, who were (to give them a just character) men of the 
best behaviour, of the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good- 
humour that ever I met with, and, in particular, of the most 
modesty, as will presently appear: I say, the sight was very un- 
couth, to see three naked men and five naked women, all together 
bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that human nature 
could be supposed to be, namely, to be expecting every moment 
to be dragged out and have their brains knocked out, and then to 
be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's 
father, to go in and see first if he knew any of them, and then if 
he understood any of their speech. As soon as the old man came 
in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither 
could any of them understand a word he said or a sign he could 
tnake, except one of the women. 

However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to 
satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were 
Christians; that they abhorred eating of men or women, and that 
they might be sure they would not be killed. As soon as they 
were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awk- 
ward and several ways as is hard to describe; for it seems they 
were of several nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid in the next 
place to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to work 
for the men who had brought them away to save their lives; at 
which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell to taking up 
this, and another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their 
shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women among them 
would presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might 
occasion some strife, and perhaps 'blood, asked the three men what 
they intended to do with these women, and how they intended to

ise them — ^whether as servants or as women. One of the English- 
aen answered very boldly and readily, "That they would use them 
s both." To which the governor said, "I am not going to 
5strain you from it; you are your own masters as to that But 
lis I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among 
ou, and I desire it of you for that reason only, namely, that you 
ill all engage that if any of you take any of these women as a 
'Oman or wife, that he shall take but one; and that having taken 
ne, none else should touch her: for though we cannot marry any 
f you, yet 'tis but reasonable that while you stay here, the woman 
ny of you takes should be maintained by the man that takes her, 
Jid should be his wife; I mean," says he, "while he continues 
lere, and that none else shadl have anything to do with her." All 
ihis appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without any diffi- 
culty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to 
take any of them. But every one of them answered, "No." 
Some of them said they had wives in Spain, and the others did 
not like women that were not Christians; and all together declared 
that they would not touch one of them; which was an instance of 
such virtue as I have not met with in all my travela On the 
other hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took them every one 
»wife; that is to say, a temporary wife: and so they set up a new 
form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my 
old habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly within. The 
three servants which were taken in the late battle of the savages 
lived with them; and these carried on the main part of the colony, 
supplying all the rest with food, and assisting them in anjrthing 
48 they could, or as they found necessity required 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such refractory, ill- 
Diatched fellows should agree about these women, and that two 
of them should not pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing 
t^o or three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable 
^han the other. But they took a good way enough to prevent 
lUarrelling among themselves; for they set the five women by 
temselves in one of their huts, and they went all into the other 
>ut and drew lots among them who should choose first.

386 A STRANGE LOTTERY. 

He that drew to choose first, went away by himself to the hut 
where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he 
chose; and it was worth observing that he that chose first took 
her that was reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the five, 
which made mirth enough among the rest; and even the Spaniards 
laughed at it. But the fellow considered better than any of them, 
that it was application and business that they were to expect 
assistance in as much as anything else; and she proved the hest 
wife of all the parcel 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and 
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned 
upon them again, and they firmly believed that they were now a 
going to be devoured; accordingly when the English sailor came 
in, and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable 
cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her with such 
agonies and such affection as would have grieved the hardest 
heart in the world; nor was it possible for the EngHshmen to 
satisfy them that they were not to be immediately murdered, 
until they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who immediately 
let them know that the five men, who had fetched them out one 
by one, had chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a 
little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and 
helped them; and in a few hours they had built them everyone 
a new hut or tent, for their lodging apart; for those they had 
already were crowded with their tools, household stuflf, and pro- 
vision. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and the 
two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the ishind, 
80 that they continued separate as before. And thus my )^^ 
was peopled in three places; and, as I might say, three towns 
were begun to be planted. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that as it often hap- 
pens in the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are in 
such a disposition of things I cannot say), the two honest fellows 
had the two worst wives, and the three reprobates, that were 
scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed 
bom to do themselves good or any one else, had three clever, dih-

jcnt, careful, and ingenious wives : not that the two first were ill 
nVes as to their temper or humour, for all the five were most 
rilling, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves 
han wives; but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, in- 
:enious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat 

Another observation I must make, to the honour of a diligent 
pplication on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negli- 
ent, idle temper, on the other, that when I came to the place, 
nd viewed the several improvements, plantings, and management 
'{ the several little colonies, the two men had so far out-gone the 
hree, that there was no comparison. They had indeed both of 
hem as much ground laid out for com as they wanted; and the 
eason was, because, according to my rule. Nature dictated that it 
^as to no purpose .to sow more com than they wanted ; but the 
iifference of the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and 
bdeed of everything else, was easy to be seen at first view. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their 
huts, that when you came to the place nothing was to be seen but 
a wood; and though they had twice had their plantation de- 
molished, once by their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, 
as shall be shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, and 
everything was thriving and flourishing about them. They had 
grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, though 
they had themselves never seen anjrthing of that kind; and by 
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again 
as any of the others. They had also found themselves out a 
letreat in the thickest part of the woods, where, though there was 
JJot a natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one with in- 
cessant labour of their hands, and where, when the mischief which 
fcilowed happened, they secured their wives and children, so as 
^ey could never be found; they having, by sticking innumerable 
'^es and poles of the wood, which, as I said, grew so easily, 
'iade the wood unpassable, except in some places, where they 
linbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on by 
'^ys of their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they 
^re much civilized by their new settlement, compared to what

they were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the 
same opportunity, yet one of the certain companions of a profli- 
gate mind never left them; and that was their idleness. It is 
true, they planted com and made fences; but Solomon's words 
were never better verified than in them : " I went by the vine- 
yard of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns." For 
when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could not see 
it in some places for weeds. The hedge had several gaps in it, 
where the wild goats had gotten in, and eaten up the com; perhaps, 
here and there, a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out 
for the present, but it was only shutting the stable door after the 
steed was stolen. Whereas, when they looked on the colony of 
the other two, there was the very face of industry and success 
upon all they did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their 
com, or a gap in any of their hedges. And they, on the other 
hand, verified Solomon's words in another place, that " The diligent 
hand makes rich;" for everything grew and thrived, and they had 
plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle than the 
other, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet more 
pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly 
within doors, and having learned the English ways of dressing 
and cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was 
cook's-mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands' victuals 
very nicely and well ; whereas the other could not be brought to 
understand it. But then the husband who, as I say, had been 
cook*s-mate, did it himself; but as for the husbands of the three 
wives, they loitered about, fetched* turtles' eggs, and caught fisl^ 
and birds; in a word, anything but labour, and they fared accor- 
dingly. The diligent lived well and comfortably, and the slothful 
lived hard and beggarly; and so, I believe, generally speaking, it 
is all over the world. 

But now I come to a scene different from all that had happened 
before, either to them or to me; and the original of the story w»« 
this : — 

Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of 
Indians, or savages, call them which you please; and there i> do

room to doubt that they came upon the old errand of feeding upon 
their slaves. But that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, 
and to oar men too, that they did not concern themselves about 
it as I did; but having been made sensible by their experience that 
jheir only business was to he concealed, and that if they were not 
feen by any of the savages, they would go off again quietly when 
;heir business was done, having as yet not the least notion of there 
)eing any inhabitants in the island; I say, having been made 
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice to all 
bhe three plantations to keep within doors, and not show them- 
Jelves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when 
the boats went to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled all 
these measures, and made it known among the savages that there 
'w^ere inhabitants there, which was in the end the desolation of 
almost the whole colony. After the canoes with the savages were 
gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them had 
the curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to see what 
they had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found 
three savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground. 
It was supposed they had either been so gorged with their inhuman 
feast, that, like beasts, they were asleep and would not stir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the woods, and did 
Hot come back in time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly 
*t a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor, as it happened, 
^^ with them, and his advice was asked, but he professed he 
hew not what to do; as for slaves, they had enough already; and 
^ to killing them, they were none of them inclined to that The 
Spaniard governor told me they could not think of shedding inno- 
cent blood, for, as to them, the poor creatures had done them no 
•^ong, invaded none of their property, and they thought they had 
^0 just quarrel against them to take away their lives. 

And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let 
he accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they 
'^1, 1 never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in 
^y foreign country, who were so universally modest, temperate.

390 THE SPANISH CHARACTER. 

virtuous, 80 very good-humoured, and so courteous as these 
Spaniards; and as to cmelty, they had nothing of it in their very 
nature, no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions, and 
yet all of them men of great courage and spirit. 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the 
unsufferable usage of the three Englishmen; and their justice and 
humanity appeared now in the case of the savages, as above. After 
some consultation, they resolved upon this, that they would lie 
still a while longer, till, if possible, these three men might be 
gone; but then the governor Spaniard recollected that the three 
savages had no boat, and that if they were left to rove about the 
island they would certainly discover that there were inhabitants 
in it, and so they should be undone that way. 

Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast 
asleep still; so they resolved to waken them, and take them 
prisoners; and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely 
frighted when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like 
the women, that they should be murdered and eaten; for it seems 
those people think all the world does as they do, eating men's 
flesh : but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they 
carried them. 

It was very happy to them that they did not carry them home 
to their castle, I mean to my palace under the hill; but they car- 
ried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their country 
work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &^) 
and afterwards they carried them to the habitation of the two 
Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they hw 
for them to do; and whether it was by negligence in guarding 
them, or that they thought the fellows could not mend themselves, 
I know not, but one of them run away, and taking into the woods, 
they could never hear of him more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon after, 
in some other boats or canoes of savages, who came on shore thw« 
or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as 
usual, went off again in two days' time. This thought terrific 
them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not without good

FEARS OF ATTACK. • 391 

cause indeed, that if this fellow came safe home among his com- 
xades, he would certainly give them an accomit that there were 
pople in the island, as also how few and weak they were: for 
this savage, as I observed before, had never been told, and it was 
Terjr happy he had not, how many there were, or where they 
]ived; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns, 
much less had they shown him any of their other retired places, 
such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two 
iglishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelli- 
gence of them was, that about two months after this, six canoes of 
savages, with about seven, or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came 
fowing along the north side of the island, where they never used 
to come before, and landed about an hour after sunrise, at a con- 
venient place, about a mile from the habitation of the two Eng- 
ishmen, where this escaped man had been kept As the Spaniard 
ovemor said, had they been all there, the damage would not 
a.ve been so much, for not a man of them would have escaped; 
lit the case differed now very much, for two men to fifty was too 
Uch odds. The two men had the happiness to discover them 
>out a league off, so that it was above an hour before they landed, 
id as they landed a mile from their huts, it was some time before 
ley could come at theuL Now, having great reason to believe 
Lat they were betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the 
^Q slaves which were left, and cause two of the three men who 
i^ey brought with the women, who, it seems, proved very faithful 
* them, to lead them with their two wives, and whatever they 
>vild carry away with them, to their retired place in the woods, 
hich I have spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows 
^nd and foot till they heard farther. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, 
id that they bent their course directly that way, they opened the 
'iices where their milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, 
'aving their goats to straggle into the wood, whither they pleased, 
iat the savages might think they were all bred wild; but the 
^gue who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave 
h^em an account of it all, for they went directly to the place.

ammunition they had, and retreated towards the place in the 
where their wives were sent, keeping at a distance, yet » 
they might see, if possible, which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far but that from a rising ground they 
see the little army of their enemies come on directly to theii 
tation, and in a moment more could see all their huts and 
hold stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and mo: 
tion; for they had a very great loss, to them irretrievable, a 
for some time. They kept their station for a while, til] 
found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all oy 
place, rummaging every way and every place they could th 
in search for prey, and in particular for the people, of wl 
now plainly appeared they had intelligenca

A WRONG STEP. 395 

iere the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were 
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the 
wounded man talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him 
how he came to be hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, told 
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after that thunder 
from their gods, had killed those two and wounded hinu This, I 
say, is rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as they 
saw no man near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their 
lives, or so much as heard of a gun; neither knew they anything 
of killing or wounding at a distance with fire and bullets; if they 
had, one might reasonably believe they would not have stood so 
unconcerned in viewing the fate of their fellows without some 
apprehension of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved them 
to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at the same 
time had no notion of their danger, yet, having them all thus in 
their power, and the first having loaded his piece again, resolved 
to let fly both together among them; and singling out by agree- 
ment which to aim at, they shot together, and killed or very much 
bounded four of them; the fifth, frighted even to death, though 
Dot hurt, fell with the rest, so that our men, seeing them all fall 
^gether, thought they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed, made our two men 
come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns 
^n, which was a wrong step; and they were under some sur- 
prise when they came to the place and found no less than four of 
'he men alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one not at 
■IL This obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of their 
iuskets; and first they made sure of the runaway savage that 
ad been the cause of all the mischief, and of another that was 
Urt in his knee, and put them out of their pain. Then the man 
lat was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them, with 
is two hands held up, and made piteous moans to them by 
estures and signs for his life, but could not say one word to them 
aat they could understand. 

However, they signed to him to sit down at the foot of a tree

THE PRISONERS A BURDEN. 397 

numbers; so they resolved to go away to the place where their 
wives were, to see if all was well there, and to make them easy, 
who were in fright enough to be sure; for though the savages 
were their own country-folk, yet they were most terribly afraid 
of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of 
them. 

When they came there they found the savages had been in the 
wood, and very near that place, but had not found it; for it was 
indeed inaccessible by the trees standing so thick, as before, had 
not the persons seeking it been directed by those that knew it, 
which these did not; they foimd therefore everything very safe, 
only the women in a terrible fright. While they were here they 
lad the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their 
assistance; the other ten, with their servants and old Friday, I 
mean Friday's father, were gone in a body to defend their bower, 
^i the com and cattle that was kept there, in case the savages 
hould have roved over to that side of the country; but they did 
ot spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the 
iree savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly: and 
ith them also came the savage whom the Fnglishmen had left 
^Und hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they came that way, 
t^v the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth and 
thought him along with them, where, however, they were obliged 

► bind him again, as they had the two others who were left when 
^e third ran away. 

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them; and they

Lould be sent out of the way to my old cave in the valley, and

od for their subsistence; which was done, and they were bound 
lere hand and foot for that night.

muskets and a pistol among them, and two stout quarterstavea, 
away they went in quest of the savages. And first they came to 
the tree where the men lay that had been killed; but it was easy 
to see that some more of the savages had been there, for they had 
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had dragged two of 
them a good way, but had given it over. From thence they 
advanced to the first rising ground, where they stood and saw 
their camp destroyed, and where they had the mortification still 
to see some of the smoke; but neither could they see any of the 
savages. They then resolved, though with all possible caution, 
to go forward towards their ruined plantation. But a httle before 
they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw 
plainly the savages all embarking again in their canoes, in order 
to be gone. 

They seemed sorry at first, and there was no way to come at 
them to give them a parting blow; but, upon the whole, were 
very well satisfied to be rid of thena. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their im- 
provement destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them 
rebuild, and to assist them with needful supplies. Their three 
countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least inclina- 
tion to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they 
living remote eastward knew nothing of the matter till all was 
over) came and ofiered their help and assistance, and did very 
friendly work for several days to restore their habitation and make 
necessaries for them: and thus, in a little time, they were set 
upon their legs again. 

About two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of 
seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, and at 
some distance from them two drowned men; by which they had 
reason to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, and had 
overset some of them; for it had blown very hard the veiy ^^ 
after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough 
of them escaped to inform the rest as well of what they had 
done as of what had happened to them, and to whet them on to 
another enterprise of the same nature; which they, it seems, resolved

A NEW INVASION. 399 

to attempt, with sufficient force to carry all before them : for except 
^hat the first man had told them of inhabitants, they could say 
ittle to it of their own knowledge; for they never saw one man, 
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they had no other 
witness to confirm it to thenL 

It was five or six months after this before they heard any more 
of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had 
either forgot their former bad luck, or given over the hopes of 
better, when on a sudden they were invaded with a most for- 
midable fleet, of no less than eight and twenty canoes full of 
savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, 
and such like engines of war; and they brought such numbers 
with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost 
consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eastermost 

side of the island, our men had that night to consult and consider 

what to do; and, in the first place, knowing that their being 

entirely concealed was their only safety before, and would much 

niore be so now, while the number of their enemies was so great, 

they therefore resolved first of all to take down the huts which 

^ere built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats 

^ the old cave; because they supposed the savages would go 

^ectly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game 

^^er again, though they did not now land within two leagues 

'fit. 

In the next place they drove away all the flock of goats they 
^d at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the Span- 
•J*ds; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants any- 
here as was possible; and the next morning early they posted 
lemselves with all their force at the plantation of the two men, 
aiting for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened. These 
iw invaders, leaving their canoes at the east end of the island, 
•me ranging along the shore directly towards the place to the 
imber of two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could judge,

id not arms for all their number neither. The whole account^

17 Spaniards. 

5 Englishmen. 

1 Old Friday, or Friday's father.

faithful 
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniards. 

To arm these they had: —

8 Fowling-pieces. 

6 Muskets or fowling-pieces, which were taken by me from the 
mutinous seamen, who I reduced. 

2 Swords. 

3 Old Halberds. 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fuzee,^ but 
they had every one a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarteretaffi 
with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by bis 
side a hatchet; also every one of our men had hatchets. Two of 
the women could not he prevailed upon but they would come into 
the fight; and they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniarda 
had taken from the savages when the first action happened, wbich 
I have spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another; and 
the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, who I have described so often, com- 
manded the whole; and Wilham Atkins, who, though a dreadful 
fellow for wickedness, was a most daring bold fellow, commanded 
under him. The savages came forward like lions, and our men, 
which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in their situar 
tion, only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, 
with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of bufihes 
as an advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them pass bj, 
and then fire into the middle of them; and as soon as he bad 
fired, to make his retreat as nimble as he could round a part of 
the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards where they i^

THE SAVAGES RETREAT. 403 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and 
then divided themselves into three hodies, and resolved to fall in 
among them all together. They had in each hody eight persons 
—that is to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty-two men, and 
the two women, who, hy the way, fought desperately. 

They divided the firearms equally in each party, and so of the 
halberds and staves. They would have had the women keep 
back, but they said they were resolved to die vrith their husbands I 
Having thus formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and they came up to the teeth of the enemy, 
shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. The savages stood 
all together but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise 
of our men shouting from three quarters together. They would 
have fought if they had seen us; and as soon as we came near 
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday 
was wounded, though not dangerously. But our men gave them 
no time, but running up to them, fired among them three ways, 
and then fell in with the butt-ends of their muskets, their swords, 
anned staves and hatchets, and laid about them so well, that in a 
word, they set up a dismal screaming and howUng, flying to save 
their lives which way soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed, or mortally 
bounded, in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them; 
tie rest, being frighted out of their wits, scoured through the 
^oods and over the hills with all the speed and fear that nimble

they resolved to march to that part of the island where the savages 
were fled, and see what posture they were in. This neceswrily 
led them over the place where the fight had been, and where they 
found several of the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past 
recovering life: a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds; 
for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of battle to 
destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his misery. 

However, there was no need to give any orders in this case; for 
their own savages, who were their servants, despatched those poor 
creatures with their hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where the more 
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there appeared 
about an hundred still. Their posture was generally sitting 
upon the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth, and 
the head put between the two hands, leaning down upon the 
knees. 

When our men came within two musket shot of them, the 
Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without ball, 
to alarm them. This he did that by their coimtenance he might 
know what to expect, namely, whether they were still in heart to 
fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged, 
and so he might manage accordingly. 

This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages heard thefiist 
gun and saw the flash of the second, they started up upon their 
feet in the greatest consternation imaginable; and as our men 
advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and 
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which our men did 
not understand and had never heard before, and thus they ran op 
the hills into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been cahn, 
and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not then consider 
that this might probably have been the occasion of their coming 
again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come 
so many and so often as would quite desolate the island and starve 
them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wouni 
kept always with them, proved the best coimsellor in this case. 
His advice was. to take the advantage that offered, and clap i^^

between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity 
of ever returning any more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this; and some were against it, for 
fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and live there des- 
perate,, and so they should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be 
afraid to stir out about their business, and have their plantations 
continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be 
reduced to a life of continual distress.

coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down and cried, 
" Oa, oa, waramokoa!" and some other words of their language, 
which none of the others understood anything of; hut as they 
made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy to understand 
they begged to have their boats spared, and that they would be 
gone, and never come there again. 

But our men were now satisfied that they had no way to pre- 
serve themselves or to save their colony but effectually to prevent 
any of these people from ever going home again, depending upon 
this, that if ever so much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that, letting 
them know that they should not have any mercy, they fell to 
work with their canoes, and destroyed them, every one that the 
storm had not destroyed before; at the sight of which the savages 
raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people heard plain 
enough, after which they ran about the island like distracted men, 
so that, in a word, our men did not really know at first what to 
do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that 
while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have 
kept good guard at the same time upon their plantations; for 
though, it is true, they had driven away their cattle, and the 
Indians did not find out their main retreat, I mean my old castle 
at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my 
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the 
fences and planting about it, trod all the com under foot, tore up 
the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did to our 
men an inestimable damage, though to themselves not one farthing- 
worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet 
they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and 
down; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when they 
found them single, so our men durst not go about single, for fetf 
of being surrounded with their numbers. The best was, they had 
no weapons; for though they had bows, they had no arrows left, 
nor any materials to make any, nor had they any edged tool or 
weapon among them.

THE INDIAN DIFFICULTY. 4*07 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and 
leed deplorable; but at the same time our men were also 
)ught to very bad circumstances by them; for though their 
reats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and 
ir harvest spoiled, and what to do, or which way to turn them- 
res they knew not. The only refuge they had now was the 
ck of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little 
n which grew there, and the plantation of the three English - 
n, William Atkins and his comrades, who were now reduced to 
>, one of them being killed by an arrow, which struck him on 
i side of his head, just under the temple, so that he never spoke 
►re; and it was very remarkable that this was the same barbar- 
a fellow who cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet, and 
LO afterwards intended to have murdered all the Spaniards. 
I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than 
ine was at any time, after I first discovered the grains of barley 
id rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising my com 
id my tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred 
olves upon the island, which would devour everything they could 
►me at, yet could very hardly be come at themselves. 
The first thing they concluded, when they saw what their cir- 
imstances were, was, that they would, if possible, drive them 
D to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if any more 
ivages came on shore they might not find one another. Then, 
lat they would daily himt and harass them, and kill as many of 
lem as they could come at, till they had reduced their number; 
id if they could at last tame them and bring them to anything, 
ley would give them com, and teach them how to plant and live 
)on their daily labour. 

In order to this, they so followed them, and so terrified them 
ith their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at 
I Indian, if he did not hit him yet he would fall down for fear; 
id so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of sight 
rther and farther, till at last our men following them, and every 
ly almost killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in 
le woods and hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the 
:most misery for want of food, and many were afterwards found

408 MERCIFUL PROPOSALS. 

dead in the woods, without any hurt, but merely starved to 
death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity 
moved them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was the mort 
gentlemanly generous-minded man that ever I met with in my 
life; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to 
act as interpreter, and to go among them and see if they might 
be brought to some conditions that might be depended upon, to 
save their lives jand to do us no spoiL 

It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being 
weak and half starved, one of them was at last surprised, and made 
a prisoner. He was sullen at first, and would neither eat or 
drink; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him, 
and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came 
to himself. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, 
and told him how kind the other would be to them all; that they 
would not only save their lives, but would give them a part of the 
island to live in, provided they would give satisfaction that they 
would keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond it to injure 
or prejudice others; and that they should have com given them to 
plant and make it grow for their bread, and some bread given 
them for their present subsistence : and old Friday bade the fellow 
go and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they 
said to it, assuring them that, if they did not agree immediately, 
they should be all destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in 
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the 
first offer, and begged to have some food given them; upon which 
twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with three 
Indian slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where they 
were. The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of 
bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and 
three live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill. 
where they sat down, eat the provisions very thankfully, and were 
the most faithful fellows to their words that could be thought o^;

TEACHING THE SAVAGES. 409 

or except when they came to heg victuals and directions, they 
lever came out of their bounds, and there they lived when I came 
the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them both to plant com, make bread, breed 
une goats, and milk them; they wanted nothing but wives, and 
ley soon would have been a nation. They were confined to a 
dck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying 
lain towards the sea before them, on the south-east comer of the 
land. They had land enough, and it was very good and fruitful; 
ley had a piece of land about a mile and a half broad, and three 
r four mile in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made 
or myself; and gave them among them twelve hatchets, and three 
>r four knives; and there they hved, the most subjected, innocent 
ireatTires that ever were heard of. 

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect 
X) the savages till I came to revisit them, which was above two 
rears. Not but that now and then some canoes of savages came 
3n shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts; but as they were of 
several nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that came 
before, or the reason of it, they did not make any search or 
iiquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it would have 
been very hard to have found them out 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that happened 
io them to my return, at least that was worth notice. The Indians 
)r savages were wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
^ent among them, but forbid, on pain of death, any one of the 
ndians coming to them, because they would not have their settle- 
aent betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, namely, that they taught the 
avages to make wicker-work or baskets; but they soon outdid 
heir masters, for they made abundance of most ingenious things 
Q wicker-work; particularly, all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, 
upboards, &c., as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and 
hundance of other things, being very ingenious at' such work 
vhen they were once put in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we

410 A WONDERFUL TENT. 

furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pickaxes, 
and all things of that kind which they could want. 

With the help of these tools they were so very handy, that they 
came at last to build up their huts, or our houses, very handsomely, 
raddling or working it up like basket-work all the way round; 
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very 
odd, but was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as 
against all sorts of vermin : and our men were so taken with it, 
that they got the wild savages to come and do the like for them; 
80 that when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, they 
looked at a distance as if they lived all like bees in a hive. And 
as for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, neces- 
sary, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket- 
work as I believe was never seen. It was an hundred and twenty 
paces round in the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls 
were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty- 
two in number, and very strong, standing about seven foot high. 
In the middle was another not above twenty-two paces round, hut 
built stronger, being eight-square in its form; and in the eight 
comers stood eight very strong posts, round the top of which he 
laid strong pieces pinned together with wooden pins, from which 
he raised a pyramid for the roof of eight rafters, very handsome, 
I assure you, and joined together very well, though he had no 
nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself, too, out 
of the old iron that I had left there; and indeed this fellow showed 
abundance of ingenuity in several things, which he had no know- 
ledge of. He made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to 
blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for his work; and he 
formed out of one of the iron crows a middling good anvil to 
hammer upon; in this manner he made many things, but espeo- 
ally hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to 
the house : after he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he 
worked it up between the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and 
thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over 
that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house 
was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed he owned 
that the savages made the basket-work for him.

ITS INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS. 411 

The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round this inner 
apartment, and long rafters lay from the two and thirty angles to 
the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty foot distant; 
so that there was a space like a walk within the outer wicker- wall 
and without the inner, near twenty foot wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, 

but much fairer, and divided it into six apartments, so that he had 

six rooms on a floor; and out of every one of these there was a 

door, first into the entry or coming into the main tent, and another 

door into the space or walk that was round it; so that walk was 

also divided into six equal parts, which served not only for retreat, 

but to store up any necessaries which the family had occasion for. 

These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what 

other apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered : — as soon 

as you were in at the door of the outer circle, you had a short 

passage straight before you to the door of the inner house, but on 

either side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you 

Went, first, into a large room or store-house, twenty foot wide, and 

about thirty foot long, and through that into another not quite so 

long; so that in the outer circle was ten handsome rooms, six of 

which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner 

tent, and served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective 

chambers of the inner circle; and four large warehouses or bams, 

c>r what you please to call them, which went in through one an- 

cither, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer 

cloor to the inner tent 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the 
world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built. 
In this great bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say. Will 
Atkins and his companion- The third was killed, but his wife 
remained with three children; for she was, it seems, big with 
child when he died. And the other two were not at all backward 
to give the widow her full share of everything — I mean, as to their 
com, milk, grapes, &c., and when they killed a kid, or found a 
tiuiile on the shore; so that they all lived well enough, though it 
was true they were not so industrious as the other two, as has 
been observed already.

412 GENERAL IMPROVEMENT. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, namely, that as for 
religion, I don't know that there was anything of that kind 
among them. They pretty often, indeed, put one another m mind 
that there was a God, by the very common method of seamen; 
namely, swearing by his name. Nor were their poor ignorant 
savage wives much the better for having been married to Christians, 
luB we must call them; for as they knew very little of God them- 
selves, so they were utterly uncapable of entering into any dis- 
course with their wives about a God, or to talk anything to them 
concerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives 
had made from them was, that they had taught them to speak 
English pretty well ; and all the children they had, which was 
near twenty in all, were taught to speak English too, from their first 
learning to speak, though they at first spoke it in a very hroken 
manner like their mothers. There were none of these children 
above six years old when I came thither, for it was not mnch 
above seven years that they had fetched these five savage ladies 
over: but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all children 
more or less; I think the cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth 
child. And the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, qniet, 
laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one another; 
mighty observant and subject to their masters — I cannot call them 
husbands; and wanted nothing but to be well instructed m the 
Christian religion, and to be legally married; both which were 
happily brought about afterwards by my means, or, at leasts in 
consequence of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and 
pretty much of my five runagate Englishmen, I must say some- 
thing of the Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, 
and in whose story there are some incidents aLso remarkable 
enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about their circum- 
stances when they were among the savages. They told id« 
readily, that they had no instances to give of their application 
or ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, miserable, 
dejected handful of people; that if means had been put into their

repeat in just the same words that he spoke in, yet I remember I 
made it into an English proverb of my own, thus: — 

'* In trouble to be troubled, 
Is to have your trouble doubled." 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements I 
had made in my solitude; my unwearied application, as he called 
it, and how I had made a condition which, in its circumstances, 
was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy 
than theirs was, even now, when they were all together. He told 
me it was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence of 
mind in their distress than any people that ever he met with; that 
their unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in 
the world to struggle with misfortunes, for that their first step in 
dangers, after the common efforts are over, was always to despair, 
lie down under it, and die without rousing their thoughts up to 
proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly : that they 
were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of 
food or of present sustenance till they could provide : that it is 
true I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was alone; 
but then the supplies I had providentially thrown into my hands 
by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was such a help 
as would have encouraged any creature in the world to have 
applied himself as I had done. " Seignior," says the Spaniard, 
" had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should never have 
gotten half those things out of the ship, as you did; nay," says 
he, " we should never have found means to have gotten a raft 
to carry them, or to have gotten the raft on shore vnthout hoat 
or sail; and how much less should we have done," said he, "« 
any of us had been alone?" Well, I desired him to abate his 
compliment, and go on with the history of their coining on shore, 
where they landed. He told me they unhappily landed at a pla^ 
where there were people without provisions; whereas, had they 
had the common sense to have put off to sea again, and gone to 
another island a little farther, they had found provisions, though 
without people; there being an island that way, as they have heen

THE SPANIARDS' STORY. 415 

Wd, where there was provisions, though no people ; that is to say, 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and had 
Med the island with goats and hogs at several times; where they 
have bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and sea-fowls were 
in such plenty, that they could have been in no want of flesh, 
ihough they had found no bread; whereas here they were only 
sustained with a few roots and herbs which they understood not, 
ind which had no substance in them, and which the inhabitants 
jave them sparingly enough, and who could treat them no better, 
inless they would turn cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which was 
ihe great dainty of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize 
the savages they were with, and to teach them rational customs 
in the ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted 
it upon them as unjust, that they who came there for assistance 
and support should attempt to set up for instructors of those that 
gave them bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set up 
for the instructors of others but those who could live without 
them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were 
driven to; how, sometimes, they were many days without any food 
fit all; the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort of 
savages that lived more indolent, and for that reason were less 
supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had reason to believe 
others were in the same part of the world; and yet they found 
that these savages were less ravenous and voracious than those 
who had better supplies of food. 

Also, they added, that they could not but see with what demon- 
Jtrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of 
jrod directs the events of things in the world; which, they said, 
appeared in their circumstances : for if, pressed by the hardships 
ihey were under, and the barrenness of the country where they 
^ere, they had searched after a better place to live in, they had 
hen been out of the way of the relief that happened to them by 
ny means. 

Then they gave me an account how the savages who they lived 
mong expected them to go out with them into their wars. And

416 AN AWKWARD POSITION. 

it was true that, as they had firearms with them, had they not had 
the disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not have been 
serviceable only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible 
both to friends and enemies ; but being without powder and shot, 
and yet in a condition that they could not in reason deny to go 
out with their landlords to their wars, when they came into the 
field of battle they were in a worse condition than the savages 
themselves, for they neither had bows or arrows, nor could they 
use those the savages gave them: so that they could do nothing 
but stand still and be wounded with arrows till they came up 
to the teeth of their enemy ; and then, indeed, the three halberds 
they had were of use to them; and they would often drive a whole 
little army before them with those halberds and sharpened sticb 
put into the muzzles of their muskets. But that for all this, they 
were sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger 
from their arrows, till at last they found the way to make them- 
selves large targets of wood, which they covered with skins of 
wild beasts, whose names they knew not; and these covered them 
from the arrows of the savages: that, notwithstanding these, 
they were sometimes in great danger, and were once five of them 
knocked down together with the clubs of the savages; which 
was the time when one of them was taken prisoner— that is to 
say, the Spaniard whom I had relieved, that at first they thought 
had been killed. But when afterwards they heard he was taken 
prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and 
would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued 
him. 

They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest 
of their company rescued them, and stood over them, fighting till 
they were come to themselves, all but him who they thought had 
been dead; and then they made their way with their halberds and 
pieces, standing close together in a line, through a body of above 
a thousand savages, beating down all that came in their way, got 
the victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because 
it was with the loss of their friend; who the other party, finding 
him alive, carried ofif with some others, as I gave an account '^

10 they thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst

ire surprised with the account he gave them of his errand, and 
it there was a Christian in any place near, much more one 
It was able, and had humanity enough to contribute to their

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the 
ief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread — things 
;y had not seen since their coming to that miserable place ; how 
en they crossed it and blessed it, as bread sent from Heaven; 
i what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it; as 
o of the other things I had sent for their supply. And, after 
, they would have told me something of the joy they were in at 
3 sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to the person 
d place from whence all these new comforts came; but they told 
5 it was impossible to express it by words, for their excessive 
^ naturally driving them to unbecoming extravagances, they 
d no way to describe them but by telling me that they bordered 
on lunacy, having no way to give vent to their passion suitable 
the sense that was upon them ; that in some it worked one way, 
d in some another; and that some of them, through a surprise 
joy, would burst out into tears, others be stark mad, and others 
mediately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and 
lied to my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father; and 
e poor people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea, after their 
ip was on fire; the mate of the ship's joy when he found himself 
livered in the place where he expected to perish ; and my own 
J when, after twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good ship

that if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if they weie 
twice as many as before ; so they had no concern about that 
Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom 
I call governor, about their stay in the island; for as I was not

some and leave others, who perhaps would be unwiUing to stay if 
their strength was diminished. 

On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them there, 
not to remove them; and then I let them know that I had 
brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had been 
at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary, as well 
for their convenience as their defence ; and that I had such and 
such particular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit 
their number, as by the particular necessary employments which 
they were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those things 
in which, at present, they were to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before 
I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them one 
by one if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities 
that had been among them, and would shake hands with one 
another, and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, 
that so there might be no more misunderstandings or jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, 
said they had met with afflictions enough to make them all sober, 
and enemies enough to make them all friends; that, for his part 
he would live and die with them; and was so far from designing 
anything against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done 
nothing to him but what his own mad humour made necessary, 
and what he would have done, and perhaps much worse, in their 
case; and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the 
foolish and brutish things he had done to them; and was ver)' 
willing and desirous of living in terms of entire friendship wd 
union with them; and would do anything that lay in his power 
to convince them of it : and as for going to England, he cared not 
if he did not go thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said they had indeed at first disarmed and ex- 
cluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct,

A STATE DINNER. 419 

as they had let me know; and they appealed to me for the neces- 
Bity they were under to do so; but that Will Atkins had behaved 
kimself so bravely in the great fight they had with the savages, 
and on several occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful 
to, and concerned for, the general interest of them all, that they 
had forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much 
to be trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of 
them; and that they had testified their satisfaction in him by 
committing the conmiand to him, next to the governor himself. 
And as they had an entire confidence in him and all his country- 
men, so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence by 
all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued and 
trasted; and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving 
me this assurance, that they would never have any interest 
separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we ap- 
pointed the next day to dine all together : and indeed we made a 
splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on 
shore and dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on 
shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef, and 
four pieces of pork out of the ship's provision, with our punch- 
bowl and materials to fill it ; and, in particular, I gave them ten 
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer — things 
that neither the Spaniards or the Englishmen had tasted for many 
years; and which, it may be supposed, they were exceeding 
glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the 
cooks roasted; and three of them were sent covered up close on 
board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat 
from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I 
brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that their might be no 
dispute about dividing, I showed them that there was suflScient 
for them all; and desired that they might all take an equal quan- 
tity of the goods that were for wearing — that is to say, equal 
when made up; as first, I distributed linen sufficient to make 
every one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard's request after-

420 PRESENTS TO THE SETTLERS. 

wards made them up six. These were exceeding comfortable to 
them, .having been what, as I may say, they had long since forgot 
the use of, or what it was to wear them. 

I allotted the thin English stuffs which I mentioned before to 
make every one a light coat, like a frock, which I judged fittest 
for the heat of the season, cool and loose ; and ordered that when- 
ever they decayed they should make more as they thought fit 
The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats, &a 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, sat upon the 
countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care 1 had 
taken of them, and how well I had furnished them. They told 
me I was a father to them, and that having such a correspondent 
as I was in so remote a part of the world, it would make them 
forget that they were left in a desolate place; and they all volun- 
tarily engaged to me not to leave the place without my consent 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, 
particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters— all of 
them most necessary people; but above all, my general artificer, 
than whom they could not name anything that was more useful 
to them. And the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to 
work immediately, and, with my leave, made them every one a 
shirt the first thing he did; and which was still more, he taught 
the women, not only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, 
but made them assist to make the shirts for their husbands and . 
for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they 
were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy things, and 
made them clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, 
lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind. 

But to let them see how Nature made artificers at first, I 
carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins's basket house, as I 
called it; and they both owned they never saw an instance of such 
natural ingenuity before, nor anything so regular and so handily 
built, at least of its kind. And one of them, when he saw it, 
after musing a good while, turned about to me, " I am sure," says 
he, "that man has no need of us; you need do nothing butgiv« 
him tools."

A WELL-STORED MAGAZINE. 421 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every 
lan a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows 
r ploughs; and to every separate place a pick axe, a crow, a 
road axe, and a saw — always appointing that as often as any 
ere broken or worn out, they should be supplied without grudg- 
ig out of the general stores that I left behind. 

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and 
11 sorts of tools and iron work, they had without tale as they 
jquiredj for no man would care to take more than they wanted, 
ad he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any 
xount whatever. And for the use of the smith, I left two ton 
E unwrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought them, was 
ich, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; 
>r now they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon 
ach shoulder, if there was occasion; and were able to fight a 
housand savages if they had but some little advantages of situa- 
ion, which also they could not miss of if they had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was 
tarved to death, and the maid also. She was a sober, well 
ducated, rehgious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively 
hat every one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an un- 
happy life with us, there being no woman in the ship but herself; 
'ut she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing things so 
/ell ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and 
onsidering that they had neither business or acquaintance in the 
Jast Indies, or reason for taking so long a voyage — I say, con- 
idering all this, both of them came to me and desired I would 
ive them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among 
ly family, as they called it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plat of ground 
Hotted to them, where they had three tents or houses set up, 
iirrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed like Atkins's, adjoining 
3 his plantation. Their tents were contrived so that they had 
ach of them a room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent like a 
:reat storehouse to lay all their goods in, and to eat and drink in.

422 THE THREE COLONIES. 

the same place, and so the island was divided into three colonies, 
and no more, namely, the Spaniards, with old Friday and the 
first servants, at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in 
a word, the capital city; and where they had so enlarged and ex- 
tended their works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, 
that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. 
Never was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I believe, 
in any part of the world ; for I verily believe a thousand men 
might have ranged the island a month, and if they had not known 
there was such a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would 
not have found it; for the trees stood so thick and so close, and 
grew so fast matted into one another, that nothing but cutting 
them down first could discover the place — except the only two 
narrow entrances, where they went in and out, could be found, 
which was not very easy. One of them was just down at the 
water edge of the creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred 
yards to the place; and the other was up the ladder at twice, as 
I have already formerly described it; and they had a large wood, 
thick planted also, on the top of the hill, which contained above 
an acre, which grew apace and covered the place from all discovery 
there, with only one narrow place between two trees, not easy to 
be discovered, to enter on that side. 

The other colony was that of W. Atkins's, where there were 
four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with 
their wives and children; three savages that were slaves; the 
widow and children of the Englishman that was killed; the young 
man and the maid; and by the way, we made a wife of her also 
before we went away. There were also the two carpenters and 
the tailor, who I brought with me for them ; also the smith, who 
was a very necessary man to them, especially as a gunsmith to 
take care of their arms; and my other man, who I called Jack of 
all trades, who was in himself as good almost as twenty men, for 
he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow; 
and before I went away we married him to the honest maid that 
came with the youth in the ship I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to «»J

A NEW PERSONAGE. 423 

mt of the ship's crew whom I took up at sea. It is true this man 
vaa a Eoman,^ and perhaps it may give offence to some hereafter 
f I leave anything extraordinary upon record of a man who before 
'. begin, I must (to set him out in just colours) represent in terms 
"-ery much to his disadvantage in the account of Protestants; as, 
Irst, that he was a Papist; secoridly, a Popish priest; and thirdly, 
i French Popish priest 

But justice demands of me to give him a due character; and I 
nust say he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person; 
3xact in his life, extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost 
everything he did. What, then, can any one say against my 
being very sensible of the value of such a man notwithstanding 
his profession? — though it may be my opinion, perhaps, as well 
as the opinion of others who shall read this, that he was mistaken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him after he had 
agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight 
exceedingly in his conversation. And he first began with me 
about religion in the most obliging manner imaginable. 

"Sir," says he, "you have not only, under God (and at that he 
crossed his breast), saved my life, but you have admitted me to 
go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging civility have 
taken me into your family, giving me an opportunity of free con- 
versation. Now, sir," says he, "you see by my habit what my 
profession is, and I guess by your nation what yours is. I may 
think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost 
endeavours on all occasions to bring all the souls I can to the 
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic doctrine; 
but as I am here under your permission, and in your family, I 
am bound in justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and 
good manners, to be under your government; and therefore I 
shall not, without your leave, enter into any debates on the point 
of religion in which we may not agree, farther than you shall give 
me leave." 

I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but 
acknowledge it; that it was true we were such people as they 
called heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic that I had

424 A TRUE PRIEST. 

conversed with without falling into any inconveniences, or canying 
the questions to any height in debate; that he should not find 
himself the worse used for being of a diflferent opinion from us, and 
if we did not converse without any dislike on either side upon tkt 
score, it should be his fault, not ours. 

He replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily 
separated from disputes; that it was not his business to cap prin- 
ciples with every man he discoursed with; and that he radier 
desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a rdigim.^ 
that if I would give him leave at any time to discourse upon 
religious subjects, he would readily comply with it; and that then 
he did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own 
opinions as well as he could; but that, without my leave, he would 
not break in upon me with any such thing. 

He told me, farther, that he would not cease to do all that he- 
came him in his office as a priest, as well as a private Christian, 
to procure the good of the ship and the safety of all that was in 
her; and though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and he 
could not pray uith us, he hoped he might pray/(?r us, which he 
would do upon all occasions. In this manner we conversed; and 
as he was of a most obliging, gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, 
if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I be- 
lieve, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the 
many extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had 
befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world; 
and particularly, this was very remarkable, namely, that in the 
voyage he was now engaged he had had the misfortune to be five 
times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the place whither 
any of the ships he was in were at first designed ! That his M 
intent was to have gone to Martinico,^ and that he went on board 
a ship bound thither at St. Malo, but being forced into Lisbon by 
bad weather, the ship received some damage by running aground 
in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged to luJoad her 
cargo there : that finding a Portuguese ship there bound to the

Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet 
¥ith a vessel there bound to Martinico, he went on board in order 
» sail to the Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship 
)eing but an indifferent mariner, had been out in his reckoning, 
md they drove to Fial, where, however, he happened to find a very 
5ood market for his cargo, which was corn, and therefore resolved

but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far as 
the Banks (so they call the place where they catch the fish), 
where, meeting with a French ship bound from France to Quebec 
in the river of Canada and from thence to Martinico, to carry pro- 
visions, he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his 
first design; but when he came to Quebec the master of the ship 
died, and the ship proceeded no farther: so the next voyage he 
shipped himself for France in the ship that was burned when we 
took them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies, 
as I have already said Thus he had been disappointed in five 
voyages, all, as I may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall 
We occasion to mention farther of the same person. 

But I shall not make digressions into other men's stories which 
lave no relation to my own. I return to what concerns our affair 
in the island He came to me one morning, for he lodged among 
^ all the while we were upon the island, and it happened to be 
just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony at the far- 
thest part of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me, with 
a very grave countenance, that he had for two or three days desired 
an opportunity of some discourse with me, which he hoped should 
not be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some 
'neasure correspond with my general design, which was the pros- 
perity of my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more 
fcan he yet thought it was, in the way of God's blessing.

as really so religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I 
ui interrupted him, and begged him to go on; and in the mean- 
me, because it seemed that what we had both to say might take 
[) some time, I told him I was going to the Englishmen's plan- 
ktions, and asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of 
by the way. He told me he would more willingly wait on me 
aither, because there partly the thing was acted which he desired 

speak to me about; so we walked on, and I pressed him to be 
ree and plain with me in what he had to say. 

"Why then, sir," says he, "be pleased to give me leave to lay 
lown a few propositions as the foundation of what I have to say, 
hat we may not diflFer in the general principles, though we may 
6 of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars. First, 
r, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion — 
id it is very unhappy that it is so, especially in the case before 
!, as I shall show afterwards — yet there are some general prin- 
ples in which we both agree, namely, first, that there is a God, 
d that this God having given us some stated general rules for 
J service and obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly 
oflfend him, either by neglecting to do what he has commanded, 
by doing what he has expressly forbidden. And let our different 
ligions be what they will, this general principle is readily owned 
us all, that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow a 
esumptuous sinning against his command, and every good 
iristian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are 
der his care living in a total neglect of God and his commands, 
is not your men being Protestants, whatever my opinion may 
of such, that discharges me from being concerned for their souls,

428 THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY. 

and there are three things which, if I am right, must stand in the 
way of God's blessing upon your endeavours here, and which I 
should rejoice for your sake and their own to see removed. And, 
sir," says he, " I promise myself that you will fully agree with me 
in them all as soon as I name them; especially because I shall 
convince you that every one of them may with great ease, and 
very much to your satisfaction, be remedied." 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, but went on. 
" First, sir," says he, " you have here four Englishmen, who hare 
fetched women from among the savages, and have taken them as 
their wives, and have had many children by them all, and yet are 
not married to them after any stated legal manher, as the laws of 
God and man require; and therefore are yet, in the sense of both, 
no less than adulterers, and living in adultery. To this, sir," says 
he, " I know you will object, that there was no clergyman or priest 
of any kind or of any profession to perform the ceremony; nor 
any pen and ink or paper to write down a contract of marriage, 
and have it signed between them. And I know also, sir, what 
the Spaniard governor has told you; I mean of the agreement that 
he obliged them to make when they took these women— namely, 
that they should choose them out by consent, and keep separately 
to them ; which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agree- 
ment with the women as wives, but only an agreement among 
themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. 

" But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony " ^ (so he 
called it, being a Koman) " consists not only in the mutual consent 
of the parties to take one another as man and wife, but in the 
formal and legal obligation that there is in the contract to compd 
the man and woman at all times to own and acknowledge each 
other; obliging the men to abstain from all other women, to 
engage in no other contract while these subsist, and on all occasions, 
as ability allows, to provide honestly for them and their childwni 
and to oblige the women to the same, or like conditions, mvio^ 
mutandis, on their side. 

" Now, sir," says he, " these men may, when they please, ct

A GREAT NEGLECT. 429 

when occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their chil- 
dren, leave them to perish, and take other women and marry them 
whilst these are living." And here he added, with some warmth, 
"How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty 1 and how 
shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, however 
good in themselves, and however sincere in your design, while 
these men, who at present are your subjects, under your absolute 
government and dominion, are allowed by you to live in open 
adultery?" 

I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but much more with 
the convincing arguments he supported it with ; for it was certainly 
true, that though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a 
fonnal contract on both sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed 
by any token which they had all agreed to be bound by, though 
it had been but breaking a stick between them, engaging the men 
to own these women for their wives upon all occasions, and never 
to abandon them or their children, and the women to the same 
^th their husbands, had been an effectual lawful marriage in the 
sight of God; and it was a great neglect that it was not done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young priest by tell- 
^^g him that all that part was done when I was not here; and 
^fley had lived so many years with them now, that if it was an 
adultery, it was past remedy, they could do nothing in it now. 

**Sir," says he, "asking your pardon for such freedom, you 
••^e right in this, that it being done in your absence, you could 
'ot be charged with that part of the crime. But, I beseech you, 
^tter not yourself that you are not therefore under an obligation 
^ do your utmost now to put an end to it. How can you think 
U.t that, let the time past lie on who it will, all the guilt for the 
iture will lie entirely upon you ? Because it is certainly in your 
^wer now to put an end to it, and in nobody's power but yours." 
I was so dull still that I did not take hiixi right; but I imagined 
Xat by putting an end to it he meant that I should part them, 
cid not suffer them to live together any longer. And I said to 
im, " I could not do that by any means, for that it would put the 
^hole island into confusion." He seemed surprised that I should

430 A GRAVE COMPLAINT. 

should now separate them, but legally and eflfectually marry them 
now. And as, sir, my way of marrying them may not be so easy 
to reconcile them to, though it will be as effectual, even by your 
own laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid 
among men; I mean by a written contract, signed by both man 
and woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws 
of Europe would decree to be valid." 

I was amazed to see so much true piety and so much sincerity 
of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his 
own party or church, and such true warmth for the preserving 
people that he had no knowledge of, or relation to; I say, for 
preserving them from transgressing the laws of God — the like of 
which I had indeed not met with anywhere. But recollecting 
what he had said of marrying them by a written contract, which I 
knew would stand too, I returned it back upon him, and told him 
I granted all that he had said to be just, and on his part very 
kind; that I would discourse with the men upon the point now, 
when I came to them. And I knew no reason why they should 
scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew well enough 
would be granted to be as authentic and valid in England as if 
they were married by one of our own clergymen. What was 
afterwards done in this matter I shall speak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint 
which he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his 
debtor for the first, and thanked him heartily for it. He told me 
he would use the same freedom and plainness in the second, and 
hoped I would take it as well. And this was, that notwithstand- 
ing these English subjects of mine, as he called them, had hved 
with those women for almost seven years, had taught them to 
speak English, and even to read it; and that they were, as he per- 
ceived, women of tolerable understanding and capable of in8tru^ 
tion; yet they had not. to this hour taught them anything of the 
Christian religion, no not so much as to know that there was a 
God or a worship, or in what manner God was to be served, or that 
their own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not who, wtf 
false and absurd.

Would certamly call them to account for, and perhaps at last take 
the work out of their hands. He spoke this very affectionately 
and warmly. " I am persuaded," says he, " had those men lived 
in the savage country whence their wives came, the savages would 
have taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and 
to worship the devil, than any of these men," so far as he could 
see, "had taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the 
true God. " Now, sir," said he, " though I do not acknowledge 
your religion, or you mine, yet we should be glad to see the devil's 
servants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to know the 
general principles of the Christian religion; that they might, at 
least, hear of God, and of a Eedeemer, and of the resurrection, 
and of a future state — things which we all believe; they had at 
least been so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true 
Church than they are now in the public profession of idolatry and 
devil-worship." 

I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and embraced 
Wm with an excess of passion. " How far," said I to him, " have 
J been from understanding the most essential part of a Christian, 
tamely to love the interest of the Christian Church, and the good 
of other men's souls ! I scarce have known what belongs to being 
* Christian." "Oh, sir, do not say so," replied he; "this thing 
^ not your fault" "No," says I; "but why did I never lay it 
^ heart as well as you?" "Tis not too late yet," said he; "be 
ot too forward to condemn yourself." "But what can be done 
Ow?" said I; "you see I am going away." "Will you give me 
save," said he, "to talk with those poor men about it?" "Yes, 
ith all my heart," said I; "and will oblige them to give heed 
i what you say too." "As to that," said he, "we must leave 
lem to the mercy of Christ; but it is our business to assist them, 
icourage them, and instruct them; and if you will give me leave, 
id God his blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls 
lall be brought home into the great circle of Christianity, if not 
ito the particular faith that we all embrace,^ and that even while 

iThis evidently means, if not into the particular faith that any of us may 
nbrace — that is the doctrines belonging especially to any particular church or 
>dy of Christians.

432 A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. 

you stay here." Upon this, I said, " I shall not only give you 
leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it" What followed on 
this account I shall mention also again in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to 
blame. " Why, really," says he, " it is of the same nature; and I 
will proceed, asking your leave, with the same plainness as before. 
It is about your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your con- 
quered subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, re- 
ceived among all Christians, of what church or pretended church 
soever — namely, * The Christian knowledge ought to be propa- 
gated by all possible means, and on all possible occasions.' 'lis 
on this principle that our Church sends missionaries into Persia, 
India, and China; and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, 
willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages and the most 
dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach 
them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over 
to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an 
opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor savages 
brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of God their Maker 
and Eedeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occasion 
of doing good, which is really worth the expense of a man's whole 
life." 

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say. 
I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion be- 
fore me, let his particular principles be of what kind soever. As 
for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this in my 
heart before, and I believe should not have thought of it; for I 
looked upon these savages as slaves, and people who, had we had 
any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or would 
have been glad to have transported them to any other part of the 
world, for our business was to get rid of them, and we would all 
have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they 
had never seen their own. But to the case. I say 1 was con- 
founded ati his discourse, and knew not what answer to make him 
He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder. "Sir,

offence." "No, no," says I, "I am offended with nobody but

lyself ; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to think that I 
aould never take any notice of this before, but with reflecting 
hat notice I am able to take of it now. You know, sir," said I, 
what circumstances I am in. I am bound to the East Indies, in 
ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an un- 
ifferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying 
11 this while at victuals and wages upon the owners' account 
b is true I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay 
lore I must pay £S sterling per diem demurrage, nor can I stay 
pon demurrage above eight days more, and I have been here 
hirteen days already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in 
his work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here again ; 
n which case, if this single ship should miscarry, in any part of 
ler voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I was left 
n here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully de- 
ivered." 

He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage, but 
aid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of saving 
Jeven and thirty souls was not worth my venturing all I had in the 
•^orld for? I was not so sensible of that as he was. I returned 
'Pon him thus : " Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an 
'^strument in God's hand to convert seven and thirty heathens to 
l^e knowledge of Christ, but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are 
'^en over to the work, so that it seems so naturally to fall into 
^ way of your profession, how is it that you do not rather offer 
^Urself to undertake it than press me to it?" 
Tjpon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked along, 
d putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow. " I most 
^rtily thank God and you, sir," says he, "for giving me so 
ident a call to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself dis- 
irged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily 

it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and dif- 
cilties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met with, 
xt I may be dropped at last into so glorious a work." 
I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this 
me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his colour 
tne and went, as if he had been falling into fits. In a word,

ANOTHER DIFFICULTY. 435 

he, "I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin thanks all my 
days if I could be made the least happy instrument of saving the 
souls of these poor men, though I was never to set my foot oflF of 
ttis island, or see my native country any more. But since j*ou 
wll honour me," says he, " with putting me into this work (for 
which I will pray for you all the days of my life), I have one 
humble petition to you," said he, "besides." "What is that?" 
said L " Why," says he, " it is that you will leave your man 
Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me; 
for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they to me." 

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because I 
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons. 
He had been the companion of my travels; he was not only 
faithful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree, and I 
W resolved to do something considerable for him if he outlived 
^e, as it was probable he would. Then I knew that, as I had 
^red Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite confound him 
^ bring him to embrace another profession ; and he would never, 
^hile his eyes were open, believe that his old master was a heretic, 
^d would be damned ; and this might in the end ruin the poor 
^llow's principles, and so turn him to his first idolatry. 

However, a sudden thought reheved me in this strait, and it 
'^s this : I told him I could not say that I was willing to part 
"^th Friday on any account whatever, though a work that to him 
as of more value than his life ought to be to me of much more 
ilue than the keeping or parting with a servant But, on the 
her hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no means cou- 
nt to part with me, and I could not force him to it without his 
nsent, without manifest injustice, because I had promised I 
3uld never put him — and he had promised and engaged to me 
at he would never leave me unless I put him — away. 
He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational 
cess to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one 
3rd of their language, nor they one word of his. To remove 
is difficulty, I told him Friday's father had learned Spanish, 
bich I found he also understood, and he should serve him for an 
terpreter. So he was much better satisfied, and nothing could

persuade him but he would stay to endeavour to convert them; 
but Providence gave another, and very happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we 
eame to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after 
some account given them of what I had done for them— namely, 
what necessary things I had provided for them, and how they 
were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and very 
thankful for, I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they 
led, and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had 
already taken of it, and arguing how unchristian and irreligioos 
a life it was. I first asked them if they were married men or 
bachelors? They soon explained their condition to me, and 
showed me that two of them were widowers, and the other three 
were single men or bachelors. I asked them with what consciences 
they could take these women and lie with them, as they had done, 
call them their wives, and have so many children by them, and 
not be married lawfully to them? 

They all gave me the answer that I expected, namely, that 
there was nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the 
governor to keep them as their wives; and to keep them and own 
them as their wives; and they thought, as things stood with them, 
they were as legally married as if they had been married hy a 
parson, and with all the formalities in the world. 

I told them that no doubt they were married in the 
God, and were bound in conscience to keep them as theii* wives; 
but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might pretend 
they were not married, and so desert the poor women and children 
hereafter; and that their wives being poor desolate women, friend- 
less and moneyless, would have no way to help themselves. 1 
therefore told them that, imless I was assured of their honest m- 
tent, I could do nothing for them, but would take care that what 
I did should be for the women and their children without them; 
and that unless they would give some assurances that they wodW 
marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they should 
continue together as man and wife, for that it was both scandaloQ* 
to men and oflFensive to God, who they could not think woold 
bless them if they went on thus.

WILL ATKINS' DECLARATION. 437 

All this went on as I expected, and. they told me, especially 
Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they 
loyed their wives as well as if they had been bom in their own 
native country, and would not leave them upon any account what- 
ever; and they did verily believe their wives were as virtuous and 
as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skiU, as much for them 
and for their children, as any women could possibly do, and they 
would not part with them on any account. And Will Atkins, for 
his own particular, added, if any man would take him away, and 
offer to carry him home to England, and make him captain of the 
best man-of-war in the navy, he would not go with him if he 
might not carry his wife and children with him; and if there was 
a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her now with all 
his heart. 

This was just as I would have it The priest was not with me 
at that moment, but was not far off; so to try him farther, I told 
liim I had a clergyman with me, and if he was sincere I would 
iave him married the next momingi and bid him consider of it, 
and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need not con- 
sider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I 
iad a minister with me; and he believed they would be all willing 
*bo. I then told him that my friend the minister was a French- 
'^an, and could not speak English, but that I would act the clerk 
*^etween them. He never so much as asked me whether he was 
*^apist or Protestant, which was indeed what I was afraid of. 
^Ut, I say, they never inquired about it. So we parted; I went 
^ack to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his 
Ompanions. I desired the French gentleman not to say anything 
^ them till the business was thorough ripe, and I told him what 
tiswer the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me and told 
le they had been considering what I had said: that they were 
ery glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they were 
ery willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally 
larried as soon as I pleased; for they were far from desiring to 
art with their wives, and that they meant nothing but what was 
ery honest when they chose them. So I appointed them to meet

438 THE PRIEST'S SCRUPLES. 

me the next morning, and that in the meantime they should let 
their wives know the meaning of the marriage-law; and that it 
was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that 
they should not forsake them, whatever might happea 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the 
thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had 
reason to be. So they failed not to attend all together at my apart- 
ment the next morning, where I brought out my clergyman; and 
though he had not on a minister's gown, after the manner of Eng- 
land, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of France, yet 
having a black vest something like a cassock, with a sash round it, 
he did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his language,! 
was his interpreter. 

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the scruples 
he made of marrying the women because they were not baptized 
and professed Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his 
person; and there was no need after that to enquire whether he 
was a clergyman or no. 

Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been carried so far 
as that he would not have married them at all; nay, notwithstand- 
ing all I was able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, 
yet very steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, 
unless he had first talked with the men and the women too; and 
though at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed 
to it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I had acquainted 
him with their circumstances, and with the present design: that 
he was very willing to perform that part of his function, and 
marry them as I had desired; but that before he could do it, he 
must take the liberty to talk with them. He told them, that in 
the sight of all indifferent men, and in the sense of the laws of 
society, they had lived all this while in an open adultery; and that 
it was true that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectuaUy 
separating them from one another now, could put an end to it; 1>"^ 
there was a difficulty in it, too, with respect to the laws of Chris- 
tian matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, namely, 
that of marrying one that is a professed Christian to a savage, to

idolater, and a heathen, one that is not baptized ; and yet that he 
did not see that there was time left for it to endeavour to persuade 
the women to be baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom 
they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they 
could not be baptized. 

He told them he doubted they were but indifferent Christians 
themselves; that they had but little knowledge of God or of his 
ways; and therefore he could not expect that they had said much 
to their wives on that head yet ; but that unless they would pro- 
mise him to use their endeavour with their wives to persuade them 
to become Christians, and would, as well as they could, instruct them 
in the knowledge and belief of God that made them, and to wor- 
ship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them; 
for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages; nor 
was it consistent with the principles of the Christian religion; and 
^as, indeed, expressly forbidden in God's law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very 
faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I 
codd; only sometimes adding something of my own to convince 
^hem how just it was, and how I was qi his mind; and I always 
*^ery faithfully distinguished between what I said from toyself and 
^hat were the clergyman's words. They told me it was very true 
*^iat the gentleman had said, that they were but very indifferent 
Christians themselves, and that they had never talked to their 
•ives about religion. " Lord, sir," says Will Atkins, "how should 
''e teach them religion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and 
esides, sir," said he, " should we go to talk to them of God and 
esus Christ, and heaven and hell, 'twould be to make them laugh 
b us, and ask us what we believe ourselves ? And if we should 
jU them we believe all the things that we speak of to them — such 
3 of good people going to heaven, and wicked people to the devil — 
tiey would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that believe

is enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing, 
'oiks must have some religion themselves, before they pretend to 
each other people." " Will Atkins," said I to him, " though I

440 TRUE REPENTANCE. 

tell your wife that she's in the wrong; — that there is a God and 
a religion better than her own; that her gods are idols, that they 
can neither hear nor speak; that there is a great Being that made 
all things, and that can destroy all that he has made; that he 
rewards the good and punishes the bad; and that we are to be 
judged by him at last for all we do here. You are not so ignorant 
but even Nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and I 
am satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it yourself." 

"That's true, sir," said Atkins; "but with what face can I say 
anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell me immediately 
it cannot be true?" 

"Not true!" said I; "what do you mean. by that?" "Why, 
sir," said he, " she will tell me it cannot be true that this God I 
shall tell her of can be just, or can punish or reward, since I am 
not punished and sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked 
creature as she knows I have been, even to her and to everybody else; 
and that I should be suflPered to live that have been always acting 
so contrary to what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought 
to have done." 

"Why, truly, Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou speakest too 
much truth." And with that I let the clergyman know what 
Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. " Oh," said the 
priest, " tell him there is one thing will make him the best minister 
in the world to his wife, and that is repentance; for none teach 
repentance like true penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, 
and then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct his 
wife. He will be then able to tell her that there is not only » 
God, and that he is the just Rewarder of good and evil, hut that 
he is a merciful Being, and with infinite goodness and longsuffenng 
forbears to punish those that offend, waiting to be gracious, and 
willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should return 
and live : that he oftentimes suffers wicked men to go on a long 
time, and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribu- 
tion : that it is a clear evidence of God, and of a future state, that 
righteous men receive not their reward, or wicked men their pun- 
ishment, till they come into another world; — and this vnll lead 
him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of the

last judgment. Let him but repent for himself, he will be an 
excellent preacher of repentance to his wife." 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the 
while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily 
affected with it; — ^when being eager, and hardly suffering me to 
make an end, " I know all this, master," says he, " and a great deal 
more; but I han't the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when 
God and my own conscience knows, and my wife will be an un- 
deniable evidence against me, that I have lived as if I had never 
heard of a God or future state, or anything about it And to talk 
of my repenting — alas!" (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, 
and I could see that tears stood in his eyes) " 'tis past all that 
with me." "Past it, Atkins!" said I; "what dost thou mean 
by that]" "I know well enough what I mean," says he; "I 
mean 'tis too late, and that is too true." 

I told my clergyman word for word what he said. The poor 
zealous priest (I must call him so; for, be his opinion what it wiU, 
le had certainly a most singular affection for the good of other 
Qen's souls; and it would be hard to think he had not the like for 
is own) — I say, this zealous affectionate man could not refrain 
2ars also. But recovering himself, he said to me, " Ask him but 
de question — Is he easy that it is too late, or is he troubled and 
ishes it were not sol" I put the question fairly to Atkins, and 
e answered with a great deal of passion, " How could any man be 
isy in a condition that certainly must end in eternal destruction] 
-that he was far from being easy, but that, on the contrary, he 
jlieved it would one time or other ruin him." 
"What do you mean by that]" said I. Why, he said, he 
)lieved he should, one time or other, cut his throat to put an end 
the terror of it. 

The clergyman shook his head with a great concern in his face 
lien I told him all this. But turning quick to me upon it, says 
J, " If that be his case, you may assure him it is not too late; 
arist will give him repentance. But pray," says he, "explain 
is to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ and the merit 
his passion procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too 
te for any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able to

442 A TRUE PENITENT. 

sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray tell him 
there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, 
and when God may refuse to hear, but that 'tis never too late 
for men to ask mercy : and we that are Christ's servants are com- 
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Christy 
to all those that sincerely repent; so that 'tis never too late to 
repent." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness; 
but it seemed as if he turned oflf the discourse to the rest, for he 
said to me he would go and have some talk with his wife; so he 
went out a while, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they 
were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, much as I was 
when I went rambling away from my father, and yet that there 
were none of them backward to hear what had been said; and all 
of them seriously promised that they would talk with their wives 
about it, and do their endeavour to persuade them to turn 
Christians. 

The clerg3rman smiled upon me when I reported what answer 
they gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking his 
head, " We that are Christ's servants," says he, "can go no further 
than to exhort and instruct; and when men comply, submit to the 
reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do : we are 
bound to accept their good words. But believe me, sir," said he, 
" whatever you may have known of the life of that man you call 
Will Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere convert among thein. 
I take that man to be a true penitent. I won't despair of the rest; 
but that man is apparently struck with the sense of his past life; 
and I doubt not but when he comes to talk religion to his wife, 
he will talk himself eflfectually into it; for attempting to teach 
others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. I knew 
a man, who having nothing but a summary notion of religion 
himself, and being wicked and profligate to the last degree in his 
life, made a thorough reformation in himself by labouring to con- 
vert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously 
of Jesus Christ to his wife, my life for it, he talks himself into a 
thorough convert — makes himself a penitent And who knows 
what may follow 1

A HOPEFUL SIGHT. 443 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to 
deavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he 
irried the other three couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were 
t yet come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a while, was 
rious to know where Atkins was gone; and turning to me, says 
, " I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here and 
)k. I daresay we shall find this poor man somewhere or other 
king seriously to his wife, and teaching her already something 
religion." I began to be of the same mind; so we went out 
;ether, and I carried him a way which none knew but myself, 
d where the trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to 
5 through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to 
i out, when, coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and 
J tawny savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager 
discourse. I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, 
d then, having showed him where they were, we stood and 
>ked very steadily at them a good while, 
^e observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun, 
id to every quarter of the heavens, then down to the earth, then 
Lt to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the 
Bes. " Now," says my clergyman, " you see my words are made 
►od; the man preaches to her. Mark him now; he is telling 
ii that our God has made him, and her, and the heavens, the

tion, and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voice. 
He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked agam 
earnestly to her; and two or three times we could see him embrace 
her most passionately. Another time we saw him take out his 
handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again with a 
kind of transport very unusual; and after several of these things 
we see him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand to 
help her up, when immediately, leading her by the hand a step or 
two, they both kneeled down together, and continued so about 
two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, "St 
Paul, St Paul! * behold, he prayeth!'" I was afraid Atkins would 
hear him, therefore I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, 
that we might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must con- 
fess, was the most affecting, and yet the most agreeable, that ever 
I saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself, and contained 
himself for awhile, but was in such raptures of joy to think that 
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was not 
able to contain himself. He wept several times, then throwing 
up his hands and crossing his breast, said over several things ejacu- 
latory, and by way of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testi- 
mony of the success of our endeavours. Some he spoke softly, 
and I could not well hear, others audibly; some in Latin, some in 
French; then two or three times the tears of joy would interrupt 
him that he could not speak at all But I begged that he would 
compose himself, and let us more narrowly and fully observe what 
was before us, which he did for a time, and the scene was not 
ended there yet; for after the poor man and his wife were risen 
again from their knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly 
to her; and we observed by her motion that she was greatly 
affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting up her hands, 
laying her hand to her breast, and such other postures as usually 
express the greatest seriousness and attention. This continued 
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked away too, 
so that we could see no more of them in that situation. 

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and first I toM 
him I was glad to see the particulars we had both been witness**

A DIFFICULTY STARTED. 445 

to; that though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet 
tkt I began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man 
and his wife, however ignorant they might both be; and I hoped 
8uch a beginning would have a yet more happy end. " And who 
inows," said I, " but these two may in time, by instruction and 
example, work upon some of the others 1" "Some of them!" 
said he, turning quick upon me, "ay, upon all of them. Depend 
upon it, if those two savages, for he has been but little better, 
as you relate it, should embrace Jesus Christ, they will never 
leave till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is naturally 
communicative, and he that is once made a Christian will never 
leave a pagan behind him, if he can help it." I owned it was a 
most Christian principle to think so, and a testimony of a true 
zeal, as well as a generous heart in him. " But, my friend," said 
I, "will you give me leave to start one difficulty here? I cannot 
tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate concern 
^hich you show for the turning the poor people from their pagan- 
ism to tlie Christian religion; but how does this comfort you, 
^hile these people are in your account out of the pale of the 
Catholic Church, without which you believe there is no salvation; 
^0 that you esteem these but heretics, and for other reasons, as 
•ffectually lost as the pagans themselves." 

To this he answered with abundance of candour and Christian 
harity thus: "Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman Church, and 
priest of the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the 
linciples of the Roman faith; but yet, if you will believe me, and 
bat I do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my 
ircumstances and your civilities; I say, nevertheless, I do not 
)ok upon you who call yourselves Reformed without some charity, 
dare not say, though I know it is our opinion in general; I say, 
dare not say that you cannot be saved. I will by no means limit 
le mercy of Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you 
ito the bosom of his Church in a manner to us unperceivable, and 
hich it is impossible for us to know ; and I hope you have the 
ime charity for us. I pray daily for your being all restored to 
hrist's Church, by whatsoever methods he, who is all-wise, is 
leased to direct. In the meantime, sure you will allow it to

consist with me, as a Eoman, to distinguish far between a Pro- 
testant and a pagan; between one that calls on Jesus Christ, 
though in a way which I do not think is according to the true 
faith, and a savage, a barbarian, that knows no God, no Christ, no 
Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale of the Catholic 
Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it than those 
that know nothing of God or his Church. And I rejoice, there- 
fore, when I see this poor man, whom you say has been a profligate 
and almost a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as 
we suppose he did, though not fully enlightened, believing that 
God, from whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch 
his heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of that truth in 
his own time ; and if God shall influence this poor man to convert 
and instruct the ignorant savage his wife, I can never believe that 
he shall be cast away himself. And have I not reason then to 
rejoice the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, 
though they may not be brought quite home into the bosom of the 
Catholic Church just at the time when I may desire it, leaving it 
to the goodness of Christ to perfect his work in his own time and 
his own way 1 Certainly I would rejoice if all the savages in 
America were brought like this poor woman to pray to God, 
though they were to be all Protestants at first, rather than they 
should continue pagans and heathens, firmly believing that He 
that had bestowed the first light to them would further illuminate 
them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and bring them into the 
pale of his Church when he should see good." 

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this truly pious 
Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his reasoning; 
and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if such a temper 
was universal, we might be all Catholic Christians, whatever church 
or particular profession we joined to, or joined in; that a spirits 
charity would soon work us all up into right principles. And in 
a word, as he thought that the like charity would make us all 
Catholics, so I told him I believed had all the members of his 
church the like moderation, they would soon be all Protestants 
And there we left that part, for we never disputed at all 

However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by the

land, "My friend," says I, "I wish all the clergy of the Romish 
Church were blessed with such moderation, and had an equal 
share of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion ; but I must 
tell you that if you should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, 
they would put you into the Inquisition." 

"It may be so," said he; "I know not what they might do 
in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be the better 
Christians for that severity, for I am sure there is no heresy in 
too much charity." 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there 
was over, so we went back our own way; and when we came 
back, we found them waiting to be called in. Observing this, I 
isked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had 
een him under the bush, or no; and it was his opinion we should 
lot, but that we should talk to him first, and hear what he would 
ly to us. So we called him in alone, nobody being in the place 
Ut ourselves, and I began with him thus: — 

Will Atkins, said I, prithee, what education had you] What 
as your father 1 

W, A. K better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my father was 
clergyman. 

B, C. What education did he give you] 

/F. A, He would have taught me well, sir; but I despised all 
iucation, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was. 

E. C. It's true, Solomon says, "He that despises reproof is 
ratish." 

fF. A. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed — I murdered my father, 
or God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir — I murdered my 
oor father. 

Pr. Hal a murderer! 

[Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as he spoke it) 
and looked pale. It seems he believed that Will had really killed 
his own father.]

and the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the 
Diind, of all the sins we can commit. 

B. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins. I 
cannot bear it 

W. A. You bear it, master? I daresay you know nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, I may say 
every tree, in this island is witness to the anguish of my soul, for 
my ingratitude and base usage of a good, tender father; a father 
much like yours, by your description. And I murdered my father 
as well as you, Will Atkins; but I think, for all that, my repen- 
tance is short of yours, too, by a great deal 

[I would have said more if I could have restrained my passions : but 
I thought this poor man's repentance was so much sincerer than 
mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse and retire ; for I 
was surprised with what he said, and thought that, instead of my 
going about to teach and instruct him, the man was made a teacher 
and instructor to me in a most surprising and unexpected manner.] 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly 
^ffi^cted with it, and said to me, " Did I not say, sir, that when 
^jiis man was converted he would preach to us all ? I tell you, 
^^, if this one man be made a true penitent, here will be no need 

^f me; he will make Christians of all on the island." But having 

^ bttle composed myself, I renewed my discourse with Will 

Atkins.

fF. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a 

lart through my very soul. I have been talking about God and 

'eligion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a 

Christian of her; and she has preached such a sermon to me as I 

hall never forget while I live. 
B, C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you; but 

vhen you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has 

lung them back upon you. 
}F, A. Ay, sir, with such a force as is not to be resisted. 
B, C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between ypu and 

jTOur wife, for I know something of it abeady.

450 HUSBAND AND WIFK 

fV. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account of it I 
am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express. But 
let her have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an 
account of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and 
reform my life. 

E. C But tell us some of it. How did you begin, Willi For 
this has been an extraordinary case, that's certain. She has 
preached a sermon indeed, if she has wrought this upon you. 

IF, A, Why, I first told her the nature of our laws about mar- 
riage, and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged 
to enter into such compacts as it was neither in the power of one 
or other to break; that otherwise order and justice could not be 
maintained, and men would run from their wives and abandon 
their children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither families 
be kept entire or inheritances be settled by legal descent 

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you mate her 
understand what you meant by inheritance and families? They 
know no such thing among the savages, but marry anyhow, with- 
out regard to relation, consanguinity, or family : brother and 
sister — nay, as I have been told, even the father and daughter, and 
son and the mother. 

W. A.l believe, sir, you are misinformed; and my wife assures 
me of the contrary, and that they abhor it. Perhaps, for any 
farther relations they may not be so exact as we are; but she 
tells me they never touch one another in the near relations you 
speak of. 

B. C. Well, what did she say to what you told herl 

W. A, She said she liked it very well, and it was much better 
than in her country. 

B. C. But did you tell her what marriage wasi 

JV. A. Ay, ay; there began all our dialogue. I asked her if 
she would be married to me our way. She asked me what way 
that was. I told her marriage was appointed by God. And here 
we had a strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife hid, 
I believe.

in writing just after he told it me, was as followB: — ]

abominable wretch.

untaught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a 
wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her about God but 
what the reproach of his own carriage would make most irrational to 
her to believe; nay, that already she had told him that she could not 
believe in God, because he that was so wicked was not destroyed.]

L8 to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, or evil in its

This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand, and

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too long

her understand him; and as she spoke but very broken English, 
he could not understand her. However, he turned himself tome 
and told me that he believed there must be more to do with this 
woman than to marry her. I did not understand him at first, 
but at length he explained himself, namely, that she ought to be 
baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for going about 
it presently. "No, no; hold, sir," said he. ** Though I would 
have her be baptized by all means, yet I must observe, that Will 
Atkins, her husband, has indeed brought her in a wonderful 
manner to be willing to embrace a religious life, and has given 
her just ideas of the being of a God, of his power, justice, mercy, 
yet I desire to know of him if he has said anything to her of 
Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners, of the nature of faith 
in him, and redemption by him, of the Holy Spirit, the resun^ 
tion, the last judgment, and a future state." 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the poorfell6w 
fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said something to 
her of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked a 
creature, and his own conscience so reproached him with his 
horrid ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions that 
her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give 
to those things, and make her rather contemn rehgion than 
receive it. But he was assured, he said, that her mind was so 
disposed to receive due impressions of all those things, that if I 
would but discourse with her she would make it appear to my 
satisfaction that my labour would not be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter 
between my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to 
begin with her. But sure such a sermon was never preached by 
a Popish priest in these latter ages of jbhe world; and, as I toM 
him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the 
sincerity of a Christian, without the error of a Roman Catholic; 
and that I took him to be such a clergyman, as the Roman hishops 
were before the. Church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty 
over the consciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace the know-

y and faith, with an affection and a surprising degree of under-

her own request she "was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that he 
3Tild perform that office with some caution, that the man might

her ill consequences which might attend a difference among us 

that very religion which we were instructing the other in. He

wl not known it before. And so he did; for saying only some

ANOTHER MATCH. 459 

man who I had taken out of the famished ship's company came 
to me, and told me he understood I had a clerg}'man with me, 
and that I had caused the Englishmen to he married to the savages 
whom they called wives; that he had a match too, which he de- 
sired might be finished before I went, between two Christians, 
which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's 
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island. 
So I began to persuade him not to do anjrthing of that kind 
^hly, or because he found himself in this solitary circumstance. 
I represented to him that he had some considerable substance in 
the world, and good friends, as I understood by himself and by 
his maid also; that the maid was not only poor and a servant, but 
^v-as unequal to him, she being six or seven and twenty years old, 
^nd he not above seventeen or eighteen; that he might very pro- 
l>ably, with my assistance, make a remove from this wilderness, 
^nd come into his own country again; and that then it would be 
^ thousand to one but he would repent his choice; and the dis- 
like of that circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I 
"Was going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling, and told 
Xne, with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses; 
that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts, his present cir- 
cumstance being melancholy and disconsolate enough; and he was 
very glad to hear that I had thoughts of putting them in a way 
to see their country again; and nothing should have put him upon 
sta3ring there but that the voyage I was going was so exceeding 
long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the reach 
of all his friends : that he had nothing to desire of me but that I 
would settle him in some little property in the island where he 
was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he 
would settle himself here like a planter, waiting the good time 
when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him, and 
hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came to England : 
that he would give me some letters to his friends in London to let 
them know how good I had been to him, and in what part of the 
world and what circumstance I had left him in: that he promised 
me that, whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the

improvements he had made upon it, let the value be what it 
would, should be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his youth, 
and was the more agreeable to me because he told me positively 
the match was not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances 
that, if I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his letters, 
and do his business effectually, and that he might depend I would 
never forget the circumstance I had left him in. But still I was 
impatient to know who was the person to be married, upon which 
he told me it was my Jack of all trades and his maid Susan. 

I was most agreeably surprised when he named the match, for 
indeed I thought it very suitable. The character of that man I 
have given already; and as for the maid, she was a very honest, 
modest, sober, and religious young woman; had a very good share 
of sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very hand- 
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good man- 
ners, and not backward to speak when anything required it, or 
impertinently forward to speak when it was not her business; very 
handy and housewifely in anything that was before her; an ex- 
cellent manager, and fit indeed to have been governess to the 
whole island; she knew very well how to behave to all kind of 
folks she had about her, and to better, if she had found any there. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them the 
same day; and as I was father at the altar, as I may say, and gave 
her away, so I gave her a portion ; for I appointed her and her 
husband a handsome large space of ground for their plantation. 
And indeed this match, and the proposal the young gentleman 
made to give him a small property in the island, put me upon 
parcelling it out amongst them, that they might not quarrel after- 
wards about their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who, 
indeed, was now grown a most sober, grave, managing fellow, 
perfectly reformed, exceeding pious and religious, and, as far as 1 
may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily believe 
was a true sincere penitent. 

He divided things so justly, and so much to everyone's satis- 
faction, that they only desired one general writing under my hand

GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAND. 461 

Per the whole, which I caused to be drawn up and signed and 
sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation of every 
aian's plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally 
I right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective 
plantations or farms, with their improvements, to them and their 
tieirs, reserving all the rest of the island as my own property, and 
4 certain rent for every particular plantation after eleven years, if 
[, or any one from me or in my name, came to demand it, pro- 
lucing an attested copy of the same writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I told them I was 
Qot capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give 
bhemselves; only made them promise me to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another. And so I prepared to leave 
them. 

One thing I must not omit, and this is, that being now settled 
in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much 
business in hand, it was but odd to have seven and thirty Indians 
Hve in a nook of the island independent, and indeed unemployed; 
for excepting the providing themselves food, which they had dif- 
ficulty enough in too, sometimes, they had no manner of business 
^r property to manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor 
Spaniard that he should go to them, with Friday's father, and 
propose to them to remove, and either plant for themselves or take 
them into their several families as servants, to be maintained for 
iheir labour, but without being absolute slaves ; for I would not 
idmit them to make them slaves by force by any means, because 
hey had their liberty given them by capitulation, and, as it were, 
xticles of surrender, which they ought not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very 
heerfully along with him; so we allotted them land and planta- 
ions, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be 
mployed as servants in the several families we had settled. And 
bus my colony was, in a manner, settled as follows: — The 
Spaniards possessed my original habitation, which was the capital 
ity, and extended their plantations all along the side of the 
rook, which made the creek that I have so often described, as far 
s my bower; and as they increased their culture, it went always

462 FINAL ARRANGEMENTS. 

eastward. The English lived in the north-east part, where Will 
Atkins and his comrades began, and came on southward and 
south-west, towards the back part of the Spaniards; and every 
plantation had a great addition of land to take in, if they found 
occasion, so that they need not jostle one another for want of 
room. 

All the west end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any 
of the savages should come on shore there, only for their usual 
customary barbarities, they might come and go. If they disturbed 
nobody, nobody would disturb them; and no doubt but they were 
often ashore and went away again, for I never heard that the 
planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more. 

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend 
the clergyman that the work of converting the savages might 
perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction. And I told 
him that now I thought it was put in a fair way; for the savages 
being thus divided among the Christians, if they would but every 
one of them do their part with those which came under their hands, 
I hoped it might have a very good effect. 

He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do their part 
"But how," says he, "shall we obtain that of themi" 1 told 
him we would call them all together, and leave it in charge with 
them, or go to them one by one, which he thought best So we 
divided it, he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists, 
and I to the English, who were all Protestants; and we recom 
mended it earnestly to them, and made them promise that they 
never would make any distinction of Papist or Protestant in their 
exhorting the savages to turn Christians; but teach them the 
general knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus 
Christ And they likewise promised us, that they would never 
have any differences or disputes one with another about religion. 

When I came to W. Atkins's house — I may call it so, for such 
a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was not standing 
in the world again; I say, when I came there, I found the young 
woman I have mentioned above and W. Atkins's wife were be- 
come intimates; and this prudent religious young woman hid 
perfected the work Will Atkins had begun. And though it wm

THE WELCOME BIBLE. 463 

ot above four days after what I have related, yet the new bap- 
zed savage woman was made such a Christian as I have seldom 
eard of any like her in all my observation or conversation in the 
^orld. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning before I went to 
tiem, that amongst all the needful things I had to leave with 
tiem I had not left them a Bible; in which I showed myself less 
onsidering for them than my good friend the widow was for me 
Then she sent me the cargo of an hundred pounds from Lisbon, 
There she packed up three Bibles and a Prayer-book. However, 
he good woman's charity had a greater extent than ever she 
naagined; for they were reserved for the comfort and instruction 
•f those that made much better use of them than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to 
»\^ill Atkins's tent or house, and found the young woman and 
^tldns's baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together; 
or W. Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy: I asked if they 
^ere together now, and he said, " Yes," so I went into the house, 
tnd he with me, and we found them together very earnest in dis- 
ourse. "Oh, sir," says Will Atkins, "when God has sinners to 
econcile to himself and aliens to bring home, he never wants a 
nessenger; my wife has got a new instructor. I knew I was un- 
rorthy as I was uncapable of that work. That young woman 
las been sent hither from heaven; she is enough to convert a 
^hole island of savages!" The young woman blushed, and rose 
p to go away, but I desired her to sit still. I told her she had 
good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would bless her 
lit 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book 
nong them, though I did not ask; but I put my hand in my 
acket, and pulled out my Bible. " Here," says I to Atkins, " I 
ave brought you an assistant that perhaps you had not before." 
he man was so confounded that he was not able to speak for 
)me time; but recovering himself, he takes it with both his 
ands, and turning to his wife, "Here, my dear," says he; "did 
at I tell you our God, though he lives above, could hear what

The woman was surprised, and was like to have ran 
mistake that none of us were aware of; for she firmly b 
God had sent the book upon her husband's petition. It 
that providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a 
quent sense; but I believed it would have been no difficult 
at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to have b 
that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose t 
that individual book. But it was too serious a matter U 
any delusion to take place, so I turned to the young womi 
told her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert 
first and more ignorant understanding of things, and beg^ 
to explain to her that God may be very properly said to 
our petitions, when in the course of his providence such 
are in a particular manner brought to pass as we petition 
but we do not expect returns from heaven in a miracuk 
particular manner, and that it is our mercy that it is not & 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so tht 
was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here; and I shoul 
thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the w 
have had it so. But the surprise of joy upon Will At

no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in th 
for anything of its kind than he was for his Bible; nor, I

SUSAN'S STORY. 465 

and the early instruction of parents is not lost, though it may 
have been many years laid asleep, but some time or other they 
may find the benefit of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man. However ignorant he was, or 
divested of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had 
some to do with now more ignorant than himself, and that the 
least part of the instruction of his good father that could now 
come to his mind was of use to him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his father used 
to insist .much upon the inexpressible value of the Bible, the privi- 
lege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons ; but he 
never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till now, 
^hen, being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he 
wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance. 

The young woman was very glad of it also for the present 
occasion, though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our 
ship among their goods, which were not yet brought on shore. 
And now having said so many things of this young woman, I 
cannot omit telling one story more of her and myself, which has 
something in it very informing and remarkable. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was 
feduced; how her mistress was starved to death, and did die on 
)oard that unhappy ship we met at sea; and how the whole ship's 
ompany being reduced to the last extremity, the gentlewoman 
nd her son and this maid were first hardly used as to provisions, 
nd at last totally neglected and starved ; that is to say, brought 
) the last extremity of hunger. 

One day being discoursing with her upon the extremities they 
iffered, I asked her if she could describe by what she had felt 
hat it was to starve, and how it appeared. She told me she 
jlieved she could, and she told her tale very distinctly thus : — 
" First, sir," said she, " we had for some days fared exceeding 
ird, and suflfered very great hunger; but now at last we were 
holly without food of any kind, except sugar and a little wine 
id a little water. The first day after I had received no food at

omach, and nearer night, mightily inclined to yawning and

aleepy. I lay down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep, and 
slept about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed, having 
taken a glass of wine when I lay down. After being about three 
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I found 
myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down again, but 
could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill ; and thus 1 con- 
tinued all the second day with a strange variety, first hungry, then 
sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second night, being 
obliged to go to bed again without any food more than a draught 
of fair water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Bs^rbadoes, 
and that the market was mightily stocked with provisions; that 
I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined very 
heartily. 

"I thought my stomach was as full after this as any would 
have been after, or at a good dinner; but when I waked, I was 
exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the extremity of 
famine. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in 
it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourishment; bat 
there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting office 
to work upon, I found the only effect of the wine was to raise 
disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay,tf 
they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk for some time. 

" The third day, in the morning, after a night of strange and 
confused inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I 
waked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not 
my understanding returned and conquered it — I say I question 
whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little child with 
me, its life would have been safe or not. 

" This lasted about three hours, during which time I was twice 
raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master told 
me, and as he can now inform you. 

" In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction, whether by the 
motion of the ship or some slip of my foot, I know not, I f^ 
down and struck my face against the comer of a pallet bed, in 
which my mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed oat 
of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, 1 ^

Susan's story. 467 

I came to myself, and the violence of the flame or the fever I was 
in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. 

"Then I grew «ick, and retched to vomit, but could not, for I 
had nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I had bled some 
time I swooned, and they all believed I was dead; but I came to 
myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my 
stomach, not to be described — not like the colic, but a gnawing 
eager pain for food; and towards night it went off" with a kind of 
earnest wishing or longing for food. I took another draught of 
water with sugar in it, but my stomach loathed the sugar, and 

brought it all up again; then I took a draught of water without 

sugar, and that stayed with me; and I laid me down upon the 

bed, praying most heartily that it would please God to take me 
away; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, 
and then waking, thought myself dying, being light with vapours 
from an empty stomach. I recommended my soul then to God, 
and earnestly wished that somebody would throw me into the 
sea. 

**A11 this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, 
^^iring, but bore it with much more patience than I ; and gave 
he last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master, 
^ho would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it; and 

believe it saved his life. 

" Towards the morning I slept again, and first when I awaked 
fell into a violent passion of crying, and after that had a second 
i of violent hunger. I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful 
>ndition. Had my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, 
am certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as much 
lish and as unconcerned as ever I did the flesh of any creature 
►pointed for food; and once or twice I was going to bite my own 
m. At last I saw the basin in which was the blood I had bled 

my nose the day before. I ran to it, and swallowed it with 
ch haste and such a greedy appetite as if I had wondered 
)body had taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from 
e now. 

" Though, after it was down, the thoughts of it filled me with 
3rror, yet it checked the fit of hunger; and I drank a draught

468 A DREADFUL CONDITION. 

of fair water, and was composed and refreshed for some hours after 
it. This was the fourth day, and thus I held it, till towards night, 
when, within the compass of three hours, I had all these several 
circumstances over again, one after another — namely, sick, sleepy, 
eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then 
sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again; and so 
every quarter of an hour, and my strength wasted exceedingly. 
At night I laid me down, having no comfort but in the hope that 
I should die before morning. 

" All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now turned 
into a disease, and I had a terrible colic and griping by wind, 
instead of food, having found its way into the bowels. And in this 
condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised a little with 
the cries and lamentations of my young master, who called out to 
me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up a little, for I 
had not strength to rise; but found she was not dead, though she 
was able to give very little signs of life. 

" I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some 
sustenance, that I cannot describe, with such frequent throes and 
pangs of appetite that nothing but the tortures of death can imi- 
tate. And in this condition I was when I heard the seamen above 
cry out, * A sail! a sail!' and haloo and jump about as if they 
were distracted. 

" I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress much 
less; and my young master was so sick that I thought he had been 
expiring; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any account 
what it was that occasioned such a combustion, nor had we hatl 
any conversation with the ship's company for two days, they having 
told us that they had not a mouthful of anjrthing to eat in the ship; 
and they told us afterwards they thought we had been dead. 

" It was this dreadful condition we were in when you were sent 
to save our lives; and how you found us, sir, you know as well as 
I, and better too." 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of 
starving to death as I confess I never met with, and was exceed- 
ing entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe it to be 
a tnie account, because the youth gave me an account of a good

)art of it^ though, I must own, not so distinct and so feelingly as 
lis maid; and the rather, because it seems his mother fed him at 
ihe price of her own life. But the poor maid, though her consti- 
iution being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in years, 
Mid a weakly woman too, she might struggle harder with it; I say, 
the poor maid might be supposed to feel the extremity something 
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last 
bit something longer than she parted with any to lelieve the maid. 
No question, as the case is here related, if our ship, or some other, 
had not so providentially met them, a few days more would have 
ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one 
another; and even that, as their case stood, would have served 
them but a little while, they being five hundred leagues from any 
W or any possibility of relief other than in the miraculous 
banner it happened; but this is by the way. I return to my 
disposition of things among the people. 

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I 
^i not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had 
darned, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I 
^Und, at least at my first coming, such seeds of divisions among 
iem, that I saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop and left it 
^ong them, they would upon every light disgust have separated, 
Id gone away from one another; or perhaps have turned pirates, 
Id so made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of 
ber and religious people, so as I intended it. Nor did I leave 
e two pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the two 
larter-deck guns that my nephew took extraordinarily, for the 
tne reason. I thought it was enough to qualify them for a de- 
isive war against any that should invade them; but not to set 
BHi up for an offensive war, or to encourage them to go abroad 
attack others, which in the end would only bring ruin and de- 
piction upon themselves and all their undertaking. I reserved 
B sloop, therefore, and the guns for their service another way, 
I shall observe in its place. 

I have now done with the island. I left them all in good cir- 
mstances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my 
ip again, having been five and twenty days among them; and

470 LEAVES THE ISLAND. 

as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I came to 
remove them, I promised to send some further reHef from the 
Brazils, if I could possibly find an opportunity; and particularly, 
I promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, aod 
cows; for as to the two cows and calves which I brought from 
England, we had been obliged by the length of our voyage to kill 
them at sea, for want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we 
set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All Saints in the Brazils in 
about twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage 
but this, — that about three days after we sailed, being hecalmed, 
and the current setting strong to the east-north-east, running, as 
it were, into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven some- 
thing out of our course, and once or twice our men cried, "Lan<i 
to the eastward;" but whether it was the continent or islands we 
could not tell by any means. 

But the third day towards evening, the sea smooth, and the 
weather calm, we saw the sea as it were covered towards the lan<i 
with something very black Not being able to discover what it 
was till after some time, our chief mate going up the main 
shrouds a little way and looking at them with a perspective, cried 
out it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an 
army, and spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some 
such word. " Nay, sir," says he, " don't be angry, for 'tis an 
army and a fleet too, for I believe there are a thousand canoes; 
and you may see them paddle along, and they are coming towards 
us, too, apace." 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew 
the captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the 
island, and having never been in those seas before, that he could 
not tell what to think of it, but said two or three times we 
should all .be devoured. I must confess, considering we were be- 
calmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked it 
the worse. However, I bade him not be afraid, but bring theabip 
to an anchor as soon as we came so near to know that we m^ 
engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace towirw

PURSUED BY SAVAGES. 471 

us; so I gave order to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails. 
As for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but fire; 
and therefore they should get their boats out and fasten them, one 
close by the head, and the other by the stern, and man them both 
well, and wait the issue in that posture. This I did, that the men 
in the boats might be ready with skeets and buckets to put out 
any fire these savages might endeavour to fix to the outside of the 
ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they 
came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by 
Christians. My mate was much mistaken in his calculation of 
their number, I mean of a thousand canoes; the most we could 
Qake of them, when they came up, being about a hundred and 
IX and twenty: and a great many of them too; for some of them 
ad sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the 
^t six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us they- seemed to be struck with 
onder and astonishment, as at a sight which they had doubtless 
2ver seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards 
iderstood, know what to make of us. They came boldly up, 
>wever, very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round 
i; but we called to our men in the boats not to let them come 
o near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement with them with- 
it our designing it; for five or six of their large canoes came so 
jar our longboat, that our men beckoned with their hands to 
em to keep back, which they understood very well, and went 
x;k; but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us 
3ni those boats, and one of our men in the longboat was very 
uch wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we 
inded down some deal boards into the boat, and th« carpenter 
•esently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them 
om the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. 
About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a body astern 
: us and pretty near us, so near that we could easily discern 
hat they were, though we could not tell their design. And I

472 DEATH OF FRIDAY. 

easily found they were some of my old friends, the same sort of 
savages that I had been used to engage with; and in a little time 
more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they came directly 
broadside with us, and then rowed down straight upon us, till 
they came so near that they could hear us speak. Upon this I 
ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any more 
arrows, and made all our guns ready; but being so near as to be 
within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out 
aloud to them in his language to know what they meant; which 
accordingly he did. Whether they imderstood him or not, that 
I knew not ; but as soon as he had called to them, six of them, 
who were in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turns their canoes 
from us, and stooping down, showed us their naked backsides 
Whether this was a defiance or challenge we know not, or whether 
it was done in mere contempt^ or as a signal to the rest; but im- 
mediately Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and un- 
happily for him, poor fellow, they let fly about three hundred of 
their arrows, and to my inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, 
no other man being in their sight. 

The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows, and 
about three more fell very near him; such unlucky marksmen 
they were. 

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, the companion 
of all my sorrows and solitudes, that I immediately ordered five 
guns to be loaded with small shot, and four with great, and gave 
them such a broadside as they had never heard in their lives 
before, to be sure. 

They were not above half a cable length off when we fired, and 
our gunners took their aim so well that three or four of their 
canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot 
only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us gave 
us no great offence, neither did I know for certain whether that 
which would pass for the greatest contempt among us might he 
understood so by them or not; therefore, in return, I had only 
resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with powder only» 
which I knew would fright them sufficiently. But when they

a-swimming; the rest, frighted out of their wits, scoured away as 
fast as they cotdd, taking but little care to save those whose boats 
were split or spoiled with our shot So I suppose that they were 
many of them lost. And our men took up one poor fellow 
swimming for his life, above an hour after they were all gone. 

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a 
great many; but in short, we never knew anything how it went 
with them, for they fled so fast, that in three hours or thereabouts 
we could not see above three or four straggling canoes; nor did 
we ever see the rest any more, for a breeze of wind springing up 
the same evening, we weighed and set sail for the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that 
he would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would 
starve himself to death. But I took a way to cure him, for I 
made them take him and turn him into the longboat, and made 
him believe they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave 
him where they found him, if he would not speak. Nor would 
that do; but they really did throw him into the sea, and came 
away from him ; and then he followed them, for he swam like a 
cork, and called to them in his tongue, though they knew not one 
word of what he said. However, at last they took him in again, 
and then he began to be more tractable, nor did I ever design 
they should drown him. 

We were now under sail again; but I was the most disconsolate 
creature alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been 
very glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken one of 
the rest from thence for my occasion, but it could not be; so we 
went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said, and 'twas a long 
while before we could make him understand anything; but, m 
time, our men taught him some English, and he began to be a 
little tractable. Afterwards we inquired what country he came 
from, but could make nothing of what he said; for his speech was 
so odd, all gutturals, and spoke in the throat in such a hollow, 
odd manner, that we could never form a word from him; and we 
were all of opinion that they might speak that language as well 
if they were gagged, as otherwise. Nor could we perceive that 
they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but

formed their words just as a hunting horn forms a tune with an 
open throat. He told us, however, some time after, when we had 
taught him to speak a httle English, that they were going with 
their kings to fight a great battle. When he said kings, we asked 
him how many kings? He said they were five nation, — we 
could not make him understand the plural s, — and that they all 
joined to go against two nation. We asked him what made 
them come up to us] He said, " To makee te great wonder look;" 
where it is to be observed that all those natives, as also those of 
Africa, when they learn English, they always add two e^s at the 
end of the words where we use one, and make the accent upon 
them, as makhh, taMh, and the like; and we could not break them 
of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last 
he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, 1 must take my 
last leave of him; poor, honest Friday! We buried him with all 
the decency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin, 
and throwing him into the sea. And I caused them to fire eleven 
guns for him; and so ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, 
honest, and most affectionate servant that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and in about 
t^relve days' time we made land in the latitude of five degrees 
south of the line, being the north-easternmost land of all that part 
of America. We kept on south by east in sight of the shore four 
days, when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came 
to an anchor oflT of the Bay of All Saints, the old place of my de- 
liverance, from whence came both my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this part that had less business than I had ; 
and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted to hold 
the least correspondence on shore. Not my partner himself, who 
was alive, and made a great figure among them ; not my two mer- 
chants' trustees; not the fame of my wonderful preservation in that 
island, could obtain me that favour. But my partner, remember- 
ing that I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of the 
monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to 
the poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the prior that then 
was to go to the governor and get leave for ine personally, with

the captain and one more, besides eight seamen, to come on Bhore, 
and no more; and this upon condition, absolutely capitulated for, 
that we should not ofifer to land any goods out of the ship, or to 
carry any person away without license. 

They were so strict with us as to landing any goods, that it was 
with extreme difl&culty that I got on shore three bales of English 
goods, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and some linen, which 1 had 
brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, though like me, he 
came from little at first; and though he knew not that I had the 
least design of giving him anything, he sent me on board a present 
of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty 
moidores, including some tobacco, and three or four fine medab in 
gold. But I was even with him in my present, which, as I have 
said, consisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine 
Hollands. Also I delivered him about the value of one hundred 
pounds sterling in the same goods, for other uses; and I obliged 
him to set up the sloop which I had brought with me from Eng- 
land, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to send the 
refreshments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very few 
days, for she was ready framed; and I gave the master of her such 
instructions as he could not miss the place, nor did he miss them, 
as I had an account from my partner afterwards. I got him soon 
loaded with the small cargo I sent them; and one of our seamen 
that had been on shore with me there offered to go with the sloop 
and settle there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard to allot 
him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation, and giving him 
some clothes, and tools for his planting work, which he said he 
understood, having been an old planter at Maryland, and a bucct- 
neer into the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow, by granting all he desires! ; and as an 
addition, I gave him the savage which we had taken prisoner of 
war to be his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him 
his share of everything he wanted with the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me 
there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his •^

jaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of the Church. " I 
now not what the matter is with him," says he, "hut on my con- 
lience I think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has been obliged 
► conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition; that he would be 
3ry glad of such an opportunity to make his escape with his wife 
id two daughters; and if I would let them go to my island, and 
lot them a plantation, he would give them a small stock to begin 
ith; for the officers of the Inquisition had seized all his effects and 
state, and he had nothing left but a little household stuff, and 
^0 slaves. And," adds he, " though I hate his principles, yet I 
'ould not have him fall into their hands; for he would assuredly 
3 burnt alive, if he does." 

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them, 
nd we concealed the man and his wife and daughters on board 
•ur ship till the sloop put out to go to sea, and then, having put 
.11 their goods on board the sloop some time before, we put them 
>n board the sloop after he was got out of the bay. 

Our seamen were mightily pleased with this new partner; and 
lieir stock, indeed, was much alike, rich in tools, in preparations, 
ind a farm, but nothing to begin with, but as above. However, 
tey carried over with them, which was worth all the rest, some 
materials for planting sugar-canes, with some plants of canes, 
^hich he, I mean the Portugal man, understood very well. 
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in the island, I 
'nt them by their sloop three milch cows and five calves, about 
^enty-two hogs among them, three sows big with pig, two mares,

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged three

478 THE LAST OF THE ISLAND. 

there was a great many. I found letters at London from them all 
by the way of Lisbon, when I came back to England; of which! 
shall also take some notice immediately. 

I have now done with my island, and all manner of discourse 
about it; and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would 
do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read 
of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, much 
less by those of other men, to beware of the like; not cooled by 
almost forty years' misery and disappointments, not satisfied with 
prosperity beyond expectation, not made cautious by auction and 
distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies, than a man at 
full liberty, and having committed no crime, has to go to the 
turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among the 
prisoners there and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from 
England, and went directly to the island; had I loaded her, as I 
did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation 
and for my people, took a patent from the governor here to have 
secured my property, in subjection only to that of England; had 
I carried over cannon and ammunition, servants and people, to 
plant, and, taking possession of the place, fortified and strength- 
ened it in the name of England, and increased it with people, as 
I might easily have done; had I then settled myself there, and 
sent the ship back loaded with good rice, as I might also have 
done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have fitted 
her out again for our supply; had I done this, and stayed there 
myself, I had, at least acted like a man of conmion sensa But 
I was possessed with a wandering spirit, scorned all advantages. 
I pleased myself with being the patron of those people I phiced 
there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic way, 
like an old patriarchal monarch; providing for them as if I had 
been father of the whole family, as well as of the plantation. But 
I never so much as pretended to plant in the name of any govern- 
ment or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call my peopk 
subjects to any one nation more than another j nay, I never so 
much as gave the place a name, but left it as I found it, belonging 
to no man, and the people under no discipline or government but

taj own ; who, though I had influence over them as father and 
benefactor, had no authority or power to act or command one 
wsLj or other, farther than voluntary consent moved them to 
comply. Yet even this, had I stayed there, would have done well 
enough. But as I rambled from them, and came there no more, 
the last letters I had from any of them was by my partner's means, 
who afterwards sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me 
word (though I had not the letter till five years after it was 
written), that they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their 
long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of. the 
Spaniards were come away; and that though they had not been 
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes 
wth them; that they begged of him to write to me, to think of 
the promise I had made, to fetch them away that they might see 
their own country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed ; and they who will 
have any more of me must be content to follow me through a new 
variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the 
justice of Providence may be duly observed, and we may see how 
easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make the 
strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish us most 
severely with those very things which we think it would be our 
utmost happiness to be allowed in. 

Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength of his own 
judgment, as if he was able to choose any particular station of 
life for himself. Man is a short-sighted creature, sees but a 
very little way before him; and as his passions are none of his 
best friends, so his particular affections are generally his worst 
counsellors. 

I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I had from a 
youth to wander into the world, and how evident it now was that 
this principle was preserved in me for my punishment. How it 
came on, the manner, the circumstance, and the conclusion of it, 
it is easy to give you historically, and with its utmost variety of 
particulars. But the secret ends of divine power, in thus per- 
mitting us to be hurried down the stream of our own desires, is 
only to be understood of those who can listen to the voice of Pro-

vidence, and draw religious consequences from God's justice and 
their own mistakes. 

Be it I had business, or no business, away I went. 'Tis no 
time now to enlarge any farther upon the reason or absurdity of 
my own conduct; but to come to the history, I was embarked for 
the voyage, and the voyage I went. 

I should only add here, that my honest and truly pious clergy- 
man left me here. A ship being ready to go to Lisbon, he asked 
me leave to go thither, being still, as he observed, bound never to 
finish any voyage he began. How happy had it been for me if I 
had gone with him I 

But it was too late now. All things Heaven appoints are 
best. Had I gone with him I had never had had so many things 
to be thankful for, and you had never heard of the Second Part 
of the Travels and Adventures of Kobinson Crusoe. So I must 
leave here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on with my 
voyage. 

From the Brazils, we made directly away over the Atlantic Sea, 
to the Cape de Bon Esperance, or, as we call it, the Cape of Good 
Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course generally 
south-east; now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. But 
my disasters at sea were at an end. My future rubs and cross 
events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land 
was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea, when Heaven, 
who directs the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint it to 
be so. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on 
board, who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the 
Cape, only being limited to certain numbers of days for stay, hy 
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. This was 
none of my business, neither did I meddle with it at all, my 
nephew, the captain, and the supercargo adjusting all those things 
between them as they thought fit. 

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was needful to take 
in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast of Cor- 
omandel. We were indeed informed that a French man-of-war 
of fifty guns, and two large merchant-ships, were gone for the

TOUCH AT MADAGASCAR. 481 

Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I had some 
apprehensions of them. But they went their own way, and we 
heard no more of them. 

I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with descriptions 
of places, journals of our voyages, variations of compass, latitudes, 
meridian distances, trade winds, situation of ports, and the like, 
such as almost all the histories of long navigation are full of, and 
makes the reading tiresome enough, and are perfectly unprofitable 
to all that read it, except only to those who are to go to those 
places themselves. 

It is enough to name the ports and places which we touched at, 
and what occurred to us upon our passing from one to another. 
T^e touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, though the 
people are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very well 
amied with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable 
dexterity, yet we fared very well with them a while: they treated 
ns very civilly, and for some trifles which we gave them, such as 
knives, scissors, &c., they brought us eleven good fat bullocks, 
niiddling in size, but very good in flesh; which we took in partly 
for fresh provisions for our present spending, and the rest to salt 
for the ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished 
ourselves with provisions; and I, that was always too curious to 
look into every nook of the world wherever I came, was for going 
on shore as often as I could. It was on the east side of the island 
that we went on shore, one evening; and the people, who, by the 
way, are very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood 
gazing at us at a distance. But as we had traded freely with 
them, and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no 
danger. But when we saw the people, we cut three boughs out 
of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance from us; which, it 
seems, is a mark in the country, not only of truce and friendship, 
hut, when it is accepted, the other side set up three poles or 
boughs, which is a signal that they accept the truce too. But 
then, this a known condition of the truce, that you are not to 
pass beyond their three poles towards them, nor they to come 
past your three poles or boughs towards you; so that you are

perfectly secure within the three poles, and all the space between 
yoUr poles and theirs is allowed, like a market, for free convene, 
traffic, and commerce. When you go there, you must not carry 
your weapons with you ; and if they come into that space, they 
stick up their javelins and lances all at the first poles, and come on 
unarmed; but if any violence is ofiered them, and the truce there- 
by broken, away they run to the poles and lay hold of their 
weapons, and then the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening when we went on shore, that a greater 
number of their people came down than usual; but all was very 
friendly and civil, and they brought in several kinds of provisions, 
for which we satisfied them with such toys as we had. Their 
women also brought us milk and roots, and several things very 
acceptable to us; and all was quiet And we made us a litde 
tent, or hut, of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all night 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well satis- 
fied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat lying at an anchor, 
about a stone-cast from the land, with two men in her to take care 
of her, I made one of them come on shore, and getting some 
boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sail on 
the bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of the branches of 
trees all night in the boat 

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of our men 
make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out for God's sake to 
bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were all like 
to be murdered. At the same time I heard the firing of five 
muskets, which was the number of the guns they had, and that 
three times over; for it seems the natives here were not so easily 
frighted with guns as the savages were in America, where I hid 
to do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter; but rousing 
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be 
thrust in, and resolved, with three fusils,^ we had on board, to land 
and assist our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore. But our men were in too 
much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the

pursued by between three and four hundred mea Our men were 
but nine in all, and only five of them had fusils with them; the 
rest had indeed pistols and swords, but they were of small use to 
them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too, 
three of them being very ill wounded. And that which was still 
worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we

lore with darts and arrows: and having got ready our firearms,

battle array on the shore till break of day; which, we suppose, was 
that they might see the better to take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh oar 
anchor or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the 
boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a 
tree with small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, 
which, though we rode a league off, yet my nephew, the captain, 
hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay 
in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood ns; 
and weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as 
he durst with the ship, and then sent another boat with ten hands 
in her to assist us. But we called to them not to come too near, 
telling them what condition we were in. However, they stood in 
nearer to us; and one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in 
his hand, and keeping our boat between him and the enemy, so 
that they could not perfectly see him, swam on board us, and 
made fast the line to the boat; upon which we slipped our little 
cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach 
of the arrows, we all the while Ijnng close behind the barricadowe 
had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, 
that she could lay her side to the shore, she run along just hy 
them, and we poured in a broadside among them, loaden with 
pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides tbe 
great shot; which made a terrible havoc amongst them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time to 
examine into the occasion of this fray. And, indeed, our super- 
cargo, who had been often in those parts, put me upon it; for, he 
said, he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us after 
we had made a truce, if we had not done something to proToke 
them to it. At length it came out; namely, that an old woman, 
who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it within our 
poles, with a young woman with her, who also brought some 
roots or herbs; and while the old woman, (whether she was mother 
to the young woman or no, they could not tell,) was selling w 
the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to the wench that 
was with her, at which the old woman made a great noise. How-

an outcry among the people she came from, who, upon notice, 
raised this great army upon us in three or four hours; and it was 
great odds but we had been all destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at bim just at 
the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had 
made. The rest came off free, all but the fellow who was the 
occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black 
mistress; for we could not hear what became of him a great while. 
We lay upon the shore two days after, though the wind presented, 
and made signals for him; made our boat sail up shore and down 
shore several leagues, but in vain. So we were obliged to give 
tim over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had been 
the less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on shore 
once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or them. It 
^as the third night after the action, that I had a great mind to 
Jsam, if I could by any means, what mischief we had done, and 
iow the game stood on the Indians' side. I was careful to do it

^ have been sure that the men I went with had been under my 
^mmand before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mis- 
hievous as I was brought into by it without my knowledge or 
esign. 

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship, besides 
le supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours before mid- 
Ight, at the same place where the Indians stood drawn up the 
'^ening before. I landed here because my design, as I have said, 
as chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and if they had 
ft any marks behind them of the mischief we had done them,

marched up one body at a distance from the other to the place; 
but at first could see nothing, it being very dark, till by-and-by, 
our boatswain, that led the first party, stumbled, and fell over a 
dead body. This made them halt a while, for knowing by the 
circumstances that they were at the place where the Indians had 
stood, they waited for my coining up. Here we concluded to halt 
till the moon began to rise, which we knew would be in less than 
an hour, when we could easily discern the havoc we had made 
among them. We told two and thirty bodies upon the ground, 
whereof two were not quite dead. Some had an arm, and some 
a leg shot off, and one his head; those that were wounded, we 
supposed, they had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we 
could come at the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on 
board; but the boatswain and his party sent me word that they 
were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where these 
dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along with 
them ; and if they could find them, as still they fancied they 
should, they did not doubt getting a good booty, and it might he 
they might find Thomas Jeffirys there : that was the man's name 
we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what 
answer to have given them; for I would have commandwi them 
instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to nm, 
who had a ship and ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to 
make, which depended very much upon the lives of the men; hot 
as they sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked 
me and my company to go along with them, I positively reftued 
it, and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in order to go to 
the boat. One or two of the men began to importune me to go» 
and when I refused positively, began to grumble, and say they were 
not under my command, and they would go. "Come, Jwk>

Jack said he would, and another followed, and then another; and 
in a word, they all left me but one, who I persuaded to stay, wa

man, went back to the boat, where we told them we would stay

488 A DESPERATE ADVENTURE. 

and they did not doubt but they would be back again in about an 
hour at farthest ; for the Indian town, they said, was not aboTe 
half a mile off, though they found it above two miles before they 
got to it. 

Well, they all went away as above; and though the attempt 
was desperate, and such as none but mad men would have gone 
about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it warily as 
boldly. They were gallantly armed, that's true; for they had 
every man a fuzee or musket, a bayonet, every man a pistol; some 
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers,^ and the 
boatswain and two more had pole-axes ; besides all which, they 
had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes.^ Bolder fellows, and 
better provided, never went about any wicked work in the world. 

When they went out their chief design was plunder, and they 
were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance 
which none of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge, 
and made devils of them all. When they came to the few Indian 
houses which they thought had been the town, which was not 
above half a mile off, they were under a great disappointment; 
for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses, and where the 
town was, or, how big, they knew not. They consulted, therefore, 
what to d», and were some time before they could resolve; for if 
they fell upon these, they must cut all their throats, and it was 
ten to one but some of them might escape, it being in the night, 
though the moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run away, 
and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army upon 
them. Again, on the other hand, if they went away and left 
those untouched (for the people were all asleep) they could not tell 
which way to look for the town. 

However, the last was the best advice; so they resolved to 
leave them, and look for the town as well as they could They 
went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree. This they

presently concluded would be a good guide to them, for they said 
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or the town 
behind them; and if they untied her they should see which way 
she went : if she went back, they had nothing to say to her, but 
if she went forward, they had nothing to do but to follow her. 
So they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the 
cow went on before theuL In a word, the cow led them directly 
to the town, which, as they report, consisted of above two hundred 
houses or huts, and in some of these they found several families 
living together. 

Here they found all in silence as profoundly secure as sleep and 
a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind could make 
them; and, first, they called another council, to consider what 
they had to do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide them- 
selves into three bodies, and to set three houses on fire in three 
parts of the town, and as the men came out, to seize them and 
bind them (if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do 
then), and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder; but 
^hey resolved to march silently first through the town, and see 
^hat dimensions it was of, and if they might venture upon 
n or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture 
^pon them; but while they were animating one another to the 
^ork, three of them that were a little before the rest called out 
^oud to them, and told them they had found Thomas Jefiiys. 
J?hey all run up to the place, and so it was indeed; for there they 
found the poor fellow hanged up naked by one arm, and his 
throat cut There was an Indian house just by the tree, where 
bhey found sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians who 
had been concerned in the fray with us before, and two or three 
of them wounded with our shot; and our men found they were 
awake, and talking one to another in that house, but knew not 
their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as 
T^efore, that they swore to one another they would be revenged, 
and that not an Indian who came into their hands should have 
quarter; and to work they went immediately, and yet not so

madly as by the rage and fury they were in might be expected. 
Their first care was to get something that would soon take fire, 
but after a little search they found that would be to no purpose; 
but most of the houses were low, and thatched with flags or 
rushes, of which the country is full; so they presently made some 
wildfire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in the palms of 
their hands, and in a quarter of an hour they set the town on 
fire in four or five places, and particularly that house where the 
Indians were not gone to bed. As soon as the fire began to 
blaze, the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save their 
lives, but met with their fate in the attempt, and especially at the 
door where they drove them back, the boatswain himself kiUing 
one or two with his pole-axe. The house being large and many 
in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenado, and 
threw it among them, which at first frightened them, but when 
it burst, made such havoc among them, that they cried out in » 
hideous manner. 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open part of the 
house were killed or hurt with the grenado, except two or three 
more who pressed to the door, which the boatswain and two more 
kept with their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and de- 
spatched all who came that way. But there was another apart- 
ment in the house, where the prince or king, or whatever he was, 
and several others were; and these they kept in till the house, 
which was by this time all of a light flame, fell in upon them, and 
they were smothered or burned together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not 
waken the people faster than they could master them; hut the 
fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were gW 
to keep a little together in bodies, for the fire grew so raging, w 
the houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they could 
hardly bear the street between them, and their business was to 
follow the fire for the surer execution. As fast as the fire either 
forced the people out of those houses which were burning, or 
frightened them out of others, our people were ready at their 
doors to knock them on the head, still calling and hallooing to 
one another to remember Thomas Jeffrys.

FIRE AND SWORD. 491 

While this was doing I must confess I was very uneasy, and 
jgpecially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being night, 
leemed to be just by me. 

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men too, 
leeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the matter 
m, or what danger I was in; especially hearing the guns too, 
'or by this time they began to use their firearms. A thousand

492 SIGHTS OF HORROR. 

as I did before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of 
the voyage, the interest of the owners and merchants, &a, and 
told him I would go and the two men, and only see if we could 
at a distance learn what was like to be the event, and come back 
and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to the 
rest before; he would go, he said, and he only wished he had left 
but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having his men 
lost for want of help; he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and 
his life and all; and away went he. 

In a word, I was no more able to stay behind now than I was 
to persuade them not to go ; so, in short, the captain ordered two 
men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving 
the long-boat at an anchor, and that, when they came back, six 
men should keep the two boats, and six more come after us, so 
that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole ship's 
company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in the 
last quarrel, which brought this mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of the 
groimd we trode on; and being guided by the fire, we kept no 
path, but went directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of 
the guns was surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people 
were now of quite another nature, and filled us with horror. I 
must confess I never was at the sacking a city, or at the taking a 
town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda 
in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and child; and I had read of 
Count Tilly sacking of the city of Magdeburgh, and cutting the 
throats of twenty-two thousand of both sexes. But I never had 
an idea of the thing itself before, nor is it possible to describe it, 
or the horror which was upon our minds at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length came to the town, though 
there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The first 
object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the 
ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just before it, plain 
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three 
women killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the 
heap among the fire. In short, there were such instances of a rage

altogether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what was 
human, that we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of 
it, or if they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to be 
every one of them put to the worst of deatha But this was not 
all: we saw the fire increase forward, and the cry went on just as 
the fire went on; so that we were in the utmost confusion. We 
advanced a little way farther, and behold, to our astonishment, three 
women, naked, and crying in a most dreadful manner, come flying, 
as if they had indeed had wings, and after them sixteen or seven- 
teen men, natives, in the same terror and consternation, with 
three of our English butchers, for I can call them no better, in 
their rear; who, when they could not overtake them, fired in among 
them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight 
Wlen the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that 
^e would murder them as well as those that pursued them, they 
Setup a most dreadful shriek, especially the women; and two of 
them fell down as if already dead with the fright. 

My very soul shrank within me, and my blood ran chill in my 
^eins, when I saw this; and I believe, had the three English 
Sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them 
UL However, we took some ways to let the poor flpng creatures 
cnow that we would not hurt them, and immediately they came 
ip to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted up, made 
)iteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them know 
ve would; whereupon they crept all together in a huddle close 
)ehind us, as for protection. I left my men drawn up together,

backs and thighs from our men pursuing; and another was shot 
through the body, and died while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was; 
but I could not understand one word they said, though bj signs 
I perceived that some of them knew not what was the occasion 
themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageoos 
attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to my own 
men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town through the 
fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an end to it, coet 
what it would. Accordingly, as soon as I came back to mj men 
I told them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me; 
when in the very moment came four of our men, with the boat- 
swain at their head, roving over the heaps of bodies they had 
killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more 
people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud ai 
they could halloo; and with much ado one of them made them 
hear, so that they knew who we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a halloo like a shout 
of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come; and with- 
out bearing to hear me, " Captain," says he, " noble captain, I am 
glad you are come. We have not half done yet, villainous hell- 
hound dogs! I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has hain 
upon his head. We have sworn to spare none of them; well root 
out the very nation of them from the earth." And thus he run on, 
out of breath too with action, and would not give us leave to speak 
a word. 

At last, raising my voice that I might silence him a little, 
"Barbarous dog," said I, "what are you doing? I won't have 
one creature touched more, upon pain of deatL I charge yoo» 
upon your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you 
are a dead man this minute." 

" Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, or what they 
have done ? If you want a reason for what we have done, come 
hither." And with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging 
with his throat cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time should 
have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their

rage too far, and thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and 
Levi, "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, 
for it was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my hands; 
for when the men I carried with me saw the sight, as I had 
done, I had as much to do to restrain them as I should have 
had with the other. Nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, 
and told me in their hearing that he was only concerned for fear 
of the men being overpowered; for as to the people, he thought 
not one of them ought to live, for they had all glutted themselves 
with the murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be used 
like murderers. Upon these words, away ran eight of my men, 
with the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work; 
and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came 
away pensive and sad, for I could not bear the sight, much less 
the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their 
iands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two 
^en; and with these I walked back to the boats. It was a very 
great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were, 
^lone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had 
I'.un over the country, there stood about forty men, armed with 
lances and bows, at the little place where the twelve or thirteen 
louses stood mentioned before. But by accident I missed the 
place, and came directly to the sea-side; and by the time I got to 
the sea-side it was broad day. Immediately I took the pinnace 
and went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in what 
might happen. 

I observed about the time that I came to the boat-side that the 
fire was pretty well out and the noise abated; but in about half 
an hour after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's fire- 
arms, and saw a great smoke. This, as I understood afterwards, 
was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, stood at the few 
houses on the way; of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and 
set all those houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women 
or children. 

By that time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace^ 
our men began to appear. They came dropping in, some and

496 THE CAPTAIN S DEFENCE. 

some; not in two bodies, and in form, as they went, but all in 
heaps, straggling here and there in such a manner that a small 
force of resolute men might have cut them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole country; and the 
men were amazed and surprised, and so frighted, that I believe 
a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but five of 
our mea Nor in all this terrible action was there a man who 
made any considerable defence. They were so surprised between 
the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of our men in the 
dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves: for if 
they fled one way, they were met by one party; if back again, 
by another; so that they were everywhere knocked down. Nor 
did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one, who 
strained his foot; and another had one of his hands very much 
burned. 

I was very angry with my nephew the captain, and indeed 
with all the men, in my mind; but with him in particular, as 
well for his acting so out of his duty as commander of the ship, 
and having the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting 
rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel an 
enterprise. My nephew answered me very respectfully; but told 
me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman, whom they 
had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous manner, he was not 
master of himself, neither could he govern his passion. He 
owned he should not have done so, as he was commander of the 
ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he could not 
bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me 
at all; and they knew it well enough, so they took no notice of 
my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it 
Our men differed in the account of the number they killed: some 
said one thing, some another; but according to the best of their 
accounts put together, they killed or destroyed about one hundred 
and fifty people, men, women, and children, and left not a house 
standing in the town. As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffry8» 
as he was quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head was 
half off, it would do him no service to bring him away. So they

A SAD DISASTER. 497 

left him where they found him; only took him down from the 
tree where he was hanged by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was against them 
in it; and I always after that time told them God would blast the 
voyage, for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to 
be murder in them. For though it is true that they had killed 
Thomas Jeffrys, yet it was as true that Jeffrys was the aggressor, 
had broken the truce, and had violated or debauched a young 
woman of theirs who came down to them innocently, and on the 
faith of their public capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards 
on board. He said, it is true that we seemed to break the truce, 
but really had not, and that the war was begun the night before 
f>y the natives themselves, who had shot us and killed one of 
>Ur men without any just provocation; so that as we were in a 
apacity to fight them now, we might also be in a capacity to do 
ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner: that 
hough the poor man had taken a little liberty with a wench, he 
Ught not to have been murdered, and that in such a villainous 
:ianner; and that they did nothing but what was just, and what 
he laws of God allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough to have warned 
.s against going on shore among heathens and barbarians; but it 
3 impossible to make mankind wise but at their own expense, and 
heir experience seems to be always of most use to them when it

We are now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to

lissed of his business outward bound, he was to go up to China, 
nd return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, where 
ve of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the 
ulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or 
arried away into slavery. The rest of the boat's crew were not

498 THE boatswain's remonstrance. 

this case; but the boatswain very warmly told me he thought I 
went farther in my censures than I could show any warrant for in 
Scripture, and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke, verse fourth, 
where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the tower 
of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans. But that 
which indeed put me to silence in the case was, that not one of 
these five men who were now lost were of the number of those 
who went on shore to the massacre of Madagascar (so I always 
called it, though our men could not bear the word "massacre" 
with any patience). And, indeed, this last circumstance, as I have 
said, put me to silence for the present. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse 
consequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been 
the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told 
me he found that I continually brought that affair upon the stage; 
that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the men very 
ill on that account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a 
passenger, and had no command in the ship or concern in the 
voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they did not bow 
but I might have some ill design in my head, and perhaps to call 
them to account for it when they came to England; and that 
therefore, unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also 
not to concern myself any farther with him or any of Ins affiain, 
he would leave the ship, for he did not think it was safe to sail 
with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told 
him that I did confess I had all along opposed the massacre of 
Madagascar, for such I would always call it: and that I had on 
all occasions spoken my mind freely about it, though not more 
upon him than any of the rest : that as to my having no command 
in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise any authority, only 
took my liberty of speaking my mind in things which publicly 
concerned us all; and what concern I had in the voyage was none 
of his business : that I was a con^derable owner of the ship, wd 
in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak even farther thin 
I had yet done, and would not be accountable to him or any one 
else, and begun to be a little warm with him. He made but

AN INSOLENT MBSSAGE. 499 

little reply to me at that time, and I thought that affair had been 
over. We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being 
willing to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo in 
the ship's boat to divert myself, and towards evening was pre- 
paring to go on board, when one of the men came to me, and told 
me he would not have me trouble myself to come down to the 
boat, for they had orders not to carry me on board any more! 
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a mes- 
sage; and I asked the man who bade him deliver that errand to 
me. He told me, the cockswain. I said no more to the fellow, 
but bade him let them know he had delivered his message, and 
that I had given him no answer to it 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told him 
the story; adding what I presently foresaw, namely, that there 
>^ould certainly be a mutiny in the ship, and entreated him to go 
immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint 
the captain of it But I might have spared this intelligence, for 
before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on 
board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and, in a word, 
^ the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came 
Up to the quarter-deck and desired to speak with the captain; and 
bhere the boatswain, making a long harangue, for the fellow 
balked very well, and repeating all he had said to me, told the 
Baptain, in few words, that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, 
fchey were loath to use any violence with me; which, if I had not 
gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to 
have gone: they therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they 
shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his command, they 
would perform it well and faithfully; but if I would not quit the 
ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the 
ship, and sail no farther with him. And at that word " all " he 
turned his face about towards the mainmast, which was, it seems, 
the signal agreed on between them; at which, all the seamen 
being got together, they cried out, "One and all! one and all!" 

My nephew the captain was a man of spirit, and of great 
presence of mind; and though he was surprised, you may be sure, 
at the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would consider of

the thing, but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken 
to me about it. He used some arguments with them to show 
them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing: but it was 
all in vain ; they swore and shook hands round before his face 
that they would go all on shore, unless he would engage to them 
not to suffer me to come any more on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to 
me, and did not know how I might take it. So he began to talk 
cavalierly to them; told them that I was a very considerable 
owner of the ship, and that in justice he could not put me out of 
my own house; that this was next door to serving me as the 
famous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny in a ship, set 
the captain on shore in an uninhabited island, and run away with 
the ship; that let them go into what ship they would, if ever they 
came to England again, it would cost them dear; that the ship 
was mine, and that he could not put me out of it; and that he 
would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than disoblige me 
so much; so they might do as they pleased: however, he would 
go on shore and talk with me on shore; and invited the boatswain 
to go with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the matter 
with me. 

But they all rejected the proposal, and said they would have 
nothing to do with me any more, neither on board nor on shore, 
and if I came on board they would all go on shore. " Well," said 
the captain, " if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore, and 
talk with him." So away he came to me with this account, a 
little after the message had been brought to me from the cock- 
swain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for I was 
not without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, 
set sail, aiid run away with the ship, and then I had been stripped 
naked in a remote country, and nothing to help myself; in short, 
I had been in a worse case than when I was all alone in the 
island. 

But they had not come that length, it seems, to my great satis- 
faction; and when my nephew told me what they had said to him. 
and how they had sworn, and shook hands, that they would one

and all leave the ship if I was suffered to come on board, I told 
liiin he should not be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on 
shore. I only desired he would take care and send me all my 
necessary things on shore, and leave me a suflBcient sum of money, 
and I would find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but there was 
no way to help it, but to comply with it; so, in short, he went on 
board the ship again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had 
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his goods from on 
board the ship; so that matter was over in a very few hours, the 
Jnen returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course 
I should steer. 

I was now alone in the remotest part of the world, as I think I 
Qiay call it; for I was near three thousand leagues by sea farther 
off from England than I was at my island. Only, it is true, I 
Daight travel here by land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat; 
ttiight go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia; 
itid from thence might take the way of the caravans over the 
iesert of Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by sea 
^gain to Italy, and so over land into France : and this put together 
tdght be at least a full diameter of the globe, but if it were to be 
Xieasured, I suppose it would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some 
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the 
sland of Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England; 
mi as I came hither without any concern with the English East 
[ndia Company, so it would be difficult to go from hence without 
heir licence, unless with great favour of the captains of the ships, 
)r of the Company's factors, and to both I was an utter stranger. 
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by contraries, to 
lee the ship sail without me ; a treatment, I think, a man in my 
drcumstances scarce ever met with, except from pirates running 
iway with a ship, and setting those that would not agree with 
iheir villainy on shore. Indeed this was next door to it both ways. 
Bowever, my nephew left me two servants, or rather, one com- 
panion and one servant; the first was clerk to the purser, who 
he engaged to go with me, and the other was his own servant. I

took me also a good lodging in the house of an EngliBhwomao, 
where several merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, or 
rather Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough 
entertained; and that I might not be said to run rashly upon aoj- 
thing, I stayed here above nine months, considering what course 
to take, and how to manage myself. I had some English goods 
with me of value, and a considerable sum of money, my nephew 
furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of 
credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened, 
whatever might happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage too; and, tf 
I originally intended, I bought here some very good diamonds; 
which, of all other things, was the most proper for me in my 
present circumstances, because I might always carry my whole 
estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my return 
to England, but none falling out to my mind, the English 
merchant who lodged with me, and with whom I had contracted 
an intimate acquaintance, came to me one morning. "Country- 
man," says he, " I have a project to conmiunicate to you, which, 
as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with 
yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it 

" Here we are posted," says he, " you by accident, and I by my 
own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own 
country; but it is in a country where, by us who imderstand trade 
and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you will po* 
a thousand pound to my thousand pound, we will hire a ship here, 
the first we can get to our minds; you shall be captain, 111 he 
merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to China; for whit 
should we stand still for? The whole world is in motion, rolling 
round and round; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and 
earthly, are busy and diligent; why should we be idlel There 
are no drones in the world but men; why should we be of that 
number?" 

I liked his proposal very well, and the more because it seemed 
to be expressed with so much goodwill and in so friendly a m»nD» 
I will not say but that I might by my loose and onhingecl cir*

ANOTHER VOYAGE. 50S 

cumstances be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or, indeed, 
for anything else; whereas, otherwise, trade was none of my 
element. However, I might perhaps say with some truth, that if 
trade was not my element, rambling was, and no proposal for 
seeing any part of the world which I had never seen before could 
possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to our 
s; and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get 
sailors; that is to say, so many as were necessary to 
jovem the voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick 
ip there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a 
[unner, English, a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese fore- 
lastmen. With these we found we could do well enough, having 
adian seamen, such as they are, to make up. 

There are so many travellers who have wrote the history of their 
Dyages and travels this way, that it would be very little diversion 
) anybody to give, a long account of the places we went to, and 
le people who inhabit there. Those things I leave to others, and 
fer the reader to those journals and travels of Englishmen, of 
hich many I find are published, and more promised every day. 
'is enough to me to tell you that I made this voyage to Achin, 

the island of Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we ex- 
langed some of our wares for opium, and some arrack; the first 
commodity which bears a great price among the Chinese, and 
hich at that time was very much wanted there. In a word, we 
ent up to Suskan, made a very great voyage, was eight months 
it, and returned to Bengal; and I was very well satisfied with my 
Iventure. I observed that our people in England often admire 
)w the officers which the Company send into India, and the 
erchants which generally stay there, get such very great estates 
\ they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty, seventy, to 
le hundred thousand pound at a time. 

But it is no wonder, or at least we shall see so much farther 
ito it, when we consider the innumerable ports and places where 
ley have a free commerce, that it will then be no wonder; and 
luch less will it be so, when we consider that at all those places 
id ports where the English ships come, there is so much, and such

constant demand for the growth of all other countries, that there 
is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market abroad, for 
the goods carried out 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much 
money by the first adventure, and such an insight into the method 
of getting more, that had I been twenty year younger, I should 
have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no farther for 
making my fortune. But what was all this to a man on the 
wrong side of threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad 
more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world, than a 
covetous desire of getting in it; and indeed I think 'tis with great 
justice that I now call it a restless desire, for it was so. When 
I was at home, I was restless to go abroad; and now I was abroad, 
I was restless to be at home. I say, what was this gain to met 
I was rich enough, nor had I any imeasy desires about getting 
more money, and therefore the profits of the voyage to me were 
things of no great force for the prompting me forward to farther 
undertakings; and I thought that by this voyage I had made no 
progress at all, because I was come back, as I might call it, to the 
place from whence I came, as to a home; whereas my eye, which, 
like that which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing, 
was still more desirous of wandering and seeing. I was come into 
a part of the world which I was never in before, and that part in 
particular which I had heard much of, and was resolved to see as 
much of as I could, and then I thought I might say I had seen all 
the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had difierent notions. I do not 
name this to insist upon my own; for I acknowledge his were the 
most just, and the most suited to the end of a merchant's life, 
who, when he is abroad upon adventures, 'tis his wisdom to stick 
to that as the best thing for him which he is like to get the most 
money by. My new friend kept himself to the nature of the 
. thing, and would have been content to have gone like a carrier's 
horse always to the same inn, backward and forward, provided he 
could, as he called it, find his account in it. On the other hand, 
mine was the notion of a mad rambling boy, that never cares to 
see a thing twice over.

A SUCCESSFUL VOYAGE. 505 

£ut this was not all: I had a kind of impatience upon me to 
h nearer home, and yet the most imsettled resolution imaginable 
viuch way to go. In the interval of these consultations my friend, 
who was always upon the search for business, proposed another 
voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a load- 
ing of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places where 
indeed the Dutch do trade, but islands belonging partly to the 
Spaniards; though we went not so far, but to some other, where 
they have not the whole power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, 
&c. We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief 
difficulty was in bringing me to come into it. However, at last, 
aothing else oflFering, and finding that really stirring about and 
trading, the profit being so great, and, as I may say, certain, had 
more pleasure in it, and more satisfaction to the mind than sitting 
still, which, to me especially, was the unhappiest part of life; I 
resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully, 
touching at Borneo and several islands, whose names I do not 
remember, and came home in about five months. We sold our 
spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs to the Persian 
merchants, who carried them away for the Gulf; and making near 
five of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me. 
"Well now," said he, with a sort of agreeable insulting my indolent 
temper, **is not this better than walking about here, like a man 
di nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense 
and ignorance of the pagans ?" " Why, truly," says I, " my friend, 
[ think it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of 
oaerchandizing; but I must tell you," said I, " by the way, you do 
aot know what I am a -doing; for if once I conquer my back- 
wrardness, and embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you 
lip and down the world till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so 
eagerly, I shall never let you lie stilL" 

But to be short with my speculations, a little while after this 
here came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a coaster, not 
in European trader, and of about two hundred ton burden; the 
nen, as they pretended, having been so sickly that the captain had 
lot men enough to go to sea with. He lay by at Bengal, and

having, it seems, got money enough, or being willing, for other 
reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice that he would sdl 
his ship. This came to my ears before my new partner heard of 
it, and I had a great mind to buy it; so I goes home to him, and 
told him of it. He considered a while; for he was no rash man 
neither; but musing some time, he replied, "She is a Uttletoo 
big; but, however, we will have her." Accordingly we bought 
the ship, and agreeing with the master, we paid for her and took 
possession. When we had done so, we resolved to entertain the 
men, if we could, to join them with those we had, for the pursuing 
our business; but on a sudden, they having received not their 
wages, but their share of the money, not one of them was to he 
found. We inquired much about them, and at length were told 
that they were all gone together by land to Agra, the great city of 
the Mogul*s residence, and from thence were to travel to Surat, 
and so by sea' to the Gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as that I 
missed the opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I 
thought, and in such company as would both have guarded me 
and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my great design; 
and I should both have seen the world and gone homewards toa 
But I was much better satisfied a few days after, when I came to 
know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their history 
was, that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not 
the commander; that they had been a trading voyage, in which 
they were attacked on shore by some of the Malayans, who had 
killed the captain and three of his men; and that after the captain 
was killed, these men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away 
with the ship, which they did, and brought her in at the Bay of 
Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on shore, of whom 
we shall hear farther. 

Well, let them come by the ship how they would, we cam« 
honestly by her, as we thought; though we did not, I confess, 
examine into things so exactly as we ought, for we never inquired 
anything of the seamen; who, if we had examined, would certainly 
have faltered in their account, contradicted one another, and ptf- 
haps contradicted themselves; or, one how or other we should have

seen reason to have suspected them. But the man showed us a 
bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some 
such name (for I suppose it was all a forgery), and called himself 
by that name, and we could not contradict him; and being withal 
a little too unwary, or, at least, having no suspicion of the thing, 
we went through with our bargain. 

We picked up some more English seamen here after this, and 
some Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the 
south-east, for cloves, &c.; that is to say, among the Philippine 
and Molucca Isles. And, in short, not to fill this part of my story 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remarkable, I spent 
from first to last six years in this country, trading from port to 
port, backward and forward, and with very good success, and was 
now the last year with my new partner, going in the ship above- 
mentioned on a voyage to China, but designing first to Siam to 
buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and 
down a great while in the Straits of Malacca and among the 
islands, we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas but we 
found our ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able by all our 
industry to find it out where it was. This forced us to make for 
some port, and my partner, who knew the country better than I 
did, directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for I 
had made the English mate, one Mr. Thomson, captain, not being 
willing to take the charge of the ship upon myself. This river 
has on the north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to 
Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on shore for refreshment, 
there comes to me one day an Englishman, and he was, it seems, 
a gunner's mate on board an EngUsh East India ship which rode 
ia the same river, up at, or near the city of Cambodia. What 
brought him hither we know not, but he comes up to me, and 
speaking English, " Sir," says he, " you are a stranger to me, and 
I to you, but I have something to tell you that very nearly con- 
cerns you." 

I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at first I 
had known him, but I did not. " If it very nearly concerns me,"

said I, "and not yourself, what moves you to tell it mel" "lam 
moved," says he, " by the imminent danger you are in, and, for 
aught I see, you have no knowledge of it" "I know no danger 
I am in," said I, " but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it 
out; but I purpose to lay her a-ground to-morrow to see if I can 
find it." "But, sir," says he, "leaky or not leaky, find it or not 
find it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, 
when you hear what I have to say to you. Do, you know, sir," 
said he, " the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this 
river, and there are two large English ships about five leagues on 
this side, and three Dutch? " " Well," said I, " and what is that 
to me?" " Why, sir," siEud he, " is it for a man that is upon such 
adventures as you are upon, to come into a port and not examine 
first what ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal 
with them? I suppose you don't think you are a match for theml" 
I was amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it^ 
for I could not conceive what he meant, and I turned short upon 
him, and said, " Sir, I wish you would explain yourself. I cannot 
imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any company of ships 
or Dutch ships. I am no interloper; what can they have to say 
tome?" 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleased, and pausing » 
while, but smiling, " Well, sir," says he, " if you think yourseK 
secure, you must take your chance. I am sorry your fate should 
blind you against good advice. But assure yourself, if you do not 
put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked 
by five longboats full of men; and perhaps, if you are taken, 
you'll be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined 
afterwards. I thought, sir," added he, " I should have met with 
a better reception than this for doing you a piece of service 
of such importance." " I can never be ungrateful," said U 
" for any service, or to any man that oflFers me any kindness; 
but it is past my comprehension," said I, "what they should 
have such a design upon me for. However, since you say thei« 
is no time to be lost, and that there is some villainous design 
in hand against me, I'll go on board this minute and put to sea 
immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim

Brithout stopping it But, sir," said I, " shall I go away ignorant 
3f the reason of all this? Can you give me no farther light 
into it r' 

" I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he, " but I have 
a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I could persuade him 
to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for it But the short 
of the story is this, the first part of which, I suppose, you know 
well enough; namely, that you was with this ship at Sumatra, 
that there your captain was murdered by the Malayans with three 
of his men, and that you, or some of those who were on board 
with you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned pirates. 
This is the sum of the story; and you will be all seized as pirates, 
I can assure you, and executed with very little ceremony; for 
you know, merchant ships show but little law to pirates if they 
get them into their power." 

"Now you speak plain English," said I, "and I thank you; 
and though I know nothing that we have done like what you talk 
0^, but am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship, yet, see- 
'Og such work is a-doing as you say, and that you seem to mean 
honestly, I'll be upon my guard." " Nay, sir," says he, " do not 
^Ik of being upon your guard; the best defence is to be out of 
he danger. If you have any regard to your life, and the life of 
U your men, put out to sea without fail at high-water; and as 
ou have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too far out 
Bfore they can come down; for they come away at high-water, 
ad as they have twenty miles to come, you get near two hours 
P them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of 
le way. Besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they 
ill not venture to follow you far out to sea, especially if it 
lows." 

" Well," says I, " you have been very kind in this; what shall 
do for you to make you amends?" "Sir," says he, "you may 
3t be so willing to make me any amends, because you may not

US we will go along with you; if you find no more in it, we vill 
desire no more; but if we do convince you that we have sared 
your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we 
will leave the rest to you." 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and 
the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, my 
partner, who was on board, came out on the quarter-deck, and 
called to me with a great deal of joy, "O ho! O ho! we have 
stopped the leak! we have stopped the leak!" "Say you bo," 
said I; "thank God! but weigh the anchor then immediately." 
"Weigh!" says he, "what do you mean by thati What is the 
matter?" says he. "Ask no questions," says I, "but all hands 
to work, and weigh without losing a minute." He was surprised; 
but, however, he called the captain, and he immediately ordered 
the anchor to be got up. And though the tide was not quite 
done, yet a little land breeze blowing, we stood out to sea Then 
I called him into the cabin and told him the story at large, and 
we called in the men and they told us the rest of it. But as it 
took us up a great deal of time, so before we had done, a seaman 
comes to the cabin door, and calls out to us that the captain bade 
him tell us we were chased. " Chased," says I, " by whom, and 
by what?" "By five sloops or boats," says the fellow, "full of 
men." " Very well," said I, " then it is apparent there is some- 
thing in it" In the next place I ordered all our men to be called 
up, and told them that there was a design to seize the ship, and 
to take us for pirates; and asked them if they would stand by us 
and by one another? The men answered cheerfully, that one 
and all they would live and die with us. Then I asked the 
captain what way he thought best for us to manage a fight with 
them, for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the 
last drop. He said readily that the way was to keep them off 
with our great shot as long as we could, and then to fire at them 
with our small arms as long as we could; but when neither of 
these would do any longer, we should retire to our close quarters; 
perhaps they had not materials to break open our bulkheads, or 
get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the meantime, order to bring two guns to

Mrhile we kept out to sea with wind enough, and could see the

English, out-sailed the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them,

and gained upon us considerably, so that we found they would 
come up with us. Upon which we fired gun without ball, to 
intimate that they should bring-to, and we put out a flag of truce 
as a signal for parley. But they kept crowding after us till they 
came within shot, when we took in our white flag, they having 
made no answer to it, hung out a red flag, and fired at them with 
a shot Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were near 
enough to call to them with a speaking-trumpet which we had 
on board; so we called to them, and bid them keep oflf at their 
peril 

It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come 
under our stem, so to board us on our quarter; upon which, 
seeing they were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the 
strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that 
they lay upon our broadside, when immediately we fired five guns 
at them; one of which had been levelled so true as to carry away 
the stem of the hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessity 
of taking down their sail, and running all to the head of the boat 
to keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; 
but seeing the foremost boat crowd on after us, we made ready to 
fire at her in particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three boats that was behind, 
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which 
we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could afterwards see her 
take out the men. We called again to the foremost boat, and 
offered a tmce to parley again, and to know what was her business 
with us; but had no answer, only she crowded close under our 
stem. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, 
run out his two chase-guns, and fired again at her; but the shot 
missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their caps, and came 
on. But the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired among 
them the second time; one shot of which, though it missed the 
boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and, we could easily see, 
had done a great deal of mischief among them; but we, taking no 
notice of that, wared* the ship again, and brought our quarter to

THE CHASE ABANDONED. 513 

hm upon them, and firing three guns more, we found the boat 
Fas spKt ahnost to pieces; in particular, her rudder and a piece of 
ier stem was shot quite away; so they handed their sail immedi- 
ately, and were in great disorder. But, to complete their misfor- 
tune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again. Where he hit 
them we could not tell, but we found the boat was sinking, and 
some of the men already in the water. Upon this I immediately 
manned out our pinnace, which we had kept close by our side, with 
orders to pick up some of the men if they could, and save them 
from drowning, and immediately to come on board with them, be- 
cause we saw the rest of the boats began to come up. Our men 
in the pinnace followed their orders, and took up three men, one 
of which was just drowning, and it was a good while before we 
could recover him. As soon as they were on board we crowded 
all the sail we could make and stood farther out to sea, and we 
found that when the other three boats came up to the first two 
they gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I knew not 
tile reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended, 
I took care that we would change our course, and not let any one 
imagine whither we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward, 
^uite out of the course of all European ships, whether they were 
tound to China or anywhere else within the commerce of the 
Huropean nations. 

When we were now at sea we began to consult with the two 
seamen, and inquire, first, what the meaning of all this should be; 
and the Dutchman let us into the secret of it at once, telling us 
that the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more 
than a thief, that had run away with her. Then he told us how 
the captain, whose name too he told us, though I do not remember, 
was treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of Malacca, 
with three of his men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four 
more, got into the woods, where they wandered about a great 
while; till at length he, in particular, in a miraculous manner 
made his escape, and swam oflf to a Dutch ship, which, sailing near 
the shore, in its way from China, had sent their boat on shore for 
fresh water; that he durst not come to that part of the shore

514 A GREAT HAZARD. 

where the boat was, but made shift in the night, to take the waier^ 
farther off, and the ship's boat took him up. 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the sea- 
men belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their 
travels, and gave an account that the fellow who had run away 
with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which were 
gone a-oruising in her, and that they had already taken an English 
ship and two Dutch ships very richly laden. 

This later part we found to concern us directly, and though we 
knew it to be false, yet, as my partner said very well, if we had 
fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepossession 
against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended 
ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their hands; and 
especially considering that our accusers had been our judges, and 
that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage 
would have dictated and an ungovemed passion have executed. 
And, therefore, it was his opinion we should go directly back to 
Bengal, from whence we came, without putting in at any port 
whatever; because there we could give a good account of ourselves, 
could prove where we were when the ship put in, who we bought 
her of, and the like ; and, which was more than all the rest, if we 
were put to the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, 
we should be sure to have some justice, and not be hanged first 
and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion, but, after a little more 
serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great haari 
for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the 
wrong side of the Straits of Malacca; and that, if the alarm was 
given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every side, as well by 
the Dutch of Batavia as the English elsewhere : that if we should 
be taken, as it were running away, we should even condemn our- 
selves, and there would want no more evidence to destroy us. I 
also asked the English sailor^s opinion, who said he was of my 
mind, and that we should certainly be taken. 

This danger a little startled my partner and all the ship's com-

UNEASY THOUGHTS. 615 

pany, and we immediately resolved to go away to the coast of 
Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China, and pursuing the first 
design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship, 
and come back in some of the vessels of the country, such as we 
could get This was approved of as the best method for our 
security; and accordingly we steered away north-north-east, keep- 
ing above fifty leagues off from the usual course to the eastward. 

This, however, put us to some inconveniences; for first the 
winds, when we came to the distance from the shore, seemed to be 
more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from 
the east and east-north-east, so that we were a long while upon 
our voyage, and we were but ill provided with victuals for so long 
a voyage; and, which was still worse, there was some danger that 
those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, whereof 
some were bound that way, might be got in before us; and if not, 
some other ship bound to China might have information of us from 
them, and pursue us with the same vigour. 

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, in- 
eluding the late escape from the longboats, to have been in the 
most dangerous condition that ever I was in through all my past 
hfe;. for whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was never 
pursued for a thief before, nor had I ever done anything that 
merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less thievish. 
I had chiefly been my own enemy; or, as I may rightly say, I 
had been nobody's enemy but my own. But now I was embar- 
rassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though I was per- 
fectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that innocence 
appear. And if I had been taken, it had been under a supposed 
guilt of the worst kind ; at least, a crime esteemed so among the 
people I had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an escape, though which 
way to do it I knew not, or what port or place we should go to. 
My partner seeing me thus dejected, though he was the most con- 
cerned at first, began to encourage me; and describing to me the 
several ports of that coast, told me he would put in on the coast 
of Cochin China or the Bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterwards 
to Macao, a town once in the possession of the Portuguese, and

516 A HAPPY STEP. 

where still a great many European families resided, and particularly 
the missionary priests usually went thither, in order to their going 
forward to China. 

Hither, then, we resolved to go; and accordingly, though after 
a tedious and irregular course, and very much straitened for pro- 
visions, we came within sight of the coast very early in the mor- 
ning. And upon reflection upon the past circumstances we were in 
and the danger if we had not escaped, we resolved to put into a 
small river, which, however, had a depth enough of water for us, 
and to see if we could, either over land or by the ship's pinnace, 
come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts. This 
happy step was indeed our deliverance; for though we did not 
immediately see any European ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet 
the next morning there came into the bay two Dutch ships, and 
a third without any colours spread out, but which we believed to 
be a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues' distance, steering 
for the coast of China; and in the afternoon went by two English 
ships steering the same course; and thus we thought we saw 
ourselves beset with enemies both one way or other. The place 
we were in was wild and barbarous, the people thieves, even by 
occupation or profession; and though it is true we had not much 
to seek of them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not 
how little we had to do with them, yet it was with much diffi- 
culty that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them several 
ways. 

We were in a small river of this country, within a few leagnes 
of its utmost limits northward, and by our boat we coasted north- 
east to the point of land which opens the great Bay of Tonquin; 
and it was in this beating up along the shore that we discovered, 
as above, that, in a word, we were surrounded with enemies. The 
people we were among were the most barbarous of all the inhabi- 
tants of the coast; having no correspondence with any other 
nation, and dealing only in fish, and oil, and such gross commo- 
dities. And it may be particularly seen that they are, as I said, 
the most barbarous of any of the inhabitants, namely, that, among 
other customs they have this as one, namely, that if any vessel

A MISTAKEN SUPPOSITION. 517 

make the men all prisoners or slaves; and it was not long 
before we found a spice of their kindness this way, on the occasion 
following. 

I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea, and 
that we could not find it out; and, however it happened, that, as 
I have said, it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy minute of 
our being to be seized by the Dutch and English ships in the Bay 
of Siam; yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly fit and sound 
as we desired, we resolved, while we were in this place, to lay her 
on shore, take out what heavy things we had on board, which 
were not many, and to wash and clean her bottom, and, if pos- 
sible, to find out where the leaks wera 

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all our 
guns and other movable things to one side, we tried to bring her 
<iown, that we might come at her bottom; but, on second thoughts, 
^e did not care to lay her dry on ground, neither could we find 
out a proper place for it 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a 
ight, came wondering down to the shore to look at us; and seeing 
he ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling in 
Awards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on 
er bottom with stages, and with their boats on the oflf side, they 
resently concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay so fast 
1 the ground. 

On this supposition they came all about us in two or three 
3urs' time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them 
ght, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come 
1 board and plundered the ship, and if they had found us there, 
> have carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever they 
ill him, for we knew nothing who was their governor. 
When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, 
ley discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's 
ottom and side; washing, and graving,^ and stopping, as every 
3a-faring man knows how. 
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little

Burprised, could not imagine what their design was; but, king 
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into 
the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to those 
that were at work, to defend themselves with if there should be 
occasion. And it was no more than need; for in less than a 
quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the 
ship was really a wreck, that we were all at work endeavouring to 
save her, or to save our Hves by the help of our boats; and when 
we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by that 
motion, that we were endeavouring to save some of our goo(l& 
Upon this they took it for granted we all belonged to them, and 
away they came down upon our men, as if it had been in a line 
of battle. 

Our men seeing so many of them, began to be frighted, for we 
lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what 
they should do. I immediately called to the men who worked 
upon the stages to slip them down and get up the side into the 
ship, and bade those in the boat to row round and come on board; 
and those few of us who were on board worked with all the 
strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights. But^ how- 
ever, neither the men upon the stages nor those in the boats coold 
do as they were ordered, before the Cochinchinese were upon 
them; and two of their boats boarded our longboat, and began to 
lay hold of the men as their prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman; a stout, 
strong fellow, who, having a musket in his hand, never offered to 
fire it, but laid it down in the boat, Hke a fool as I thought But 
he understood his business better than I could teach him; for he 
grappled the pagan, and dragged him by main force out of their 
own boat into ours, where, taking him by the two ears, he beat 
his head so against the boat's gunwale, that the fellow died in- 
stantly in his hands. And in the meantime, a Dutchman who 
stood next took up the musket, and with the butt end of it w 
laid about him, that he knocked down five of them who attempted 
to enter the boat But this was doing little towards resisting 
thirty or forty men, who, fearless, because ignorant of their danger, 
began to throw themselves into the longboat, where we had but

attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with 
which he supplied the men that were at work with that hot staff 
Two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this fellow 
stood, being in the fore-sheets; he inmiediately saluted them with 
a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so burned and scalded 
them, being half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and 
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter 
saw it, and cried out, "Well done. Jack! give them some more of 
it;" and stepping forward himself, takes one of their mops, and dip- 
ping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them so 
plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in three boats, there was 
not one that was not scalded and burned with it in a most fright- 
ful, pitiful manner, and made such a howling and crying that I 
never heard a worse noise, and indeed nothing like it: for it is 
worth observing that though pain naturally makes all people cry 
out, yet every nation has a particular way of exclamation, and 
make noises as different from one another as their speecL I 
cannot give the noise these creatures made a better name than 
howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it; for I never 
heard anything more like the noise of the wolves, which, as 1 have 
said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc 

I was never pleased with a victory better in my Hfe; not only 
as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was imminent 
before, but as we got this victory without any bloodshed, except of 
that man the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which 1 was 
very much concerned at; for I was sick of killing such poor savage 
wretches, even though it was in my own defence, knowing they 
came on errands which they thought just, and knew no better. 
And that though it may be a just thing, because necessary, for 
there is no necessary wickedness in nature, yet I thought it was 
a sad life, in which we must be always obliged to be killing our 
fellow-creatures to preserve our own; and indeed I think so still, 
and I would even now suffer a great deal, rather than I would 
take away the life even of that person injuring me. And I 
believe all considering people, who know the value of hfe, would 
be of my opinion; at least they would, if they entered seriously

AT SEA AGAIN. 521 

But to return to my story. All the while this was doing, my 
partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board, had with 
great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights ; and having gotten 
the guns into their places again, the gunner called to me to bid 
our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among them. I 
called back again to himj and bid him not offer to fire, for the 
carpenter would do the work without him, but bade him heat 
another pitch-kettle; which our cook, who was on board, took care 
of. But the enemy were so terrified with what they had met with 
in their first attack, that they would not come on again. And 
some of them that were farthest off, seeing the ship swim as it were 
upright, began, as we supposed, to see their mistake, and give over 
the enterprise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got 
clear of this merry fight; and having gotten some rice, and some 
roots, and bread, with about sixteen good big hogs, on board two 
days before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward, 
whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be 
surrounded the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than 
our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. 

We therefore got all our things on board the same evening, and 
the next morning were ready to sail. In the meantime, lying at 
an anchor at some distance, we were not so much concerned, 
being now in a fighting posture as well as in a sailing posture, if 
any enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our work 
within board, and finding our ship was perfectly healed of aU her 
leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into the Bay of Tonquin, 
for we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known con- 
cerning the Dutch ships that had been there; but we durst not 
stand in there, because we had seen several ships go in, as we sup- 
posed, but a little before; so we kept on north-east, towards the 
Isle of Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or 
English merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship in 
the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man-of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept out north-east, as if 
we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine Islands; and this 
we did that we might not fall into the way of any of our European 
ships; and then We steered north till we came to the latitude

of 22 degrees, 30 minutes, by which means we made the island 
Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get water 
and fresh provisions; which the people there, who are yery cour- 
teous and civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly, and 
dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their agreements and 
bargains; which is what we did not find among other people, and 
may be owing to the remains of Christianity, which was once 
planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testi- 
mony of what I have often observed, namely, that the Christian 
religion always civilizes the people, and reforms their manneis, 
where it is received, whether it works saving effects upon them 
or no. 

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at 
an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports of 
China where our European ships usually come, being resolved if 
possible not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this 
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could not fail of 
being entirely ruined; nay, so great was my fear in particular as 
to my being taken by them, that I believe firmly I would much 
rather have chosen to fall into the hands of the Spanish Inquisi- 
tion. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved to 
put into the first trading port we should come at; and standing 
in for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, with an old 
Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowing us to be a European 
ship, came to offer his service, which indeed we were very glad 
of, and took him on board; upon which, without asking m 
whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent 
them back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old 
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk with him 
about carrying us to the Gulf of Nanquin,^ which is the most 
northern part of the coast of China. The old man said he knew 
the Gulf of Nanquin very well; but smiling, asked us what we 
would do there. 

I told him we would sell our cargo and purchase China warefii

caKcoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c., and so would return by 
the same course we cama He told us our best port had been to 
have put in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a market 
for our opium to our satisfaction, and might for our money have 
purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as we could at 
Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he 
vas very opinionated or conceited^ I told him we were gentlemen 
as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and see the 
great city of Pecking,^ and the famous court of the monarch of 
CJiina. "Why, then," says the old man, "you should go to 
Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you 
may go up within five leagues of the Great CanaL" This canal is 
a navigable river, which goes through the heart of that vast empire 
>f China, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable hills by 
he help of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pecking; 
'eing in length near two hundred and seventy leagues. 

" Well," said I, " Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our busi- 
ess now. The great question is, if you can carry us up to the 
Lty of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Pecking afterwards." 
Yes," he said, " he could do so very well, and that there was a 
reat Dutch ship gone up that way just before." This gave me 
little shock; and a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we had 
luch rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in too 
rightful a figure; and we depended upon it that a Dutch ship 
rould be our destruction, for we were in no condition to fight 
hem; all the ships they trade with into those parts being of great 
urden and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under some con- 
ern when he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, "Sir, you 
leed be under no apprehensions of the Dutch, I suppose they are 
lot now at war with your nation." " No," says I, " that's true; 
)ut I know not what liberties men may take when they are out 
)f the reach of the law." " Why," says he, " you are no pirates, 
ivhat need you fear? They will not meddle with peaceable 
nerchants, sure."

624 THE PILOT'S STORY. 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face 
at that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed 
by Nature to prevent it; for it put me into the greatest disorder 
and confusion imaginable. Nor was it possible for me to conceal 
it so, but that the old man easily perceived it 

" Sir," says he, "I find you are in some disorder in your 
thoughts at my talk ; pray be pleased to go which way you think 
fit, and depend upon it Til do you all the service I caa" "Why, 
seignior," said I, " it is true I. am a little unsettled in my resolu- 
tion at this time whither to go in particular; and I am something 
more so for what you said about pirates. I hope there are no 
pirates in these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet with 
them, for you see we have but a small force, and but very weakly 
manned." 

*'*0 sir," says he, "do not be concerned; I do not know that 
there has been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, except 
one which was seen, as I hear, in the Bay of Siam about a month 
since; but you may be assured she is gone to the southward Nor 
was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the work She was 
not built for a privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate 
crew that were on board, after the captain and some of his men 
had been murdered by the Malayans at or near the island of 
Sumatra." 

" What!" said I, seeming to know nothing of the matter, "did 
they murder the captain?" " No," said he; "I do not understand 
that they murdered him; but as they afterwards run away with 
the ship, it is generally believed they betrayed him into the bands 
of the Malayans, who did murder him, and perhaps they procured 
them to do it" " Why then," said I, " they deserve death as 
much as if they had done it themselvea" " Yea," says the old 
man, " they do deserve it, and they will certainly have it, if they 
light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed 
together that if they meet that rogue they will give him no 
quarter." 

" But," said I to him, " you say the pirate is gone out of those 
seas. How can they meet with him?" "Why, that is true," 
says he. " TViey 3lo «»«c^ «»o \ \s^\a ^^^%& 1 tell you, in the Bay

of Siam, in the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some 
Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore 
when they run away with her; and some English and Dutch 
traders being in the river, they were within a little of taking him. 
Nay," said he, "if the foremost boats had been well seconded 
hy the rest, they had certainly taken him, but he finding only 
two boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at these 
two, and disabled them before the others came up; and then 
standing off to sea, the other were not able to follow him, and so 
he got away. But they have all so exact a description of the 
siip that they will be sure to know him; and wherever they find 
iim they have vowed to give no quarter, to either the captain or 
the seamen, but to hang them all up at the yard-arm.'* 

"What!" says I; "will they execute them right or wrong; 
iang them first, and judge them afterwards?" "0 sir!" says 
the old pilot, " there's no need to make a formal business of it 
Mth such rogues as those; let them tie them back to back and 
Set them a diving. 'Tis no more than they richly deserva" 

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he could do me 
lo harm, so that I turned short upon him. " Well now, seignior," 
laid I, " and this is the very reason why I would have you carry 
is up to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao, or to any other 
part of the country where the English or Dutch ships come. For 
36 it known to you, seignior, those captains of the English and 
Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that 
aeither knows what belongs to justice, nor how to behave them- 
selves as the laws of God and nature direct. But being proud of 
their offices, and not understanding their power, they would act 
the murderers to punish robbers; would take upon them to insult 
men falsely accused, and determine them guilty without due in- 
quiry. And perhaps I may live to call some of them to an account 
for it, where they may be taught how justice is to be executed, 
and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some 
evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the man." 

With this I told him that this was the very ship they attacked; 
and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had with their 
boats, and how foolishly and coward-like they behaved. I told

him all the story of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchmen 
served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe that this story 
of killing the master by the Malayans was not true; as also the 
running away with the ship : but that it was all a fiction of their 
own, to suggest that the men were turned pirates; and they 
ought to have been sure it was so before they had ventured to 
attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them; adding, that 
they would have the blood of those men who we killed there in 
our just defence to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were 
very much in the right to go away to the north; and that if he 
might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China, which we 
might very well do, and buy or build another in the coimtiy. 
" And," said he, " though you will not get so good a ship, yet you 
may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods hack 
again to Bengal, or anywhere else." 

I told him I would take his advice when I came to any port 
where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to huy 
this. He replied I should meet with customers enough for the 
ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very 
well to go back again; and that he would procure me people hoth 
to buy the one and sell the other. 

"Well but, seignior," says I, "as you say they know the ship 
so well, I may perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrumental 
to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible broil, and per- 
haps to be murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find the 
ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by proving this was 
the ship, and so innocent men may probably be overpowered and 
murdered." "Why," says the old man, "Til find out a way to 
prevent that also ; for as I know all those commanders you speak 
of very well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure 
to set them to rights in the thing, and let them know that they 
had been so much in the wrong : that though the people who were 
on board at first might run away with the ship, yet it was not 
true that they had turned pirates; and that in particular these 
were not the men that first went off with the ship, but innocently 
bought her for their trade : and I am persuaded they will so far

AN EXPLANATION. 527 

believe me as, at least, to act more cautiously for the time to 
come." "Well," says I; "and will you deliver one message to 
them from me?" "Yes, I will," says he, "if you will give it 
under your hwid in writing, that I may be able to prove that it 
came from you, and not out of my own head." I answered, 
"That I would readily give it him under my hand." So I took 
a pen, and ink, and paper, and wrote at large the story of assault- 
ing me with the longboats, &c.; the pretended reason of it, and 
the unjust cruel design of it; and concluded to the commanders, 
that they had done what they not only should have been ashamed 
of, but also, that if ever they came to England, and I lived to see 
them there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my 
country were not grown out of use before I arrived there. 

My old pilot read this over and over again, and asked me 

several times if I would stand to iti I answered, " I would stand 

to it as long as I had anything left in the world;" being sensible 

that I should one time or other find an opportunity to put it home 

to them. But we had no occasion ever to let the pilot carry this 

letter; for he never went back again. While those things were 

passing between us, by way of discourse, we went forward directly 

for Nanquin; and in about thirteen days' sail came to an anchor 

at the south-west point of the great Gulf of Nanquin, where, by 

the way, I came by accident to understand that two Dutch ships 

were gone the length before me, and that I should certainly fall 

into their hands. I consulted my partner again in this exigency; 

and he was as much at a loss as I was, and would very gladly 

have been safe on shore almost anywhere. However, I was not 

in such perplexity neither; but I asked the old pilot if there was 

no creek or harbour which I might put into, and pursue my 

business with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of the 

enemy 1 He told me if I would sail to the southward about two 

and forty leagues, there was a little port called Quinchang, where 

the fathers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on their 

progress to teach the Christian religion to the Chinese, and where 

no European ships ever put in; and if I thought to put in there, 

I might consider what farther course to take when I was on 

shore. He confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants,

628 SAFE ON SHORE. 

except that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair there, 
when the merchants from Japan came over thither to buy the 
Chinese merchandise. 

We all agreed to go back to this place. The name of the port 
as he called it I may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particu- 
larly remember it, having lost this, together with the names of 
many other places set down in a little pocket-book which was 
spoiled by the water, on an accident which I shall relate in its 
order; but this I remember, that the Chinese or Japonese mer- 
chants we corresponded with called it by a differing name from 
that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it^ as 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to this place, 
we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shore, where 
we were to get fresh water; on both which occasions the people 
of the country were very civil to us, and brought us abundance of 
things to sell to us, I mean, of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, 
and some fowls; but nothing without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till 
five days, but it was very much to our satisfaction. And I was 
joyful, and I may say thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore, 
resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of 
ourselves and effects any other way, though not every way to our 
satisfaction, we would never set one foot on board that unhappy 
vessel more; and, indeed, I must acknowledge, that of all the 
circumstances of life that ever I had any experience of, nothing 
makes mankind so completely ndserable as that of being in constant 
fear. Well does the Scripture say, " The fear of man brings a 
snare:" it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely suppressed 
by it, that it is capable of no relief; the animal spirits sink, and 
all the vigour of nature, which usually supports men under other 
afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest exigencies, fails 
them here. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy by height- 
ening every danger, representing the English and Dutch captains 
to be men uncapable of hearing reason, or of distinguishing he- 
tween honest men an^ to^^^*, ot \i'6\?«^^\3L a» atory calculated for

TORMENTED BY FEAR. 529 

our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a 
true genuine account of our whole voyage, progress, and design. 
For we might many ways have convinced any reasonable creature 
tiat we were not pirates : the goods we had on board, the course 
^e steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such 
and such ports; and even our very manner, the force we had, the 
number of men, the few arms, little ammunition, short provisions; 
all these would have served to convince any men that we were no 
pirates. The opiiim, and other goods we had on board, would 
make it appear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, 
^ho, it was said, had the names of all the men that were in the 
sliip, might easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portu- 
guese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These, 
^d many other particular circumstances, might have made it 
'Wdent to the understanding of any commander, whose hands we 
^ght fall into, that we were no pirates. 

But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another way, and 
irew us into the vapours; it bewildered our understandings, and set 
ie imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that 
^rhaps might never happen. We first supposed, as indeed every- 
^dy had related to us, that the seamen on board the English and 
Utah ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the 
xme of a pirate, and especially at our beating of their boats and 
leaping, that they would not give themselves leave to inquire 
hether we were pirates or no, but would execute us off-hand, as 
6 call it, without giving us any room for a defence. We reflected 
lat there was really so much apparent evidence before them, that 
ley would scarce inquire after any more; as, first, that the ship 
as certainly the same, and that some of the seamen among them 
new her, and had been on board her; and secondly, that when 
e had intelligence at the river of Cambodia that they were coming 
own to examine us, we fought their boats and fled : so that we 
lade no doubt that they were fully satisfied of our being pirates, 
s we were satisfied of the contrary; and, as I often said, I know 
lOt but I should have been apt to have taken those circumstances 
or evidence, if the tables were turned, and my case was theirs, 
jid have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without

530 DISQUIETING APPREHENSIONS. 

believing, or perhaps considering, what they might have to ofifor in 
their defence. 

But let that be how it will, those were our apprehensions; and 
both my partner and I too scarce slept a night without dreaming 
of halters and yard-arms — that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and 
being taken; of killing, and being killed; and one night I was in 
such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded as, 
and I was knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck mj 
double fist against the side of the cabin I lay in, with such a 
force as wounded my hand most grievously, broke my knuckles 
and cut and bruised the flesh; so that it not only waked me out 
of my sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost two of mj 
fingers. 

Another apprehension I had, was of the cruel usage we mi§;ht 
meet with from them if we fell into their hands. Then the stoiy 
of Amboyna^ came into my head, and how the Dutch might per- 
haps torture us, as they did our countrymen there, and make some 
of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those crimes thej 
never were guilty of, own themselves and all of us to be pirates, 
and so they would put us to death, with a formal appearance of 
justice; and that they might be tempted to do this for the gain 
of our ship and cargo, which was worth four or five thousand 
pound, put all together. 

These things tormented me, and my partner too, night and day; 
nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no authority to 
act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could 
not answer the destroying us, or torturing us^ but would be 

^ Amboyna, the most important but not the largest of the Moluccas or Spic* 
Islands in the Eastern seas. Taken in 1521 by the Portuguese, who were tywaot^ 
and cruel to the natives. Early in the seyeuteenth century the Dutch took theiihBA 
from the Portuguese, but were just as cruel, so that the people of Amboyn* ««* 
always at strife with them. In 1604 the East India Company tried to make » 
settlement in the island, and in 1619 a treaty was made between them and the Dutch, 
but there were constant quarrels and disputes. At a later date the jealooay o( tkt 
Dutch led them to accuse a Captain Towenon, with nine EogliihinMi, tm 
Japanese, and one Portuguese sailor, of conspiring to surpriae the garriiOD, tod 
these persons were seized, tortured, tried, found guilty, and executed. Tbii, 
which was called the ** massacre of Amboyna," made a great sensation in Eogtes^ 
and it is this that is referred to here.

A DISPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE. 631 

accountable for it when they came into their own country : this, I 
say, gave me no satisfaction; for if they will act thus with us, 
what advantage would it be to us that they would be called to an 
accoont for itt or if we were first to be murdered, what satisfac- 
tion would it be to us to have them punished when they came 
homel 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had 
upon the past variety of my particular circumstances; how hard 
I thought it was that I, who had spent forty years in a life of 
continued difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port 
or haven which all men drive at, namely, to have rest and plenty, 
should be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice; 
aud that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should 
now come to be hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, 
for a crime I was not in the least inclined to, much less really 
guilty of, and in a place and circumstance where innocence was 
not like to be any protection at all to me. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in; and 
I should be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition 
of immediate Providence, and I ought to look upon it, and submit 
to it as such; that although I was innocent as to men, I was far 
from being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and 
examine what other crimes in my life were most obvious to me, 
and for which Providence might justly inflict this punishment as 
a retribution; and that I ought to submit to this, just as I would 
to a shipwreck, if it had pleased Grod to have brought such a dis- 
aster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place, 
and then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions, 
that I would not be taken, to be barbarously used, by a parcel of 
merciless wretches, in cold blood: that it were much better to have 
fallen into the hands of the savages, who were man-eaters, and 
who, I was sure, would feast upon me when they had taken me, 
than by those, who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by 
inhuman tortures and barbarities : that in the case of the savages, 
I always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp; and why should 
I not do 80, se^g it was much more dreadful to me, at least, to

532 A HAPPY DREAM. 

think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to tliink 
of being eaten by men; for the savages, give them their due, would 
not eat a liian till he was dead, and killed him first, as we do a 
bullock; but that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of 
death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed I was sure to put my- 
self in a kind of fever with the agitations of a supposed l 
my blood would boil and my eyes sparkle as if I was eng 
and I always resolved that I would take no quarter at their hands, 
but even at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the 
ship, and all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to 
boast of. 

By how much the greater weight the anxieties and perplexities 
of these things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, by so 
much the greater was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on 
shore; and my partner told me he dreamed that he had a very 
heavy load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and 
found that he was not able to stand long under it; but that the 
Portuguese pilot came and took it off his back, and the hill dis- 
appeared, the ground before him showing all smooth and plain; 
and truly it was so, we were all like men who had a load taken off 
their backs. 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my heart that I 
was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above, we resolved 
to go no more to sea in that ship. When we came on shore, the 
old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging and a ware- 
house for our goods; which, by the way, was much the same. It 
was a little house or hut, with a large house joining to it, all built 
with canes, and palisadoed round with large canes to keep out 
pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few in that 
country. However, the magistrates allowed us also a little guard, 
and we had a sentinel with a kind of halberd, or half-pike, who 
stood sentinel at our door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice, 
and a little piece of money, about the value of threepence per day; 
so that our goods were kept very safe. 

The fair or mart usually kept in this place had been over some 
time; however, we found that there were three or four junta in 
the river, and two Japanners, I mean ships from Japan, with goods

NEW ACQUAINTANCES. 533 

vhich they had bought in China, and were not gone away, having 
Japonese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us, was to bring 
us acquainted with three missionary Eomish priests who were in 
the town, and who had been there some time, converting the 
people to Christianity; but we thought they made but poor work 
of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they had done. 
However, that was none of our business. One of these was a 
Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon. He was a jolly, 
well-conditioned man, very free in his conversation; not seeming 
so serious and grave as the other two did, one of whom was a 
Portuguese, and the other a Genoese: but Father Simon was 
courteous, easy in his manner, and very agreeable company. The 
other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and 
applied seriously to the work they came about, namely, to talk 
with and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants wherever 
they had opportunity. We often eat and drank with those men; 
and though I must confess the conversion, as they call it, of the 
Chinese to Christianity is so far from the true conversion required 
to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to 
amount to little more than letting them know the name of Christ, 
and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son in a tongue 
which they understand not, and to. cross themselves, and the like, 
yet it must be confessed that these religious, who we call mission- 
aries, have a firm belief that these people shall be saved, and that 
they are the instruments of it And on this account they undergo, 
not only the fatigue of the voyage, and hazards of living in such 
places, but oftentimes death itself, with the most violent tortures, 
for the sake of this work; and it would be a great want of charity 
in us, whatever opinion we have of the work itself, and the manner 
of their doing it, if we should not have a good opinion of their 
zeal, who undertook it with so many hazards, and who have no 
prospect of the least temporal advantage to themselves. 

But to return to my story. This French priest, Father Simon, 
was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the mission, to 
go up to Peking, the royal seat of the Chinese Emperor, and waited 
only for another priest who was ordered to come to him from

534 FATHER SIMON. 

Macao to go along with him; and we scarce ever met together bill 
he was inviting me to go that journey, telling me how he would 
show me all the glorious things of that mighty empire; and, 
among the rest, the greatest city in the world — " A city," said he, 
" that your London and our Paris put together cannot be eqiud 
to/' This was the city of Peking: which, I confess, is very 
great, and infinitely full of people; but as I looked on those things 
with different eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion of 
them in few words, when I come in the course of my travels to 
speak more particularly of them. 

But first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him 
one day, and being very merry together, I showed some little in- 
clination to go with him, and he pressed me and my partner yeiy 
hard, and with a great many persuasions, to consent "Why, 
Father Simon," says my partner, " why should you desire our 
company so muchi You know we are heretics, and you do not 
love us, nor can keep us company with any pleasure." "Oh," 
says he, " you may, perhaps, be good Catholics in time; my busi- 
ness here is to convert heathens, and who knows but I may con- 
vert you too." " Very well, father," said I; "so you will preach 
to us all the way." •* I won't be troublesome to you," says he; 
" our rehgion does not divest us of good manners; besides," says 
he, " we are here like countrymen, and so we are, compared to 
the place we are in; and if you are Huguenots ^ and I a Catholic, 
we may be all Christians at last; at least," said he, " we are all 
gentlemen, and we may converse so without being uneasy to one 
another." I liked that part of his discourse very well, and it 
began to put me in mind of my priest that I had left in the 
Brazils; but this Father Simon did not come up to his character, 
by a great deal; for though Father Simon had no appearance of » 
criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not that fund of Christian 
zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection to religion that my other 
good ecclesiastic had, of whom I have said so much. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor soliciting 
us to go with him; but we had something else before us at first:

from the name of Hugon, one of their early leaders.

for wd had all this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose

were now in a place of very little business; and once I was about 
to venture to sail for the river of Kilam and the city of Nanquin. 
But providence seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever

though I had not the least view of the manner; and when I began 
sometimes to think of it, could not imagine by what method it 
was to be dona Providence, I say, began here to clear up our 
way a little; and the first thing that offered was that our old 
Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to 
inquire what goods we had; and in the first place, he bought all 
our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold

by weight; some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in 
small wedges of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my head that he 
might perhaps deal with us for the ship too, and I ordered the 
interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk up his shoulders at 
it when it was first proposed to him, but in a few days after he 
came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter, 
and told me he had a proposal to make to me, and that was this: 
He had bought a great quantity of goods of us, when he had no 
thoughts (or proposals made to him) of buying the ship, and that^ 
therefore he had not money enough to pay for the ship; but if I 
would let the same men who were in the ship navigate her, he 
would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would send them from 
thence to the Philippine Islands with another loading, which he 
would pay the freight of before they went from Japan; and that 
at their return he would buy the ship. I began to listen to his 
proposal, and so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that 
I could not but begin to entertain a notion of going myself with 
him, and so to sail from the Philippine Islands away to the South 
Seas; and accordingly I a^ed the Japanese merchant if he would 
not hire us to the Philippine Islands and discharge us there. He 
said. No, he could not do that, for then he could not have the 
return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, he said, 
at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that pro- 
posal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, per- 
suaded me from it, representing the dangers as well of the seas as 
of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people; 
and then of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, morei 
cruel, and more treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion, the 
first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the 
ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to go to 
Japan. And while I was doing this, the young man who, as I 
said, my nephew had left with me as my companion for my travels, 
came to me and told me that he thought that voyage promised 
very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage, and

would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I 
to order him; that if ever he came to England, and I was 
there and alive, he would render me a faithful account of his 
success, and it should be as much mine as I pleased. 

I was really loath to part with him, but considering the prospect 
of advantage, which was really considerable, and that he was a 
young fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I incHned 
to let him go; but first I told him I would consult my partner, 
and give him an answer the next day. My partner and I dis- 
coursed about it, and my partner made a most generous offer. He 
told me, " You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we both 
I'esolve not to go to sea in it again; if your steward," so he called 
Hiy man, " will venture the voyage, I'll leave my share of the vessel 
to him, and let him make his best of it; and if we live to meet in 
England, and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for 
one half of the profits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be 
his own." 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, 
made him such an offer, I could do no less than offer him the same; 
and all the ship's company being willing to go with him, we made 
over half the ship to him in property, and took a writing from 
him, obliging him to account for the other; and away he went to 
Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very punctual, honest man 
to him, protected him at Japan, and got him a license to come on 
shore, which the Europeans in general have not lately obtained; 
paid him his freight very punctually, sent him to the Phihppines 
loaded with Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their 
own, who, trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European 
goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spice. And 
there he was not only paid his freight very well and at a very 
good price, but being not willing to sell the ship then, the mer- 
chant furnished him with goods on his own account; that for 
some money and some spices of his own, which he brought with 
him, he went back to the Manillas to the Spaniards, where he 
sold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a good acquaintance 
at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship; and the Governor of 
Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast of

Mexico, and gave him a license to land there, and travel to Mexico, 
and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe, with all his men 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there he 
sold his ship; and having there also obtained allowance to travel 
by land to Portobello, he found means, somehow or other, to 
get to Jamaica with all his treasure; and about eight yean 
after, came to England exceeding rich : of the which I shall take 
notice in its place; in the meantime, I return to our particalar 
affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's company, it came 
before us, of course, to consider what recompense we should give 
to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the design 
against us in the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had 
done us a considerable service, and deserved well at our hands; 
though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues too; for as they 
believed the story of our being pirates, and that we had really mn 
away with the ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the 
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea with us as 
pirates; and one of them confessed afterwards, that nothing else 
but the hopes of going a-roguing brought him to do it However, 
the service they did us was not the less; and therefore, as I had 
promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered the money to be 
paid to them which they said was due to them on board their 
respective ships; that is to say, the Englishman nineteen months' 
pay, and to the Dutchman seven; and over and above that, I gave 
them, each of them, a small sum of money in gold, and which 
contented them very well Then I made the Englishman gunner 
in the ship, the gunner being now made second mate and purser; 
the Dutchman I made boatswain : so they were both very well 
pleased, and proved very serviceable, being both able seamen, and 
very stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China. If I thought myself banished 
and remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had numy 
ways to get home for my money, what could I think of myself 
now, when I was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off from 
home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of prospect of return 1

AT NANQUIN. 539- 

H'as to be another fair at the place where we were; and then we 

inight be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the 

country, and withal might possibly find some Chinese junks or 

vessels from Tonquin that would be to be sold, and would carry us 

and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and 

resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons were not 

obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps 

we might have an opportunity to load our goods and get passage 

to some other place in India, nearer home. 

Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here; but to divert 
ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the country. First 
we went ten days' journey to see the city of Nanquin : a city well 
worth seeing indeed. They say it has a million of people in it; 
which, however, I do not believe. It is regularly built, the streets 
all exactly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which gives 
the figure of it great advantage. 

But when I come to compare the miserable people of these 
countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, their 
government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory (as some 
call it), I must confess I do not so much as think it is worth 
naming, or worth my while to write of, or any that shall come 
after me to read. 

It is very observable, that we wonder at the grandeur, the 
riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manu- 
factures, the commerce, and the conduct of these people; not that 
it is to be wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded, but 
because, having first a true notion of the barbarity of those coun- 
tries, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevails there, we do not 
expect to find any such things so far off. 

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and royal 
buildings of Europe? What their trade to the universal com- 
merce of England, Holland, France, and Spain? What are their 
cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, 
and an infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a 
few jimks and barks, to our navigation, our merchant fleets, our 
large and powerful navies? Our city of London has more trade 
than all their mighty empire. One English, or Dutch, or French

540 CONCERNING THE CHINESE. 

man-of-war of eighty guns would fight and destroy all the shipping 
of China. But the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the 
power of their government, and strength of their armies, is sur- 
prising to us, because, as I have said, considering them as a har- 
barous nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did not 
expect such things among them; and this, indeed, is the advantage 
with which all their greatness and power is represented to us. 
Otherwise, it is in itself nothing at all; for as I have said of theii 
ships, so may be said of their armies and troops. All the forces 
of their empire, though they were to bring two millions of men into 
the field together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the countiy 
and starve themselves. K they were to besiege a strong town in 
Flanders, or to fight a disciplined army, one line of Gemuio 
cuirassiers or of French cavalry would overthrow all the horse of 
China. A million of their foot could not stand before one em- 
battled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, 
though they were to be not one to twenty in number; nay, I do 
not boast if I say that 30,000 German or English foot, and 10,000 
French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China And so 
of our fortified towns, and of the art of our engineers in assaulting 
and defending towns. There is not a fortified town in China could 
hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an 
European army; and, at the same time, all the armies of China 
could never take such a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not 
starved, no, not in a ten years' siege. They have firearms, it is 
true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain in going o£ 
They have powder, but it is of no strength. They have neither 
discipline in the field, exercise to their arms, skill to attack, or 
temper to retreat. And therefore I must confess it seemed strange 
to me, when I came home and heard our people say such fine things 
of the power, riches, glory, magnificence, and trade of the Chinese; 
because I saw and knew that they were a contemptible herd, or 
crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to a government qualified 
only to rule such a people. And in a word (for I am now launched 
quite beside my design) — I say, in a word, were not its distance 
inconceivably great from Muscovy,^ and was not the Muscovite

empire almost as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a crowd of slaves 
as they, the Czar of Muscovy might with much ease drive them all 
out of their country, and conquer them in one campaign. And 
had the Czar, who I since hear is a growing prince, and begins to 
appear formidable in the worid, fallen this way, instead of attack- 
ing the warlike Swedes (in which attempt none of the powers of 
Europe would have envied or interrupted him), he might by this 
time have been Emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the 
King of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in 
number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their naviga- 
tion, commerce, and husbandry is imperfect and impotent, com- 
pared to the same things in Europe ; also in their knowledge, their 
learning, their skill in the sciences. They have globes and spheres, 
and a smatch^ of the knowledge of the mathematics; but when you 
come to inquire into their knowledge, how short-sighted are the 
wisest of their students ! They know nothing of the motion of 
the heavenly bodies; and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when 
the sun is eclipsed, they think it is a great dragon has assaulted 
and run away with it, and they fall a-clattering with all the drums 
and kettles in the country, to fright the monster away, just as 
we do to hive a swarm of bees ! 

As this is the only excursion of this kind which I have made 
in all the account I have given of my travels, so I shall make no 
more descriptions of countries and people ; it is none of my busi- 
ness, or any part of my design, but giving an account of my own 
adventures, through a life of inimitable wanderings, and a long 
variety of changes, which perhaps few that come after me will 
have heard the like of. I shall therefore say very little of all the 
mighty places, desert countries, and numerous people I have yet 
to pass through more than relates to my own story, and which 
my concern among them will make necessary. I was now, as 
near as I can compute, in the heart of China, about the latitude 
of 30 degrees north of the line, for we were returned from Nanquin. 
I had indeed a mind to see the city of Peking, which I had heard 
so much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it. At 
length his time of going away being set, and the other missionary

542 START FOR PEKING. 

who was to go with him being arrived from Macao, in was neces- 
sary that we should resolve either to go or not to go; so I referred 
him to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at length 
resolved it in the afl&rmative, and we prepared for our journey. 
We set out with very good advantage as to finding the way; for 
we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins— 
a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate in the province where 
they reside, and who take great state upon them, travelling with 
great attendance, and with great homage from the people, who 
are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, because all the 
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish provisions for 
them and all their attendance. That which I particularly observed, 
as to our travelling with his baggage, was this, that though we 
received sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses, 
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet were obliged 
to pay for everything we had after the market price of the country, 
and the mandarin's steward, or commissary of the provisions, col- 
lected it duly from us; so that our travelling in the retinue of 
the mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to us, was not 
such a mighty favour in him, but was indeed a great advantage 
to him, considering there were above thirty other people travelled 
in the same maimer besides us, under the protection of his retinae, 
or, as we may call it, under his convoy. This, I say, was a great 
advantage to him, for the country furnished all the provisions for 
' nothing, and he took all our money for them. 

We were five and twenty days travelling to Peking, through a 
country infinitely populous, but miserably cultivated; the bu^ 
bandry, the economy, and the way of living miserable, though 
they boast so much of the industry of the people. I say miser- 
able, and so it is, if we who understand how to live were to 
endure it, or to compare it with our own; but not so to these 
poor wretches who know no other. The pride of these people is 
infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, which 
adds to that which I call their misery. And I must needs think 
the naked savages of America live much more happy, because, as 
they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these are 
proud and insolent, and in the main are mere beggars and drudges*

A CHINESE GRANDEE. 543 

Their ostentatdon is inexpressible, and is chiefly shewed in their 
clothes and buildings, and in the keeping multitudes of servants 
or slaves; and, which is to the last degree ridiculous, their con- 
tempt of all the world but themselves. 

I must ponfess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the 
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here; and 
yet the roads here are well paved, and well kept, and very con- 
venient for travellers; but nothing was more awkward to me than 
bo see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of 
^he grossest simplicity and ignorance; for all their famed ingenuity 
s no more. And my friend Father Simon and I used to be very 
aierry upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride of those 
people. For example, coming by the house of a country gentle- 
tnan, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues off of the city 
of Nanquin, we had first of all the honour to ride with the master 
of the house about two miles. The state he rode in was a perfect 
Don Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greasy don was very proper for a scaramouch 
or merry Andrew, being a dirty calico, with all the tawdry and 
trapping of a fool's coat, such as hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts 
and slashes almost on every side. It covered a taffeta vest, as 
greasy as a butcher, and which testified that his honour must 
needs be a most exquisite sloven. 

His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, such as 
in England might sell for about thirty or forty shillings; and he 
had two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor creature 
along. He had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast 
as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus 
he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants, and we were told 
he was going from the city to his country seat, about half a league 
before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman 
rode away before us, and as we stopped at a village about an hour 
to refresh us, when we came by the country-seat of this great 
man, we saw him in a little place before his door eating his repast. 
It was a kind of a garden, but he was easy to be seen; and we 
were given to understand that the more we looked on him the 
better he would be pleased.

544 A CHINESE DINNER. 

He sat under a tree something like the palmetto tree, which 
effectually shaded him over the head; and on the south side, but 
under the tree also, was placed a large umbrella, which made that 
part look well enough. He sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, 
being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being brought him by 
two women slaves. He had two more, whose office, I think, few 
gentlemen in Europe would accept of their service in— namely, 
one fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish with 
one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's beard 
and taffeta vest; while the great fat brute thought it below him 
to employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices, which 
kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with the 
clumsy fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pain men's pride puts them to, 
and how troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill managed, must 
be to a man of common sense. And leaving the poor wretch to 
please himself with our looking at him, as if we admired his 
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him, we pursued 
our journey. Only Father Simon had the curiosity to stay to 
inform himself what dainties the country justice had to feed on, 
in all his state, which, he said, he had the honour to taste of, and 
which was, I think, a dose that an English hound would scarce 
have eaten if it had been offered him, namely, a mess of boiled 
rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with 
green pepper, and another plant which they have there, something 
like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard. 
All this was put together, and a small lump or piece of lean 
mutton boiled in it; and this was his worship's repast, four or 
five servants more attending at a distance. If he fed them meaner 
than he was fed himself, the spice excepted, they must fare very 
coarsely indeed. 

As for our mandarin, with whom we travelled, he was respected 
like a king; surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended 
in all his appearances with such pomp that I saw little of him but 
at a distance. But this I observed, that there was not a horse in 
his retinue, but that our carriers' pack-horses in England seem to 
me to look much better; but they were so covered with equipage,

mntles, trappings, and such like trumpery, that you cannot see 
H^hether they are fat or lean. In a word, we could see scarce any- 
thing but their feet and their heads. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity 

that I have given an account of being over, I had no anxious 

thoughts about me, which made this journey the pleasanter to 

iQe; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in the passing 

or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me free of the 

country, as they call it, that is to say, threw me in. The place 

^as not deep, but it wetted me all over. I mention it because it 

spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of 

several people and places, which I had occasion to remember; and 

which, not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the words 

w-ere never after to be read, to my great loss as to the names of 

Some places I touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Peking. I had nobody with me but 
the youth who my nephew, the captain, had given me to attend 
One as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and 
Oiy partner had nobody with him but one servant, who was a 
kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see 
t;he court, we gave him his passage — that is to say, bore his charges 
for his company, and to use him as an interpreter; for he under- 
stood the language of the country, and spoke good French, and 
a little English. And, indeed, this old man was a most useful 
implement to us everywhere; for we had not been above a week 
at Peking when he came laughing. " Ah, Seignior Inglese," says 
he, " I have something to tell you will make your heart glad." 
"My heart glad," says I. "What can that be? I don't know 
anything in this country can either give me joy or grief to any 
great degree." " Yes, yes," said the old man, in broken English; 
"make you glad, me sorrow." "Sorry" he would have said. 
This made me more inquisitive. " Why," said I, " will it make 
you sorry?" "Because," said he, "you have brought me here 
twenty-five days' journey, and will leave me to go back alone. 
And which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a ship, 
without a horse, without pecune?" So he called money, being his 
broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry with.

546 THE pilot's news. 

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and 
Polish merchants in the city, and they were preparing to set out 
on their journey by land to Muscovy, within four or five weeks; 
and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with them, 
and leave him behind to go back all alone. I confess I was sur- 
prised with his news; a secret joy spread itself over my whole 
soul, which I cannot describe, and never felt before or since, and 
I had no power for a good while to speak a word to the old man. 
But at last I turned to him. " How do you know thisf said L 
" Are you sure it is true?" " Yes," says he: "I met this morning 
in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one 
you call a Grecian, who is among them. He came last from 
Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly 
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go 
with the caravan to Muscow, and so down the river Wolga to 
Astracan." "Well, seignior," says I, "do not be uneasy about 
being left to go back alone. If this be a method for mj return 
to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at alL" 
We then went to consulting together what was to be done, and I 
asked my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and 
whether it would suit with his aflfairsi He told me he would do 
just as I would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, 
and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had made a 
good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought and 
raw, such as might be worth the carriage, he would be content to 
go to England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal by the 
Company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that, if our Portugal 
pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges to Muscow, or 
to England if he pleased. Nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed 
over-generous in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him 
farther, for the service he had done us was really worth all that, 
and more : for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he 
had been like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us 
the Japan merchant was some hundred of pounds in our pocket 
So we consulted together about it, and being willing to gratify 
him, which was indeed but doing him justice, and very willing

WE LEAVE PEKING. 547 

aiso to have him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man 

on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, 

^hich, as I compute it, came to about £175 sterling between us, 

and to bear all his charges, both for himself and horse, except 

only a horse to carry his goods. 

Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to let him 
know what we had resolved. I told him he had complained of 
:)ur being to let him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we 
►vas resolved he should not go back at all; that as we had resolved 
'O go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also he should go 
vith us ; and that we called him to know his mind. He shook 
lis head, and said it was a long journey, and he had no pecune to 
iarry him thither, or to subsist himself when he came there. 
i^e told him we believed it was so, and therefore we had resolved 
o do something for him that should let him see how sensible we 
?vere of the service he had done us, and also how agreeable he 
?vas to us. And then I told him what we had resolved to give 
nim here, which he might lay out as we would do our own; and 
:ihat as for his charges, if he would go with us, we would set him 
safe ashore, life and casualties excepted, either in Muscovy or 
England, which he would, at our own charge, except only the 
carriage of his goods. 

He received the proposal like a man transported, and told us 
he would go with us over the whole world; and so, in short, 
we all prepared ourselves for the journey. However, as it was 
with us, so it was with the other merchants: they had many 
things to do, and instead of being ready in five weeks, it was 
four months and some odd days before all things were got 
together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set out 
from Peking. My partner and the old pilot had gone express back 
to the port where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods 
which we had left there; and I, with a Chinese merchant, who I 
had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to Peking on 
his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of 
fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other very fine 
silks, of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these

648 A LARGE CARAVAN. 

brought to Peking against my partner's return. Besides this, we 
bought a very large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods; 
our cargo amounting in these goods only to about three thousand 
five hundred pounds sterling; which, together with tea and some 
fine calicoes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded 
in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those we ride upon, 
which, with two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with 
provisions, made us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our 
retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I can rememher, 
made between three and four hundred horse, and upwards of a 
hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all 
events. For as the Eastern caravans are subject to be attacked 
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars. But they are not al- 
together so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they 
prevail 

The company consisted of people of several nations, such a« 
Muscovites chiefly; for there were above sixty of them who were 
merchants or inhabitants of Muscow, though of them some were 
Livonians, and, to our particular satisfaction, five of them were 
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience in huai- 
ness, and men of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day^s journey, the guides, who were 
&ve in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants, that is 
to say, all the passengers, except the servants, to a great council, 
as they called it At this great council every one deposited » 
certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the necessary 
expense of buying forage on the way, where it was not otherwise 
to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses and the 
like. And here they constituted the journey, as they call it; 
namely, they named captains and officers to draw us all up, and 
give the command in case of an attack, and gave every one their 
turn of command. Nor was this forming us into order any moi« 
than what we found needful upon the way, as shall be obsened 
in its place. 

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and 
is full of potters and earthmakers; that is to say, people that

A CURIOUS HOUSE. 549 

tempered the earth for the China ware. And as I was coming 
along, our Portugal pilot, who had always something or other to 
say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would 
show me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should 
have this to say of China, after all the ill-humoured things I had 
said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in 
all the world beside. I was very importunate to know what it was. 
At last he told me it was a gentleman's house built all with China 
wara " Well," says I, " are not the materials of their building 
the product of their own country; and so it is all China ware, is it 
not?" "No, no," says he; "I mean it is a house all made of 
China ware, such as you call it in England; or, as it is called in 
our country, porcelain." "Well," says I, "such a thing may be. 
How big is it] Can we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we 
can, we will buy it." " Upon a camel !" says the old pilot, holding 
up both his hands; "why, there is a family of thirty people lives 
in it" 

I was then curious indeed to see it; and when I came to it, it 
was nothing but this : it was a timber house, or a house built, as 
we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all the plastering 
was really China ware; that is to say,, it was plastered with the 
earth that makes China ware. 

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and 
looked very well, perfect white, and painted with blue figures, as 
the large China ware in England is painted, and hard, as if it had 
been burned. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, 
were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like the little square 
tiles we call galley-tiles in England, all made of the finest China; 
and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary variety 
of colours mixed with gold, many tiles making but one figure, 
but joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the same earth, 
that it was very hard to see where the tiles met The floors of 
the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the 
earthen floors we have in use in several parts of England, 
especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c., as 
hard as stone, and smooth, but not burned and painted, except 
some smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved

with the same tile. The ceilings and, in a word, all the plastering 
work in the whole house were of the same earth; and after all, the 
roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep shining 
black. 

This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be 
called so; and had I not been upon the journey, I could have 
stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it They 
told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all paved 
at the bottom and sides with the same, and fine statues set up in 
rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and 
burned whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be 
allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their 
accounts of it; for they told me such incredible things of their 
performance in crockery ware, for such it is, that I care not to 
relate, as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in par- 
ticular, of one workman that made a ship with all its tackle, and 
masts, and sails, in earthenware, big enough to carry fifty men. H 
he had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan in it, 
I might have said something to it indeed ; but as it was, I knew 
the whole of the story, which was, in short, asking pardon for the 
word, that the fellow lied. So I smiled, and said nothing to it 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for which 
the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of three 
shillings, and told me, if it had been three days' journey without 
the wall, as it was three days within, he must have fined me four 
times as much, and made me ask pardon the next council day. So 
I promised to be more orderly; for, indeed, I found afterwards the 
orders made for keeping all together were absolutely necessary for 
our common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a 
fortification against the Tartars; and a very great work it is, 
going over hills and mountains in a needless track, where the 
rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy could 
possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall 
could hinder them. They tell us, its length is near a thousand 
English miles, but that the country is five hundred in a straight

measured line, which the wall bounds, without measuring the 
windings and turnings it takes. Tis about four fathom high, and 
as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour or thereabout, without trespassing our 
orders, for so long the caravan was in passing the gate ; I say, I 
stood still an hour to look at it on every side, near and far off; I 
mean, that was within my view. And the guide of our caravan, 
who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was 
mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a most 
excellent thing to keep off the Tartars; which he happened not 
to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a compliment. 
But the old pilot laughed. " O Seignior Inglese," says he, " you 
speak in colours." " In colours," said I; " what do you mean by 
that?" "Why, you speak what looks white this way, and black 
that way ; gay one way, and dull another way. You tell him it 
is a good wall to keep out Tartars. You tell me by that, it is 
good for nothing but to keep out Tartars, or it will keep out none 
but Tartars. I understand you. Seignior Inglese, I understand 
you," says he ; " but Seignior Chinese understood you his own 
way." 

" Well," says I, " seignior, do you think it would stand out an 
army of our country people, with a good train of artillery; or our 
engineers, with two companies of miners ; would not they batter 
it down in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or blow 
it up in the air, foundation and all, that there should be no sign 
of it left?" "Ay, ay," says he, "I know that." The Chinese 
wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him leave to 
tell him a few days after, for we were then almost out of their 
country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward; but 
when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest of the 
way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese power 
and greatness, while he stayed. 

After we had passed this mighty nothing called a wall, some- 
thing like the Picts' wall, and so famous in Northumberland, and 
built by the Romans, we began to find the country thinly in- 
habited, and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns 
and cities, as being subject to the inroads and depredations of the

652 THREATENED BY TARTARS. 

Tartars, who rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be 
resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping together m 
a caravan as we travelled, for we saw several troops of Tartan 
roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly, I wondered 
more that the Chinese empire could be conquered by such con- 
temptible fellows; for they are a mere horde or crowd of wild 
fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no discipline or 
manner of fight 

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught nothing, 
and fit for nothing; and this we said the first day we saw them, 
which was after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our 
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunt- 
ing, as they call it; and what was this, "but hunting of sheep. 
However, it may be called hunting too; for the creatures are the 
wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind. Only 
they will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport when yon 
begin the chase; for they appear generally thirty or forty in a 
flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game it was our hap to meet with 
about forty Tartars. Whether they were hunting mutton as we 
were, or whether they looked for another kind of prey, I know 
not; but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of a 
horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound, that I had never 
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear again. We all 
supposed this was to call their friends about them, and so it was; 
for in less than half a quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty 
more appeared at about a mile distance; but our work was over 
first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Muscow happened to be amongst 
us, and as soon as he heard the horn he told us, in short, that we 
had nothing to do but to charge them immediately without loss 
of time; and drawing us up in a line, he asked if we were i«- 
solved ? We told him we were ready to follow him ; so he rode 
directly up to them. They stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, 
drawn up in no order, nor showing the face of any order at ill; 
but as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their arron

which however missed us very happily. It seems they mistook 
not their aim, but their distance; for their arrows all fell a little 
short of us, but with so true an aim, that had we been about 
twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men wounded, if 
not killed. 
Immediately we halted; and though it was at a great distance. 



"We fired, following our shot full gallop.* 

we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, follow- 
ing our shot full gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand, for 
so our bold Scot that led us directed. He was indeed but a 
merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and bravery on this 
occasion, and yet with such a cool courage too, that I never saw 
any man in action fitter for command. As soon as we came up 
to them we fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew, but 
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable. The only stand 
any of them made was on our right, where three of them stood, 
and by signs called the rest to come back to them, having a kind 
of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs.

554 IN THE DESERT. 

gallops up close to them, and with his fuzee knocks one of them 
oflf his horse, killed the second with his pistol, and the third nw 
away; and thus ended our fight. But we had this misfortune 
attending it, namely, that all our mutton that we had in chase 
got away. We had not a man killed or hurt; but as for the 
Tartars, there was about five of them killed. Who were wounded, 
we knew not; but this we knew, that the other party was so 
frighted with the noise of our guns that they made ofij and never 
made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominion, and therefore 
the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about five days 
we entered a vast great wild desert, which held us three days' 
and nights' march; and we were obliged to carry our water with 
us in great leather bottles, and to encamp all night, just as 1 have 
heard they do in the desert of Arabia. 

I asked whose dominion this was in, and they told me this was 
a kind of border, that might be called No Man's Land; being a 
part of the Great Karakathie, or Grand Tartary, but that, however, 
it was all reckoned to China; but that there was no care taken 
here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it 
was reckoned the worst desert in the whole world— though we 
were to go over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which I confess was at the first very 
frightful to me, we saw two or three times little parties of the 
Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have 
no design upon us; and so, like the man who met the devil, if 
they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them; we 
let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand and 
gaze at us; whether it was to consider what they should do, 
whether attack us, or not attack us, that we knew not but when 
we were passed at some distance by them, we made a rear-guard 
of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass 
half a mile, or thereabouts, before us. But after a while they 
marched off, only we found they saluted us with five arrows at 
their parting, one of which wounded a horse so that it disabled 
him; and we left him the next day, poor creature, in great need

of a good farrier. We suppose they might shoot more arrows, 
which might fall short of us; but we saw no more arrows or 
Tartars that tima 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways being not so 
good as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of 
China, but lay for the most part in villages, some of which were 
fortified, because of the incursions of the Tartars. When we 
came to one of these towns (it was about two days and a half 
journey before we were to come to the city Naum), I wanted 
to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the way 
upon that road, and of horses also, such as they are, because, so 
many caravans coming that way, they are often wanted. The 
person that I spoke to to get me a camel would have gone and 
fetched it for me, but I, like a fool, must be officious, and go 
myself along with him. The place was about two miles out of 
the village, where, it seems, they kept the camels and horses feed- 
ing under a guard. 

I walked it on foot with my old pilot, being very desirous, for- 
sooth, of a little variety. When we came to the place, it was a 
low marshy ground walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, 
without mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a little guard 
of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and 
agreed for the price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went 
with me led the camel; when on a sudden came up five Tartars 
on horseback: two of them seized the fellow, and took the camel 
from him, while other three stepped up to me and my old pilot, 
seeing us, as it were, unarmed; for I had no weapon about me 
but my sword, which could but ill defend me against three horse- 
men. The first that came up stopped short upon my drawing 
my sword (for they are arrant cowards); but a second, coming 
upon my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never felt till 
afterward, and wondered, when I came to myself, what was the 
matter with me and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground. 
But my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, 
unlooked-for, directs deliverances from dangers, which to us are 
imforeseen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, 
nor the Tartars neither: if they had, I suppose they would not

have attacked us*^ but cowards are always boldest when there is 
no danger. 

The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped up to 
the fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm with 
one hand, and pulling him down by main force a little towards 
him with the other, shot him into the head, and laid him dead 
upon the spot; he then immediately stepped up to him who had 
stopped us, as I said, and before he could come forward again (for 
it was all done, as it were in a moment), made a blow at him with 
a scimitar which he always wore, but, missing the man, cut his 
horse into the side of his head, cut one of his ears off by the root, 
and a great slice down the side of his face. The poor beast, en- 
raged with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider, 
though the fellow sat well enough too, but away he flew, and 
carried him quite out of the pilot's reach; and, at some distance, 
rising up upon his hind-legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon 
hinL 

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had lost the 
camel, but he had no weapon; however, seeing the Tartar down, 
and his horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing 
upon an ugly, ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, something 
like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neither, he wrenched it from 
him, and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with it 
But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and, 
seeing he did not fly as he expected, nor come on to flght him as 
he apprehended, but stand stock still, the old man stood still too, 
and falls to work with his tackle to charge his pistol again; bat 
as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it to 
be the same or another I know not, but away he scoured, and 
left my pilot, my champion I called him afterward, a complete 
victory. 

By this time I was a little awake; for I thought, when fiist I 
began to wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep; but, as I said 
above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the ground, and 
what was the matter : in a word, a few moments after, as sense 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where; I clapped my 
hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I felt my held

ache, and then, in another moment, memory returned, and every- 
thing was present to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, 
but no enemies in view. I foimd a Tartar lie dead, and his horse 
standing very quietly by him; and, looking farther, I saw my 
champion and deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had 
ione, coming back with his hanger in his hand. The old man, 
jeeing me on my feet, came running to me, and embraced me with 
I great deal of joy, being afraid before that I had been killed, and, 
seeing me bloody, would see how I was hurt; but it was not much, 
)nly what we call a broken head; neither did I afterwards find 
my great inconvenience from the blow, other than the place which 
wras hurt, and which was well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory; for we lost 
\ camel, and gained a horse : but that which was remarkable, when 
we came back to the village, the man demanded to be paid for the 
i^mel. I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before the 
Chinese judge of the place; that is to say, in English, we went 
before a justice of the peace. Give him his due, he acted with a 
great deal of prudence and impartiality; and having heard both 
sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that went with me to buy 
the camel, whose servant he was? "I am no servant," says he, 
"but went with the stranger." "At whose request?" says the 
justice. "At the stranger's request," says he. "Why, then," 
says the justice, "you were the stranger's servant for the time; 
and the camel being delivered to his servant, it was delivered to 
him, and he must pay for it." 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say; 
but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence, 
and so accurate stating the cause, I paid willingly for the camel, 
and sent for another. But you may observe, I sent for it; I did 
not go to fetch it myself any more; I had enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a fr<Jntier of the Chinese empire : they call 
it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there; for this I will 
venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathie, which, I 
believe, are some millions, could not batter down the walls with 
their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it were attacked

558 BAD NEWS FOR TRAVELLERS. 

with cannon, would be to make those who understand it laugh 
at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this city, 
when messengers were sent express to every part of the road, to 
tell all travellers and caravans to halt, till they had a guard sent 
for them; for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thou- 
sand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond 
the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers : however, it was carefullj 
done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should 
have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred 
soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and 
three hundred more from the city of Naum, and with those we 
advanced boldly; the three hundred soldiers from Naum marched 
in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men on each 
side of our camels with our baggage, and the whole caravan in the 
centre. In this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought 
ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mongul Tartars, if 
they had appeared; but the next day, when they did appear, it 
was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching from a httle well- 
situated town, called Changu, we had a river to pass, where we 
were obliged to ferry: and had the Tartars had any intelligence, 
then had been the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan 
being over, the rear-guard was behind : but they did not appear. 

About three hours after, when we were entered upon a desert 
of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust 
they raised, we saw an enemy was at hand; and they were at 
hand indeed, for they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so big the 
day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers frequently looked 
behind them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just 
ready to run away. My old pilot wfts of my mind; and being 
near me, he called out: " Seignior Inglese," says he, " those fellows 
must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars 
come on, they will never stand it." " I am of your mind," said I; 
"but what course must be done?" "Donel" says he; "let fifty

of our men advancej and flank them on each wing, and encourage 

them, and they will fight like brave fellows in brave company; but 

fldthout, they will every man turn his back." Immediately I rode 

up to our leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind; and 

accordingly, fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the 

left, and the rest made a line of reserve; and so we marched, 

leaving the last two hundred men to make another body by them^ 

selves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need were, they 

shoiUd send a hundred men to assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company 
they were; how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we 
thought, was the least. A party of them came on first, and viewed 
our posture, traversing the ground in the front of our line; and 
as we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two 
ivings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing 
with their shot, which was done; but they went off, and, I sup- 
pose, back to give an account of the reception they were like to 
meet with: and, indeed, that salute clogged their stomach, for 
they immediately halted, stood a while to consider of it, and, 
wheeling off to the left, they gave over the design, and said no 
more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to our cir- 
cumstances, which were but very indifferent for a battle with such 
a number. 

Two days after this, we came to the city Naun, or Naum. We 
thanked the governor for his care for us, and collected to the 
value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the 
soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day. This is a 
garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here; 
but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay 
nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites having aban- 
doned that part of the country (which lies from this city west, for 
about two hundred miles) as desolate and ujifit for use; and more 
especially, being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops 
thither for its defence; for we had yet above two thousand miles 
to Muscovy, properly so called. 

After this, we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful 
deserts, one of which we were sixteen days passing over, and which,

560 "AMONG christians!" 

as I said, was to be called No Man's Land; and on the 13th of 
April we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. 1 
think the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it might be 
called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argon, 
being on the west side of the river Argun. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was so soon 
arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or at least in acountiy 
governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my 
opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they 
pretend to be, and are very devout in their way. It would cer- 
tainly occur to any man who travels the world as I have done, 
and who had any power of reflection — I say, it would occur to him 
to reflect what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where 
the name of God and of a Redeemer is known, worshipped, and 
adored; and not where the people, given up by Heaven to strong 
delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks 
and stones, worship monsters, elements, horrible shaped animals, 
and statues, or images of monsters. Not a to^vn or city we 
passed through but had their pagods, their idols, and their tem- 
ples, and ignorant people worshij^ing even the works of their 
own hands. 

Now we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship 
appeared, where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and whether igno- 
rantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name 
of the true God was called upon and adored; and it made the very 
recesses of my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots 
merchant I mentioned above, with my first acknowledgment of this; 
and taking him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God, we 
are once again come among Christians !'' He smiled, and answered, 
"Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are but 
an odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it, you may 
see very little of the substance for some months farther of our 
journey." 

" Well," says I, " but still 'tis better than paganism and wor- 
shipping of devils." "Why, Til tell you," says he; "except the 
Russian soldiers in garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the 
cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for above a thou-

sand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of 
pagans." And so indeed we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth, if 
I understand anything of the surface of the globe, that is to be 
found in any part of the earth : we had at least twelve hundred 
miles to the sea, eastward; we had at least two thousand to the 
bottom of the Baltick Sea, westward; and above three thousand 
miles, if we left that sea and went on west to the British and 
French Channels; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian 
or Persian Sea, south; and about eight hundred miles to the Frozen 
Sea, north; -nay, if some people may be believed, th^re might be 
no sea north-east till we came round the Pole, and consequently 
into the north-west, and so had a continent of land into America, 
the Lord knows where; though I could give some reasons why I 
believe that to be a mistake. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a good while before 
we came to any considerable town, we had nothing to observe there 
but this: first, that as all the rivers run to the east; as I under- 
stood by the charts which some of our caravans had with them, it 
was plain that all those rivers ran into the great river Yamour, 
or Gammour.^ This river, by the natural course of it, must run 
into the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The story they tell us, that 
the mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes of a monstrous 
growth, namely, three foot about, and twenty or thirty foot high, 
I must be allowed to say I believe nothing of; but as its naviga- 
tion is of no use, because there is no trade that way — the Tartars, 
to whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle — so nobody 
that ever I heard of, has been curious enough either to go down to 
the mouth of it in boats, or come up from the mouth of it in ships; 
but this is certain, that this river running due east, in the latitude 
of about fifty degrees, carries a vast concourse of rivers along with 
it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude; so we are 
sure of sea there.

of the Shilka or Onon and the Argun or Eerulen, which divides the Chinese and 
Russian territories for 400 miles. The Amoor nms first S.E. and then E.N.E.

662 IN MUSCOVY. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several consider- 
able rivers, whose streams run as due north as the Yamour runs 
east; and these are all found to join their waters with the great 
river Tartarus, named so from the northernmost nations of the 
Mongul Tartars, who, the Chinese say, were the first Tartars in 
the world; and who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog and 
Magog mentioned in sacred story. 

These rivers running all northward, as well as all the other 
rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident that the Northern 
Ocean bounds the land also on that side; so that it does not seem 
rational in the least to think that the land can extend itself to 
join with America on that side, or that there is not a communica- 
tion between the Northern and the Eastern Ocean. But of this 
I shall say no more; it was my observation at that time, and 
therefore I take notice of it in this place. We now advanced from 
the river Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, and were very 
visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Muscovy has taken to 
have cities and towns built in as many places as are possible to 
place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the 
stationary soldiers placed by the Eomans in the remotest countries 
of their empire, some of which I had read particularly were 
placed in Britain for the security of commerce, and for the lodging 
travellers; and thus it was here; for wherever we came, though 
at these towns and stations the garrisons and governor were 
Eussiaus and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants of the 
country were mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping 
the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven : and not only 
so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, 
the most barbarous, except only that they did not eat man's flesh, 
as our savages of America did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country between 
Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of 
Tartars and Kussians together, called Nertsinskay; ^ in which is 
a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel 
over it. In a village near the last of those places, I had the 
curiosity to go and see their way of living, which is most brutish

A TARTAR GOD. 563 

and unsufferable. They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day ; 
for there stood out upon an old stump of a tree, an idol made of 
wood, frightful as the devil, at least as anything we can think of 
to represent the devil can be made. It had a head certainly not 
samuch as resembling any creature that the world ever saw; ears 
as big as goat's horns, and as high; eyes as big as a crown piece; 
a nose like a crooked ram's horn; and a mouth extended four 
cornered like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a 
parrot's under bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner 
that you could suppose; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, 
with the wool outward, a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with 
two horns growing through it; it was about eight foot high, yet 
had no feet or legs, or any other proportion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village, and 
when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures, 
whether men or women I could not tell, for they make no dis- 
tinction by their habits,^ either of body or head. These lay all 
flat on the ground, round this formidable block of shapeless wood. 
I saw no motion among them any more than if they had been all 
logs of wood like the idol, and at first really thought they had 
been so; but when I came a little nearer, they started up upon 
their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if it had been so many 
deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased 
at our disturbing them. A little way oflf from the idol, and at 
the door of that tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow- 
skins, dried, stood three butchers: I thought they were such; when 
I came nearer to them, I found they had long knives in their 
hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, 
and one young bullock or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices 
to that senseless log of an idol, and these three men priests belong- 
ing to it; and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people 
who brought the offering, and were making their prayers to that 
stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish wor- 
ship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was at anything in my life; to 
see God's most glorious and best creature, to whom he had granted

564 ZEAL AGAINST IDOLATRY. 

80 many advantages, even by creation, above the rest of the works 
of his hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that soul adorned 
with faculties and capacities adapted both to honour his Maker 
and be honoured by him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so 
more than stupid, as to prostrate itself to a frightful Nothing, a 
mere imaginary Object dressed up by themselves, and made 
terrible to themselves, by their own contrivance; adorned onlj 
with clouts and rags; and that this should be the effect of mere 
ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil himself, 
who, envying to his Maker the homage and adoration of his 
creatures, had deluded them into such gross, surfeiting, sordid, 
and brutish things, as one would think should shock Nature 
itself. 

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of 
thoughts] Thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there 
was no room to wonder at it, or think it impossible. All my 
admiration turned to rage, and I rid up to the image or monster, 
call it what you will, and with my sword cut the bonnet that was 
on its head in two in the middle, so that it hung down by one of 
the horns; and one of our men that was with me took hold of 
the sheep-skin that ^covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a 
most hideous outcry and howling run through the village, and 
two or three hundred people came about my ears, so that I was 
glad to scour for it, for we saw some had bows and arrows. Bat 
I resolved from that moment to visit them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about 
four miles off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, 
several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the 
badness of the way and long march over the last desert; so we 
had some leisure here to put my design in execution. I com- 
municated my project to the Scots merchant of Muscow, of whose 
courage I had had sufficient testimony, as above. I told him 
what I had seen, and with what indignation I had since thought 
that human nature could be so degenerate. I told him I was re- 
solved, if I could get but four or five men well armed to go with 
me, I was resolved to go and destroy that vile abominable idol, 
and let them see that it had no power to help itself, and con-

sequently could not be an object of worship, or to be prayed to, 
nrach less help them that oflfered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me. Says he, "Your zeal may be good, but 
what do you propose to yourself by it?" " Propose !" said I; " to 
vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted by this devil- 
worship." ** But how will it vindicate the honour of God?" said 
he; "while the people will not be able to know what you mean 
by it, unless you could speak to them and tell them so, and then 
they will fight you, and beat you too, Fll assure you; for they are 
desperate fellows, and that especially in defence of their idolatry." 
" Can we not," said I, " do it in the night, and then leave them 
the reasons and causes in writing in their own language ?" " Writ- 
ing!" said he; " why, there is not a man in five nations of them 
that knows anything of a letter, or how to read a word in any 
language, or in their own." "Wretched ignorance!" said I to 
him; "however, I have a great mind to do it. Perhaps Nature 
may draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how brutish 
they are to worship such horrid things." " Look you, sir," said 
he : "if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it; 
but, in the next place, I would have you consider, these wild 
nations of people are subjected by force to the Czar of Muscovy's 
dominions; and if you do this, 'tis ten to one but they will come 
by thousands to the Governor of Nertsinskay, and complain, and 
demand satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, 'tis 
ten to one but they revolt, and it will occasion a new war with 
all the Tartars in the country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a while; 
but I harped upon the same string still, and all that day I was 
uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the evening, the 
Scots merchant met me by accident in our walk about the town, 
and desired to speak with me. " I believe," said he, " I have put 
you off your good design. I have been a little concerned about 
it since, for I abhor the idol and the idolatry as much as you can 
do." "Truly," says I, "you have put it off a little as to the 
execution of it, but you have not put it all out of my thoughts; 
and I believe I shall do it still before I quit this place, though I 
were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction." " No, no," says

he; "God forbid they should deliver you up to such a crew of 
monsters. They shall not do that neither : that would be mur- 
dering you indeed." " Why," says I, " how would they use mef" 
"Use you!" says he; "Til tell you how they served a poor 
Russian, who affronted them in their worship just as you did, and 
who they took prisoner. After they had lamed him with an 
arrow that he could not run away, they took him and stripped him 
stark naked, and set him up on the top of the idol monster, and 
stood all round him, and shot as many arrows into him as would 
stick over his whole body, and then they burned him, and all the 
arrows sticking in him, as a sacrifice to the idol." "And was 
this the same idol ?" " Yes," says he, " the very same." " Well," 
says I, " I'll tell you a story." So I related the story of our men 
at Madagascar, and how they burned and sacked the village there, 
and killed man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of our 
men, just as it is related before ; and when I had done, I added, 
that I thought we ought to do so to this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked ol 
doing so to that village, says he, " You mistake very much. It 
was not this village : it was almost a hundred mile from this 
place; but it was the same idol, for they carry him about in pro- 
cession all over the country." "Well then," says I, "then that 
idol ought to be punished for it; and it shall," says I, "if I live 
this night out." 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me 
I should not go alone, but he would go with me, and bring a stout 
fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; "and one," 
says he, " as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to he, 
against such devilish things as these." In a word, he brought me 
his comrade, a Scotsman, who he called Captain Kichardson, and 
I gave him a full account of what I had seen, and, in a word, of 
what I intended ; and he told me readily he would go with roe, if 
it cost him his life : so we agreed to go only us three. I had, 
indeed, proposed it to my partner, but he declined it He said he 
was ready to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occasions, for 
my defence, but that this was an adventure quite out of his way. 
So, I say, we resolved upon our work, only us three and my man-

ACTIVE PREPARATIONS. 667 

servant, and to put it in execution that night about midnight^ 
with all the secrecy imaginable. 

However upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it 
till the next night, because the caravan being to set forward in the 
morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to give them 
any satisfaction upon us, when we were out of his power. The 
Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for the enterprise as 
bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of the 
sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had pro- 
vided the same for himself and his. countryman, that the people, if 
they saw us, should not be able to determine who we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible 
matter with aqua vitse, gunpowder, and such other materials as we 
could get; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about 
an hour after night we set out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found 
that the people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their 
idol. The night was cloudy, yet the moon gave us light enough 
to see that the idol stood just in the same posture and place that 
it did before. The people seemed to be all at their rest, only that 
in the great hut, or tent, as we called it, where we saw the three 
priests, who we mistook for butchers, we saw a light, and going 
up close to the door, we heard people talking as if there were five 
or six of them. We concluded, therefore, that if we set the wild- 
fire to the idol, these men would come out immediately, and run 
up to the place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended 
for it; and what to do with them we knew not. Once we thought 
of carrying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance; but when 
we came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our carriage, so 
we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman was for setting 
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures that were there 
on the head when they came out; but I could not join with that. 
I was against killing them, if it was possible to be avoided. 
"Well, then," said the Scots merchant, "Til tell you what we 
will do : we will try to take them prisoners, tie their hands behind 
them, and make them stand still and see their idol destroyed." 

As it happened, we had twined or packthread enough about us.

which was used to tie our fireworks together with; so we re- 
solved to attack these people first, and with as little noise as m 
could. The first thing we did, we knocked at the door, which 
issued just as we desired it; for one of their idol priests came to 
the door. We immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth, 
and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol, where ve 
gagged him that he might not make a noise, tied his feet also 
together, and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another 
would come out to see what the matter was; but we waited so 
long till the third man came back to us, and then nobody coming 
out, we knocked again gently, and immediately out came two 
more, and we served them just in the same manner, but were 
obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol, some 
distance from one another. When going back, we found two more 
were come out to the door, and a third stood behind them within 
the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied them, when 
the third stepping back, and crying out, my Scots merchant went 
in after him, and taking out a composition we had made, that 
would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it, and threw it in 
among them. By that time the other Scotsman and my man, 
taking charge of the two men who were already bound, and tied 
together also by the arm, led them away to the idol, and left 
them there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making haste 
back to us. 

When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so 
much smoke thut they were almost suffocated, we then threw in a 
small leather bag of another kind, which flamed like a candle, and 
following it in, we found there was but four people left, who, it 
seems, were two men and two women, and, as we supposed, had 
been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in 
short, frighted to death, at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, 
and not able to speak neither, for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the others, 
and all without any noise. I should have said, we brought them 
out of the house or hut first; for, indeed, we were not able to bear 
the smoke any more than they«were. When we had done this,

THE IDOL DESTROYED. 569 

We carried them all together to the idol. When we came there, 
We fell to work with him. And, first, we daubed him all over, 
and his robes also, with tar and such other stuff as we had, which 
was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and 
ears, and mouth full of gunpowder; and then we wrapped up a 
great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then, sticking all the 
combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked about 
bo see if we could find anything else to help to bum him, when 
tny man remembered that by the tent or hut where the men were 
bhere lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes I do not 
remember. Away he and one of the Scotsmen run, and fetched 
bheir arms full of that. When we had done this, we took all our 
prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and un- 
tagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them just 
before their monstrous idol, and then set firp to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the 
powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, and, 
we could perceive, had split and deformed the shape; and, in a 
word, till we saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood : and 
then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would be quite con- 
sumed, when we began to think of going away. But the Scotsman 
said, "No, we must not go; for these poor deluded wretches will 
all throw themselves into the fire, and burn themselves with the 
idoL" So we resolved to stay till the forage was burned down 
too, and then we came away and left them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow-travellers, ex- 
ceeding bu5y in getting ready for our journey; nor could any man 
suggest that we had been anywhere but in our beds, as travellers 
might be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigues of that 
day's journey. 

But it did not end so. The next day came a great multitude 
of the country-people, not only of this village, but of a hundred 
more, for ought I know, to the town-gates, and, in a most out- 
rageous manner, demanded satisfaction of the Eussian governor 
for the insulting their priests, and burning their great Cham-Chi- 
Thaungu; such a hard name they gave the monstrous creature they 
worshipped. The people of Nertsinskay were, at first, in a great

consternation; for they said, the Tartars were no less than thirty 
thousand, and that in a few days more would be one hundred 
thousand strong. 

The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them, and 
gave them all the good words imaginable. He assured them he 
knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul of his garrison 
been abroad; that it could not be from anybody there; and if 
they would let him know who it was, they should be exempkrily 
punished. They returned haughtily, that all the country rever- 
enced the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and 
no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image but 
some Christian miscreant, so they called them, it seems; and they 
therefore denounced war against him, and all the Eussians, who, 
they said, were miscreants and Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, or 
to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the czar 
having straitly charged them to treat the conquered country with 
gentleness and civility, gave them still all the good words he 
could. At last he told them there was a caravan gone towards 
Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who had 
done them this injury; and that if they would be satisfied with 
that, he would send after them to inquire into it. This seemed 
to appease them a little; and, accordingly, the governor sent after 
us, and gave us a particular account how the thing was; intimating 
withal that if any in our caravan had done it, they should make 
their escape; but that whether they had done it or no, we should 
make all the haste forward that was possible; and that, in the 
meaiitime, he would keep them in play as long as he could 

This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it came 
to the caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the matter. 
And as for us that were guilty, we were the least of all suspected; 
none so much as asked us the question. However, the captain of 
the caravan for the time took the hint that the governor gave us, 
and we marched or travelled two days and two nights without any 
considerable stop. And then we lay at a village called Plothus; 
nor did make any long stop here, but hastened on towards 
Jarawena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where

PURSUED BY TARTARS. 671 

we expected we should be safe; but it is to be observed, that here 
we began for two or three days' march to enter upon the vast 
nameless desert, of which I shall say more in its place; and which, 
if we had now been upon it, 'tis more than probable we had been 
all destroyed. It was the second day's march from Plothus that, 
by the clouds of dust behind us, at a great distance, some of our 
people began to be sensible we were pursued. We had entered 
the desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks-Oser, 
when we perceived a very great body of horse appear on the 
other side of the lake to the north, we travelliug west We 
observed they went away west as we did, but had supposed we 
would have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happily 
took the south side; and in two days more we saw them not, 
for they, believing we were still before them, pushed on till they 
came to the river Udda. This is a very great river when it passes 
farther north; but where we came to it, we found it narrow, and 
fordable. 

The third day they either found their mistake, or had intel- 
ligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards the dusk of 
the evening. We had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon 
a place for our camp which was very convenient, for the night; 
for as we were upon a desert, though but at the beginning of it, 
that was above five hundred miles over, we had no towns to lodge 
at, and indeed expected none but the city Jarawena, which we had 
yet two days' march to. The desert, however, had some few 
woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the 
great river Udda.^ It was in a narrow strait between two little, 
but very thick woods, that we pitched our little camp for that 
night, expecting to be attacked in the night. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for; but as 
it was usual for the Mongul Tartars to go about in troops in that 
desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every night 
against them, as against armies of robbers; and it was therefore 
no new thing to be pursued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most 
advantageous camp; for we lay between two woods, with a little

572 A STARTLING DEMAND. 

rivulet running just before our front; so that we could not be 
surrounded or attacked any way but in our front or rear. We 
took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by pliicing 
our packs, with our camels and horses, all in a line on the inside 
of the river, and felling some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was 
upon us before we had finished our situation. They did not come 
on us like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to 
us, to demand the men to be delivered to them that had abnsed 
their priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi-Thaungu with fire, 
that they might bum them with fire; and upon this, they said, 
they would go away and do us no farther harm, otherwise they 
would bum us all with fire. Our men looked very blank at this 
message, and began to stare at one another, to see who looked 
with most guilt in their faces; but nobody was the word, nobody 
did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured 
it was not done by any of our camp; that we were peaceable mer- 
chants, travelling on our business; that we had done no harm to 
them, or to any one else; and that, therefore, they must look 
farther for their enemies who had injured them, for we were not 
the people. So desired them not to disturb us; for, if they did, 
we should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer; bat 
a great crowd of them came down in the morning by break of 
day to our camp. But seeing us in such an unaccountable situa- 
tion, they durst come no farther than the brook in our front, 
where they stood and showed us such a number that indeed 
terrified us very much; for those that spoke least of them, spoke 
of ten thousand. Here they stood and looked at us a while, and 
then setting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among 
us; but we were well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered 
under our baggage; and I do not remember that one man of us 
was hurt 

Some time after this, we see them move a little to our right, 
and expected them on the rear; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack, 
as they call them, of Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, 
calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, " ril go send all

these people away to Siheilka." This was a city four or five days' 
jouraey at least to the south, and rather behind us. So he takes 
his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides away from 
our rear directly, as it were, back to Nertsinskay. After this he 
takes a great circuit about, and comes to the army of the Tartars, 
as if he had been sent express to tell them a long story; that the 
people who had burnt the Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to 
Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that is 
to say. Christians; and that they had resolved to bum the god 
Schal-Isar belonging to the Tongueses.^ 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke 
their language, he counterfeited so well, that they all took it from 
him, and away they drove in a most violent hurry to Siheilka, 
which it seems was five days' journey to the south; and in less 
than three hours they were entirely out of our sight, and we never 
heard any more of them; and we never knew whether they went 
to that other place called Siheilka or no. 

So we passed safely on to the city of Jarawena, where there 
was a garrison of Muscovites; and there we rested five days, the 
caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard march, 
and with want of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us three- 
and-twenty days' march. We furnished ourselves with some tents 
here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night; and 
the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages or waggons of 
the country for carrying our water and provisions, and these 
carriages were our defence every night round our little camp; so 
that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very numerous 
indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to want rest again after this long 
journey; for in this desert we saw neither house or tree, or scarce 
a bush; we saw abundance of the sable-hunters, as they called 
them. These are all Tartars of the Mongul Tartary, of which 
this country is a part; and they frequently attack small caravans, 
but we saw no numbers of them together. I was curious to see 
the sable-skins they catched, but could never speak with any of

them; for they durst not come near us, neither durst we straggle 
from our company to go near them. 

After we had passed this desert we came into a country pretty 
well inhabited ; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled 
by the Czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to 
protect the caravans, and defend the country against the Tartan, 
who would otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his 
czarish majesty has given such strict orders for the well guarding 
the caravans and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard 
of in the country, detachments of the garrisons are always sent 
to see the travellers safe from station to station. 

And thus the governor of Adinskoy, who I had opportunity to 
make a visit to, by means of the Scots merchant who was ac- 
quainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought 
there was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe 
we should find the country better peopled, and the people more 
civilized; but I found myself mistaken in both, for we had yet the 
nation of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw the same 
tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse than before, only as 
they were conquered by the Muscovites, and entirely reduced, they 
were not so dangerous; but for rudeness of manners, idolatry, and 
multitheism, no people in the world ever went beyond them 
They are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their houses are built 
of the same. You know not a man from a woman, neither by 
the ruggedness of their countenances or their clothes; and in the 
winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live under- 
ground in houses like vaults, which have cavities going from one 
to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole village 
or country, these had idols in every hut and in every cave; besides, 
they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, and in a 
word, everything that they do not understand, and they understand 
but very little; so that almost every element, every uncommon 
thing sets them a-sacrificing. 

But I am no more to describe people than countries, any farther 
than my own story comes to be concerned in them. I met with

CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLK 575 

nothing peculiar to myself in all this country, which I reckon was, 
from the desert which I spoke of last, at least four huDdred miles, 
half of it being another desert, which took us up twelve days' 
severe travelling, without house, or tree, or bush, but were obliged 
again to carry our own provisions, as well water as bread. After 
we were out of this desert, and had travelled two days, we came 
to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station on the great river Janezay. 
This river they told us parted Europe from Asia, though our 
map-makers, as I am told, do not agree to it; however, it is certainly 
the eastern boundary of the ancient Siberia, which now makes 
up a province only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself 
equal in bigness to the whole empire of Germany. 

And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed, 
except in the Muscovite garrisons. All the country between the 
river Oby and the river Janezay^ is as entirely pagan, and the 
people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as any 
nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. I also found, 
which I observed to the Muscovite governors who I had oppor- 
tunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not much the 
wiser or the nearer Christianity for being under the Muscovite 
government; which they acknowledged was true enough; but, as 
they said, was none of their business. That if the czar expected 
to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should 
be done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers; and they 
added, with more sincerity than I expected, that they found it was 
not so much the concern of their monarch to make the people 
Christians, as it was to make them subjects. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a wild, 
uncultivated country. I cannot say 'tis a barren soil; 'tis only 
barren of people and good management; otherwise it is in itself 
a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inhabi- 
tants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent among 
them from Kussia; for this is the country, I mean on both sides 
the river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals, that are not put 
to death, are banished, and from whence it is next to impossible 
they should ever come away.

576 A COUNCIL CALLED. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs, till I 
came to Tobolsk!, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued 
some time on the following occasion: — 

We had been now almost seven months on our journey, and 
winter began to come on apace; whereupon my partner and I 
called a council about our particular affairs, in which we found it 
proper, considering that we were bound for England, and not for 
Muscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of 
sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter time; 
and, indeed, they have such things that it would be incredible to 
relate the particulars of, by which means the Eussians travel more 
in the winter than they can in summer ; because in these sleds they 
are able to run night and day; the snow being frozen, is one 
universal covering to Nature, by which the hills, the vales, the 
rivers, the lakes, all are smooth and hard as a stone; and they run 
upon the surface, without any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind; 
I was bound to England, not to Muscow, and my route lay two 
ways: either I must go on as the caravan went, till I came to 
Jeroslaw,^ and then go off west for Narva, and the Gulf of Fin- 
land, and so either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I might pos- 
sibly sell my China cargo to good advantage; or I must leave the 
caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six 
days by water to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of 
shipping, either to England, Holland, or Hamburg. 

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter, would have been 
preposterous; for, as to Dantzic, the Baltic would be frozen up, 
and I could not get passage; and to go by land in those countries, 
was far less safe than among the Mongul Tartars; likewise to go 
to Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone from thence, 
and even the merchants who dwell there in summer, retire south 
to Muscow in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that I should 
have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity 
of provisions, and must lie there in an empty town all the winter: 
so that, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way to let

LIFE AT TOBOLSKI. 577 

the caravan go, and to make provision to winter where I was; 
namely, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of fifty-eight degrees, 
where I was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with; 
namely, plenty of provision, such as the country afforded ; a warm 
house, with fuel enough, and exceUent company : of all which I shall 
give a full account in its place. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my beloved island, 
where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague ; on the con- 
trary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, and never 
made any fire but without doors, and for my necessity in dressing 
my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests, with large robes, 
or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and button close 
to the wrists, and all these lined with furs to make them sufficiently 
warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our way 
in England, of making fires in every room in the house, in open 
chimneys, which, when the fire was out, always kept the air in the 
room cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in a good 
house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built like a furnace, 
in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove; the funnel to carry 
the smoke went up one way, the door to come at the fire went in 
another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but no fire 
seen ; just as they heat the bagnios in England. 

By this means we had always the same climate in all the rooms, 
and an equal heat was preserved; and how cold soever it was 
without, it was always warm within, and yet we saw no fire, nor 
was ever incommoded with any smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible 
to meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous as that 
of the most northerly parts of Europe, near the Frozen Ocean, and 
within but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. 

But this being the country where the State criminals of Muscovy, 
as I observed before, are all banished, this city was full of noble- 
men, princes, gentlemen, colonels ; and, in short, all degrees of the 
nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. Here was 
the famous Prince Galliozen, the old General Robostiski, and 
several other persons of note, and some ladies.

578 A RUSSIAN EXILE. 

By means of my Scots merchant, who, nevertheless, I parted 
with here, I made an acquaintance here with several of these 
gentlemen, and some of them of the first rank; and from these, in 
the long winter nights in which I stayed here, I received several 
very agreeable visits. It was talking one night with Prince — , 
one of the banished ministers of state, belonging to the Czar of 
Muscovy, that my talk of my particular case began. He had been 
telling me abundance of fine things, of the greatness, the magnifi- 
cence, the dominions, and the absolute power of the Emperor of 
the Eussians. I interrupted him, and told him, I was a greater 
and more powerful prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy was, 
though my dominions were not so large, or my people so many. 
The Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and, fixing his eyes 
steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant 

I told him his wonder would cease when I had explained my- 
self. First, I told him, I had the absolute disposal of the lives 
and fortunes of all my subjects : that, notwithstanding my absolute 
power, I had not one person disaffected to my government or to 
my person, in all my dominions. He shook his head at that, and 
said, there, indeed, I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him, 
that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my sub- 
jects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will; that they 
would all fight for me to the last drop; and that never tyrant, for 
such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so universally be- 
loved, and yet so horribly feared by his subjects. 

After amusing them with these riddles in government for a while, 
I opened the case, and told them the story at large of my living 
in the island, and how I managed both myself and the people there 
that were under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They 
were exceedingly taken with the story, and especially the prince, 
who told me, with a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be 
master of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged such » 
state of life as mine, to have been Czar of Muscovy; and that he 
found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to be banished to 
there, than ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in 
the court of his master the czar : that the height of human wisdom 
was to bring our tempers down to our circumstances, and to make

TRUE FELICITY. 579 

a calm within under the weight of the greatest scorns without 
When he came first hither, he said, he used to tear the hair from 
his head, and the clothes from his back, as others had done before 
him : but a little time and consideration had made him look into 
himself, as well as round him to things without; that he found 
the mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the 
state of universal life, and how little this world was concerned in 
its true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself, 
fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and 
desires, with but very little assistance from the world; that air to 
breathe in, food to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty for 
exercise in order to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the 
world could do for us: and though the greatness, the authority, 
the riches, and the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world, and 
which he had enjoyed his share of, had much in them that was 
agreeable to us, yet, he observed, that all those things chiefly 
gratified the coarsest of our affections, such as our ambition, our 
particular pride, our avarice, our vanity, and our sensuality; all 
which were, indeed, the mere product of the worst part of man, 
were in themselves crimes, and had in them the seeds of all manner 
of crimes, but neither were related to, or concerned with, any of 
those virtues that constituted us wise men, or of those graces which 
distinguished us as Christians : that being now deprived of all the^ 
fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those 
vices, he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them, 
where he found all manner of deformity ; and was now convinced 
that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and pre- 
serves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future state. 
And in this, he said, they, were more happy in their banishment 
than all their enemies were, who had the full possession of all 
the wealth and power that they (the banished) had left behind 
them. 

" Nor, sir," says he, " do I bring my mind to this politically, by 
the necessity of my circumstances, which some call miserable ; but 
if I know anything of myself, I would not now go back, though 
the czar, my master, should call me, and reinstate me in all my 
former grandeur — I say, I would no more go back to it, than I

580 A GREAT CONQUEROR. 

believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison of the 
body, and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, wonld 
come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in, and 
leave heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human affairs/' 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much 
earnestness and motion of his spirits, which were apparent in his 
countenance, that it was evident it was the true sense of his souL 
There was no room to doubt his sincerity. 

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a monarch in my old 
station, of which I had given him an account, but that I thought 
he was not a monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he 
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the 
absolute dominion over himself, whose reason entirely governs his 
will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city. " But, my 
lord," said I, "shall I take the liberty to ask you a question?" 
" With all my heart," says he. " If the door of your liberty was 
opened," said I, " would you not take hold of it to deliver your- 
self from this exile]" 

"Hold!" said he; "your question is subtle, and requires some 
serious just distinctions to give it a sincere answer; and Til give 
it you from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I know of in 
this world would move me to deliver myself from this state of 
banishment except these two — first, the enjoyment of my relations; 
and, secondly, a little warmer climate. But I protest to you that 
to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power, the 
hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and the 
pleasures, that is to say, follies, of a courtier; — if my master 
should send me word this moment, that he restores me to all he 
banished me from, I protest, if I know- myself at all, I would not 
leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for 
the palace at Muscow." 

" But, my lord," said I, " perhaps you not only are banished 
from the pleasures of the court, and from the power, and authority, 
and wealth you enjoyed before, but you may be absent, too, from 
some of the conveniences of life, your estate, perhaps, confiscated, 
and your effects plundered, and the supplies left you here may 
not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life."

WINTER AT TOBOLSKI. 681 

" Ay/* says he, " that is, as you suppose me to be a lord or a 
prince, &c. So indeed I am; but you are now to consider me 
only as as a man, a human creature, not at all distinguished from 
another; and so I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited 
with sickness and distempers. However, to put the question out 
of dispute': you see our manner ; we are in this place five persons 
of rank; we live perfectly retired, as suited to a state of banish- 
ment; we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our 
fortunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for 
our food; but the poor soldiers who are here, without that help, 
live in as much plenty as we, who go into the woods and catch 
sables and foxes; the labour of a month will maintain them a year: 
and as the way of living is not expensive, so it is not hard to get 
sufficient to ourselves: so that objection is out of doors." 

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable 
conversation I had with this truly great man; in all which he 
showed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge 
of things, so supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of 
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really as much as he 
had expressed, and that he was always the same to the last, as 
will appear in the story I am going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I 
thought it to be, the cold so intense that I could not so much as 
look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur 
before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, 
and two for sight. The little daylight we had was, as we reckoned, 
for three months not above five hours a day, and six at most; 
only that the snow lying on the ground continually, and the 
weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were kept, 
or rather starved, underground; and as for our servants — for we 
hired three servants here to look after our horses and selves — we 
had every now and then their fingers and toes to thaw and take 
care of, lest they should mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, 
the walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our 
food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season; 
good bread enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several

582 PREPARES TO DEPART. 

sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buffaloes, which is 
pretty good beef. All the stores of provision for the winter are 
laid up in the summer, and well cured. Our drink was water 
mixed with aqua vitsB ^ instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead 
instead of wine, which, however, they have excellent good. The 
hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, frequently brought us 
in fresh venison, very fat and good, and sometimes bear's flesh, 
but we did not much care for the last. We had a good stock of 
tea, with which we treated our friends as above; and, in a word, 
we lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, and the days grown considerably longer, 
and the weather, at least, tolerable; so the other travellers began 
to prepare sleds to carry them over the snow, and to get things 
ready to be going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said, 
for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no 
motion; knowing very well that the ships from the south do not 
set out for that part of the world till May or June; and that if I 
was there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any 
ships would be ready to go away; and therefore, I say, I made no 
haste to be gone as others did; in a word, I saw a great many 
people, nay, all the travellers, go away before me. It seems every 
year they go from hence to Muscow for trade ; namely, to carry 
furs, and buy necessaries with them, which they bring back to 
furnish their shops: also others went of the same errand to 
Archangel; but then they also being to come back again above 
eight hundred miles, went all out before me. 

In short, about the latter end of May I began to make all ready 
to pack up; and as I was doing this, it occurred to me, that seeing 
all these people were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, 
and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to go whither 
they would, why did they not then go away to any part of the 
world wherever they thought fit? and I began to examine what 
should hinder them from making such an attempt. 

But my wonder was over when I entered upon that subject 
with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus: "Con- 
sider, first, sir," said he, " the place where we are; and, secondly,

A STARTLING OFFER. 583 

the condition we are in; especially," said he, "the generality of 
the people who are banished hither. We are surrounded," said 
he, " with stronger things than bars and bolts : on the north side 
an unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed and boat never 
swam; neither, if we had both, could we know where to go with 
them. Every other way," said he, " we have above a thousand 
miles to pass through the czar's own dominions, and by ways 
utterly unpassable, except by the roads made by the governor, 
and by the towns garrisoned by his troops; so that we could 
neither pass undiscovered by the road, or subsist any other way; 
so that it is in vain to attempt it" 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in a 
prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the 
castle at Muscow. However, it came into my thought, that I 
might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of 
this excellent person, and that whatever hazard I run, I would 
certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took an occa- 
sion one evening to tell him my thoughts : I represented to him 
that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being no 
guard over him in the country, and as I was not going to Muscow, 
but to Archangel, and that I went in the nature of a caravan, by 
which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the 
desert, but could encamp every night where I would, we might 
easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where I would immediately 
secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and carry him off 
safe along with me ; and as to his subsistence, and other particulars, 
it should be my care till he could better supply himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all 
the while I spoke. Nay, I could see in his very face that what I 
said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment; his colour frequently 
changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might 
be even perceived in his countenance; nor could he immediately 
answer me when I had done, and, as it were, expected what he would 
say to it; but after he had paused a little he embraced me, and 
said, " How unhappy are we, unguarded creatures as we are, that 
even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares to us, and we 
are made tempters of one another! My dear friend," said he,

what I would say; but, indeed, I soon after perceived, that he 
stopped because his spirits were in motion; his great heart was full 
of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, astonished 
at the thing, as well as at the man, and I used some arguments 
with him to urge him to set himself free; that he ought to look 
upon this as a door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a 
summons by Providence, who has the care and disposition of all 
events, to do himself good, and to render himself useful in the 
world. 

He had by this time recovered himsell " How do you know,

silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admired what I saw. The 
struggle in his soul was so great, that, though the weather was

my room, and I was going to open the door; but he had opened it, 
and came in. "My dear friend," says he, "you had almost over- 
set me, but I am recovered; do not take it ill that I do not close 
with your offer; I assure you, 'tis not for want of a sense of the 
kindness of it in you: and I came to make the most sincere 
acknowledgment of it to you; but, I hope, I have got the victory 
over myself." 

" My lord," said I, " I hope you are fully satisfied that you do 
not resist the call of Heavea" "Sir," said he, "if it had been from 
Heaven, the same power would have influenced me to accept it; 
but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven thatl 
decline it; and I have an infinite satisfaction in the parting, that 
you shall leave me an honest man still, though not a free man." 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to 
him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. 
He embraced me very passionately, and assured me, he was sensible 
of that, and should always acknowledge it: and with that he 
offered me a very fine present of sables, too much indeed for me to 
accept from a man in his circumstances; and I would have avoided 
them, but he would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship, with » 
small present of tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four 
little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six 
ounces or thereabout, but were far short of the value of his sables, 
which, indeed, when I came to England, I found worth near X200. 
He accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and one of the 
pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coin- 
age, which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take 
any more; and he sent word by my servant that he desired to 
speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had passed 
between us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that 
affair; but that, since I had made such a generous offer to him, he 
asked me, if I had kindness enough to offer the same to another 
person that he would name to me, in whom he had a great share

and should have been glad to have been the instrument of his de< 
liverance : however, if he would please to name the person to me, 
I would give him my answer, and hoped he would not be 
displeased with me, if he was with my answer. He told me, it 
was only his son, who, though I had not seen, yet was in the same 
condition with himself, and above two hundred miles from him, 
on the other side the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would 
send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made some 
ceremony in letting him undeTstand that it was wholly on his 
account; and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show 
my respect to him by my concern for his son. But these things 
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the next day for 
his son; and, in about twenty days, he came back with the 
messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with very rich furs, 
and which on the whole amounted to a very great value. 

His servants brought the horses into the town, but left the 
young lord at a distance, till night, when he came incognito into 
our apartment, and his father presented him to me; and, in short, 
we concerted there the manner of our travelling, and everything 
proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-skins, 
fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich — I say, I had 
bought them in that city in exchange for some of the goods I 
brought from China; in particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of 
which I sold the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at 
Archangel, for a much better price than I could have done at 
London; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit, and 
whose business more particularly than mine was merchandize, was 
mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the traffic we made 
here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place, a 
city, I believe, little heard of in the world; and, indeed, it is so 
far out of the road of commerce that I know not how it should be 
much talked of. We were now come to a very small caravan, 
being only thirty-two horses and camels in all; and all of them 
passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of

them. It was most natural, also, that I should take more servants 
with me than I had before; and the young lord passed for my 
steward. What great man I passed for myself I know not, 
neither did it concern me to inquire. We had here the worst 
and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in all the 
journey. Indeed, I' call it the worst, because the way was very 
deep in some places and very uneven in others. The best we 
had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of 
Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side 
the river Oby, or, at least, but very seldom; but we found it 
otherwise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovite servant, or 
rather a Siberian servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the 
country, and led us by private roads, that we avoided coming into 
the principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as lumen, 
Soly-Kamskoi, and several others; because the Muscovite garrisons 
which are kept there are very curious and strict in their observa- 
tion upon travellers, and searching lest any of the banished persons 
of note should make their escape that way into Muscovy. But by 
this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey 
was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents 
when we might have had very good accommodation in the cities 
on the way. This the young lord was so sensible of, that he 
would not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several cities 
on the way, but lay abroad himself with his servant in the woods, 
and met us always at the appointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, 
which, in these parts, is the boundary between Europe and Asia, 
and the first city On the European side was called Soly-Kamskoi, 
which is as much as to say, the great city, on the river Kama. 
And here we thought to have seen some evident alteration in the 
people, their manner, their habit, their religion, and their business. 
But we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which, 
by relation, is near seven hundred miles long in some places, but 
not above two hundred miles over where we passed it, so, till we 
came past that horrible place, we found very little difference 
between tYiat country «u\i^\iv^ Mow^l Tartary; the people moatly

pagans, and little better than the savages of America, their houses 
and towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly barbarous, 
except in the cities as above, and the villages near them, where 
they are Christians, as they call themselves, of the Greek Church, 
but have their religion mingled with so many relics of superstition, 
that it is scarce to be known in some places from mere sorcery 
and witchcraft 

In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must, after all our 
dangers were in our imagination escaped, as before, have been 
plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves. 
Of what country they were, whether the roving bands of the 
Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars or wild people on the bank of the Oby, 
had ranged thus far; or whether they were the sable-hunters of 
Siberia, I am yet at a loss to know; but they were all on horse- 
back, carried bows and arrows, and were at first about five and 
forty in number. They came so near to us, as within about two 
musket shot, and, asking no questions, they surrounded us with 
their horse, and looked very earnestly upon us twice. At length 
they placed themselves just in our way, upon which we drew up 
in a little line before our camels, being not above sixteen men in 
all; and being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the Sibe- 
rian servant, who attended his lord, to see who they were. His 
master was the more willing to let him go, because he was not a 
little apprehensive that they were a Siberian troop sent out after 
him. The man came up near them with a flag of truce, and 
called them; but though he spoke several of their languages, or 
dialects of languages rather, he could not understand a word they 
said. However, after some signs to him not to come nearer to 
them at his peril, so he said he understood them to mean, oflfering 
to shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back no wiser than 
he went; only that by their dress, he said, he believed them to be 
some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes, and that 
there must be more of them upon the great desert, though he 
never heard that any of them ever were seen so far north befora 

This was small comfort to us: however, we had no remedy. 
There was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile's distance, 
a little grove or clump of trees, which stood close to^etlier^ a.rvd

very near the road. I immediately resolved we should advance 
to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there: for, 
first, I considered that the trees would, in a great measure, cover 
us from their arrows; and, in the next place, they could not come 
to charge us in a body. It was indeed my old Portuguese pilot 
who proposed it, and who had this excellency attending him, 
namely, that he was always readiest, and most apt to direct and 
encourage us in cases of the most danger. We advanced imme- 
diately with what speed we could, and gained that little wood, the 
Tartars or thieves, for we know not what to call them, keeping 
their stand, and not attempting to hinder us. When we came 
thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy, 
springy piece of ground; and on the one side, a very great spring 
of water, which, running out in a little rill or brook, was, a little 
farther, joined by another of the like bigness, and was, in short, 
the head or source of a considerable river, called afterwards the 
Wirtska, The trees which grew about this spring were not in all 
above two hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty thick; 
so that as soon as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from 
the enemy, unless they alighted and attacked us on foot 

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with indefati- 
gable application, cut down great arms of the trees, and laid them 
hanging, not quite cut of, from one tree to another, so that he 
made a continued fence almost round us. 

We stayed here, waiting the motion of the enemy, some hours, 
without perceiving they made any motion : when, about two hours 
before night, they came down directly upon us; and, though we 
had not perceived it, we found they had been joined by some more 
of the same, so that they were near fourscore horse, whereof, how- 
ever, we fancied some were women. They came on till they were 
within half shot of our little wood, when we fired one musket 
without ball, and called to them in the Kussian tongue to know 
what they wanted, and bid them keep off. But, as if they knew 
nothing of what we said, they came on with a double fury, directly 
up to the wood -side, not imagining we were so barricaded that 
they could not break in. Our old pilot was our captain as well 
as he had been our engineer, and desired of us not to fire upon

592 THE ENEMY INCREASE. 

and rode round our little wood to see where else they might break 
in ; but finding us always ready to face them, they went off again, 
and we resolved not to stir from the place for that night 

We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of the 
night in strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances 
into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited for day- 
light, and when it came it gave us a very unwelcome discover}' 
indeed; for the enemy, who we thought were discouraged with 
the reception they had met with, were now increased to no less 
than three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve huts and 
tents, as if tliey were resolved to besiege us; and this little camp 
they had pitched upon the open plain, at about three-quarters of 
a mile from us. We were indeed surprised at this discovery; and 
now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had. 
The loss of my effects did not lie so near me, though they were 
very considerable, as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such 
barbarians, at the latter end of my journey, after so many diffi- 
culties and hazards as I had gone through, and even in sight of 
our port, where we expected safety and deliverance. As for my 
partner, he was raging. He declared that to lose his goods would 
be his ruin; and he would rather die than be starved: and he 
was for fighting to the last drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed itself, was for 
fighting to the last also; and my old pilot was of the opinion we 
were able to resist them all in the situation we were then in. 
And thus we spent the day in debates of what we should do. 
But towards evening, we found that the number of our enemies 
still increased, perhaps as they were abroad in several parties for 
prey. The first had sent out scouts to call for help, and to 
acquaint them of the booty; and we did not know but by the 
morning they might still be a greater number. So I began to in- 
quire of those people we had brought from Tobolski if there was 
no other or more private ways by which we might avoid them in 
the night, and perhaps either retreat to some town, or get help to 
guard us over the desert.

OUT OF DANGER. 593 

US oflf in the night, to a way that went north towards the Petrou, 
by which he made no question but we might get away, and the 
Tartars never the wiser. But, he said, his lord had told him he 
would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight. I told him 
he mistook his lord; for that he was too wise a man to love fight- 
ing for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave enough by 
what he had showed already; but that his lord knew better than 
to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men fight five hundred, 
unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it; and that if 
he thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we had noth- 
ing else to do but to attempt it He answered, if his lord gave 
him such orders, he would lose his life if he did not perform it. 
We soon brought his lord to give that order, though privately; 
and we immediately prepared for the putting it in practice. 

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in 
our little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to 
make it bum all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were 
still there. But as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we 
could see the stars, for our guide would not stir before, having 
all our horses and camels ready loaden, we followed our new 
guide, who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north 
star, all the country being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two houra very hard, it began to be 
lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon 
began to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we 
wished it to be; but by six o'clock the next morning, we were 
gotten near forty miles, though, the truth is, we almost spoiled our 
horses. Here we found a Kussian village named Kermazinskoy, 
where we rested, and heard nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that 
day. About two hours before night, we set out again, and travelled 
till eight the next morning, though not quite so quiet as before; 
and, about seven o'clock, we passed a little river called Kirtza, 
and came to a good large town inhabited by Eussians, and very 
populous, called Ozomoys. There we heard that several troops or 
hordes of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but that we 
were now completely out of danger of them, which was to our 
great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we were obliged to get

some fresh horses, and having need enough of rest, we stayed five 
days ; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian 
who brought us thither, the value of ten pistoles for his conduct- 
ing us. 

In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the river 
Witzogda, and running into the Dwina. We were there, very 
happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river being 
navigable in seven days* passage to Archangel. From hence we 
came to Lawrenskoy, the 3rd of July; and, providing ourselves 
with two luggage-boats, and a barge for our own convenience, we 
embarked the 7th, and arrived all safe at Archangfel the 18th, 
having been a year and five months and three days on the journey, 
including our stay of eight months and odd days at TobolskL 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks, for the arrival 
of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburger 
come in above a month sooner than any of the EngUsh ships; 
when, after some consideration that the city of Hamburg migbt 
happen to be as good a market for our goods as London, we all 
took freight with him; and, having put my goods on board, it 
was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take care 
of them, by which means my young lord had a sufficient opportu- 
nity to conceal himself, never coming on shore in all the time we 
stayed there; and this he did that he might not be seen in the 
city, where some of the Muscow merchants would certainly have 
seen and discovered him. 

We sailed from Archangel the 20th of August, the same year, 
and after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived in the Elbe the 
13th of September. Here my partner and I found a very good 
sale for our goods, as well those of China, as the sables, &c, of 
Siberia; and dividing the produce of our eflfects, my share 
amounted to ^£3475, 175. Sd,, notwithstanding so many losses 
we had sustained, and charges we had been at, only remembering 
that I had included in this about six hundred pounds worth of 
diamonds which I had purchased at Bengal

in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek

father's friends who were left alive. He did not part without all 
the testimonies he could give me of gratitude for the service I had 
done him, and his sense of my kindness to the prince, his father. 

To conclude. Having stayed near four months in Hamburg, 
I came from thence overland to the Hague, where I embarked in 
the packet, and arrived in London the 10th of January 1705, 
having been gone from England ten years and nine months. 

And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am preparing 
for a longer journey than all these, having lived seventy-two 
years a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know the 
value of retirement, and the blessing of ending our days in peace.

TRUE TO THE OLD FLAG: 

A Tale of the American War of Independence. By G. A. 
Hbnty, author of "With Clive in India/' "By Sheer Pluck," 
"Facing Death," "Under Drake's Flag," &c. With 12 full- 
page Illustrations by Gordon Browne in black and tint. 
Grown 8vo, cloth elegant, bevelled boards, olivine edges, Qs. 

Owing to the unsuccessful termination of the war between Great Britain 
and her American colonies, the subject is one which English writers have 
for the most part avoided, and our histories have been generally drawn 
from American sources. In the present volume the author has gone, to the 
accounts of English officers who took part in the conflict, and lads will find 
that in no war in which British soldiers have been engaged did they behave 
with greater courage and good conduct, than in the long struggle with 
the American colonists. Older people will read with surprise and interest 
this accurately written narrative of the war. The historical portion of the 
book being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the red- 
skins on the shores of Lake Huron, in which the hero of the tale, the son 
of a British officer settled in the States, and who joins the Royal army as 
a scout, takes part, a story of exciting interest is interwoven with the 
general narrative and carried through the book. 

IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE:

"Under Drake's Flag," &c. With 12 full-page Illustrations 
by Gordon Browne in black and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth 
elegant, bevelled boards, olivine edges, 6s. 

In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War of 
Independence and of the exploits of Wallace and Bruce. The extraordinary 
valour and personal prowess of these historical characters rival the deeds 
of the mythical heroes of chivalry Roland and Arthur, and indeed at one 
time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages. The researches 
of modem historians have shown, however, that he was a living, breathing 
man, and that in spite of the fact that the contemporary writers were, for 
the most part, his bitter enemies, there can be no doubt that he was a 
great man as well as a valiant champion. The hero of the tale fought 
under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical accuracy 
has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is full of '* hair- 
breadth 'scapes " and wild adventure.

WITH CLIVE IN INDIA: 

Or the Beginnings of an Empire. By G. A. Hentt, author of 
« Facing Death/' " Under Drake's Fla^," « By Sheer Pluck," &c. 
With 12 full-page Illustrations by Gordon Browne. Crown 
8vo, cloth elegant, bevelled boards, olivine edges, 6s. 

The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and 
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme. At its 
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of tiie 
native princes. At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the greater 
part of Southern India. The Author has given a full and accurate account 
of the historical events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges follow 
each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his narrative a tale 
of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike interest to the volume. 

" In this book Mr. Henty has oontrired to exceed himself in stirring adreutavM 
and thrilling situatioiu, while the realities are preserved. The pictures are by Mr. 
Gordon Browne, who may be congratulated on their soooess in adding to the interest 
of the book."— &Uttr(/ay Review. 

" Among writers of stories of adventnre for boys Mr. Henty stands in the Teiyflnt 
rank, and Mr. Gordon Browne occupies a similar place with his pencil . . . Those 
who know something about India will be the most ready to thank Mr. Henty tot 
giving them this instractive volume to place in the hands of their children."— .^loutony. 

" He has taken a period of Indian History of the most vital importance, and he has 
shown by what means the work was accomplished. He has embroidered on tbe 
historical facts a «tory which of itself is deeply interesting. Tonng people assuredly 
will be delighted with the volume as a whole." — Scottmcm.

A story of the days when England and Spain straggled for the sapre-

with Drake in l^e expedition in which the Pacific Ocean was first seen by 
an Englishman from a tree-top on the Isthmus of Panama, and in his great 
voyage of circumnavigation. The historical portion of the story is abso- 
lutely to be relied upon, but this, although very useful to lads, will perhaps 
be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure throogh 
which the young adventurers pass in the course of their vojrages.

ST. GEORGE FOR ENGLAND: 

A Tale of Creasy and Poitiers. Bj G. A. Henty, author of 
"With Clive in India/' "By Sheer Pluck," "Facing Death,". 
"Under Drake's Flag," &c. With 8 full-page Illustrations 
by Gordon Browne in black and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth 
elegant, bs. 

No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than that 
of the reign of Edward III. Cressy and Poitiers laid France prostrate at 
the feet of England. The Spanish tieet was dispersed and destroyed by a 
naval battle as remarkable in its incidents as was that which broke up the 
Armada in the time of EUzabeth. Europe was ravaged by the dreadful 
plague known as the Black Death, and France was the scene of the terrible 
peasant rising called the Jacquerie. All these stirring events are treated 
by the author in St. George for England. The hero of the story, although 
of good family, b^ins life as a London apprentice, but after countless 
adventures and perils, becomes by valour and good conduct the squire, and 
at last the trusted friend and companion of the Black Prince.

8vo, cloth elegant, 5*. 

The Ashanti Campaign seems but an event of yesterday, but it happened 
-when the generation now rising up were too young to have made them- 
selves acquainted with its incidents. The author has woven, in a tale of 
thrilling interest, all the details of the campaign, of which he was himself 
a witness. His hero, after many exciting adventures in the interior, finds 
himself at Coomassie just before the outbreak of the war, is detained a 
prisoner by the king, is sent down with the army which invaded the British 
Protectorate, escapes, and accompanies the English expedition on their 
march to Coomassie.

FACING DEATH:

By G. A. Hentt, author of " By Sheer Pluck,** " With Clive 
in India,** &c With 8 full-page Illustrations by Gordon 
Browne in black and tint Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, bs. 

" Facing Death " is a story with a purpose. It is intended to show that 
a lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in life, 
and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to carry out bis 
determination, is sure to succeed. The hero of the story, though only a 
colliery lad, is a character that boys will delight in. He is a typical British 
boy, dogged, earnest, generous, apd though " shamefaced " to a degree, is 
ready to face death in the discharge of duty. His is a character for imita- 
tion by boys in every station, who will assuredly be intensely interested in 
the narrative. 

"The tale ia well written and well illustrated, and there is much reality in the 
oharacten. "—A tkenanun,

THE LIFE AND SUKPKISING ADVENTUKES OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

BY DANIEL DEFOE. 

Beautiftilly Printed, and Illustrated by above 100 Pictures 
Designed by Gtordon Browne. 

Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges, 68. 



There have been countless editions of " Robinson Crusoe," and they have 
mostly been imperfect, inasmuch as they have been so largely altered from 
the original text that the language in many instances has not been that of 
Defoe but of his revisers. The present volume has been carefully printed 
from the original edition, and all obsolete or little known terms and obscure 
phrases are explained in brief foot notes. The ** Editing " is not a corrup- 
tion or pretended improvement of Defoe's great work.

With 12 full-page pictures by Gordon Browne. Crown 8vo,.

The tale is of a romantic lad, who leaves home, where his father conducts 
a failing business, to seek his fortune in South America by endeavouring to- 
discover some of that treasure which legends declare was ages ago hidden 
by the Peruvian rulers and the priests of that mysterious counti^, to pre- 
serve it from the Spanish invaders. The hero of the story is accompanied 
by a faithful companion, who, in the capacity both of comrade and nench- 
man, does true service, and shows the dogged courage of the English lad 
during the strange adventures which befaU them. The plot of tne story 
is simple, but the movement is rapid and full of strange excitement. 

" It forma a handsome volume, and clearly a rival to ' Robiiuon Cmioe ' as a gift-

IN THE KING'S NAME: 

Or the Cruise of the Kestrel, By G. Manville Fbnn, author 
of "The Golden Magnet,'' "Nat the Naturalist," &c. Illus- 
trated by 12 full-page Pictures by Gordon Browne. Crown 
8vo, cloth extra, bevelled boards, olivine edges, Qs, 

"In the King's Name" is a spirited story of the Jacobite times, con- 
cerning the adventures of Hilary Leigh, a young naval officer in the 
preventive service off the coast of Sussex, on boanl the Kestrel. Leigh 
IS taken prisoner by the adherents of the Pretender, amongst whom is an 
early friend and patron who desires to spare the lad's life, but will not release 
him. The narrative is full of exciting and often humorous incident. 

" Mr. Manville Fenn has already won a foremost place among writers of stories 
for buys. 'In the King's Name,' is, we are inclined to think, the beet of all his pro- 
ductions in this field. It has the great quality of always 'moving on' — adventure 
following adventure in oonstaut succession." — Daily News. 

" Told with the freshness and verve which characterize all Mr. Fenn's writings and 
imt him in the front rank of writers for boys." — Standard. 

"A book in which boys will delight. Jiist the sort which can be given to a healtby- 
minded youngster with the certainty that he will enjoy it."— Scottman. 

" A capital boy's story, frill of incident and adventure, and told in the lively style 
in which Mr. Fenn is siu^ an adept." — OloOe. 

MENHAEDOC : 

A Story of Cornish Nets and Mines. By G. Manvillb Fbnn, 

author of "The Golden Magnet," " Nat the Naturalist,'' &c. 

With 8 full-page Illustrations by C. J. Staniland in black 

and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, 6s, 

The scene of this story of boyish aspiration and adventure is laid among 
the granite piles and tors of Cornwall, where the huge Atlantic waves, 
clear as cr3rstal, come flowing in to break in glittering cascades upon the 
Imrriers of rock. Here amongst the hardy, honest fishermen and miners the 
two sons of Mr. Temple meet with Will Marion, the nephew of a retired 
purser of the Royal Navy and owner of several fishing-boats. The lads, in 
spite of their differences of temperament, fraternize, and the London boys, 
whose father is a mining engineer in search of profitable lodes or veins, 
Are inducted into the secrets of fishing in the great bay. They learn how 
to catch mackerel, pollack, and conger with the line, and are {>resent at the 
hauling of the nets, but not without incurring many serious risks. Adven- 
tures are pretty plentiful, but the story has for its strong base the develop- 
ment of character of the three boys, who are wonderfully dissimilar. There 
is a good deal of quaint character throughout, and the sketches of Cornish 
life and local colouring are based upon experience in the bay, whose fishing 
village is called here Menhardoc. The search for valuable mineral proves 
successful in an unexpected manner, through the knowledge of the Ix>ndon 
boys' Cornish companion, and with good result. This is a thoroughly 
English story of phases of life but little touched upon in boys' literature up 
to the present time.

Stories of the Red Indians. By Ascott R Hope, author of 
" Stories of Old Renown," &c. With 8 full-page Pictures hy 
Gordon Browns. Crown 8vo, cloth elegant, 5«. 

The interest taken by boys in stories of the North American Indians is 
probably as keen as ever. At all events the works of Fenimore Cooper and 
other writers about the red men and the wild hunters of the forests and 
prairies are still among the most popular of boys' books. " The Wigwam 
and the War-path " consists of stories of Red Indians which are none the 
less romantic for being true. They are taken from the actual records of 
those who have been made prisoners by the red men or have lived among 
them, joining in their expeoitions and taking part in their semi-savage but 
often picturesque and adventurous life. 

*' Mr. Hope'« volume is notably good : it gives a very vivid picture of life among 
the ludians." — SpectaUir. 

" Mr. Aaoott Hope is so deservedly popular as a teller of stories of adventure, that 
in order to recommend a new volume from bis pen we need little more than say it i«

detail that makes them instructive as well as mteresting.^'— /ouma^ of Education. 

" So far, nothing can be better than Mr. Asoott Hope's choice of 'The Wigwam and

"Traitor or Patriot?" is a romantic story of the later days of the reign 
of Charles II. The main theme of the story is the conspiracy for the assas- 
sination of the king and his brother the Duke of York, which was to be 
effected in the lane skirting the premises of the Rye-House in Hertfordshire, 
belon^ng to Richard Rumbold, a maltster. The brothers were to return 
from Newmarket to London, and the design was to hew down the guards, 
4ittack the coach, and murder its two royal occupants. The hero of the 
story, Lawrence Lee, a young farmer of the neighbourhood, learns the 
truth from Rumbold's pretty daughter Ruth, who has accidentally over- 
heard the intentions of the traitors. Thereupon Lee starts on horseback for 
Newmarket without a moment's loss of time, and obtaining an audience of 
the king, wtvxna \i\m ol Vi\« vm^i^ading fate. After a series of adventures,

THE WKECK OF THE NANCY BELL; 

Or, Cast Away on Kergiielen Land. By John C. Hutcheson, 
author of " Picked up at Sea," &c. Illustrated by 6 full-page 
Pictures in black and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth extra, Ss, 6d, 

This is a book for boys after a boy's own heart, for it has the savour and 
spirit of the sea in every page. The story narrates the eventful voyage of a 
vessel on her way from the port of London to New Zealand, and the haps 
and mishaps that befell her — the contrary wmds in the Chops of the 
Channel, the c^ms when in the Doldrums off the African coast — culminat- 
ing in the wreck of the ill-fated Nancy Bell on Kerguelen Land. There is 
no lack of incident. From the opening chapter, with the cowardly steward's 
alarm of *' a ghost in the cabin ' to the end of the story, which details the 
rescue of the shipwrecked passengers, one engrossing narrative holds the 
attention of the reader, until he reaches the final page that tells in an 
almost poetic vein "the last of the old ship." The characters, also, are full 
of interest; jolly old Captain Dinks and the quaint brave Lrish mate 
M'Carthy, winsome Kate Meldrum and the hero Frank Harness, down to 
the mischievous imp Maurice Negus, and the eccentric Mr. Zachariah 
Lathrope, and Snowball the negro cook, who need only to be known to be 
appreciated. "The Wreck of the Naiwy Bell" has all the elements of a 
popular and favourite story. 

PICKED UP AT SEA: 

Or the Gold Miners of Minturne Creek, and other Stories. By 
John C. Hutcheson. With 6 full-page Pictures in tints^

The story of a young English lad, rescued in mid Atlantic from a watery 
grave, and taken out west by a party of gold diggers to the wild regions of 
the filack Hills in Dakota. Here, after warring with the elements during 
months of imceasing toil in their search for the riches of the earth, and 
having the result of their indefatigable labour well-nigh torn from their 
grasp when on the verge of victory by a desperate onslaught of Sioux 
braves, success at last rewards the efforts of the adventurous band and 
their prot€g6. The tale abounds in exciting scenes and stirring incidents 
— all tending to show that pluck and perseverance when allied to a good 
cause invariably win in the long run all the world over. 

** This is the first appearance of the author as a writer of books for boys, and the 
■nccess is so marked that it may well encourage him to further efforts. The descriiv

DR. JOLLIFFE'S BOYS: 

A Tale of Weston School. By Lewis Hough, author of "Phil 
Crawford," &c With 6 full-page Pictures in black and tint. 
In crown 8vo, cloth extra, 3s, 6d, 

A story of school life which will be read with genuine interest, especially 
as it exposes some of the dangers which even in these davs of high instruc- 
tion may beset lads who are ill instructed at home or have b^n thrown 
among vicious or unscrupulous companions. The descriptions of some of 
the characters of the boys at Dr. JoUiffe's are vivid and truthful, — that of 
the worst boy being not too revolting, although it is necessariljr painful as 
conveying a very distinct impression which should be useful in warning 
lads against giving way to overweening personal conceit and envy of the 
achievements of others. Perhaps the best touch in the book is the subtle 
description of the manner in which the best boy may exhibit weakness of 
purpose and some meannesses under the influence of flattery and of tem- 
porary luxury. The narrative throughout is bright, easy, and lighted by 
touches of humour. 

"Young people who appreciate *Toin Brown's School-days' will find thisstoiya 
worthy comiMiiiion to that fascinatiug book. There is the same manliness of tone, 
truthftilnees of outline, avoidance of exaggeration and caricature, and healthy mor- 
ality in this tale of school life as characterized the masterpiece of Mr. Hughes "— 
Newcastle Jownal. 

"This is a racy vigorous story of school life ; but it is more than this. The char- 
acteri are drawn with great nicety and discrimination, while the whole spirit of the 
narrative is such as to enoouriK^e and instruct boys in the trials which they cannot 
avoid." — Edinburgh Courant. 

** The tone of the book cannot fail to be beneficial. The narrative ' moves on ' 
firom first to last with great vigour. It shonld be read not only by boys but by the 
seniors who are apt to forget the troubles which their boys have to meet."— Glasgow

CHEEP AND CHATTER: 

Or, Lessons from Field and Tree. By Alice Banks. "With 
64 Character Illustrations by Gordon Browne, of which four 
are full-page size. Small 4to, cloth, handsome design on 
cover, 38, 6d, ; gilt edges, 48. 



About a dozen highly dramatic sketches or little stories, the actors in 
which are birds, beasts, and insects. They are instructive, suited to the 
capacities of young people, and very amusing. The curious and laughable 
thmg is the clever way in which mice, sparrows, and butterflies are made 
to act and talk. We take an absorbing interest in the adventures of 
"Peepy" and "Cheepy," and "Birdie" and "Pecky," in the opinions 
they express and the characters they develop, just as if they were papas 
and mamas, and boys and ^rls; and whether we are in Fairy-land, or 
Mouse-land, or Bird-land, or m real Boy-and-girl-land, we cease to be sure, 
or, for the matter of that, to care. The character drawings, with which 
the book is profusely illustrated, are delightfully funny. 

" The real charm of the Tolume lies in the illustrations. We have more than once 
approved Mr. Qordon Browne's pencil. Here we can give it unstinted admiration. 
Now of these fifty-four illustrations every one is a success. With l»irds and mice and 
insects the artist is equally at home; but his birds above all are inimitable."— 
Academy. 

"This is a very pleasing book for the young. The morals of the stories are very 
sound, and by no means obtrusive. Of the illustrations it is sufficient praise to say 
that they are worthy of the good-natured drollery, the invention, and the sense of the 
humorous side of the ways of the lower animals which the author displays." — Daily 
News. 

"The author has done her work extremely well, and has conveyed very many 
admirable lessons to young people in an excellent Way. The illustrations are capitid 
—full of fun and genuine humour."— Scotsman.

This Tale gives in narrative form the history and adventures of a class 
of Sunday-school boys. Each boy's career is full of interest. In some 
chapters we are taken to America, during the civil war, and mingle in 
scenes relating to the battle-field ; while, in other chapters, we listen to 
the quiet teachings of one of God's faithful servants who strove to *' gamer 
sheaves for Christ." The wide difference between the honourable upright 
youth, and one who is clever and cunning, but dishonest, is here depict^ 
by incidents from the Ufe ; and it is proved that ** godliness hath promise 
of the life that now is," as well as of that which is to come. From this 
tale Sunday-school teachers may learn that their *' labour shall not be in

LIFE'S DAILY MINISTRY. 

A Story of Everyday Service for Others. By Mrs. Emma Ray- 
mond Pitman. With 4 full-page Illustrations in black and 
tint. Crown 8vo, cloth extra, 3*. 6c?. 

A Story of self-sacrifice and of some touching experiences of life. Some 
of the characters are very attractive, others very repulsive ; hut all tend 
to show that true honour and happiness are to be found in serving others, 
according to our capacity, and so imitating Him '* who went about doing 
good." Some experiences of a sincere and gifted, but doubting youth, 
helpless through spinal disease and destined to early death, and his attain- 
ment of faith, light, and peace, are peculiarly affecting. OUve Forrester,

A series of stories designed to bring before the youn^ mind, in a new 
and entertaining form, some of the shreds of wit and w^om which have 
come down to us from ancient times in the guise of fables. Although 
amusement has been a chief end aimed at, most of the tales will be found 
to suggest some important truth, or teach some sound lesson in practical 
morality.

A story of city life, in which, though the chief aim is to amuse through 
the recital of interesting events and the exhibition of original and humor- 
ous character, the reader may see something of the spirit in which mis-

helps those who help themselves," receive an impulse towards kindhness 
of deed and charity of thought, and fall on sundry other things worth 
knowing and noting.

WINNIE'S SECRET: 

A Story of Faith and Patience, By Kate Wood, author of 

"Lory Bell," "A Waif of the Sea,'' &c. With 4 full-page 

Pictures in black and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth extra, 2«. 6c?. 

Mifls Kate Wood has a talent for writing a simple and pathetic story with 
a great deal of (quaint easy description and enough of fun to enliven some 
chapters that might otherwise seem to be very sad because they relate to 
the suffering and poverty of orphan or destitute children. "Winnie's 
Secret " has a plot as interesting as that of many more ambitious volumes, 
and while the vicissitudes of the two Uttle sisters are narrated with touching 
sympathy and a feeling of genuine piety, the chu'acters of the numerous 
juvenile and ^wn-up friends who come to their aid in the course of the 
story are admirably depicted. 

A WAIF OF THE SEA: 

Or, the Lost Found. By Kate Wood. With 4 full-page Illus- 
trations in black and tint. Crown JBvo, cloth extra, 2«. 6c?. 

"A Waif of the Sea" deals very pathetically with the sorrows and trials 
of children, and of mothers who are separate from their children. The 
narrative is full of human interest, and the lives and struggles of the 
people of a poor London neighbourhood are well portrayed. The child- 
character of " Little Birdie " and her short but affecting story will attract 
and delight many readers. 

** Little Birdie is a beautiful child-character with whom no one can come in contact 
without feeling purer and fresher for life's work."— ©/cwfirow Newi. 

*' This is a very touching and pretty tale of town and oountry, tall of pathos and 
interest embodied in a narrative which never flags, and told in a style which deserves 
the highest praise for its lucid and natural ease.^' — Edinburgh Courant.

of "Isabeau^s Hero/' "Mimi," "The Little Brown Girl," &c. 
With 4 full-page Illustrations in black and tint. Crown 8vo, 
cloth extra, 2s. 6d. 

"Miss Fenwick's Failures" will doubtless be a very complete success 
among young people. The story abounds in capitally told domestic adven- 
tures, and though it has an excellent and well-sustained moral purpose, is 
80 humorous and lively that very few readers, having taken it up, will like 
to part with it till they have followed the fortunes of the Fenwick family 
to the end of the volume. Like other books by the same author this tale 
is a striking example of the ability which can tell a story with spirit and

"A Wise Woman," " As Good as Gold," " Under Canvas," &c. 

With 4 full-page Illustrations by Gordon Browne in black 

and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth extra, 2«. i5d, 

"Brothers in Arms " is a story which while it provides exciting incidents 
and vivid descriptions, will be of real value to the youn^ reader because of 
its containing accurate historical information on the subject of the Crusades 
and the doings of Richard the lion-heart and his army in the Holy Land. 
There are few tales which comprise within so brief a compass, such pictur* 
esque representations of life in that olden time, and such stirring and well- 
told adventures of two lads who took a prominent but not by any means 
an impossible part in the wars in Cyprus and Palestine.

" Hetty Gray " is the story of a girl who, having been found as an infant 
by a villager, is brought up by his wife, and is a kind of general pet, till an 
accident causes a rich widow to adopt her, and spoil her by bringing her up 
in alternate indulgence and neglect. On the death of her adoptive mother 
Hetty, who is left unprovided for, is taken by the widow's relatives to be 
educated in the family as a dependant, but with a view to her gaining her 
hveUhood as a governess, an event which is prevented by a rather remark- 
able discovery. The tale is carried on throughout with the simpUcity but 
genuine effect which distinguishes Miss Mulholland's writing. 

" A pleasantly told story for c^rls, with a happy ending." — A thenceum. 

*'A charming story for young folks. Hetty is a delightful creature— piquant, 
tender, and true— and her varying fortunes are perfectly realistic."— IFbr/^i.

Narratives of Wreck and Rescue. With 4 full-page Illustrations 
by Frank Feller in black and tint. Crown 8vo, cloth 
extra, 2$, 6d. 

While no attempt is made in ** Stories of the Sea " to paint the sailor's 
life in glowing colours, or invest it with a glamour of romance, the narratives

narratives of real personal experience in " Field, Flood, and Forest," while 
in no sense fictitious, and conveying much sound information on the

and more truly interesting than uie most cunningly devised fables.
