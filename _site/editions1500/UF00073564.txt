_ DANIEL Duos was born in the parish of St. Giles's,
Cripplegate, in the year 1663, where his father, Janice
Foe, had followed the trade of a butcher for many years.
Of the earlier members of his family little or nothing is
known. His parents were Nonconformists, and under the
guidance and ministration of Dr. Annesly, a Presbyterian
ininister. When a boy he was full of cheerfulness,
vivacity, and buoyancy of spirits, which was soon displayed
in that unconquerable love of liberty which characterised
his lii'e.

At the age of fourteen he was removed from school to
the academy of the Rev. Charles Morton, at Newington-
green. In this establishment he went through a course of
theology, and studied politics and history. He was intended
for the ministry, but his genius following another bent, he
entered on a succession of employments. We find him
first a political author in 1683, then a soldier, as an ad-
herent to the Duke of Monmouth, in whose unfortunate
expedition he took part, and escaped with better fortuneo

than many of those engaged in that affair. He devoted
his time to business, and was subsequently a hosier, a tile-
maker, and a. woollen-merchant in succession. The ac-
cession of King William commenced a new era in the life
of Dnron. In 1699 he published a very successful poetical
satire, under the title of "The True Born Englishman,"
a defence of King William and the Dutch, which gave the
author a. great reputation. By the death of the King,
Dnros lost a. true and powerful patron, and his gratitude
was only equal to his admiration of his character. In the

new reign he could expect no favour from the government;

he had always been obnoxious to the Stuarts and their
adherents. This source of profit then being dried up, he
betook himself to his pen, to which he was to trust for his
subsistence. Dares became exceedingly prolific, and
tract after tract poured from the press, upon almost every
topic. Among them was the celebrated piece of grave irony
entitled the "Shortest Way with Dissenters," which in-
volved Daron in great trouble. The House of Commons
declared the book a libel, and ordered itto be burnt by the
hands of the common hangman. He was put in the pillory,
and imprisoned in Newgate, where he was confined for two
years. Newgate had no terrors for Dnron. His enemies,
mortified by his wit and satire, tried to enlist him in their

service, but he preferred poverty to the shame of serving a
cause that he abhorred, and remained in prison whilst they
were in power. Some time after Harley's accession to
ofiice, the Queen, through him, became acquainted with
Baron's merits, and was made conscious of the injustice of
his punishment, which she now wished to mitigate. For
this purpose she now sent relief to his wife and family,
and to him a suificient sum for the payment of his fine,
and the expenses attending his discharge from prison.
After thirty years of political life he retired. It was
then he wrote the Life and Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe, which first appeared in 1719. Its successwas so
very great that four editions were published in the same
year; and perhaps there exists no work in the English
language which has been more generally read and more
universally admired. DANIEL Daron died in 1731, at
the age of 68, in Cripplegate, London, leaving a widow

and large family in tolerable good circumstances.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a
good family, though not of that country,.my father being
a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull: he got a
good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade,
lived afterwards at York; from whence he had married my
mother, whose relations were named Robinson, avery good
family in that country, and from whom' I was called
Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called--nay, we call our-
selves,' and write our name--Crusoe; and so my companions
always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-
colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly
commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and as
killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniar 5.
What became of my second brother I never knew, any
more than my father or mother did know what was become
of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling
thoughts; my father, who was very ancient, had given me a
competent share of learning, as far as house education and
a country free-school generally go, and designed me for the
law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to
sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all
the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that10 ROBINSON causes.

propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery
which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was
confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with
me upon this subject; he asked me what reasons, more
than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving my
father's house and my native country, where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune
by application and industry, with alife of ease and pleasure.
He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand,
or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went
abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make
themselves famous in undertakings of a. nature out of the
common road; that these things were all either too far
above me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle
state, or what might be called the upper station of low
life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best
state in the world, and the most suited to human happiness;
that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind
of virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, ,all
agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the
blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way
men went silently and smoothly through the world, and
comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of
the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery
for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances,
which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest.

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to
precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that as he would do very kind things for me if I
would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me
any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told
me I had an elder brother for an example, to whom hehad usednonmsox cnusoa. 11

the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into
the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young
desires prompting him to run into the army, where he
was killed ; and though he said he would not cease to
pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I
did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I
should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected
his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my re-
covery. ,

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it
to be so himself, the tears ran down his face very plentifully,
especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed;
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and
none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the
discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no
more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who
could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going
abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my
father's desire. But, alas! a few days wore it all off; and,
in short, to prevent any of my father's further inportunities,
in a few weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from
him. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the'first heat
of my resolution prompted, but I took my mother, atatime
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and
told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon
seeing the world, that I should never settle to anything
with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father
had better give me his consent than force me to go
without it ; that I was now eighteen years old, which was
too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney;
that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my time,
but I should certainly run away from my master before my
time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my
father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home
again, and did not like it, I would go no more; and I
would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time
that I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion : she told me she12 ROBINSON 011050 E.

knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon
any such subject; and that, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might depend I should
never have their consent to it; and I should never have
it to say that my mother was willing when my father was
not.

Though my mother refused to name it to my father, yet
I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to
him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at
it, said to her, with a sigh, " That boy might be happy
if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will
be the most miserable wretch that ever was born 5 I can
give no consent- to it."

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to
all proposals of settling to business, and frequently expos-
tulated with my father and mother about their being so
positively determined against what they knew my inclina-
tions prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, whither
I went casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement at that time, and one of my companions going
by sea to London in his father's ship, and prompting me to
go with them, with the common allurement of a seafaring
man, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as
sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as
they might, without asking God's blessing or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September,
1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. The
ship was no sooner got out of the Humber, than the wind
began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful man-
ner; and,as I had never been at sea before, I was most
inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind. I began
now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how
justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for
my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning
my duty.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many time-t

nosmsos causes. 13

since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was
enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and
had never known anything of the matter. I expected
every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every
time the ship fell down, as I thought it 'did, in the trough
or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more: in this
agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that if
it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if
ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would
go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship
again while I lived.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while
the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next
day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began
to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for
all that day, being also a little sea--sick still; but towards
night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and
a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and having
little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon
it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that
ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-
sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea
that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be
so calm and so pleasant in so little 8. time after. And now,
lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion,
who had enticed me away, comes to me: "Well, Bob,"
says he, clapping me upon the shoulders, " how do
you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't
you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind ?"--" A
capful, d'you call it ?" said I; " 'twas a terrible storm."--
" A storm, you fool you," replies he; " do you call that
a storm? Why, it was nothing at all; give us but a good
ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of
wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come,
let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that 3 d'ye
see what charming weather 'tis now?" To make short this
sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the
punch was made, and I was made half drunk with it; and
in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance,
all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions
for the future. As the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that
storm, so, the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears
and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being
forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I
entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my
distress; and I had, in five or six days, got as complete a
victory over my conscience as any young fellow that resolved
not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have
another trial for it still.

The sixth day of our beingat sea we came into Yarmouth
Roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather
calm, we had made but little way since the storm. Here
we were obliged to cone to an anchor, and here we lay, the
wind continuing contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or
eight days, during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads, as the common
harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the
river.

We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should
have titled it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh,
and, after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard.
However, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour,
the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong,
our men were unconcerned, and not in the least appre-
hensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth,
after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work
to strike our top-masts, and make everything snug and
close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By
noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rid fore-
castle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or
twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master
ordered out the sheet--anchor, so that we rode with two
anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to the better
end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of
the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in
the business of preserving the ship, yet, as he went in and
out of his cabin by me,'I could hear him softly to himself
say several times, "Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be
all lost; we shall be all undone!" and the like. During
these first hurries I was lying still in my cabin; but when
the master himself came by me, and said we should be all
lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin
and looked out; but such a. dismal sight I never saw ; the
sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing
but distress round us; two ships that rid near us, we found,
had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden; and
our men cried out, that a ship which rid about a mile
ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships, being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all
adventures, and that not with a mast standing. The'light
ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us,
running away with only their spritsail out before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which
he was very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain protesting
to him, that if he did not, the ship would founder, he con-
sented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the
main-mast stood so loose, and shock the ship so much, they
were obliged to cut that away also, and make a clear deck.

Anyone must judge what a condition I must'be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in
such a fright before at but a little. But the worst was
not come yet; the storm continued with such fury, that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and
wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now and
then cried out she Would founder. It was my advantage
in one respect that I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent,
thatI saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boat-
swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at
their prayers, and expecting every moment that the ship
would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and
under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that
had been down to see, cried out we had sprung a leak;
another said, there was four feet water in the hold. Then
all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my
heart, as I thought, died within me; and I fell backwards
upon the side of the bed 11 here I sat, into the cabin.
However, the men roused me, and told me, that I, that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as
another ; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the
storm, were obliged to slip, and run 1111 ay to the sea, and
would come nea1 us, ordered a gun to be fired as a signal of
distress. I, 11110 knew nothing what they meant, thought
the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened t,Iu
a 11 01d, I w as so Slll px 1sed that I fell dowa'n in a $11 oon. As
this was a time when everybody had his own life to think
of, nobody minded me, or 11 hat 11 as become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead;
and it was a great while hefox e I came to myself.

we worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it
was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the
storm began to abatea little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into any port, so the master
continued firing guns for help ; and a light ship, who had
rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it
was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily,
and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a
rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it
out a great length, which they, after much labour and
hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our
stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose
for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of
reaching to their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive,
and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could;
a nd our master promised them that if the boat was staved upon
shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly
rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away to the
northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as
Winterton Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out
of our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for
the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the
sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up
when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the
moment that they rather put me into the boat, than that
I might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, (lead
within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of
mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition--the men yet labouring
at the oar to bring the boat near the shore--we could see
(when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see
the shore) a great many people running along the strand to
assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow
way towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the
shore, till, being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the
shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the
land broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth,
where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great
humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who
assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and
owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to
carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we thought
fit.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinaey that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment, to
go home, yet I had no power to do it.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I.
The first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth,
which was not till two or three days, for we were separated '
1n the town to several quarters, his tone was altered; and,

looking 2very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked
me how I did; and, telling his' father who I was, and how
I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go
farther abroad; his father turning to me, with a very grave
and concerned tone, " Young man," says be, "you ought
never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain
and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man."
" Why, sir," said I, " will you go to sea no more?" " That
is another. case," said he; "it is my calling, and therefore
my duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you see
what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to
expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on
your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,"
continues he, " what are you; and on what account did
you go to sea?" Upon that I told him some of my story;
at the end of which he burst out into a. strange kind of
passion. " What had I done," says he, "that such an
unhappy wretch shOuld come into my ship? I would not
set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand
pounds." However, he afterwards talked very gravely to
me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; telling me I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me. " And, young man," said
he, " depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever
you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and
disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled
upon you."

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and
I saw him no more; which way he went I knew not. As
for me, having money in my pocket, I travelled to London
by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many strug-
gles with myself, what course of life I should take, and
whether I should go home or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
offered to my thoughts 3 and it immediately occurred to me
how I should he laughed at among the neighbours, and should
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
everybody else.

In this state of life, I remained some time, uncertain what
measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irre--
sistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I
stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I had been
in wore off; and as that abated, the little motion I had
in my desires to return were off with it, till at last I
quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a
voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, whatever it was, presented the
most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and
I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa;
or, as our sailors vulgarly called it, a voyage to
Guinea. '

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventuresI
did not ship myself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed
have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same
time I should have learnt the duty and office of a. fore-mast
man ; and in time might have qualified myself for a mate
or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my
fate to choose for the worst, so I did here; for having money
in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would
always go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so
I neither had any business in the ship, nor learned to
do any.

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company
in London. I first got acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having
had very good success there, was resolved to go again;
this captain taking a fancy to my conversation, which was
not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a
mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage
with him I should be at no expense; I should be his mess-
mate and his companion; and if I could carry anything
with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the
trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.

I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I
went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure
with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend
the captain, I increased very considerably; for I carried
about PS40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed
me to buy. This PS40 I had mustered together by the
assistance of some ot'my relations whom I corresponded
with; and who, I believe, got my father, or at least
my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first
adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was suc-
cessful; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces
of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in
London, at my 1etuin almost PS300, and this filled me
with those aspiring thoughts which have since completed
my ruin.

I u as now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to
mv "101i; misiortunc, dving soon after his arrival. I resolved
to go the same \ov age again, and I e: ubarked 1n the same
vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage,
and had now got the command of the ship. This was the
unhappiest voyage that ever man made ; for though I did
not carry quite PS100 of my new-gained wealth, so thatI
had PS20010t't, which I had lodged with my friend's widow,
who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes;
the first was this-<<our ship making her course towards the
(.'anary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the
African shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by
a Turkish rover of Sallce, who gave chase to us with all
the sail she could make. We crowded also as much can 'as
as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to get clear;
but, finding the pirate gained upon us, and v. end certainly
come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our
ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen. About
three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to,
by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart
our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to
hear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him,
which made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot irom near two hundred
men which he had on bomd. How ever, we had not a man
touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack
us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on
board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered
sixty men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cuttingnonmsorr 0317503. 21

and hacking the sails and rigging. We plied them with
small shot, hzdf pilies, powder chests, and such like, and
cleared our deck of them twice; but our ship being dis-
abled, and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we
were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I
apprehended; I was kept by the captain of the rover
as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising change
of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave,
I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon
my father's prophetic discourse to me, that; I should be
miserable and have none to relieve me, which I thought was
now so effectually brought to pass, that I could not be
worse; but, alas! this was but a. taste of the misery I
was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of this
storv.

As my master had taken me home to his house, so I was
in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to
sea again, believing that it would some time or other
be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-
of--war ; and that then I should be set at liberty. But this
hope of mine was soon taken away ; for when he went to
sea, he left me on shore to look after his little garden,
and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house;
and when he came home again from his cruise, he
ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to effect it, but found no way that
had the least probability in it; so that for two years,
tllOugh I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I
never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in
practice. '

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the old thought of making some attempt
for my liberty again in my head. My patron lying
at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,
he used, constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes
oftcner, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace,
and go out into the road a-fishing; and, as he always
toolt me and young Maresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in
catching fish; insomueh that sometimes he would send
me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth--
the Mareseo, as they called him, to catch a. dish of fish
for him.

It happened one time, that going a--fishing in a calm
morning, a fog rose so thick that, though we were not.
half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and
rowi 1g we knew not whither or which way, we laboured
all day, and all the next night, and when the morning
came, we found we had pulled off to sea instead
of pulling in for the shore; and that We were at least
two leagues from the shore. However, we got: well
in again, though with a great deal of labour and some
danger.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by
him the long<<boat of our English ship that he had taken,
iie resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a
compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter
of his ship to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the
middle of the long--boat, like that of a barge, with a
place to stand behind it to steer, and haul home the main-
shect; and room before for a hand or two to stand and
work the sails. The cabin lay very snug and low, and had
in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a
table to eat. on, with some small lockers to put in some
bottles of liquor, and his bread, rice, and eoti'ec.

We went, frequently out with this boat. a-fishing, and
as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never
went without me. It happened that he had appointed
to go out in this boat with two or three Moors, of some
distinction in that place, and for whom he had provided
extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on board the
boat over-night a larger store of provisions than ordinary;
and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with
powder and shot, which were on board his ship, fornonmsou CRUSOE. 23

that they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited
the next morning; when by-and-by my patron came
on board alone, and told me his guests had put off going,
from some business that fell out, and ordered me, with the
man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch
them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his
house; and commanded that as soon as I got some fish
I should bring it home to his house: all which I prepared
to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts, for now I found I was likely to have.
a little ship at my command: and my master being gone
I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing business, but
for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as
consider, whither I should steer--anywhere to get out of
that place was my desire.

My first contrivance was to speak to this Moor, to get
something for our subsistence on board; so he brought a
large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh
water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of
bottles stood, and I conveyed them into the boat while the
Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for
our master. I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax
into the boat, which weighed above half a hundredweight,
with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a.
hammer, all of which were of great use to us afterwards.
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried
upon him, which he innocently came into also: his name was
Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely; so I called to
him :-----" Moely," said I, " our patron's guns are on board
the boat; can you not get a little powder and shot? It
may be we may kill some alcamics (a fowl like our curlews)
for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in
the ship." Accordingly he brought a great leather pouch,
which held a pound and a half of powder, and another
with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets,
and put all into the boat. At the same time, I had found
some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which
I filled one of the large bottles in the case; and thus
furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port
to fish.

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for
when I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up,
that he might not see them, I said to the Moor, " This
will not do; our master will not be thus served; we must
stand farther 011'." He, thinking no harm, agreed, and set
the sails; and. as I had the helm, 1 run the beat. out near
a. league farther, and then brought her to; when, giving the
boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,
and making as if I stooped for something behind him, I
took him by surprise with my arm under his waist, and
tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose imme-
diately, for he swam like a cork, and begging to be taken
in, told me he would go all over the world with me. He
swam so strong after the boat, that. he would have reached
me very quickly, upon which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching,r one of the fowling--pieees, I presented it at him,
and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be
quiet I would do him none. "But," said 1', " it' you come
near the boat, I'll shoot you through the head, for I am
resolved to have my libertyf2 so he turned himself about
and swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but
he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they
called Xury, and said to him, " Xury, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make you a great man ; but if you will
not stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear
by Mahomet and his father's heard, "I must throw you
into the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke
so innocently, that I could not distrust him, and swore
to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.

\Vhile the Moor was swimming, I stood out directly to
sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they
might think me gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed
anyone that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do) ; for who would have supposed we were sailed on to
the southward, where whole nations of negroes were sure
to surround us with their canoes, and destroy us; where we
could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage
beasts, or more merciless savages of human kind?

lint as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed
my con '50, and steered directly south and by east; and
having a fresh gale of wind, and a. smooth sea, I made such
sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the
afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less
than one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee.

The wind continued fair till I had sailed in that
manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I concluded also that it" any of our vessels were in
chase of me, they would now give over; so I ventured to
make to the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a
little river, I knew not what, or where; I neither saw, or
desired to see, any people; the principal thing I wanted
was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening,
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark, we
heard such dreadful noises of the barking, rearing, and
howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that
the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me
not to go on shore till day. " Well, any," said I, " then
I won't; but it may be we may see men by day who will
be as bad to us as those lions."---" Then we give them the
shoot gun," says Xury, laughing, " make them run wey."
I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I. gave him a
dram to cheer him up; and we dropped our little anchor,
and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for
in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures, of many
sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the water,
wallowing and washing for the pleasure of cooling them-
selves; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings
that I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both more frighted when we heard one of
these mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat;
we could not see him, but we might hear him by his blow--
ing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. any said
it was a lion, and cried to me to weigh anchor and row
away: "No," says I, " Xury; we can slip our cable, with26 nonmson (meson.

the buoy to it, and go ofi' to sea; they cannot follow us
far." I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature
within two cars' length; however, I immediately fired at
him, upon which he turned about, and swam towards the
shore again.

'iut it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and
hideous cries and how-tings, that were raised upon the re-
port of the gun. This convinced me that there was no
going on shore for us in the night on that coast, and how
to venture on shore in the day was another question too;
for to have t'aiien into the. hands of any of the savages had
been as had as to have fallen into the hands of lions and

rat- as it wovdd, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere 0' Other for water, for we had not a pint, left in
the boat. }.ur_v said, if I would let him go on shore with
one of tie jars, he would find if there was any water, and
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go? The
boy answered with so much affection as made Inc love him
ever a":er. " 1f wild mans come, they eat me, you go
\\'e_v."---"".Vell, Jury," said I, "we will both go, and if
the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall catneither
of us." {:10 we hauled the boat in near the shore, and
waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms, and two
jars for water.

1' did not. :are to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming- of canoes with savages down the river; but the
boy ' in_<__r a 1m ee about a mile up the country1 rambled
to it, and hy-azxd-hy E saw him come running towards me.
I thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beast, and I ran forwards to help him ; but when
leame nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his
shoulders, which was a. creature that. he had shot, like a
hare; it was very good meat; but the great joy that poor
Xury eame with, was to tell me he had found good water,
and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such
pains for water, for a little higher up the creek we found
the water fresh when the tide was out, so we tilled our jars,
and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go
on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature
in that part of the country.

I had no instruments to take an observation to know
what latitude we were in ; but my hope was, that if I stood
along this coast till I came to that part where the English
traded, I should find some of their vessels that would
relieve and take us in.

We made onto the southward continually for ten or twelve
days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began
to abate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than
we were obliged for fresh water. My design in this was,
to make the River Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any-
where about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to
meet with some European ship.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and, in
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand
upon the shore to look at us; we could also perceive they
were quite black, and naked. I was once inclined to have
gone on shore to them; but Xury said to me, " No go, no
go." However, 1 hauled in nearer the shore that I might
talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me
a good way: I observed they had no weapons in their
hands, except one, who had a long slender stick, which
Xury said was a lance, and that they could throw them a great
way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked
with them by signs as well as I could; and particularly
made signs for something to eat; they beckoned to me to
stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat. Upon
this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of
them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn. "re were willing to accept it; but how to
come at it was our next dispute, for I would not venture
on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us;
but they stood a safe way for us all, for they brought it to
the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great
Way oif till we fetched it on board, and then came close to
us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an opportunity offered that very
instant to oblige them wonderfully: for while we were
lying by the shore, came too mighty creatures with great
fury from the mountains towards the sea. The man that had
the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest
did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the
water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the negroes,
but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if
they had come for their diversion: at last one of them
began to come nearer our heat than at first I expected; but
I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all
possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the others.
As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot
him directly in the head: he immediately made to the
shore, but died just before he reached it.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun; some of
them were ready to die for fear, and fell downas dead
with the very terror ; but when they saw the creature
dead, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and came, and began to search for the
creature. By the help of a rope, which I slung round him,
and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore,
and found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and
fine to an admirable degree.

The other creature, frighted with the noise of the gun,
swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains whence
they came. I found quickly the negroes wished to eat the
flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it
as a favour from me. They offered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, pointing out that I would give it them;
but made signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely,
and brought me a great deal more of their provisions.
then made signs to them for some water, and held out one
of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that
it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They
called immediately to some of their friends, and there came
two women, and brought a great vessel; this they set down

to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars,
and filled them all three."I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, if possbll'. until the
"BVVS went back again."
I was now furnished with roots, corn, and water; and
leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven
days more, without offering to go near the shore. At
length, doubling the point, I saw plainly land on the other
side, to seaward: then I concluded that this was the Cape
de Verd, and those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de
Verd Islands. However, they were at a great distance,
and I could not tell well whatI had best do; for if I should
be taken with a. fresh of wind, I might neither reach one or

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into
the cabin, and sat down, Xury having the helm; when, on
a sudden, the boy cried out, " Master, master, a ship with a
sail!" and the foolish boy was fright-ed out of his wits,
thinking it must be some of his master's ships sent to
pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their
reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw
that it was a Portuguese ship.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by
before I could make any signal to them ; but after I had
crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems,
saw, by the help of their glasses, that it was some European
boat; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was
encouraged with this, and made them a signal of distress,
and fired a gun, both which they saw. Upon these signals
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me, and in
about three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French, but I understood none of them; but, at
last, a Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me; and I
answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that
I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at
Sallee: they then bade me come on board, and very kindly
took me in, and all my goods.

It was an inexpressihle joy to me that I was thus delivered
from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition; and
I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the
ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had
should be delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils.
" No, no," says he, " Seignor Inglese, I will carry you
thither in charity, and those things will help to buy your
subsistence there, and your passage home again."

In this proposal he was just in the performance to a tittle ;
for he ordered the seamen, that none should touch anything
that I had: then he took everything into his own posses-
sion, and gave me back an exact inventory of them.

My boat 11 as a wery good one, and he told me he would
buy it. I told him, he Uhad been so generous to me that I
could not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it
entirely to him, ' upon which he told me he would give me
a note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for:3 it. He
ofi'ered me also sixty pieces of eight mom for my boy Xury;
but I was vc11' loath to sell the poor boy's liberty, 11 he had.
assisted me so faithfully' 111 procuring my own. However,
when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and ofi'ercd that he would set him free in ten years, if he
turned Chr:istian upon this, and Katy saying he was
willing to go to him, I let the captain have him

V1 e Dhad a very good voy age to the Brazils, and I arrived
in All Saints' Bay in about twenty-two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of
all conditions of life; and what to do next with myself I
was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and
forty for the lion's skin, and caused everything I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered to me ; and what I was
will iug to sell he bought of me: in a word, I made about
two hundred and 1:11 entv pieces of eight of all my cargo ;
and 11 ith this stock I went on shore 1n ':'the Brazils.

I had not been long here before I was recommended to
the house of a good honest man, who had a plantation and
sugar-house. I lived with him some time, and acquainted
myself with the manner of planting and making of sugar;
and seeing how well the planters lived, and. how they got
rich suddenly, I resolved, it I could get a licence to settle
there, I would turn plant-er: resolving, in the meantime, to
find out some way to get my money, which I had left 'in
London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a. letter
of naturalization, I purchased as much land as my money
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and
settlement suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself
to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. My stock was low, as well as his;
and we rather planted for food than anything else, for about
two years. However, we began to increase, and our land
began to come in order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground
ready for planting canes in the year to come: but we both
wanted help; and now I found I had done wrong in parting
with Xury.

But I had no remedy but to go on: I had got into an
employment quite remote to my genius, and directly con--
trary to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house and broke through all his good advice.

I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this _
neighbour; no work to be done, but by the labour of my
hands ; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast
away upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself.

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carry-
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend the captain went
back; for the ship remained there nearly three months; when,
. telling him what little stock I had left behind me in Lon-
; don, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice :--"Seignor
Inglese," says he (for so he always called me), "if you will
giVe me letters to the person who has your money in London,
V to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall
1 direct, and in such goods as are proper for this country, I
:'i will bring you the produce of them: but I would have you

ive orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which, you
ay, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run 1' or the first ;
0 that if it come safe, you may order the rest the same

ay; and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half to
' ve recourse to for your supply."
Ti'iiis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendiy,
that I conid not but be convinced it was the best course I
could take; so I prepared letters to the gentlewoman with
whom I had left my money, and a procuration to the
Portuguese captain, as he desired.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all
my adventures, and what condition I was now in, with all
other neceSsary directions for my supply; and when this
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means to send
over, not the order only, but a full account of my story to
a merchant at London, who represented it effectually to
her: whereupon she not only delivered the money, but, out
of her own pocket, sent the Portugal captain a very hand-
some present for his humanity and charity.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds
in English goods, such as the captain had written for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all
safe to me to the Brazils: among which he had taken care
to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary
for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes made,
for I was surprised with the joy of it; and my good
steward, the captain, had laid out the five pounds, which
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to purchase
and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years'
service, and would not accept of any consideration, except
a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of
my own produce.

Neither was this all; for my goods being all English
manufacture, particularly valuable in the country, I found
means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that I
had more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was
now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour in the advance-
ment of my plantation; for the first thing I did I bought
a negro slave, and a European servant also, besides that
which the captain brought me from Lisbon.

I went on the next year with great success in my plans
tation ; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own
ground, more than 1 had disposed of for necessaries among.r
my neighbours, and these fifty rolls, being each of above anoctxsox canson. 33

bundrcdweight, were Well cured, and laid by against the
return of the fleet from Lisbon ; and now increasing in
business and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects
and undertakings beyond my reach.

To come, then, by the just degrees, to the particulars of
this part of my story :--You may suppose that having now
lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive
and prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only
learned the language, but had contracted acquaintance and
friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among the
merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that,
in my discourses among them, I had frequently giVen them
. an account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea; the
E manner of trading with the negrocs there, and how easy it
was to purchase upon the coast for trifles--such as beads,
toys, knives, scissors, hatcliets, bits of glass, and the like--
not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, 8m,
but negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related to
the buying of negroes; which was a trade, at that time, not
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been
carried on by the permission of the Kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrOssed in the public stock; so that few
negroes were bought, and those excessively dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things
very earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning,
and told me they had been musing very much upon what I
had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came
to make a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me
secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship
to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and
were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as it-
Was a trade that could not be carried on, because they could
not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they
, desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on
shore privately, and divide them among their own planta-
:-. trons; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would

go theirfisupercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
0
upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered 1119 that i
should have 1111 equal share of the 11' egroes, without. 11:1>>
riding any 11:11 t of the stock.

This was a fair proposa , had it been made to anyone
that had not had a settlement and a plantation ct" his 011:2;
to look ai'ter, which was in a fair way of coming to he 1111">>-

that was thus entered and established, and had nothing 11.1

But I, that was born to he 1113'o11'n des'rm or. could no

tainly 1101 or gone away from so prosperous an undertaking-'1
upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards,
to say nothing- of particular misfortunes to myself.

But. I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy rather than my reason; and accordingly, the shi1 1
being fitted out, the cargo furnished, and all things done,
as 111' acre clncnt, by my partners in the vovage, I went 01:
board in an e111 hour, the lst- of'cptember,1659,beinj:
the same dav eizrlit. years that I 1 cut from my tather and
mother at Hull.

Uur ship 11' as about one hundred and twenty ton-3 burden,
carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his
boy. and myself; we had on heard no large car-go of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the
neg-mes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifles,
especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets,
and. the like.

The same day I went on hoard we set sail, standing away
to the northward upon our own coast, with a design to
stretch over for the Af'ican coast. "'0 had very good weather
ti}! we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino ; whence,
Leeifingi'arther off at sea, we 10st sight of land, and steered
as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha.
in this course we passed the line in about twelve days' time,
when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of
our knowledge. It bl in such a terrible manner, that for
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and
scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate
and the fury of the winds directed.

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men die of tlu;calenture, and one man and the
hay washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather
ahating a little, the n aster made an observation as well as
he could, and found that he was upon the coast of Guiana,
and began to consult with me what course he should take,
for the ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was
going directly back to the coast. of Brazil.

E was pesitivcly against that; and looking over the
charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded
there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to,
till we came within the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and
therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes ; which, by
keeping ott' at sea, to avoid the in-draft of the bay or gulf
of Mexico, we might. easily perform, as we hoped, in about
fifteen days' sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance bot]:-
to our ship and to ourselves.

With this design, we changed our course, in order to
reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief;
but our voyage was otherwise determined; for a second
storm canie upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the way of
all human commerce, that had all our lives been saved as to
the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by
savages, than ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of
our men early in the morning cried out, "Land l" and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of
seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship
struck upon a sand, and in a moment the sea broke over in
such a manner that we expected we should all have perished ;
and we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to
shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for anyone who has not been in the like
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men
in such circumstances. "We knew not where we were, or
upon what land we were driven; and as the rage of the
wind was still great, we could not hope to have the ship
hold many minutes without breaking into pieces, unless the
winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately
about. In a word, we sat- 1ooking upon one another, and
expecting death every moment, every man preparing for
another world; for there was little or nothing more for us
to do in this; but, contrary to our expectation, the ship
did not break yet, and the master said the wind began to
abate.

New, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking
too fast for us to expect her getting ofl', we were in a dread-
ful condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of
saving our lives as well as we could. \Ve had a boat at
our stern just before the storm, but she was first stavcd by
dashing against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place,
she broke away, and either sank or was driven off to
sea; so there was no hope from her. We had another
boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no time to debate, for
we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute,
and some told us she was actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, get her
Slung over the ship's side; and getting all into her, let go,
and committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's
mercy and the wild sea.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all
saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could
not live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As
to making sail, we had none; so we worked at the oar to-
wards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going
to execution; for we all knew that when the boat came
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a. thousand pieces
by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our
souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind
driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction
with our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards
land.

After we had rowed or rather driven about a league and
a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like,
came rolling astern of us with such fury, that it overset
the boat at once ; and separating us, as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us not time to say, " 0 God!"
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I
felt when I sank into the water: for though I swam very
well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as
to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or rather
carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having
spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost
dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had so
much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing
myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon
my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as
fast as I could, before another wave should return and take
me up again; but I soon found it was impOSsible to avoid
it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill,
and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with: my business was to hold my
breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and
80, by swimming, to preserve my breathing and pilot myself
towards the shore, if possible, my greatest concern now
being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great way
touls'ar: the shore "hen it came on, might not carry me

great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and
sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look
up and thank God that my life was saved, in a case wherein
there was, some minutes before, scarce any room to hope.
.1 believe it is impossible to express, to the life, what the
ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved,
as I may say, out of the very grave.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands; and
my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in a contemplation
of my deliverance; making a thousand gestures and
motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my
comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be
one soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them
afterwards, or any sign of them, except three of their hats,
one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach
and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it
lay so far elf; and considered, Lord! how was it possible
I could get on shore?

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part
of my condition, I began to look round me, to see What
kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done:
and I soon found my comforts abate, and that I had a.
dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to
shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink; neither did
I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts: and that which
was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon,
either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance,
or to defend myself against any other creature that might
_ desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing
about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco
in a box. This was all my provision; and this threw me
into terrible agonies of mind, that for a while, I ran about a
like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began, with a
heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there
were any ravenous beasts in that country, as at night they
always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time,
was to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night,
and consider the next day what death I should die, for as
yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,
which I did to my great joy; and having drunk, and
put a little tobaeco in my mouth to prevent hunger,
I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to
place myself so as that, if I should sleep, I might not fall.
And having cut a short stick, like a truncheon, for my
defence, I took up my lodging; and having been excessively
fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I
believe, few could have done in my condition, and found
myself more refreshed with it than I think I ever was on
such an occasion.

When I waked it- was broad day, the weather clear, and
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as
before; but that which surprised me most was, that the
ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay,
by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as
far as the rock, where I had been so bruised by the wave
dashing me against it. This being within about a mile
from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upright still, I wished myself on board, that at least I might
save some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from the tree, I looked about me
again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay,
as the wind and sea had tossed her up, upon the land.
about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I
could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a
neck, or inlet, of water between me and the boat,
which was about half a mile broad; so I came back for
the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I hoped to find something for my present sni.>>
sistcncc.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the
tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter
of a mile of the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing
of my grief, for I saw that if we had kept on board, we
had been all safe: that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely
destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This
forced tears to my eyes again; butI resolved, if possible, to
get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes, and took the
water. But when I came to the ship, my difficulty was
still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay
aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I spied a small piece of rope, which
hung down by the fore-chains so low, that with great
dillieulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope I got
up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold;
but that she lay so on the side of a. bank of hard sand, that
her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low,
almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry. First, I found
that all the ship's provisions were untouched by the water.
I also found some rum in the great cabin. N ow I wanted
nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things
which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.

We had several spare yards, and two or three large spars
of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship ; I resolved
to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them
overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every
one with a rope, that they might not drive away. When
this was done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling them
to me, I tied four of them together at both ends, as well as
I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short
pieces of plank upon them, cross-ways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear
any great weight, the pieces being too light. So I went to
work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a. spare top-mast
into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing my-
self with necessaries, encorxraged me to go beyond what I
should have been able to have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how to4

l9

ROBINSON CRCSOE.

preserve what I had laid upon it- from the surf of the sea:
but I vas not long considering this. I first laid all the
plank or boards upon it that I could get, and having con-
sidered well what I most wanted, I got three of the1
sca1 111011'5 chests, which I had broken open and e111ptied,
and lowered 11.1111 11111111 1111011 1111' raft; the first of these .I
Itilled with Lil '.ead rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces cl"

tried goat' s flesh, and'1 a little 11111110110111 corn. As for
liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our

.:kipper, in which 1" ere some cordial waters ,Da11d,in all,
about five or six gall ons of 11:1 .ek. These I stewed by 1.110.111-
selves, there being no need to put them into the chest, 1111-1.-
.111y room for them. It 11 as after long searching that I
found out the carpenter's chest which was indeed a very
useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a sain-
ladine' of gold would have been at that time. I got it down
to 11w ra1t, whole as it was, without losing1 time to look 111m
it, for I knew 1n general what it contained.

My next care was for some animuuition and arms. There
were two very good fo11'li11SS__1."--pieees 111 the great cabin, and
two pistols. These 1 secured first, with some powder-horns
and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. There
were three barrels of powder in the ship, but I knew not
where our gunner had stowed them ; but with much search
I found two of them dry and good. These two I got to my
raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty
well f1'ei111hted,and began to think how I should get to
shore with them, having- nether 'ail, oar, nor rudde '; and
the least cap-full of wind 11011.11 have overset all my naviga-
tion.

I had three encourageinents: lst, a smooth, calm sea;
2ndly, the tide rising and setting; into the shore , 3rdly, what
little wind there was blew me towards the land. And thus,
having found two or three broken oars belonging to thh
boat, and beside the tools which were in the chest, two saws,
an axe, and a hannner; with this ca'go I put to sea. For
a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, onlyr that. I
found it drive a little distant from the place where I had
landed before; by which I perceived that there was some
._ndraft of the water, and consequently, I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a
little opening of the land, and I found a strong current of
the tide set into it; so I guided my raft, as well as I could,
to keep in the middle of the stream.

But here I had liked to have suffered a second shipwreck,
which, if I had, I think, verily, would have broke my heart;
for, knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at
one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at the
other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had
slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and so fallen
into the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back
against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could
not thrust oil" the raft with all my strength 3 neither (lurst
I stir from the posture I was in : but holding up the chests
with all my might, I stood in that manner near half an
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me
a little more upon a level ; and, alittle after, the water still
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the
ear 'I. had into the channel, and then driving up higher, I
at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides, and a strong current running up. I
looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, re-
solved to place myself as near the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my
raft, and at last got so near, that reaching ground with my
our, I could thrust her directly in. But here I had liked
to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that
shore lying pretty steep--there w. 3 no place to land, but
where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so
high, and the other siuk lower, as before, that it would
endanger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to wait
till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my
oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore,
near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water
would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I found water
enough, I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground,
and there moored her, by sticking my two broken oars
into the ground--one on one side, near one end, and
one on the other side, near the other end; and thus I lay
till the water ebbcd away, and left my raft and all my
cargo safe on shore.

My next 11011; was to view the country, and secka
proper place for my habitation, and 11 he1e to stow 1111
goods, to secure them from 11 hatever mwht happen. "11610
I was, I yet knew not: whether on the continent or on an
island; whet-her inhabited or not inhabited; whether in
danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hill not above
a mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, and
which seemed to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a
ridge from it northward. I took out one of the fowling-
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and
thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that
hill, where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got
to the top, I saw my fate, to my great affliction, viz., that I
was in an island environed on every side by the sea: no
land to be seen except some roeks,11h1ch lay a great way
on; and two small islands, less than this, 11inch lay about
tlu ec leagues to the 11 est.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and
uninhabited. Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their kinds, neither, when I killed them, could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back I shot
at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree, on the side
of a wood. I believe it was the first gun that had been fired
there since the creation of the world. I had no soonerfired,
than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable
number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused scream--
ing and crying, everyone according to his usual note, but
not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the
creature I killed, I took it. to be a kind of a 11.111 it, its colour
and beak 10501111)lln"' it, but it had no talons or claws
more than common. Its flesh was cariion, and fit for
nothing.

Contented with this discover ', I came back to my raft,
and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took
me up the rest of that day: what to do with myself at
night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid
to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast
might devour me.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore,
and made a kind of but for that night's lodging. As for
food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that
I had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the
wood where I shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a. great
many things out of the ship, which would be useful to me,
and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and such
other things as might come to land; and I resolved
to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible.
And as I knew that the first storm that blew must
necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all
other things apart, till I had got everything out of the ship
that I could get.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft ; and, having had experience of the first, I neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard. I brought away
several things very useful to me; as, first, in the carpenter's
stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a
great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above
all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these
I secured, together with several things belonging to the
gunner; particularly two or three iron crows, and two
barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another
fowling-pieee, with some small quantity of powder more;
a large bagfull of small shot, and a great roll of sheet-
iead; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it up to
(get it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I
could find, and a spare fore-top sail, a. hammock, and some
bedding; and with this I loaded my second raft, and
brought them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehension during my absence from
the land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on
shore ; but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor;
only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little dis-46 aomxsox 011113012.

and slept very quietly r11111ir1'1'1t, forI was very v. eary {1111.1
heavv.

I had the 1312:1051 111:1;212'1110 of all kinds now that ever

as laid up, I beliex e, 101' one man; for while the ship sat
upright, I got 01 013 thing- out of her that I could: so every
d: 1\', at low water, I went on 110:1: d, and brought awuv
':.1111et11ing or other, ' but p:1rtieula1'l_\-' the third time I went,
I. brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also
all the small ropes and rope twine I could get, with a piece
of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion,

.11d the barrel of wet gunpowder.

But that which 00111101 ted me more still, was, 1:1 st of all,
after I had made two or six v03, ages, and thought I had
nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my
meddling with, I found a. great hogshead of bread, three
large runlcts of mm, or spirits, a. box of sun 11', and a
barrel of fine flour. I soon emptied the hogs'ncad of the

'l.'
bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the
sails, which I cut out, and got all this safe on shore also.
The next day I made another voyage, and now having
plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand
our, I began with the cables, cutting the great cable into
pieces, such as I could move. I got two cables and a hawscr
on shore, with all the iron-work I could get; and having
em: down the spritsail--yard, and the mizen-yard, and every-
thing I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all
[hr-so heavy goods, and came away 3 but my good luck
began now to leave me; for this rain was so unwieldy, and
so overladen, that after I was entered the little cove, where
I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide
it so handily as I did the Other, in overset, and threw me
and all my cargo into the water; my cargo was a great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would
have been of great use to me : however, when the tide
was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and
some of the iron, though with infinite labour. After this,

--v

1 went- every day on board, and brought away What I
could get.

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship ; but preparing the twelfth
time to go on board, I found the wind began to rise; how-
ever, at low water I went on board, and though I thought
I had rumniaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more
could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in
it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and one
pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good
knives and forks: in another I found about thirty-six
pounds value in money--some European coin, some Brazil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: " 0 drug!"
said I aloud, "what art thou good for? Thou art not
worth to nae--no, not the taking off the ground: one of
those knives is worth all this heap: I have no manner of
use for thee; e'en remain where thou art, and go to the
bottom, as a creature whose life is not worth saving."
However, upon second thoughts, I took it away; and
wrapping all in a. piece of canvas, I began to think of
making another raft; but while I was preparing this, I
found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in
a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore.
It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend
to make a raft with the wind off shore; and that it was
my business to be gone before the tide of flood began,
otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.
Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam
across the channel which lay between the ship and the
sands, and even that with difiiculty enough, partly with
the weight of the things I had about me, and partly from
the roughness of the water.

But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with
all my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all
that night, and in the morning, when I looked out, behold
no more ship was to be seen!

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or wild
beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling
to make--whether I should make me a cave in or a tent
upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both; the
manner and description of which, it may not be improper
to give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settle-
ment, because it was on a low, moorish ground, near the
sea, and I believed it would not be wholesome, and more
particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I
resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot
of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation: lst, health
and fresh water; 2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun ;
3rdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or
beasts; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship
in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance.

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain
on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little
plain was steep as a house--side, so that nothing could come
down upon me from the top. 0n the side of the rock
there was a hollow place. worn a little way in, like the
entrance or door of a cave; but there was not really any
cave, or way into the rock, at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay
like a green before my door; and, at the end of it, de-
scended irregularly every way down into the low ground
by the seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so
that it was sheltered from the heat every day, till it came
to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those
countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-
diameter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter
from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driVing them into the ground till they stood very firm like
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground above five
feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows
did not stand above six inches from one another.

Then I tool: the pieces of cable which I had cut in the
ship, and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the
circle, between those two rows of stakes, up to the top,
placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against them,
about two feet and a half high, like a. spur to a post; and
this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could
get into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and
labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them
to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a
door, but by a short ladder to go over the top; which
ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me; and so I was
completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all
the world, and consequently slept secure in the night,
which otherwise I couldnot have done; though, asit appeared
afterwards, there was no need of all this caution from the
enemies that I apprehended danger from.

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried
all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition and stores, of

which ytou have the account above; and I made a large
tent, which, to preserve me from the rains that in one part
of the year are very violent there, I made double, one
smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and
covered the uppermost with a large tarpanlin, which I had
saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I
had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which had be-
longed to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every-
thing that would spoil by the wet ; and having thus
inclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till
now I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as I said,
by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug d0wn
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in
the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within
about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour and many days before all these
things were brought to perfection; and therefore I must go
back to some other things which took up some of my
thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had laid
my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave,
that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a
sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that, a great
clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not
so much surpri:e.l with the lightning as I was with the
thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning
itself : O my powder! My very heart sank within me when
I thought that, at one blast, all my powder might' be
destroyed; on which, not my dcfcnceonly, but the providing
me food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing
near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the
powder took fire, I should never have known who had hurt
me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to
separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a." The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat which
had a little kid by her."

{m ..
parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart, thatit should not
be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this
' work in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, was
divided into not less than a hundred parcels. As to the
barrel that had been wet. I did not apprehend any danger
from that; 501 placed it in my new cave, which, in my
iixney, I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
:tzarking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out
once at least every day with my gun, as well to divert my-
Sulf as to see if I could kill anything fit for food; and as
near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the island
produced. The first time I went out, I presently discovered
that there were goats in the island, which was a great
Satisfaction to me 5 but then it was attended with this mis--
fortune to me, viz., that. they were so shy, so subtle, and so
swift of foot, that it was the diflieultest thing in the world to
come at them; but I was not discouraged at this, not
doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon
happened ; for after had found their haunts a little, I laid
wait in this manner for them: I observed that if they saw
me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they
would run away, as in a terrible fright; but if they were
feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they
took no notice of me; from whence I concluded, that by
the position of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects that were
above them; so afterwards I took this method--I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark.

The first shot I made among these creatures I killed a
she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave
suck to, which grieved me heartily; for, when the old one
fell, the kid stood stock still by her, till I came and took
her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to
my inelosure ; upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to
have bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was
forced to kill it, and ate it myself. These two supplied me
with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my
provisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to
burn; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full
account of in its place; but I must now give some little ac--
count of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it
may well be supposed, were not a. few.

And now being about to enter into a melancholy rela--
tion of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never
heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its begin-
ning, and continue it in its order. It- was, by my account,
the 30th of September, when I first set foot upon this horrid
island; when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox,
was almost just over my head: for I reckoned myself by
observation to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-
two minutes north of the line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time
for want of books, and pen and ink, and should even
forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent this, I cut with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters, and making
it into a great cross, I set up on the shore where I first
landed, "I came on shore here on the 30th of September,
1659."

Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a
notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as leng-
again as the rest, and every first day of the month as long
again as that long one; and thus I kept my calender, or
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next place we are to observe that among the many
things I brought out of the ship, I got several things of
less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted
setting down before, as pens, ink, and paper; several
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's
keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical in-
struments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of naviga-
ticn; all which I huddled together, whether I might want
them or no; also I found three very good Bibles, which
came to me in my cargo from England, and which I had
packed up among my things; some Portuguese books also;
and several other books, all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and
two cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to
say something in its place; for I carried both the cats with
me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of
himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me
many years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor
any company that he could make up to me; I only wanted
to have him talk to me, but that would not do. My pens,
ink, and paper I husbanded to the utmost; and while my
ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that was
gone I could not, for I could not make ink by any means
that I could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and of
these, ink was one; as also a spade, pick-axe, and shovel,
to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread:
as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much
difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go heavily;
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished
my little pale, or surrounded my habitation. The piles or
stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a
long time in cutting and preparingin the woods, and more,
by far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two
days in cutting and bringing home one of these posts, and
a third day in driving it into the ground; for which pur--
pose, I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last
bethought myself of one of the iron crows; which, however,
though I found it, made driving those posts or piles very
laborious and tedious work. But what need I have been
concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing
I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other em-
ployment, if that had been over, at least that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food,
which I did, more or less, every day.
I now began to consider 5:11-111115'1'1111' condition, and the

or enable me to supply my--
self, even as long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that
there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable
but there was something negative or positive to be thankful
for in it.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my con-
dition, and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could
spy a ship--I began to apply myself to arrange my way
of living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a.
tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong
pale of posts and cables; but I might now rather call it a
wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about
two feet thick on the outside: and after some time (I think
it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to
the. rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees,
and such things as I could get, to keep out the rain; which
I found at some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into
the care which I had made behind me. But I must observe,
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which,
as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place; I
had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my
cave, and work farther into the earth; and when I found I
was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to
the right hand into the rock; and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out
on the side of my pale or fortification. -

This gave me not. only egress and regress, as it was aback--
way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room
to store my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few
comforts I had in the world; I could not write, or eat, or
do several things with so much pleasure, without a table :
so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that
as reason is the substance and origin of the mathematics,
so by stating and squaring everything by reason, and by
making the most rational judgment of things, every man
may he, in time, master of every mechanic art. I had never
handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labour,
application, and contrivanec, I found, at last, that I wanted
nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had tools.
However, I made abundance of things, even without tools;
and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before, and that
with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board,
I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an
edge before me, and 11er it flat on either side with my axe,
till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then club
it sat 10th with my adze. It is true that by this method I
could make but one board out of a whole tree; but this I
had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for
the prodigious deal of time and labour which it tool: me up
to make a plank or board : but my time or labour was little
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as another.

However, 1 made me a table and a chair, in the first place ;
and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I
brought on my raft from the ship. But when I had wrought
out some boards as above, I made large shelves, of the
breadth of a foot and a half, one over another all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron--work
on; and, to separate everything into their places, thatI
might come easily at them. I knocked pieces into the
wall of the rock to hang mv guns and all things that w ould
hang up: so that my cave looked like a general magazine
of all necessary things; and I had eV ch- thing so ready at
my hand, that it was a. great pleasule to me to see all 111v
goods m such orde1, and especially to find my stock of all
necessaries so great.

Having settled my household stufi' and habitation, made
me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I
could, I began to keep mv journal; of which I shall here
give you the copy (though In it VV 111 be told all those pa1-
ticulars over again) as 10110 as it lasted; for having no
more ink I V1 as torced to leave it ofi'.

THE JOURNAL.

September 30, 1659--1, poor, miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm, in the
em ng, came on shore on this dismal, unfortunate island,
which I called " The Island of Despair ;" all the rest of the
ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to: and, in
despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me:
either that I should he devoured by wild beasts, murdered
by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the
approach of night I slept in a tree for fear of wild creatures ;
but slept soundly, though it rained all night.

October 1.----In the morning I saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on
shore again much nearer the island ; which, as it was some
comfort, on one hand, for seeing her sit upright, and not
broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get
on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief ; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the
loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed
on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they
would not have been all drowned, as they were; and that,

lad the men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a
boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some
other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in '
perplexing myself on these things; but, at length, seeing
the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I
could, and then swam on board. This day also it continued
raining, though with no wind at all.

From the 1st of October to the 24th.---All these days en--
tirely spent in several voyages to get all I could out of the
ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon
rafts. Much rain also in the days, though with some
intervals of fair weather; but it seems this was the rainy
season.

Oct. 20.--I oversct my raft, and all the goods I had got
upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was
out.

Oct. 25.--It rained all night and all day, with some gusts
of wind ; during which time the ship broke in pieces, the
wind blowing a little harder than before, and was no more
to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low-
water. I spent this day in covering and securing the goods
which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

Oct. 26,--I walked about the shore almost all day, to
find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to
secure myself from any attack in the night, either from wild
beasts or men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper place,
under a rock, and marked out my encampment; which I
resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification,
made of double piles, lined within with cables, and without
with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carry-
ing all my goods to my new habitat-ion, though some part
of the time it rained exceedingly hard.

The 3lst in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country;
when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me
home, which I afterwards killed also, because it would not
feed.

November L--I set up my tent under a rock. and lay
there for the first night; making it as large as I could, with
stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.

Nov. 2.--I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed
a fence round me, a little within the place I had marked
out for my fortification.

Nov. 3.--I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls
like ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon
went to work to make me a table.

Nov. 4.--This morning I began to order my times or"
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of
diversion ; viz., every morning I walked out with my gun
for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then employed
myself to work till about eleven o'clock; then ate what I
had to live on; and from twelve till two I lay down to
sleep, the weather being excessively hot; and then, in the
evening, to work again. The working part of this day and
of the next were wholly employed in making my table, for
I was yet but a. very sorry workman, though time and

I
necessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after,
as I believe they would do any one else.

Nov. 5.--'i'his day went aboard with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild eat; her skin pretty soft,
but her flesh good for nothing; every creature that I
killed I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming
back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea--fowls, which
I did not understand; but was surprised, and almost
frightened, with two or three seals, which, while I was
gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the
sea, and escaped me for that time.

Nov. 6.--After my morning walk, I went to work with
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking;
nor was it long before I learned to mend it.

Nov. 7.--Now it began to be settled fair weather. The
7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was
Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with
much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to
please me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces
several times.

Note--I soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for,
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was
which.

Nov. 13.---This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied
with terrible thunder and lightning, which frighted me
dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over,
I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many
little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16.--'I'hese three days I spent in making
little square chests, or boxes, which might hold about
a pound, or two pounds at most, of powder 3 and so, putting
the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote
from one another as possible. On one of these three days
I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.

Nov. 17 .--This day I began to dig behind my tent into
the rock, to make room for my further conveniency.

N ote.--Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work,
via, a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so
I desisted from my work, and began to consider how to
supply that want, and make me some tools. As for the
pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper
enough, though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or
spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could
do nothing effectually without it; but what kind of one to
make I knew not.

A'ov. 18.----The next day, in searching the woods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the
131azils, they call the iron- -tree, for its exceeding hardness ,
of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my me, I
cut a piece, band brought it home, too, with diflicultv
enough, for it 11 as eweeding heav v. The excessi1e hard-
ness of the wood, and 1111' l1a1ing no other 11 a_1- , made me a
long 1111110 upon this machine, for I 11 orked it etl'eetuallv,
by little and little, into tne form of a shovel or spade, the
handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that
the board part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long; however, it. served well
enough for the uses which I had occasion to put it too.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-
barrow. A basket I could not make by any means, having
no such things as twigs that would bend to make wicker
ware--at least none 1et found out; and as to a "heel-
b.1r1owI fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that
I had no notion of' , neither did I know how to go about it ,
besides, I had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons
for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in ; so I gave it
over, and so, for carrying away the earth which I dug out
of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the
labourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayer".
This was not so diflicult to me as making the shovel: and
yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in
vain to make a11'hee1barrow,tookme up noless than fourdays.

Nov. 23.--My other work having now stood still, because
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went
on, and working every day, as my strength and time
allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening and

deepening 111v c1110, that it might hold my goods c0111-
modiously-
Note--During all this time, I worked to make this room,
or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a ware-
house, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar.
As for my lodging, I kept to the tent; except that some-
times, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard, that
I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards
to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, in
the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them
with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.

December 10.----I began to think my cave or vault finished,
when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great
quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side; so
much that it frighted me, and not without reason, too; for
if I had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger.
I had now a great deal of work to do over again, for I had
the loose earth to carry out: and which was of more im-
portance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be
sure no more would come down.

Doc. 11.-----This day I went to work" .1th it accordingly,
and got. two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with
two pieces of board across over each post; this I finished
the next day; and setting more posts up with boards, in
about a week more I had the roof secured; and the posts,
standing in rows, served me for partitions to part 011' the
house.

Dec. 17.----From this day to the 20th I placed shelves,
and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up
that could be hung up; and now Ibegan to be in some
order within doors.

Dec. 20.--Now I carried everything into the cave, and
began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of
boards like a dresser, to order my victuals upon, but boards
began to be very scarce with me: also I made me another
table.

Dec. 24.--Much rain all night and all day: no stirring
out.

Dec. 25.----Rain all day.

Dec. 26.---No rain, and the earth much cooler than
before, and pleasanter.

Dec. 27.--Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that
I caught it, and led it home in a string ; when I had it at
home, I bound and splintered 11p its leg, 11' 1. ieh was broken.

N. B --I took such care of it that it lined, and the lee:
grew 11' ell and as strong as ever. ' but by nursing it so 1011'1
itgrew tame, and fed upon the little g1een at my (low,
and would not go away. This was the first time that I
entertained a thought of breeding 11p some tame creatures;
that 1 might have food when my powder and shot was all
spent.

Dec. 98, 29, 30, 31.-----Great heats, an :1 no breeze, so
that there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening,
for food : this time I spent in putting all my things in order
within doors;

Marrow] 1--11 erV' 11' at still, but I went ab'. oad ear=v
and late 111rhn1y gun, and lav still in the middle of the

day. This evening, going: farther into the V'allovs which
lay towards the centre of the e island, I found there were
plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come
at ; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog
to hunt them down.

Jan. 2. --Aecordinglv the next day I went out with 1n}r
dog, and set him upon the goz'1ts , but I was mistaken, "for
they all faced about upon the dog, and he knew his da11.-:-er
too well, for he would not come near them.

Jan. 3.---I began my fence or wall; which, being still
jealous of my being-1' attacked by somebody, I resolved to
make 1ery thick and strong.

N. Lil--This wall beingr described before, I purposel 1r emit
what 11 as saz d 1n the Jouinal; it is sufficient to obserV e that
I was no less time than from the 3rd of January to the l-lth of
f1111il working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, then-
it was no more than about twenty-four V-ards in lenntli,
being a halt- circle, from one place 1n the rock to another
place, about eight yards from it, the door of the cam being
in the centre behind it. '

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering
me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together ; but I
thought I should never be perfectly secure till this wall was
finished; and it is scarcely credible what inexpressible
labour e1erytl1ing 11's. sclone with, especially the bringing
piles out of the woods, and driving them into the ground;
for I made them much bigger than I needed to have done.

'thn this wall was finished, and the outside double-
fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded
myself that if any people were to come on shore there they
Would not perceive anything like a habitation; and it was
very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a
very remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and made
frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other
to my advantage; particularly I found a kind of wild
pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and
taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up
tame, and did so; but when they grew older they flew
away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them,
for I had nothing to give them; however, I frequently
found their nests, and got their young ones, which were
very good meat. And now, in the managing my household
affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as, in-
deed, with some of them it was: for instance, I could
never make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or
two, as I observed before, but I could never arrive at the
capacity of making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it: I could neither put in the heads, nor join
the staves so true to one another as to make them hold
water; so I gave that also over. In the next place, I was

_ at a great loss for candles; so that as soon as ever it was
'lark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged
."o go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees'-wax with
which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had
none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when
I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added
a wick of some oakum, Imade me a lamp ; and this gave me
light, though not a. clear steady light like a candle. In the
middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging my
things, I found a. little bag, which had been filled with corn
for the feeding of poultry. The little remainder of corn

that had been in the bag was all devoured with the rats,

and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and

being willing to have the bag for some other use, I shook

the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification,
nder the rock.

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned
that I threw this stuit' away, taking no notice, and not so
much as remembering that I had thrown anything there,
when about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some few
stalks of something green shooting out of the ground,
which Ifaneied might be some plant I had not seen; but I
was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little
longer time, I saw about ten or twelve cars come out, which
were perfect green barley, of the same kind as our English
barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion
of my thoughts on this occasion; I had hitherto acted upon
no religious foundation at all: indeed, I had very few
notions of religion in my head, nor had entertained any
sense of anything that had befallen me, otherwise than as
chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God, without so
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or His order in governing events for the world.
But after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I
knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I knew
not how it came there, it startled me strangely, and I began
to suggest that God had miraculously caused His grain to
grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so
directed purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable
place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of
my eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a. prodigy
of nature shenld happen upon my account; and this was
the more strange to me because I saw near it still, all along
by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which
proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I
had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Provi-
dence for my support, but not doubting that there was
more in the place, 'I went all over that part of the island
where I had been before, peering in every corner, and
under every rock, to seek for more of it, but I could not
find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts, that I shook
a bag of chickens' meat out in that place, and then the
wonder began to cease: and I must confess, my religious
thankfulness to God's providence began to abate, too, upon
the discovering that all this was nothing but what was
common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so
strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence to
me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains
of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had de-
stroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven;
as also, that I should throw it out in that particular place,
where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up
immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else, at
that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June; and,
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again,
hoping, in time, to have some quantity sufficient to supply
me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I
could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even
then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order;
for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not observing
the proper time; for I sowed it just before the dry season,
so that it never came up at all, at least not as it would have
done: of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care
and for the same use, to make me bread, or rather food;

for I found ways to cook it without baking, though I did
that also after some time.

But to return to my J ournal:

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up,
contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over the wall.

by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of
my habitation.
5"N ...-.. A

 

66 ROBINSON GRUSOL'. '

April l6.--I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down
in the inside: this was a complete inclosure to me; for
within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me
from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had
almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself
killed; the case was thus :--As I was busy in the inside,
behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was
terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing
indeed: for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come
crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the
edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had
set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I
was heartily scared; thinking that the .top of my cave was
fallen in, as some of it had done before: and for fear I
should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not
thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for
fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll
down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the
firm ground, than I plainly saw it was a, terrible earthquake; -
for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight
minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have
Overturned the strongest building that could be supposed
to have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of
a rock, which stood about half a mile from me, next the
sea, fell down, with such a terrible noise as I never heard
in all my life. I perceived also the very sea was put into
violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were
stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt
the like, nor discoursed with anyone that had, I was
like one dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth
made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but
the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were,
and rousing me from the stupified condition I was in,
filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but
the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods,

and burying all at once; and this sunk my very soul
within me a second time.ogt'he posts I had set up cracked in a fnghtful manner."
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for
so: no time, Ibegan to PS11110 courage; and yet I had not
11ez11t enough to go 0101' my wall again, for fear of being
buried ali1e, but sat still upon the ground greatly cast
11 11111 an d 111 seonsolate, not knowing what to do. All this
while, I had not the least serious religious thought, nothing
1:11L PS110 common "Lord have, mercy upon me!" and when
it was over, that went away too.

While ls sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grew
01111' 1, as it it would r1111; soon after that, the wind arose
vliu'lc and little, so that 111 less than half an hour it blew
11 1110std1'cad'1ul hurricane: the sea was, all 011 a sudden,
covered over with foam and froth; the shore was covered
with the breach of the water; the trees were torn up by
the roots; and a terrible storm it was. This held about
three hours, and then began to abate; and in two hours
more it was quite cahn, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified
:11111 dejected; when 011 a sudden it came into my thoughts,
that these winds and rain being the consequences of the
earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, andI
might Venture into my cave again. With this thought, my
spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to per-
511111101110, I went in and sat down in my tent; but the
rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
11111111 wlit 1 it; and I was forced to go into mv cave, though
'-' e '1'11'111c'11 afraid an 1 uneasv, for fear it should 1' 111 on 1111'
head This violent rain lorccd me to a new work, 1'iz., to

1 a hole through my new fortification like a sink, to let the
water go out, which would else have flooded my cave.
After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still

1.11 more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be
211 ore composed. And now to support my spirits, which
indeed wanted 11'; very much, I went to my little store and
wot a small sup of 111111; which, however, I did then and
.1111 11's 1e1) sparingly, know mg I could have no more when
that 11115 gone. It continued raining all that night, and
grc .11; part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad;
hut 111v mind being more composed, I began to think 01'
11 hat 1 had best do: concluding, that if the island was sub-

ject to these earthquakes, there 11 ould be no living for me
111 a care, but I must consider of building a little hut in
an open place, which I might. surround 111th a wall, as I
had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men , for I concluded if I sta1 ed where I was, I should
certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

\V it11 these thoughts I resolved to re1n01e my tent from
the place where it now stood, which was just under the
hanging precipice of the hill; a11d11hieh, if it should be
shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent; and I
spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of A111 11
in contm 111" 1111010 and 11011' to 1emo1e my habitation.
The fear of being s11 1111011 ed up alive made me that I ne1 e1
slept 111 quiet; and 1et the apprehension of 11mg 11111-10111
without. any fence as almost equal to it: but still, 11 hen I
looked about, and saw how everything was put in order,
how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger,
in made me very loath to remove. In the meantime, it
occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of time for
me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture where
I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had
secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I
composed myself for a time; and resolved that I would
go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and
cables, &c., in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it,
when it was finished; but that I would venture to stay
where I was till it was finished and fit to remove. This
was the 2181:.

Ap7'2'122.--The next morning I began to consider of
means to put this resolve into execution; but I was at
a great less about 1111 tools. I had three large axes, and
abundance of hatchets, but with much chopping and cutting
knotty ha1d wood, [1101 wow all full of notches, and dulla;
and though I had a <<1 1ndstone, I could not turn it and
grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a.
statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of
politics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At
length I contrived a wheel with a string to turn it with my
foot, that I might. have both my hands at liberty.

April 28, 29. --Tl1esc two whole days I took up in grind-
iug my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone
performing very well.

April 30.---Having perceived my bread had been low a
great while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself
to one biscuit a day, which made my heart very heavy.

ilIa-g/ 1.--In the morning, looking towards the sea side,
the tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore
bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I
name to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces
01' the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the
late hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself,
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it
used to do. I examined the barrel which was driven on
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it
had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a.
stone; however, I rolled it fart-her on shore for the present,
and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship to look for more.

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed. The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was
heaved up at least six feet, and the stern, which was broke in
pieces and parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon
after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up,
and east on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on
that side next. her stern, that whereas there was a great
place of water before, so that I could not come within a
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was
surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must be
done by the earthquake; and by this violence the ship was
more broke open than formerly, so many things came
daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the
rinds and water rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of
removing my habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that
day especially, in searching whether I could make any way
into the ship ; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with
sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of any-
thing, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of70 Romxsox CRUSOE.

the ship, concluding that everything I could get :rom her
would be of some use or other to me.

Jfay 3.---I began with my saw, and cut apiece of a
beam through, which I thought hold some of the upper
part or quarter deck 1: )gcther, and when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from
the side which lay highest: but the tide coming in, I was
obliged to give over for that time.

may 4,--1 went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport ; when, just going
to leave off, I caught; :1 young dolphin. I had made me u.
long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks; yet
I frequently caught lish enough, as much as I cared to eat;
all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.

Illa-3] 7.~--Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself
down, the beams being cut; that several pieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold lay so open
that I could see into it, but it was almost full of water and
sand.

BIay 8.--Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crew
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the
water or sand. I wrcnehed open two planks, and brought
them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in
the wreck for the next day.

May 9.--\\'eut to the wreck, and with the crow made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt seve 'al easlis, and
loosened them with the crew, but could not break them up.
I felt also a roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it
was too heavy to remove.

3103/ 10, LIL--Went. every day to the wrect; and g-n
a great many pieces of timber and boards or plank, and
two or three hundrcdweight of iron.
may 15.--I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not.
out a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one
hatchet and driving it with the other; but as it lay about
a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow
in drive the hatchet.

Elfin] 16.--lt had blown hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I
stayed so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food, that
the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day.

May 17.--I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore, at a great distance, near two miles oll' me, but
resolved to see what they were, and found it was a piece of
the lead, but too heavy for me to bring away.

Min] BL--Evcry day, to this day, I worked on the
wreck; and with hard labour I loosened some things so
much with the crow, that the first blowing tide several
easks floated out, and two of the seamcu's chests; but the
wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that
day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some
Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and the sand had spoiled
it. I continued this work every day to the 15th of June,
except the time necessary to get food, which I always
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when
due tide was up, that I might be ready when it cbbcd out;
and by this time I got timber and plank, and iron-work,
enough to have built a good heat, if I had know how ; and
also I got at several times, and in several pieces, near one
lmndredweight of the sheet-lead.

June 16.--Going down to the sea-side, I found a large
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it
seems, was only my misfortunemot any defect of the place, or
scarcity ; for had I happened to be on the other side of the
island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, as I
found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for
them.

June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her
three score eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time,
:he most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life,
having had no flesh, but. of goats and fowls, since I landed
in this horrid place.

June 18.--I'.ained all day, and I stayed within. I
thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was some-
thing chilly , which I knew was not usual in that latitude.

June 19. --Very ill and shivering, as if the n eather had
been cold.

June 20.---No rest all night; violent pains in my head,
and very feverish.

June 21.--Very ill; frighted almost to death with the
apprehension of my sad condition--to be sick, and no
help; prayed to God, for the first time since the storm ot'i'
Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why; my thoughts
being all conii.15ed

June 22.--A little better; but under dreadful apprehen-
sions of sickness.

June 23.-----V'ery had again; cold and shivering, and then
a. violent headache.

June 24.--1\Iucl1 better.

June '25.-An ague very violent: the fit held me seven
hours: cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.

June 26.--Better; and having no victuals to eat, took
my gun, but found myself very weak: however, I killed a
she-goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled
some of it, and ate. I would i'ain have stewed it, and made
some broth, but had no pot.

June 2".---'I'lle ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all
day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for
thirst; but so weak, 1 had not strength to stand up, or to
get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but
was light-headed 5 and when I was not, I was so ignorant-
that I knew not what to say: onlyI lay and cried, " Lord,
look upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon-
me'." I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours:
till the fit "'8'111110' 011', I fell asleep, and did not wake till
far in the night. \l hen I awoke, I found myself much
refreshed, but weak and exceeding thirst 7; however, as I
had no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till-
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I
had this terrible dream: I thought that I was sitting on
the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when
the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man
descend from a great black cloud, in a. bright flame of fire,
and light upon the ground: he was all over as bright as a
flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him:
his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible
for words to describe; when he stepped upon the ground
with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had
done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to
my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved
forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his
hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground at
some distance, he spoke to me--or I heard a voice so
terrible that itis impossible to express the terror of it. All
that I can say I understood was this :---" Seeing all these
things have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt
die ;" at which words I thought he lifted up the spear that
was in his hand to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision. I mean, that even while it was a dream, I
even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind
when I awaked, and found it was but a. dream.

I had, alas! no divine knewledge. What I had received
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by
an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring wicked-
ness, and a constant conversation with none but such as
were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. I
do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought
that so much as tended either to looking upwards "towards
God, or inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways;
but a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or
conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me; and I
was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature
among our common sailors are supposed to be: not having
the least sense, either of the fear of God, in danger, or of
Ilzankfulness to God, in deliverance.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all
m y ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised
with a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which,
had the grace of God assisted, might have come up to true
thankfulncss; but it ended where it began, in a mere
common flight of joy, without the least reflection upon the
distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved
me, and had singled me out to be preserved when all the
rest were destroyed. Even when I was, afterwards, on due
consideration, made sensible of my condition, how I was
cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon
as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I should not
starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction
w ore oti' , and I began to be very easy, applied In} selt to
the works proper for 1113' preservation and supply, and was
far enough from being atllieted at my condition, as ajudg-
ment from Heaven, or as the hand of God againsn me:
these were thoughts which very seldom entered my head.

But to return to my Journal:

June 23.--Having been somewhat refreshed with the
sleep Ihad, and the fit being entirely 013', I got up; and
though the fright and terror of m\ dre cam w as verv grt at,
v et I considered that the fit of the aguc would return again
:l1e next dav, and now u as mv time to get somethingr to
refresh and support 1113- self when I should be ill, and the
first thing I did, I filled a large square case- -bottle with
water, and set it upon my table, 1n reach of my bed; and
to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I
put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed
them together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh,
and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I
walked about, but 'was very weak, and withal very sad and
heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable condition,
dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At
night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I
roasted in the ashes, and ate in the shell, and this was the
first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, that I
could remember, in my whole life. After I had eaten, I
tried to walk, but found myself so weak, that I could
hardly carry a gun, for I never went- out without that, so I
went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground,
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and
Ker" calm and smooth. Some such thoughts as these
occurred to me: God knows that I am here, and am in this
dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without His
appointment, He has appointed all that is to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these
conclusions, and therefore it rested upon me with the
greater force, that it must needs be that God had appointed
all this to befall me ; that I was brought into this miserable
circumstance by His direction, He having the sole power,
not of me only, but of everything that happened in the
world. Immediately it followed--Why has God done this
to me? What have I done to be thus used? My con--
science presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had
blasphemod, and methought it spoke to me like a voice,
"' Wretchl dost then ask what thou hast done ? Look
"back upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself, what
thou hast not done? Ask, why is it that thou wert not
long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in
Yarmouth Roads; killed in the fight when the ship was
taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured by the wild
beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned [(6113, when all
the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou ask, what have I
done?" 1 was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say--no, not to answer
to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my
retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going
to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had
no inclination to sleep: so I sat down in my chair, and
lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now. as the
apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me
very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brazilians
take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers,
and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests,
which was quite cured, and some also that was green, and
not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt, for in this chest I
i'ound a cure for both soul and body. I opened the chest,
and found what I looked for, the tobacco: and as the few
books I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles
which I mentioned before, and which to this time I had not
found leisure, or inclination, to look into. What use to
make of the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or
whether it was good for me or no; but I tried several
experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one
way or other. I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it
in my mouth, which, indeed, at first, almost stupified my
brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had
not been much used to. Then I tool: some and steeped it.
an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of
it when I lay down ; and, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of
coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as
I could bear it, as well for the heat, as almost for suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible and
began to read, but my head was too much disturbed with
the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time: only,
having opened the book casually, the first words that
occurred to me were these, " Call on me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
These words were very apt to my case, and made some im-
pression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them,
though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for
being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say, to
me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my appre-
hension of things, that I began to say as the children
of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, " Can
God spread a table in the wilderness ?" so I began to say,
" Can God Himself deliver me from this place 1'" And as
it was not for many years that any hopes appeared, this
prevailed very often upon my thoughts ; but however, the
words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon
them very often. It grew now late,and the tobacco had dozed
my head so much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in
the night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I did
what I had never done in all my life ; I kneeled down,
and prayed to God, to fulfil the promise to me, that if I
called upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I
drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco ; which
was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that I could scarcely
get it down ; immediately upon this I went to bed. I found
presently it flew up into my head violently ; but I fell into
a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must
necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the next
day; nay, to this hour, I am partly of opinion, that I slept
all the next day and night, and till almost three the day
after: for otherwise, I know not how I should lose a day
out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared
some years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing
and recrossingtheLine,Ishould have lest more than one day;
but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew
which way. Be that, however, one way or the other, when
I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my
spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up I was stronger
than I was the day before, and my stomach better, for
I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day,
but continued much altered for the better. This was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a.
sea~fow1 or two, something like a brand goose, and brought
them home; but was not very forward to eat them; soI
ate some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good.
This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had sup--
posed did me good the day before, the tobacco steeped in
rum; only I did not take so much as before, nor did I
chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;
however, I was not so well the next day, which was the 151:
of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little
spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.

July 2.--I renewed the medicine all the three ways;
and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity
which I drank.

July 3.--I missed the fit for good and all, though I did
not recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I
was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly
upon this Scripture, "Iwill deliver thee ;" and the ini-
possibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in
bar of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging
myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I
pored so much upon my deliverance from the main affliction,
that I disregarded the deliverance I had received; andI1 '1')

was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions as these,
viz. : Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too. from
sickness? from the mest distressed condition that could be,
and that was so frightful to me? and what notice had
I taken of it '? Had I done my part? God had delivered
me, but I had not glorified Him; that is to say, I had not
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance: and
how could I expect greater deliverance? This touched my
heart very much; and inunediately I knelt down, and gave
thanks aloud for my reeeverv from my sickness.

July-1' 4.----Iu the 11101-11i11g. I tool: the Bible , and begin-
ning at the l\ew Testament, I began seriously to read it,
and imposed upon 111v self to i'ead awhile every mornintr and
e1ery night; not. tying 1111 selt to the number of chapters,
but as long as my thongl .115 should engage me. It was not
long after I set seriously to this 11 01-11, 3till I found my heart;
more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of
my past life. The impression of my dream revived ; and
the words, " All these things have not brought thee to re-
pentance," 1am seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly
begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened
providentially, the very day that, reading the Scripture, I
came to these words. " He is exalted a. Prince and a
Saviour, to give repentance and to give remission." I
threw down the book; and with my heart as well as my
hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ocstacy of joy, I
cried out aloud, "Jesus, then son of David! Jesus, thou
exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance!" This
mm the first time I could say, in the true sense of the
words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with
a sense of my condition, and with a true Scripture view of
hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of God;
and hem this time, I may say, I began to have hope that
(zed 11 ould hear me.

New I began to construe the words mentioned above,
"Call on Me, and I will deliver thee," in a difl'erent sense
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no notion
of anything being called dei'ircrancc, but my being delivered
from the captivity I was in: for though I was indeed at
large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison 11.1
me, and that in the worst sense in the world. But now I
learned to take it in another sense; now I looked back
upon- my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my
comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not
so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it
was all of no consideration in comparison to this. And I
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that
whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will
find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than de-
liverance from afiliction.

But, leaving this part, I return to my Journal :--

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and
a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his
strength after a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to be
imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was
reduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly
new, and perhaps which had never cured an ague before;
neither can I recommend it to any one to practise by this
experiment: and though it did carry off the fit, yet it
rather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent
convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time; I
learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my
health that could be, especially in those rains which came
attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the
rain which came in the dry season was almost always
accompanied with such storms, so I found that rain was
much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September
and October.

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten
months: all possibility of deliverance from this condition
seemed to be entirely taken from me; and Ifirmly believed
that no human shape had ever set foot upon that place.
Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to
my mind, I had a great desire to make a. more perfect dis-
covery of the island, and to see what other productions I
might find. which I yet knew nothing of.80 110131115011 causes.

It was on the 15111 of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek
first, where I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I
came about two miles up, that the tide (lid not flow any
higher; and that it u as no more than a little brook of
runninn- water, 1cr_1 fresh and good; but this being the
dry season, there 11 as hardlv any water in some parts =,of it.
011 the banks ot this brook, I found many pleasant
sa1-annahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and eo1ered with
grass: and 011 the rising parts of them, next to the higher
grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, never
o1'ert'l011ed,I found a g11~at deal of tobacco, green, and
growing to a great and 1ery strong stal' .: , there w 010
divers other plants, which I had no anotion of or under-
standing about, that might perhaps have virtues of their
own, which I could not find out. I searched for the
cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make
their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of
aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar--
canes, but 11i1d,a11d for 11 ant of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and
came back, musing with myself what course I might take
to know the 1irtue and goodness of any of the fruits 01
plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no
conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation
while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants
in the field, that might serve me to any purpose now in my
distress.

The next dav, the 161l1, I went up the same 11 av again;
and after going somethinei farther than I had gone the day
before, I found the b10011 and savannahs cease, and the
country became more woody. In this part I found difi'erent
fruits, and particulailv melons upon the ground, in great
abundance, and grapes upon the trees; _the 1 ines had sp1ead
o1 er the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in
their prime, 1e1y ripe and rich. This was a surprising
discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them ; but I was
warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remem-
bering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of
grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were slaves
there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. But I
found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to
cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapesI
or raisins are kept, which I thought would be wholesome
and agreeable to eat, when no grapes could be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation, which, by the way, was the first night, as I
might say, I had lain from home. In the night, I took my
first contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well;
and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery,
travelling nearly four miles, as I mirrht judge by the length
of the valley, keeping still due nort 1, with a ridge of hills
on the south and north side of me. At the end of this
march, I came to an opening, where the country seemed to
descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water,
which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the

' other way; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure, that
it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on
the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a. kind of
secret pleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting
thoughts, that this was all my own; that I was king and
lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a. right of
possession; and, if I could convey it, I might have it in
inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange
and lemon, and citron trees; but all wild, and very few
hearing any fruit. However, the green limes that I
gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very whole--
some ; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which
made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I
found new I had business enough, to gather and carry
home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season,
which I knew was approachinv. In order to do this, I
gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap
in another place, and a. great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a. few of each with me, I travelled
home-wards; and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or
Sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest heme. Ao-

6
cordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came
home (so I must now call my tent and my cave), but before
I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the
fruit, and the weight of the juice, having broken them and
bruised them, they were good for little or nothing: as to
the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made
me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was
surprised, when coming to my heap of grapes, which were
so rich and fine when I gathered them, I found them all
spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here,
some .there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this,
I concluded there were some \\ ild creatures thercabouts,
which had done this; but what they were, I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be
crushed with their own weight, I took another course; for
I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them
upon the out branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and the lemons,
I carried as many back as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on
that side the water, and the wood: and concluded that I
had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by far
the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began
to consider of removing my habitation; and looking out
for a place equally safe as where now I was situate, if
possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the place
tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view of it, I
considered that I was now by the sea side, where it was at
least possible that something might happen to my advantage;
and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither, might
bring some other unhappy wrctehes to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thing should
eVel' happen, yet to inclose myself among the hills andturned home with three

my cat re
kittens "

" To my astonishment
woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove. However, I was so enamoured of this
place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole of
the remaining part of the. month of July, and though, upon "
second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a. '
little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with .
a strong, fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could
reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood; and
here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights to-
gether; always going over it with a ladder; so that I
Janeied now I had my country house and my sea--coast
house; and this work took me up to the beginning of
August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy
my labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick close
to my first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like
the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well,
yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, _
nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were
extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished
my bower and began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August,
I found the grapes I had hung up perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins; so I began to take them
down from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so,
for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and
I had lest the best part of my winter food; for I had above
two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I
taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my
care, but it began to rain; and from hence, which was the
ch of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the
middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could
not stir out of my cave for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of
my family: I had been concerned for the loss of one of my
cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been
dead, and I heard no more tidings of her till, to my astonish-
ment, she came home about the end of August with three
kittens. This was the more strange to me, because, though
I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I
thought it was quite a different kind from our European cats ;
but the young cats were the same kind of house--breed as
the old one; and both my cats being females, I thought it
very strange. But- from these three cats I afterwards came
to be so pestercd with cats, that I was forced to kill them like
vermin or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as
much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be
much wet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened
for food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat;
and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was regulated
thus :----I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece
of the goat's flesh, or of the tultle, for my dinner, broiled,
for I had no \essel to boil or stew anything , and two or
three of the turtles eggs for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by de-
grees worked it on towards one side, till I came to the
outside of the hill, and made a door or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out
this uav. But I w as not perfectly easy at lying so open;
for, as I had managed my self before, I was in a perfect
inclosure; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed, and open
for anything to come in upon me; and Vet I could not.
perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest
creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.

Sept. 30.--I was now come to the unhappy anniversary
of my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and
found I had been on shore three hundred and sixty--five
days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, even till the going
down of the sun; I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it,
with religious exercise. I had all this time observed no
Sabbath-day; for as at first I had no sense of religion upon
my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the
Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the
days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I
found I had been there a year, so I divided it into weeks,
and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I
found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink began to fail
me, and so I contented myself to use it more sparingly,
and to write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a. daily memorandum of other
things.

The rainy season and the dry season now began to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide
for them accordingly; but I bought all my experience
before I had it, and this I am going to relate was one of
the most discouraging experiments that I made.

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley
and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I
thought of themselves, and I believe there were about
thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now
I thought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the
sun being in its southern position, going from me. Ac-
cordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could
with my wooden spade, and dividing it in two parts, I
sowed my grain ; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred
to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, because
I did not know when was the proper time for it, so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of
each. It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did
so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to
anything; for the dry months following, the earth having
had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to
assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet
season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been
but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grew,
which I easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for
a moister piece of ground to make another trial in, and I
dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal
equinox; and this having the rainy months of March and
April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a
very good crop; but having part of the seed left only, and
not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity
at last, my whole crop not amounting to half a peek of
each kind. But by this experiment I was made master of
my business, and knew exactly when the proper season was
to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times and two
har1ests e1'e1y year.

\\ hile this corn 11 as growing, I made a little disco1 er1',
which 11 as 01 use to me D'aitcrwards. As soon as the rains
were over, and the weather began to settle, which was
about the month of November, I made a visit up the
countr 1' to 111V 11011 or 11 here, though I had not been some
months, vet I found all things just as I left them. The
ei1ele or double hedge that I had made was not only firm
and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some
trees that grew thereahouts, were all shot out and grown
with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots
the first year after lopping its head. I was surprised, and
yet very well pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I
pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike as I
could; and it is s 'arce credible how beautiful a figure they
grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty~iive yards in diameter, yet the trees
soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sutlieient to
lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to
cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in 11,
semi-circle round the wall of my first dwelling, which I did ;
and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about
eight yards' distance from my first fence, they e'icw
preseuth, and 11 ere at hrs t a fine cover to my habitation,
and afterwards ser1 ed tor a defence also, as I shall observe
in its order.

1 found now that the seasons of the year might generally
be divided, not into sunnner and winter, as in Europe, but
into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were
generally thus 1---

The half of February, the whole of March, and the
half 01' April--rainy, the sun being then 011 or near the
equi: 10.\.

The half of April, the 11 hole of May, June, and July, a1
the half of August--dry, the sun being then to the north
of the Line.

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half
of October--rainy, the sun being then come back.

The half of October, the whole of November, December,
and January, and the half of February--dry, the sun being
then to the south of the Line.

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow, but this was the general
observation I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill
consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care
to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might
not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as
possible (luring the wet months. This time I found much
employment, and very suitable also to the time, for I found
great occasion for many things which I had no way to
furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant appli-
cation; particularly I tricd many ways to make myself a
basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved
so brittle that they would do nothing. It proved of
excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I
used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's,
in the town where my father lived, to see them make their
wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious
to help, and a great observer of the manner in which they
worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had
by these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I
wanted nothing but the materials, when it came into my
mind that the twigs of that tree whence I cut my stakes
that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows,
and osiers in England, and I resolved to try. Accordingly,
the next day I went to my country-house, as I called it,
and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my
purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the
next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity,
which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them.
These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when
they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave; and here,
during the next season, I employed myself in making,
as well as I could, a great many baskets, both to carry or to
lay up anything, as I had occasion ; and though I did not
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently
serviceable for my purpose; and thus, afterwards, I took
care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware
decayed, I made more, especially strong deep baskets
to place my corn in, inst-cad of sacks, when I should come
to have any quantity of it.

Havimr mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to
supply two wants. I had no vessel to hold anything that
was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of
rum, and some glass bottles--some of the common size, and
others, which were case-bottles, square, for the holding of
water, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil any-
thing, except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship,
and which was too big to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I fain would have had
was a. tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible to make one;
however, I found a contrivance for that, too, at last. I em-
ployed myself in planting my second rows of stakes
or piles and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry
season, when another business took me up more time than
it could be imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and
so on to where I built my bower, and where I had an
opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I
now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that
side; 50, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and
a larger quantity of pewder and shot than usual, with two
biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for
my store, I began my journey. When I had passed the val-s,
where my bower stood, as above, I came within View of the
sea to the west, and it being a. very clear day, I fairly
descried land, at a very great distance; by my guess,
it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues ofi'.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America, and,
as I concluded, by all my observations, must be near
the Spanish dominions.
After some thought upon this afi'air, I considered that, if
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one
time or other, see some vessel pass or repass one way or
other; but if not, then it was the savage coast between the
Spanish country and Brazils, where are found the worst of
savages.

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely for-
ward; I found that side of the island where I now was
much pleasantcr than mine---the savannah fields sweet,
adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very fine woods.
I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to
speak to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young
parrot, for I knOcked it down with a stick, and having
recovered it, I brought it home; but it was some years be-
fore I could make him speak; however, at last I taught
him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the
accident that followed, though it he a. trifle, will be very
diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found
in the low grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and
foxes; but they differed greatly from all the other kinds I
had met with, nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though
I killed several. But I had no need to be venturous, for I
had no want of food, and of that which was very good, too,
especially those three sorts, viz. : goats, pigeons, and turtle,
or tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall-market
could not have furnished a table better than I, in propor-
tion to the company.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles out-
right in a day, or thereahouts; but I took so many turns
to see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary
enough to the place where I resolved to sit down all night;
and then I either reposecl myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes set upright in the ground, from
one tree to another, so that no wild creature could come at
me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the
island, for here, indeed, the shore was covered with
innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other side I had found
but three in a year and a half; Here was also an infinite
number of fowls of many kinds, some I had seen, and some
1 had not seen before, and many of them very good meat,
hut such as I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins.

I could l1a1e shot as many as I pleased, but was verv
sparing of my pow 1hr and shot, and therefore had more
mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could better food
011; and though there were many goats here--more than on
my side the island, yet it was with much more ditliculty
that I could come near them, the country being flat and
even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the
hill.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter
than mine; but yet I had not the least inclination to
remove, for as I was fixed in my habitation it became
natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here to he,
as it were, upon a journey, and from home. However, I
travelled along the shore of the sea towards the cast, I sup-
pose about twelve miles, and then, setting up a great pole
upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again, and that the next journey I took should be on the
other side of the island eastfrom my dwelling, and so round
till I came to my post again.

I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep all the island so 11111011211
111v 1ie11', that Icould not miss finding my dwelling by
1iewing the country; but I tonnd mvselt mistaken, for,
beinl1 come about two or tlnee miles, I found 111151111
lescended into a wry. l11r5: e1allo1', but so surrounded with
hills, and those hills cov tired \11th wood, that I could not
see which was 1111' 11'111' by anv direction but that 01 the sun,
1101- even then, uhless I knew 1'er1' well the position of the
sun at that time of the day. It happened, to my further
111isfo1'tune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four
days while I was in the valley, and not being able to see
the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at. last
was obliged to find the sea-side, look for my post, and come
back the same way I went; and then, by my journeys,
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and
ply gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very
leavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a. young kid, and seized
upon it, and I, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and
saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it
home if I could, for I had often been musing whether it
might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a
breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my
powder and shot should be all spent. I made a collar for
this little creature, and with astring, which I made of some
rope-yarn, which I always carried about with me, I led him
along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my
bower, and there I incloscd him and left him, for I was
very impatient to be at home, whence I had been absent
above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come
into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed.
This little wandering journey, without any settled place of
abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house,
as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me com-
pared to that; and it rendered everything about me so
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a great way
from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself
after my long journey; during which, most of the time
was taken up in the weighty afl'air of making a cage for my
Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to be well
acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor
kid which I had penned in within my little circle, and re-
solved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food;
accordingly, I went, and found it where I left it, almost
starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees,
and branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it
over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had
no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog; and
as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so
gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time one ofmy
domestics also, and would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn
111' .'11111e1 as befo1 e, being the anniversary of 111v landing on the
island, having now been there two years, and no mo e
prospect of being deh1ercd than the first day I came there.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much 111o1e
happy this life I now lead 11 as, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all
the past part of my days; and 110111 I changed both my
sorrows and mv jovs' , mvvervdesires altered, my affections
changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new
from awhat they new at my first coming ,or, indeed, for the
two years past.

I began to exercise n11} self with new thoughts; I daily
read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to
my present state. One morning, being 1-' cry sad, I opened
the Bible upon these words, "I will never, ne1-er leave
thee, nor forsake thee", immediately it occurred that these
words were to me; why else should they be directed
in such a manner, just at the moment 11l1e11 I was mourn-

in<r o1er my condition, as one forsaken of God and man 9
" IV ell, then," said I," if God does not forsake me, of what
ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the
world should all forsake me? seeing, 011 the other hand, if
I had all the world, and should lose the favour and blessing
of God, there would be no comparison in the loss."

From this moment I began to conclude' 111 my mind that
it was possible for me to be more happy' in this forsaken,
solitary condition, than it was probable I should ever 111110
been 111 any other particular state in the 11"'o11d , and, with
this thought, I was gomg to give thanks to God for bring-

ing me to this place. I Dknow not what it was, but some-
thing shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not.
speak the words. " How canst thou become such a
hypocrite," said I, even audiblv, "to pretend to be thankful
for a condition, which, however thou 111111 est endeavour to
be contented 111th, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to he
delivered from 9" So I stopped there, but though I could
not say I thanked God for being there, vet I sincerelyo gave
thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting
providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the
Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God
for directing my friend in England, without any order of
mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me
afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

In this disposition of mind, I began my third year ; and
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so
particular an account of my works this year as the first, yet
in general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle;
but having regularly divided my time according to the
several daily employments that were before me, such as,
first, my duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures,
which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice every day ;
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, which
generally took me up three hours in every morning, when it
did not rain 5 thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and
cooking, whatIkillcd or caught for my snpply- these took up
great part of the day ; also, it is to be considered, that in
the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the
violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about
four hours in the evening was all the time I could be
supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I
changed my hours of hunting and working, and went to
work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.

To this short time for labour may be added the exceed-
ing laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for
the want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, every-
thing I did took up out of my time; for example, I was
full two and forty days in making a board for a long shelf
which I wanted in my cave; avhereas, two sawyers, with
their tools and a saw-pit, would have out six of them out of
the same tree in half a day.

My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to
be cut. down, because my board was to be a broad one. This
tree I was three days in cutting down, and two more
cutting ofi' the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of
timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing. I reduced
both the sides of it into chips till it began to be light
enough to move; then I turned it, and made one side of
it smooth and flat as a board from end to end; then, turn-
ing that side downward, cut the other side, till I brought
the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on
both sides. Any one may judge the labour in such a piece
of work, but labour and patience carried me through that,
and many other things, as will appear by what follows.

I was now, in the months of November and December,
expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured and dug up for them was not great; for, asI
observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of
half a peck, but now my crop promised very well, when on
a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarcely possible to
keep from it; as, first the goats, and wild creatures which
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay
in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and ate it so
close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure
about it with a hedge; which I did with a great. deal of
toil and the more because it required speed. However,
as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got
it totally well fenced in about three weeks' time; and
shooting some of the creatures in the day-time, Iset my
dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at
the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long; so,
in a little time, the enemies forsook the place, and the corn
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were likely to ruin me now, when
it was in the ear; for, going along by the place to see how
it throve, I saw my little crap surrounded with fowls, of I
know not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them,
for I always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot,
but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not
seen at all, from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few
days they would devour all my hopes; that I should he
starred, and never be able to raise a crop at all, and what
to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not to lose my
com, if possible, though I should watch it night and dav.
I 11 the first place, I went among it, to see what damage 111121
aheady done, and found they had spoiled a good deal
of it , but that as it was yet too green for them, the loss
1 as not so great, but that the remainder was likely to be a
good c1',op if it could be saved.

I sta1 ed by it to load myg 1run, and then coming away, I
could easily see the thie1cs sitting upon all the trees about
me, as if they only waited till ID was gone away, and the
e1e11t pro1 ed it to he so; for as I walked off, as if I was
some, I 11:15 no sooner out of their sight, than they dropped
do" 11 one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked,
that I could not have patience to stay till more came on,
knowing that every grain they ate now was, as it might be
said, a peek-loaf to me in consequence; but, coming up to
the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This
was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them
as we serve notorious thieves in England--hanged them in
chains, tor a terror to others. It is impossibleD to imagine
that this should have such an efl'ect as it had, for the fowls
11 011111 not only not come at the corn, but,1n short, they for-
sook all that part of the island, and I could never see a yhird
near the place as long as my scare-crows hung there. This
I was very glad of, and about the latter end of December,
which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down,
and all I could do was to make one, as well as I could, out
of one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first
crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down;
in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in a. great basket which I had
made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the
end of my harvesting, I found that out of my half--peek of
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and about two bushels
and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess, for I
had no measure at that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I
foresaw that, in time, it would please God to supply me
with bread: and yet, here I was perplexed again, for I
neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn, or,
indeed, 110w to clean it and part it; nor, if made into
meal, how to make bread of it: and if how to make it,
yet I knew not how to bake it. I resolved not to taste any
of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next
season; and, in the meantime, to employ all my study and
hours of working to accomplish this great work of providing
myself with corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.
I believe few people have thought much upon the strange
multitude of little things necessary in the providing, pro-
ducing, curing, dressilw, making, and finishing, this one
article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a more state of nature, found this
to my daily discouragement, and was made more sensible
of it every hour.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth; no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making me
a wooden spade, as I observed before, but this did my work
but in a wooden manner, and though it cost me a great many
days to make it, yet for want of iron, it not only were out
seen, but made my work the harder, and made it be per--
formed much worse. However, this I bore with, and was
content to work it out with patience, and bear with the
hadness of the performance. When the corn was sown, I
had no barrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and
drag a great heavy hough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as
it may he called, rather than rake or barrow it. When it
was growing, ahd grown, I have observed already how
many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap
it, cure and carrv it home, thrash, part it from the chafl,
and saw it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves
to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an
oven to bake 1t; but all these things I did without, as shall
be observed , and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort
and advantage to me, too. All this made everything laborious
and tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither was
12v time so much loss to 111e, because, as I had divided it,a
certain part of it wm e1 e1 y day appointed to these woxks, '
and as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I
had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to
apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to furnish my-
self with utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for making the corn, when I had it, fit for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this,
1 had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which,
when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very
heavy, and required double labour to work with it. How-
ever, 1 got through that, and sowed my seed in two large
flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge,
the stakes of which were all cut of that wood which I had
set- before, and knew it would grow; so that in one year's
time I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would
want but little repair. This work did not take me up less
than three months, because a great part of that time was
the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within doors
I found employment in the following occupations--always
observing that, all the while I was at work, I diverted myself
with talking to my parrot, and teachinghim to speak; and I
quickly-taught him to know his own name, and atlast to speak
it out pretty loud, Poll, which was the first word I ever heard
spoken in the island by any month but my own. This,
therefore, was not my work, but an assistance to my work,
for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my
hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some
means or other, some earthern vessels, which, indeed, I
wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them.
llowever, considering the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might make some
pots that might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough
and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold anything
that was dry, and required to he kept so; and as this was
necessary in the preparing corn, meal, &c., which was the
thing I was doing, I resolved to make them as large as I
could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should
be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at

7
me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this
paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how
many of them fell in, and how many fell out--the clay not
being stifl' enough to bear its own weight; how many
cracked by the over-violent heat of the sun, being set out
too hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dried; and, in a.
word, how, after having laboured hard to find the clay--to
dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it--I could
not make above two large earthern ugly things (I cannot
call them jars) in about two months' labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard,
I lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in
two great wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break; and as between the pot
and the basket there was a little room to spare, I smiled it
full of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots being
to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn,
and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots,
yet I made several smaller things with better success; such
as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and
anything my hand turned to ; and the heat of the sun
baked them quite hard.

But my end was to get an earthen pot to hold what was
liquid, and bear the fire ; which none of these could do. It
happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for
cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after I had
done with it, I founda broken piece of one of my earthen--
ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as
a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to my--
self that, certainly they might be made to burn whole, if
they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make
it burn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had
some lead to do it with; but I placed three large pipkins,
and two or three pots, in a. pile, one upon another, and placed
my firewood all round it with a great heap of embers under
them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside,
and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack at all;
when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about five or six hours, till I found one of them, though it
did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand which was
mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat,
' and would have run into glass if I had gone on; so I
slackcd my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the
red colour, and watching them all night, that I might not
let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very
good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of
them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no
sort of earthenware for my use; but as to the shapes of
them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose.

N 0 joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would
bear the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they
were cold, before I set one on the fire again, with some
water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably
well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,
though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients
requisite to make it as good as I would have had it been.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp
or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no
thought of arriving at that perfection of art with one pair
of hands. To supply this want, I was at a. great loss; for,
of all the trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified
For a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any
':o 013 to go about it with. I spent many a day to find out
I great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a
.n ortar, and could find none at all, except what was in the
solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or out out; nor
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient,
but were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which neither
would hear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break
the corn, without filling it with sand; so, after a great deal
of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and
resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which
I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I
had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of
tire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the
Indians in brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a.
great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called the iron-
wood; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my
next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or
rather pound, into meal to make bread.

My next dilliculty was to make a sieve to dress my meal,
and to part it from the bran and the husk; without which
I did not see it possibleI could have any bread. This was
a most diiiicult thing, even to think on, for to be sure I
had nothing like the necessary thing to make it ; I mean
fine thin canvas, or stuff, to search the meal through. And
here I was at a full stop for many months; nor (lid I really
know what to do. Linen I had none left, but what was
more rags; I had g0ats'-hair, but neither knew how to
weave it or spin it; and had I known how, here were no
tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found for
this was, that at last I did remember I had, among the
seamen's clothes which were saved out of the ship, some
neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some pieces of
these I made three small sieves, proper enough for the
work; and thus I made shift for some years: how I did
afterwards, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I should make bread when I came to have corn;
for, first, I had no yeast; as to that part, there was no
supplying the want, so I did not concern myself much
about it. But for an even, I was indeed in great pain.
At length, I found out an experiment for that also, which
was this: I made some earthen vessels very broad, but not
deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above
nine inches deep; these I burned in the fire, as I had done
the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake,
I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved
\\ ith some square tiles, of my own baking and burning also.

When the fire--wood was burned pretty much into embers,
I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all
over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot:
then sweeping away all the embers, I set down loaves, and
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the
embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add
to the heat ; and thus, as well as in the best oven in the
world, I baked my barley loaves, and became, in a little
time, a good pastrycook into the bargain; for I made
- myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; but I made
no pics, neither had I anything to put into them, except
the flesh either of fowls or goats.

All these things took me up most part of the third year
of my abode here; for, it is to be observed that, in the
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest and hus-
bandry to manage; for I reaped my corn in its season, and
carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the
car, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for
1 had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it
with.

And now, my stock of corn increasing,I wanted to build
my barns bigger ; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the
increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had
of the barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as
much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved to begin to
use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great
while; also I resolved to see what quantity would be
sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a-year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley
and rice were much more than I could consume in a. year ;
so I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that
I sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully
provide me with bread, &c.

All the while these things were doing, my thoughts ran
many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen
from the other side of the island; and I was not without
secret wishes that I were on shore there, faneying I might
find some way or other to convey myself farther, and per-
haps at last find some means of escape.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat
with the shoulder-of--mntton sail, with which I sailed above
a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but this was in102 aosngsox causal.

vain: then I thought I would go and look at our ship's
boat, which was blown up upon the shore a great way, in
the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost
where she did at first; and was turned, by the force of the
waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, but no water
about her. If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to
have launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils
with her easily; but I might have foreseen that I could no
more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I
could remove the island ' however, I went to the woods,
and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat,
resolving to try what I could do ; suggesting to myself, that
if I could but turn her down, I might repair the damage she
had received, and she would be a very good boat, and
I might go to sea in her easily.

I spared no pains in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent
three or four weeks about it; at last, finding it impossible
to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging
away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it nghtin
the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move it forward
towards the water; so I was forced to give it over.

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not pos-
sible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives
of these climates make, even without tools, of the trunk of
a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy,
and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making
it, and with my having much more convenience for it than
any of the negroes or Indians; but not at all considering
the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than
the Indians did, viz., want of hands to move it, when it
was made, into the water; for what was it to me, if, when
I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with much
trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools
to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat,
and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to
make a boat of it--if, after all this, I must leave it just"" :2 Enact: ' '

where I faund it, and not be able to launch it into the
water ?-

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that
ever man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased
myself with the design, without determining whether I was
ever able to undertake it; not but that the difficulty
of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put
a stop to my inquiries into it by this foolish answer: " Let
me first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other
to get it along when it is done."

_ I felled a cedar-tree, and I question much whether
Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple of
Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower
part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter
at the end of twenty-two feet. It was not without infinite
labour that I felled this tree ; I was twenty days hacking
and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more
getting the branches and limbs cut off, which I hacked and
hewed through with axe and hatchet, with inexpressible
labour: after this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub
it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a
boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost
me near three months more to clear the inside, and work it
out so as to make an exact boat of it; this I did, without
fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by dint of hard labour,
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big
enough to have carried sixand twenty men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than
ever I saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree,
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be
sure: and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question
but I should have begun the maddest v0yage, and the
most unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me. It
lay about one hundred yards from the water; but the first
inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek. To
take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into
the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I
began; but when this was worked through, and this.
dillieulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could
no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then
I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a
(lock or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe. "7 ell, I
began this work; and when I began to calculate how deep
it was to be dug, how broad, how the stufl' was to be
thrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had,
being none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
years before I could have gone through with it; for the.
shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must, have been
at least twenty feet deep ; so, with great reluctance, I gave
this attempt over also.

I had now been here so long that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gene, or
very much wasted, and near spent.

My ink had been gone some time, all but a very little.
which I eked out with water, till it was so pale, it scare>>.
left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as it
lasted, 1 made use of it. to minute down the days of the
month on which any remarkable thing happened to inc '.
and, first, by casting up times past, I remembered that there
was a strange concurrence of days in the various pro-
vidences which bcfel me, and which, if I had been super-
stitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I
might. have had reason to have looked upon with a great.
deal of curiosity.

First, Iliad observed, that the same day that I broke
away from my father and friends, and ran away to Hull, in
order to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken 1);:
the Sallce nian-otlwar, and made a slave; the same day of
the year that l escaped out of the wreck of that ship in
Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made in};
escape from Sallcc in a boat ; the same day of the year I was
born on, \'iz., the 30th of September, that same day I had
my life so miraculously saved twenty--six years after, when
I was cast on shore in this island ; so that. my wicked life
and my solitary life began both on a day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was the biscuit
which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbandcd to
the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread
a day for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread
for near a year before I got any corn of my own.

My clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had
none a good while, except some chequered shirts which I
found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I care-
l'ully preserved; because many times I could bear no other
clothes on but a shirt.

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the
few rags I had in some order; I had worn out all the waist-
coats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not
make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set to
work, tailoring, or rather, indeed, botehing, for I made most
piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make two or
three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me agreat
while; as for brooches or drawers, I made but a very sorry
shil't indeed till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had
them hung up, stretched out- with sticks, in the sun, by which
means some of them were so dry and hard that they were
lit for little, but others were very useful. The first thing
I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair
on the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed
so well, that after, I made me a suit of clothes wholly of
these skins.

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make
an umbrella; I was in great want of one; I had seen them
made. in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great
heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to
me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world
of pains with it, and was a great while before I could make
anything likely to hold: nay, afterI thoughtIhad hit theway,
I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind: but at
last I made one that answered indifferently well; the main
difficulty I found was to make it letdown. I could make it
spread, but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it was not
portable for me any way but just over my head. However,
at last, I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the
hair upwards, so that it cast 011' the rain like a pent-house,
and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in
the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than
I could before in the coolest, and whcnI had no need of it,
could close it, and carry it under my arm.

I cannot say that, after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me, but I 111 ed on in the
same course, in the same place as before; the chief things I
was employ ed' in, besides my yearly labour of planting my
barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I
always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock ot one
year's provision beforehand, and my daily pursuit of going
out with my gun, I had one labour, to makea canoe, which
at last I finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of six
feet- wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek,
almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big,
I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum
to teach me to be wiser the next time; indeed, the next
time, though I could not. get a tree proper for it, and was
in a place where I could not. get the water to it at any less
distance than near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable
at last, I never gave it over; and though I was near two
years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes 0f
hm ing a boat to go oli'to sea at last.

110" 0101', though 111v little pcriagua was fi11ishecl,\fet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which I
had 111 view when I made the first--ofrentan'ingo overto the
terrafirnm, where it was above forty miles broad; accord-
ingly. the smallness of my boat assisted me to put an end to
that. design, and new I thought no more of it. My next
design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I had
been on the other side in one place, crossing over the land,
so the discoveries I made in that little journey made me
very eager to see other parts of the coast ; and now I had
a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and
made a sail too out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails
which lay in store. Having fitted my mast and sail, and
tried the boat, I found she would sail very well: then I
made little lockers, at each end of my boat, to put pro-
visions, necessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry,
and a. little, long, hollow place I cut in the inside of the
boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to lay over
it, to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella. also in a step at the. stem, to stand
over my head, and keep the heat of the sun ofi' me, like an
awning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage
upon the sea: but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek. At last, being eager to' view the circumference
of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise; and
accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in
two dozen of leaves of barley bread, an earthen pot full of
parched rice, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
and shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats I had
saved out of the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie
upon, and the other to cover me in the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or captivity, which you please, that I set out on this
voyage, and Ifound it much longer than I expected; for
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came
to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out
about two leagues into the sea, and beyond that a shoal of
sand, lying dry half a league more, so that I was obliged to
go a great way out to sea to double the point.

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over
my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far
it might oblige me to go out to sea; and, above all, doubt-
ing how I should get back again: so I came to an anchor,
for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of broken
grappling which I got out of the ship.

But the third-day, in the morning, I ventured: but I am
a warning to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner
was I come to the point, when I was not even my boat's
length from the shore, but I found myself in a great depth
of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill: it carried
my boat along with it with such violence that all Icould do
could not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but
I found it hurried me farther and further out from the
eddy,11'l1ieh was on my left hand. There was no wind
stirring to help me, and all I could do with my paddles sig-
nilied nothing; and now I began to give myself over for
lost: {0' as the current. was 011 both sides of the island, I
knew in a few leagues' distance they must join awain, and
then I 11.1: irre1 oe1l1l1gone; so that I had no prospect be--

enough. but of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found
a tortoise on the shore, as big,1 almost as I could lift, and had
tossed it into the heat; and I had a great jarot' fresh water;
11111 what was all this to be driven into the vast ocean,
where, to he. sure, there was no shor 1, no mainland or
island,1"or a thousand leagues at least?

And now 1 saw how easy it was for the providence of
God to 111: die even the most miserable condition of mankind
11 11150. I\o1v I looked back upon my desolate, solitary
island, as the most pleasant place 111 the world, mid all the
happiness 111y heart could 111sh lor was to be but there again.
It is <<1.11 eel1 possible to imagine the consternation l was
now i11,hei111r driven from 11111 helov ed island into the wide
ocean, almost two leagues, a1id 1n the utmost despair of me:-
recovering it again. llo11e1e1', I worked hard till my
sIrenth was almost exhausted, and liept my boat as much
to the northward, that is towards the current which the
eddy lay on. as possibly I Could; when about 110011, as the
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of
wind in my face, springing up from 8.8.1112. This cheered
my heart 21 little, and especially when, in about half an hour
more, it. blew :1 pretty gentle gale. By this time I had got
at a frightful distance 1'10111 the island, and had the least
eloud1 or hazy weather interv cued, I had been undone
another 1111' too; for I had no compass on board, and
should never l1a1e known how to have steered towards the
island, ii I had but once lost sight at it; but the 11 tamer
eontinuiny.11 clear, 1 applied myself to get 111) my mast again,
and spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as
possible, to get. out of the current.

Just. as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began
to stretch away, I saw by the clearncss of the water
some alteration of the current was near; and presently I
found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks: these rocks caused the current to part
again, and, as the main stress of it ran away more southerly,
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by
the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran
back again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a. reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going
to murder them, or who have been in such extremities, may
guess what my present surprise ofjoy was, and how gladly
1 put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind
also l'reshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy
under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back
again, directly towards the island, but about two leagues
more to the northward than the current which carried me
away at first; so that when]. came near the island, I found
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out
n-om.

When I had made something more than a league of way
by the help of this eddy, I found it was spent, and served
me no farther. However, being between two great cur-
rents, in the wake of the island, I found the water at least
still, and running no war; and having still a. breeze of
wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,
and in about an hour came within about a mile of the
shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all
thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing
myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat close to
the shore, in a. little cove that Iliad spied under some trees,
and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the
labour and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with
my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much
of the case, to think of attempting it by the way I went
out; so I resolved on the next morning to make my way
westward along the shore, and to see if there was no creel:
where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have
her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles, I came
to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where -
I found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and where
she lay as it" she had been in a little dock made on purpose
for her. Here 1 put. in, and having stowed my boat \'\:l'_v
safe, I went on shore to look about 1110, and see where
I was.

I soon found Iliad but a little passed by the place where
I had been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore;
so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella,
for it was exceedingly hot. I began my march. The way
was Comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been
upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I
found everything standing as I had left it.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the Shade to
rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but
judge you, if you can, that read my story, what a surprise
I must be in, when l was awaked out of my sleep b\ a
voice, calling me by name. se\eral times "Ilobiu, lloliin,
Robin Crusoe; poor Robin 01 usoe! \\ how are you,
Robin Crusoe ? Where are you? Where have you been?"
I was so dead asleep at lirst,bei11g fatigued with r'oning
the first part of the d: 1y, and \11th walkin<1r the latter part,
that I did not wake. thoroughly; but dozing between
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that5 somebody
spoke to me; but as the vuiee continued to repeat. " Robin
Crusoe, lxobin Crusoe," at last I began to 1 ahe more per-
feetly, and was at first. dreadfully frightened, and started
up in the utmOSt consternation; but no sooner were my
eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the
hedge; and innnediately knew that it was he that spoke to
me; for just in Such bemoaning language I had used to
talk to him, and teach him ; and he had learned it so per-
fectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill
close to my face, and cry, "Poor Robin Crusoe! "'here
are you? Where lme _\ ou been? How came you here ?"
and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a. good while
before I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how
the creature got thither; and then, how he should just
keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well
satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it;
and holding out my hand, and calling him by his name,
" Poll," the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my
thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me,
" Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here? and
where had I been ?"just as if he had been overjoyed to see
me again; and so I carried him home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time,
and had enough to do for many days to sit still, and reflect
upon the danger I had been in. I would have been very
glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island;
but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. I
contented myself to be without any boat, though it had
been the product of so many months' labour to make it,
and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper, I remained near a
year; and lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well
suppose; and my thoughts being very much composed as
to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really
very happily in all things, except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself
to; and I believe I should, upon occasion, have made a.
very good carpenter, especially considering how few tools
I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with
a wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better; because
I made things round and shaped, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I was never more
vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything
I found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-
pipe; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when
it was done, and only burned red, like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I
was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always
used to smoke; and there were pipes in the ship, but I
forgot them at first, not thinking that there was tobacco in
the island; and afterwards, when I searched the ship train,
I could not come at any pipes.

In my wickerware, also, I improved much, and made
abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention
showed me; though not very handsome, yet they were
such as were very handy and convenient for laying things
up in, or fetching things home. Also, large deep baskets
were the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed out
as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept in great baskets.

I began now to perceive that my powder abated cor-
siderably: this was a want which was impossible for me
to supply ; and I began seriously to consider what I must
do whenI should have no more powder; that is to say,
how I should kill any goats. I had, in the third year of
my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame,
and I was in hopes of getting a lie-goat: but I could not
by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grow an old goat;
and as I could never find in my heart to kill her, she died
at last of mere age.

But being new in the eleventh year of my residence, and
my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some
art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not
catch some of them alive; and particularly I wanted a
she-goat great with young. For this purpose, I made
snares to hamper them; but my tackle was not good, for I
had no wire, and I always found them broken, and my bait
devoured. At length, I resolved to try a pitfall : so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had ob-
served the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed
hurdles, of my own making too, with a great weight upon
them ; and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice,
without setting the trap ; and I could easily perceive that
the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, for I could
see the marks of their feet. At length, I set three traps
in one night, and going the next morning, I found them all
standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was very
disconragincr. However, I altered my traps; and, not to
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see my
traps, I found in one of them a large old he-goat; and in
one of the others, three kids, a male and two females.

A; to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he
was so iierce, I (lurst not go into the pit to him, to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted; so I even let him
out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of
his wits.

lint I did not then know what I afterwards learned, that
hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three
or four days without food, and then have carried him some
water to drink, and then a little corn, he would have been
as tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious,
tractable creatures, when they are well used.

However, for the present 1 let him go, knowing no better
at. that time; then I went to the three kids, and, taking
them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and
with some difficulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throw-
ing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they
began to be tame. And now I found that if I expected
to supply myself with goat's flesh, when I had no powder
or shot left, breeding up some tame was my only way, when,
perhaps, I might have them about my house like a. flock of
sheep. But then it occurred to me that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild
when they grew up; and the only way for this was to have
some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with
hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet, as I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it,
my first work was to find out a proper piece of ground,
where there was likely to he herbage for them to eat, water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who undei'stand such enclosures will think I had
very little eontrivance when I pitched upon a place very
proper for all these, which had two or three littledrills of
trash water in it, and at one end was very woody--they

'0
will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I began by
enclosing this piece of ground in such a manner, that my
hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about.
Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass, for,
if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough
to do it in , but I did not consider that my goats would be
as wild 111 so much compass as if they had the \\ hole island,
and I should have so much room to chase them in that I
should never catch them.

My hedge was begun, and carried on I believe about
fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I pre--
sently stopped short, and, for the beginning, I resolved to
enclose a piece about one hundred and fifty yards in length,
and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would
maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time,
so, as my stock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work
with courage. I was about three months hedging in the
first piece ; and, till I had done it, I tethered the three
kids in the best part of it, and used them to feed as near
me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I
would go and carry them some ears of barley and corn, or
a. handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; so that,
after my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose, they
would follow me up and down, bloating after me for a
handful of corn.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years more Iliad three-and-forty, besides several that I
took and killed for my food. After that, I enclosed several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive
them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one
piece of ground into another.

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's flesh
to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which,
indeed, in the beginning, I did not so much as think of,
and which, "hen it came into my thoughts, was really an
agreeable surprise, ior no" I set up my dairy, and had
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as"Then to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended by my
servants."
Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, die-
tates even naturally how to make useof it, so I, that had never
milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese
made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays
and miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at last, also
salt (though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat
of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), and never
wanted it afterwards.

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and
my little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty,
the prince and lord of the whole island; I had the lives of
all my subjects at my absolute command; I could hang,
draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among
my subjects. Then, to see how like a king I dined too,
all alone, attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been
my favourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me.
My dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and had
found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at
my right hand, and two cats, one on one side of the table
and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from
my hand, as a mark of my special favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on
shore at first, for they were both of them dead, and had
been interred near my habitation by my own hand; but
one of them having multiplied by I know not what kind of
creature, these were two which I had preserved tame. With
this attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived;
neither could I be said to want anything but society.

I was something impatient to have the use of my boat,
though very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore
sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island,
and at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind
to go down to the point of the island, where, in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay; this
inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I
resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of
the shore. I did so; but had any one in England met
such a man as I was, it must either have frightened him, or
raised a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion
of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage,
and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a. sketch of my
figure as follows :--

I had a high, shapelcss cap made of goat's skin. with a flap
hanging clown behind, as well to keep the sun from me as
to shoot the rain oil' from running into my neck, nothing
being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.

I had a. short jacket of goats skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of
Open-kneed hreeehes of the same; the breeehcs were made
of the. skin of an old lie-goat, whose hair hung down as
such a length on either side, that, like pautaloons, it
reached to the middle 01' my legs; stockings and shoes I
had none, but had made me a pair of somethings, I Scarce
know what to call them, like bnskins, to flap over my legs,
and lace on either side like spatterdashcs, but of a mest
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a. broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles,
and in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a
sword and dagger, hungr a little saw and a hatchet, one 0:1
one side and one on the other. I had another belt not
so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung
over my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too, in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At. my
back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun, and
over my head a great, clumsy, ugly, goat's skin umbrella,
but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had
about me next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of
it ms really not so mulatto-like as one might expect from
a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten
degrees of the equinox. My heard 1 had once sutl'ercd to
grow {ill in was about a quarter of a. yard long; but as i.
had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as
I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallce, for the Moors
did not wear such, though the Turks did; of these mous~
tnchios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough
to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and
shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would
have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye; for, as to my, figure, I had so
few to observe me, that it was of no manner of conse--
quence, so I say no more of that. In this kind of dress I
went my new journey, and was out five or six days. I
travelled first along the sea shore, directly to the place
where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon
the rocks; and having no boat now to take care of, I went
over the land a nearer way to the same height that I was
upon before, when, looking forward to the points of the
rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double
with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the
sea all smooth and quiet--no rippling, no motion, no cur-
rent, any more there than in any other places.

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and
I might very easily bring my boat about the island again;
but when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again
with any patience, but, on the contrary, I took up another
resolution which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, that I would build me another canoe, and so
have one for one side of the island and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call
it, two plantations in the island--one my little fortification
or tent, with the wall about it, under the rock, with the
cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into
several apartments, or eaves, one within another. One of
these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out
beyond my wall or fortification--that is to say, beyond
where my wall joined to the rock--was all filled up with
the large earthen pots of which I have given an account,
and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of
provisions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short
from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown
so big, and spread so very much, that there was not the
least appearance, to any one's View, of any habitation be-
hind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within
the land, and upon loner ground, lay my two pice es of
com land, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and
which duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and
whenever I had occasion for more corn, 1 had more land
adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat, and had now a
tolerable plantation there also; for, first, I had my little
bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair--that is to
say, I kept the hedge, which encircled it in, constantly
fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in
the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no more
than stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always
out, so that they might spread and grow thick and wild,
and make the more agreeable shade, which they did efi'ec-
tually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent
always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles,
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair
or renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or
couch, with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and
with other things, and a blanket laid on them, such as
belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved; and a
watch-coat to cover 1110. And here, wheneV er I had occasion
to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country
habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my goats;
andI had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence
and enclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never
left 03' till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of
the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one
another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there
was scarce room to put a hand through between them;
which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did
in the next rainy season, made the enclosure stronger than
any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared neces-
sary for my comfortable support, for I considered the
keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand
would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and
cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to
be for forty years.

In this place also I, had my grapes growing, which I
principally depended on for my winter store of raisins, and
which I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best
and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed
they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome,
nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally stayed and lay here in my way thither, for I
used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all things
about, or belonging to her, in very good order. Some-
times I wcnt out in her to divert myself, but no more
hazardous voyages would I go, scarcely ever above a stone's
cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being
hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new-
scene of my life.

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's
naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen
on the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I
had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked round me,
but I could hear nothing nor see anything; I went up to
a rising ground to look farther ; I went up the shore and
down the shore, but it was all one: I could see no other
impression but that one. I went to it again to see if there
were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy;
but there was no room for that, for there was exactly the
print of a foot----toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How
it came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; _
but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man per-~
fectly confused and out of my self, I came to my fortifica-
tIon, not iecling. as we sar, the mound I "out on, but
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at (new two
or tlnee steps, mistaking eI er bu:h and tree, and fancying
er-eII stump atr dist: nice to he II man.

\\ hen I came to mv castle (tor so 1 think I called it eIcr
aitI'II' this), I tied into it like one pursued.

I slept none that night : the farther I was from the
occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil, and reason joined
in with me in this supposition, 101' how should any other
thing- In human shape come into the place? \\ here "us
the vessel that brought them? What marks II ere there of
any other footstep'! And how \'1$ it possible a man should
come there? I considered that the deI ll might haIe found
out abundance ot other w'a_Is to lIaIe lerIiiicd me than this
of the single print of a foot; that. as I lived quite on the
other side of the island, he would never have been so
simple as to leIeIr :I. mark in a place where it was ten
thousand to one whether I should ever see it- or not, and in
the sand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high
wind, would have defaced entirciy. All this seemed in-
consistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions we
usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil.

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was
very thankful in my thoughts that l. was so happy as not
to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my
boat, by which they would have concluded that some in-
habitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched
farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagina-
tion about their having,r found out my boat, and that there
were people here; and that, if so, I should certainly have
them come again in greater numbers, and devour me; that.
if it should happen that they should not find me, yet they
would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry
away all my flock of tame goats, and 1 should perish at
last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that
former confidence in God, which was founded upon such
wonderful experience as I had had of His goodness; as it
He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not pre-
serve, by His power, the provision which he had made
for me by His goodness. I reproached myself with my
laziness, that would not sow any more corn one year than
would just serve me till the next season, as if no accident
could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was
upon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that
I resolved for the future to have two or three years' corn
beforehand; so that, whatever might come, I might not
perish for want of bread.

One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages,
I found it discomposed me very much; upon which these
words of the Scripture came into my thoughts: " Call upon
me in the (lay of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my
bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance:
when I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening
it to read, the first words that presented tome were, " Wait
on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen
thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to
express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully
laid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that
occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and re-
flections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this
might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot
might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore
from my boat; this cheered me up a little, too, and I began
to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing
else but my own foot; and why might Inot come that way
from the boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat?
Again I considered also, that I cOuld by no means tell, for
certain, where I had trod, and where I had not; and that
if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had
played the part of these fools who try to make stories of
spectrcs and apparitions, and then are frightened at them
more than anybody.

N ow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again,
for I had not. stirred out of my castle for three days and
nights, so that. l bee-an to starve for provisions; for I had
little or nothing wiahin doors but some barley-cakes and
water: then I knew that. my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor
creatures were in great. pain and inconvenience for want of
it; and, indeed, i1. almost. spoiled some of them, and almost.
dried 11p their milk. lCm-ouraging myself, therefore, with
the belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my
01111 ftee. and that I might be trnlv said to start at 1111' own
shadow, I began to go abroad .11T 1111, and 11' ent to my
co1n11'rv-h1msetomil-1 1n\ lloek . but to see 111111 what fear
I went for" '11'd hon 11111-11 I looked behind me, how I was
ready, or eiy 111111 and 1111.11, to lay down my basket and run
for my life, it would have made any one have. thought I was
haunted with an evil eonseieuee, or that I had been lately
most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However,
I went down thus two or three days, and having seen
nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there
was 111'11ll) nothing in it but my own imaeination; but I
could not persuade n1_1selt tnlly of this till I should go down
to the shore again. and see this print of a foot, and measure
it by my own, and see it' there was any similitude or tit-
ness, that I might be assured it was 1111' own feet: but when
I came to the pl11ee--l'1rs1', it appeared evidenth to me, that
when I laid 1111 1111' boat, I could not possibly be 011 shore
anvwhere thereabouts : seeondlv, 11 hen I came to measure
the mark with 1111' 111111 loot, I iound mv foot not so large
by a great deal. .luotll these thinws filled my head with new
imaginations, and "11111 me the vapours again to the highest
degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague; and
I went home again, filled with the belief that some man or
men had been ashore there; or, in short, that the island was
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware;
and what course to take for my security I knew not.

The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down
my enelowres, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the
woods, lest the enemy should find them, and then frequent
the island in prospect of the same or the like hootv . then
the simple thing of dieging 11,) my two corn fields, lest they
should find such a grain there, and still be prompted to fre-
quent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent,
that they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be
prompted to look farther, in order to find out the persons
inhabiting.

These were the subjects of the first night's eogitations
after I was come home again, while the apprehensions which
had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my head
was full of vapours.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night;
but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the amuse-
ment of my mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits
exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much better
composed than I had ever been before. And now I began
to think sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I con-
cluded that this island (which was so exceedingly pleasant,
fruitful, and no farther away from the mainland than as I
had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine;
that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on
the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats ofi' from
the shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but
when they were driven by cross winds, might come to this
place; that I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; and
that, if at any time they should be driven here, it was pro-
bable they went away again as soon as ever they could,
seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any oc-
easion; that the most I could suggest any danger from was,
from any casual accidental landing of straggling people from
the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither,
Were here against their wills, so they made no stay here,
but went off again with all possible speed ; seldom staying
one night on shore, lest they should not have the help of
the tides and daylight back again; and that, therefore, I
had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in
case 1 should see any savages land upon the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I
said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to the
rock: upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved
to draw me a second lbrtiti'ation, in the 111anner of a
semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just. where I had
planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of
which 1 made 111c11tion: these trees having; been planted so
thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven be-
tween them, that they might. be thicker and stronger, and
my wall would he soon linished. So that 1 now had
:1 double wall ; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces
of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to
make it strong; having in it. seven littleholes, about, as big
as l 111ight put my arm out at. In the inside of this. l.
thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually
bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of
the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the nutskets, of which I took
notice that. I had got seven on shore. out of the ship; these
I planted like my cannon, and titted them into frames, that
held them like a t'fil'l'l:tf.:e,\ so that I could lire all the seven
guns in two minutes time; this wall [ was many a wearv
month 111 finishing, and yet never thought 1111:th sale till 1;
was done. _
When this was done. I stuck all the ground without my
wall, for a great length every way, as full with stakes or
sticks of the Osier--like wood, which I found so apt to grow,
as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe 1 mic-ht
set. in near twenty thousand of tl1em,leavi11g__1; a pretty large
space between them and tar wall, that I might. have room
to see an enemy. and they might have no shelter from the
301mg trees, it" the\ attempted to approach 111v outer wall.
Tints, 111 two years time, 1 had a thick <<trove; and in
five or six years' time 1 had a wood bet'oore my dwelling,
growing so 111011strously thick and strong that it, was indeed
perfectly i111passable: and no men, of what kind socvcr,
could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it,
much less a habitation. As for the way which I proposed
to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by
setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, aml left room to place another
upon that ; so that when the two ladders were taken down,
no man living could come down to me without doing him-
sch" mischief; and it' they had come down, they were still
on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preser 'ation; and it will be seen, at
length. that they were not altogether without just reason '.
Though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my more
fear suggested to me.

While this was doing. I was not altogether careless of my
other all'airs; for I had great concern upon me for my
little herd of goats: they were not only a ready supply to
me on every occasion, and began to he sullicient for me,
without the expense of powder and shot, but also without
the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath
to lose the advantage of them, and to have to nurse them
tip over again.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think
of hut two ways to preserve them ; one was, to find
another convenient place to dig a care under ground, and
to drive them into it every night; and the other was to en-
close two or three little bits of land, remote from one
another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might
keep almul', half a dozen young goats in each place; so that
if any disaster happened to the tlock in general, I might be
ahle to raise them again with little trouble and time: and
this, though it would require a good deal of time and
lahour, [ thought was the most rational design.

Aeoordingly.l spent some time to find out the most
retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which
was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish for: it was
a little, damp piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow
and thick woods, where I almost lost myself once before,
cmlearouring to come back that way from the eastern part
of the island. IIercI found a clear piece of land, near
thre - acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost
an enclosure by nature; at least, it did not want near so
much lahour to make it so as the other piece of ground I
had worked so hard at.

1 immediately went to work with this piece of ground;
and in less than a month's time, I had so fenced it round
that my flock werewell enough secured in it; so, without any
further delay, I removed ten young she-goats, and two
lie-goats, to this piece; and, when they were there, I
continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it. as secure
as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it
took me up more time by a great deal. All this labour I
was at the expense of purely from my apprehensions on the
account of the print of a man's foot; for, as yet, I had
never seen any human creature come near the island ; and
I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, in-
deed, made my life much less comfortable than it was
before, as may be Well imagined by any who know what it
is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man.

After I had thus secured one part of my little living
stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another
private place to make such another deposit; when, wander-
ing more to the west point of the island than I had ever
done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat
upon the sea, at a great distance. Ihad found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved
out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and this was
so remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though
I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look
any longer; whether it was a boat or not, I do not know,
but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it,
so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more out with-
out a perspective glass in my pocket. When I was come
down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I
had never been before, I was presently convinced that the
seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a. strange
thing in the island as I imagined; but that it was a special
providence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came. I should easily have known
that nothing Was more frequent than for the canoes from
the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at
sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them over
to this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs,
being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, I was per-"I was fierfectly confounded and amazed to see the shore spread with
s ulls, hands, and feet, and other bones of human bodies."
feetly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to
express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread
with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies,
and particularly I observed a place where there had been
a tire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit,
where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that
I entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it
for a long while ; all my apprehensions were buried in the
thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and
the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which,
though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a
View of before; in short, I turned away my face from
the horrid spectacle, and with all the speed I could, walked
on towards my own habitation.

When I canie a little out of that part of the island, I
stood still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself,
I looked up with the utmost ailection of my soul, and, with
a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast
my first let in a part of the world where I was distinguished
from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I
had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet
given me so many comforts in it that I had still more to
give thanks for than to complain of.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circmnstzmces, than ever I was before : for I observed that
these wretches never came to this island in search of what
they could get; perhaps not seeking, wanting, or expecting
anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the
covered woody part of it, without finding anything to their
purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen
years, and never saw the least footsteps of any human
creature there before; and I may be eighteen years more
as entirely concealed as I was now, it' I did not discover
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do;
it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed
where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than
cannihals to make nn'self known to. Yet I entertained
sueh an ahhorrenee of th.. savage wretches that, I have been
speaking: of, and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their
devouring and eating one another up, that 1 eontinued
pensive and sad. and kept, close within my own circle, for
almost. two years after this. I did not>> so l|lllt.il as go to

that. I had furnished Inysell' with a tame breed of goats,
and that I had no need to hunt. any mor~ almut the woods,
or shunt at, them; and it I did etueh anyot' them after this,
it, was hy snares and traps, as i had done before: so that,
for two years after this. I believe 1 never tired my gun
onee oll', though I never went out without it; and, what was
more. as 1 had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always
carried them out \\ ith me, or at least :wooi' them, stieking
them in my eeatskin helt. 1 also i'urhished up one of the

is in my present, condition there were not really many
things which I wanted. so, indeed, I thought that. the
i'r' his I had heen in about these savage wretches, and the.
cum-urn I had been in for my own preservation, had taken

oil" the edge of my invention for my own conveniences;
and I had dropped a good design, which I had once beat
my thoughts too much upon, and that was to try if I could
not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical
thought, and I rcproved myself often for the simplicity of
it; for I presently saw there would be the want of several
things necessary to the making my beer, that it would be
impossible for me to supply: as, first, casks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I
could never compass: no, though I spent not only many
days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no pur-
pose. In the next place, I had no hops to make it keep,
no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it
boil; and yet, with all these things wanting, I verily believe,
had not the frights and terrors I was in about the savages
intervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to
pass, too; for I seldom gave anything over without accom-
plishing it, when once I had it in my head to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for,
night and day, I could think of nothing but how I might
destroy some of these monsters in their cruel, bloody
entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they should
bring hither to destroy. But. what could one man do
among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty
of them together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows,
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could
with my gun?

While my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge,
and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword,
as 1 may call it, the horror 1 had at the place, and at the
signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another,
abetted my malice. Well, at length I found a place in the
side of the hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait
till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, convey my-
self unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which
there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely;
and there I might sit and dbserve all their bloody doings,
and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so

close together as that it would be next to impossible that I
9
should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or
four of them at the first shot. In this place, then, 1' re-
rolved to fulfil my design; and accordingly I prepared two
mnskets and my ordinary fowling~piece. The two muskets
I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling-
piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the
largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four
bullets each ; and in this posture, Well provided with am-
munition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself
for my expedition.

After 1 had thus laid the scheme of my design, I made
my four every morning to the top of the hill, to see it' I
could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the
island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of
this hard duty, after I had for two or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, but came always back without any
discovery ; there having not, in all that time, been the least
appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the whole
ocean, so far as my eyes or glass could reach every way.

As long as .l kept my daily tour to the hill to look out,
so long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my
spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable form for so
outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty
naked savages, for an otl'ence which I had not at all entered
into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my
passions were at first fired by the horror 1 conceived at the
unnatural customs of the people of that country. But
now, when I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion
which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain,
so my Opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I
began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what
I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to
pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as
criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages,
to sullL-r to go on unpunishcd, and to be, as it were, the
cxecutioncrs of His judgments one upon another; how far
these people were oilenders against me, and what right I
had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed
promiscuously upon one another.
When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily
that I was certainly in the wrong; that these people were
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned
them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were
murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in
battle ; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though
they threw down their arms and submitted.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a
kind of a full stop ; and I began, by little and little, to be off
my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong measures
in my resolution to attack the savages ; and that it was not
my business to meddle with them, unless they first attacked
me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent:
but that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew
my duty.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this:
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up
the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or
to know whether any of them had been on shore or not,
that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contri-
vances against them, or be provoked by any advantage that
might present itself, to fall upon them: only this I did; I
went and removed my boat, which I had on the other side
of the island, and carried it down to the east end of the
whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found
under some high rocks, and whereI knew, by reason of the
currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come
with their boats on any account whatever. With my boat
I carried away everything that I had left there belonging
to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither,
via, a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing
like an anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could
make of its kind ; all these I removed, that there might
not be the least shadow for discovery, or appearance of any
boat, or of any human habitation upon the island. Besides
this, I kept myself more retired than ever, and seldom went
from my cell except upon my constant employment, to milk
my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood,
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
Out of danger.

1 lu'lim'o the reader of this will not think it strange, if
I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I
lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put an
end [0 all invention, and to all the contrivanecs that i had
laid for my future :wconunodations and conveuicm-cs. I
had the. care of my safety more now upon my hands than
that of my food. I 'arcd not to drive a. nail, or chop a
stick of wood now, for fear the noise I might make should
be heard: much less would I tire a gun for the same reason:
and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any tire,
lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the
day, should betray me. For this r rason, I removed that
part of my business which required lire, such as burning
of pets and pipes. &c., into my new apartment in the woods;
where, after 1 had been some time, I found, to my un-
speakable consolation, a more natural cave in the earth,
which went. in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage,
had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to
venture in.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great
rock, where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not
see abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to
Providence), I was cutting down some thick branches of
trees" to make charcoal; and before I go on 1 must observe
the reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I
said before; and yet I could not live there without baking
my bread, cooking my meat, 850., so I contrived to burn
some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf,
till it became ehark or dry coal; and then, putting the tire
out, I preserved the coal to car-r)v home, and perform the
other services for which tire was wanting, without danger of
smoke. But this is by-thc-by. While I was cutting down
some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch
of low brushwood or undcrwood, there was a kind of hollow
place: I was curious to look in it, and getting with dilliculty
into the mouth'of it, 1 found it was sufficient for me to stand
pnright in, and perhaps another with me; but I must
confess to you that I made more haste out than I did
in, when, looking farther into the place, and which was
perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some
creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinklcd
like two stars; the dim light from the cave's month shining
directly in, and making the reflection. However, after
some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself a
thousand fools, and to think that he who was afraid to see
the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all
alone; and that I might well think there was nothing in
this care that was more frightful than myself. Upon this,
plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and in
I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had
not gone three steps in before I was as much frightened as
before ; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in
some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as of
words halt" expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped
back, and was indeed struck with such a. surprise that it
put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my
head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have
lifted it oll'. But still plucking up my spirits as well as I
could, and encouraging myself a little with considering that
the power and presence of God was everywhere, and was
able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by the
light of the fircbrand, holding it up a little over my head,
1 saw lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-
goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life,
and dying, indeed, of mere old age. I stirred him a little
to see if 1 could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but
was not able to raise himself; and I thought with myself
he might even lie there--for if he had frightened me, so
he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any one of
them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had
any life in him.

I was new recovered from my surprise, and began to
look round me, when Ifound the cave was but very small--
it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of
shape, neither round nor square, no hands having ever been
employed in making it but those of more Nature. I
observed also that there was a place at the farther side of
it that went in further, but was so low that it required me
to keep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither
it went I knew not; so, having no candle, 1 gave it. over
for that. time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-
vided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of
the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the
pill).

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six
large candles of my own making (for I made very good
candles now of goats' tallow, but was hard set for candle-
wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes
the dried rind of a weed like nettles), and going into this
low place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours, alumst ten
yards--which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold
enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go,
nor what was beyond it. When I had got through the
strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near
twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in
the island, I dare say, as it was to look round the sides and
roof of this vault or cave--the wall reflected a hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles. What it was
in the rock--whether diamonds or other precious stones, or
gold--which I rather supposed it to be--I knew not. The-
place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto,
though perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and
had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it, so that there
was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only
difficulty in it was the entrance--which, however, as it was
a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
was a convenience--so that I was really rejoiced at the
discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some
of those things I was most anxious about to this place;
particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of
powder, and all my spare arms, viz, two fowling--pieces--
for I had three in all--and three niuskets--t'or of them I
had eight in all; so I kept in my castle only five, which
stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my out-most
fence, and were r \ady also to take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition I happened
to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea,
and which had been wet, and I found that the water had
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on
every side, which, caking and growing hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask.
This was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so
I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three
pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a sur-
prise of any kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had
left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who
were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where
none could come at them; for I persuaded myself, while I
was here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me,
they could never find me out--or if they did, they would
not venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found
expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day aftcrI
made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a.
great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there.

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place and the
manner of living, that, could I but have enjoyed the
certainty that no savages would come to the place to dis-
turb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for
spending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment,
till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the
cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions and
amusements, which made the time pass a great deal more
pleasantly with me than it did before ;--first, I had taught
my Pol], as I named before, to speak; and he did it so

very pleasant to me, for I believe no bird ever spoke
plainer--and he lived with me no less than six--and--twenty
years; how long he might have lived afterwards I know
not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that
they live a hundred years. My dog was a. pleasant and

time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they

hours, and began to be 1111patientf11r intelligence abroad,

and musing what I should do in this ease,l was not able to
hear sitting in ignorance any longer; so setting up 1113' lad~
111-1' 111 the side 01' the hill, where there was a 11th place, and
then pulling the ladder after 1110, I set it up again, and

upon the shore; and, as it was then ebb oi tide, they seemed

lt.1s not, easy to imaoine 1111111; confusion this sight put me
into e<|11'eliall3 seeing them come on my side 02 Pthc island,
and so near to me , but when I considered their coming must

to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might
go abroad with safety all the time 01' the flood of tide,
if they were not 011 shore before; and having made this ob-
servation. I went abroad about my harvest-work with the
more composure.

As I expected. so it proved; for, as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat and row
away. I should have observed. that for an hour or more
before they went 03' they were dancing, and I could easily
discern their postures and gestures by my glass.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my
great sword by my side without a scabbard, and with all the
speed I was able to make went away to the hill where I had
discovered the first appearance of all; and as soon as I got
thither, I perceived there had been three canoes more of the
savages at that place; and looking out farther, I saw they
were all at sea together, making over for the main. This
was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the
shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work
they had been about had left behind it. I was so filled with
indignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditate
the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be
whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that
the visits which they made thus to this island were not very
frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of
them came on shore there again--that is to say, I neither
saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all
that time; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by
reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming upon
me by surprise.

During all this time I was in the murdering humour, and
spent mOSt of my hours, which should have been better em-
ployed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon
them the very next time I should see them--especially if
they should be divided, asthey were the last time, into two
parties; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one party
--suppose ten or a dozen--I was still the next day or week,
or month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infinz'zum,
till I should be, at length, no less a murderer than they were
in being man-eaters--and perhaps much more so. I spent my
days now in great pcrplexity and anxiety of mind, expect-
ing that I should one day or other fall into the hands of
these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture
abroad, it was not without looking round me with the
greatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found,
at my great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided
to ame flock or herd of goats ; for I durst not upon any ac-"So I brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand. and making

count tire my gun, especially near that side of the island
where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages:
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them
come again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them in a few days, and then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more before
I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them
again, as I shall soon observe. It is true they might have
been there once or twice; but either they made no stay, or
at least I did not see them; but in the mouth of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year,
I had a very strange encounter with them; of which in its
place.

It was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day,
I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon
--for I marked all upon the post still--that it blew a. very
great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning
and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I knew
not what was the particular occasion of it; but as I was
reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious
thoughts about my present condition, I was surprised with
tho noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to
be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any I
had met with before; for the notions this put into my
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the
greatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of a.
hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a
second gun, which, accordingly, in about half-a--minute, I
heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part
of the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some ship in
distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other
ship in company, and fired these for signals of distress, and
to obtain help. I had the presence of mind, at that minute,
to think, that though I could not help them, it might be
they might help me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, and, making a good pile, I set it
on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely ;
and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly
out, so that. I was certain, it' there were any such a thing: as a
ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt. they did; for as
soon as ever my tire blazed 11p, 1 heard another gun, and
after that. several others, all from the same quarter. 1 plied
my lire all night. 111119;, till davbreakz and whenit w as broad
d:1\'. and the8 air cleared 1111, 1 saw something at a great
distance at. sea, full east of the island, whether a sail ora
111111 1 could not distinguisle--no, not 11 1th my glass; the
distance "as so 1.;1eat, :unl the n e 1ther still somethinw hazy
also: at least, it. was so out at sea

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon pereeived
that it. did not. more; so I presently concluded that it was
a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be
satisfied, 1 took my gun in my hand, and ran towards the
south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly
been 01.1'1 ied awav by the current, ' and getting up there,
the weather by this time being perleetly clear, 1 could
plainly see, to my ereat sorrow, the \\ rech ot a ship, cast
away in the night upon those eonce: 1led rocks 11inch l lound
when 1 was out in my boat. Had they seen the island, as
] must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endem'oured to have saved themselves on
shore by the help of their boat; but their tiring oll' guns for
help, especially when they saw. as 1 i111agined, my tire,
filled me with many thoughts. First, I inmgined that, upon
seeing my light, they might. have put themselves into their
boat. and endeavoured to make the shore; but that. the sea
running: very high, they 111ight have been cast away.
Other times I imagined that they might have lost their
boat before, as might be the. case many ways; particularly
by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many
times obliged them to stave, 01' take in pieces, their boat,
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands.
Other times, 1 hungined they had some other ship or ships
in company, who, upon the signals ot'distrcss they made, had
taken them up, and carried them ofl'. Other times I fancied
they were all gone oll'to sea in their boat, and being hurried
away by the current. that 1 had been formerly in, wore
carried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing
but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they might
by this time think of starving, and of being in a condition
to eat one another.

There are some secret moving springs in the affections,
which, when they are set a-going by some object in view,
or, though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind
by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the
soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings
of the subject, that the absence of it is insupportablc.
h'ueh were these earnest wishings that but one man had
been saved. I believe I repeated the words, " O that it had
been but one 1" a thousand times; and my desires were so
mored by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would
clinch together, and my fingers would press the palms of
my hands, so that if I had anything soft in my hand,
1 should have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in my
head would strike together, and set against one another so
strong, that for some time I could not part them again.
llut it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both,
forbade it, for till the last year of my being on this island,
I never know whether any were saved out of that ship or
no ; and had only the afllietion, some days after. to see the
t'm'psc of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the
island which was next the shipwreck; He had no clothes
on but a scaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so
nmeh as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing
in his pockets but two pieces-of--eight and a tobacco--pipe--
the last was to me of ten times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out
in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find
something on board that might be useful to me. But that
did not altogether press me so much, as the possibility that
there might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life,
comfort my own to the last degree ; and this thought clung
so to my heart that I could not. be quiet night nor day, but
I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and
committing the rest to God's providence, I thought the im--
pression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be
resisted, that. it. must. come from some invisihlo direction,
and that, I should ho \\'1Ulllllf__',' to myself il'l did not go.

Under the [mn'vr of this impression, I hastened haul: to
my castle. prepared everythingr for my \'U_\':Ig'(', took a
quantity of bread. a great: pot of fresh water, a compass to
steer by, a holtlv of rum (for 1 had still a great deal of
that left). and a ha<ket ol' raisins; and thus, loading my-
Svlt' with everything: necessary, [went down to my boat,
got. the water out ol' h-'r, grot. hcralloat, loaded all my cargo
in her, and then Went. home again for more. My second
cargo was a great. has: of rice. the nmhrvlla to set. up over
my head [or a shade. another large pot. of l'rosh water, and
about two dozen of small loaves. or harleywalios, more than
before, with a bottle 0F goat's milk, and a. (-heeso: all
of which. with great. lahoni' and sweat, I carried to my
hoat; and praying to God to (lll't't'l my voyage, I put out,
and rowingr the (-anoo along the shore, came at. last. to the
ntznost point of the island on the north-east; side, and
hauled my boat into a little week on the shore.

I resolved. the next morning, to set. out with the first of
the tide; and, imposing myself for the night. in my (-anoe,
under the groan watoh-eoat I mentioned, I lalun'hetl out,
and having a strong; stowage with my paddle, 1 went at a
great. rate, directly for the wreck. and in less than two
hours I mine up to it. 'It. was a dismal sight to look at:
the ship, which, lry its huildine', was Spanish. stuck fast,
jannned in lH'l-Wt't'll two l'Ut'le, all the stern and quarter of
her were. beaten to pii'm's hy the sea; and as her i'orm'astle,
which siuvlg in [he rot-ks. had run on with great. Viult'llCL',
her mainmast. and t'oremasi. were hrolwn short, otl'; but her
ln'HVSlll'lt. was sound, and the haul and how appeared firm.
When 1 came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who
seeing: me coming. yelped and cried; and as soon as I
called him, jumped into the sea to come to me: I took him
into the hunt. but found him almost: dead with hunger and
thirst. 1 gave him a. cake. of my bread, and he. devoured
it, lik ? a ravenous wolt' that lliltl been starvingr a fortnightin
the snow: 1 then gave the poor creature some. fresh water,
with which, il' 1 had let, him, he would have hnrst himself.
After this I went on board; but the first sight; 1 met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the
ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded,
as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in
a storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually over her,
that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if
they had been under water. Besides the dog, there was
nothing left in the ship that had life; nor any goods, that I
could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were
some easks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not,
which layr lower in the hold, and which, the water being
ehhed 1nd,] eould see; but they were too big to meddle with.
.I saw several chests, which I believed belonged to some of
the seamen : and 1 got two of them into the boat, without
examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship
been lixed, and the i'orepart broken oil', I am persuaded I
might have made a good voyage; for, by what I found in
these two chests, I had reason to suppose the ship had
a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess from
the course she steered, she must have been bound from
Luenos Ay res, 01 the Itio de la I'lata, in the south part of
America, beyond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf
oi Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt,
a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to any-
body; but what became of the crew I then know not.

1 found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor,
of about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with
much dillieulty. There were several mnskets in the cabin,
and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder
in it: as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I
left. them, but took the powder-horn. I took the fire-shovel
and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little
b1ass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron , and with this cargo, and the (log, I came away, the
tide beginning to make home again : and the same evening,
about an hour within night, 1 reached the island again,
weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that
night in the boat; and in the morning I icsolved to
11.11 hour what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it
home to my castle. DAfter refreshing myself I got all my
cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars.
The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not
such as we had at the Brazils; and, in a. word, not at all
good ; but when I came to open the chests, I found seve 'al
things of great use to me: for example, I found in one a
line ease of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and tilled with
cordial waters, fine and ver good. The bottles held about
three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two
pots of very good succades, or swectmeats, so fastened also
on the top that the salt water had not hurt them; and two
more of the same, which the, water had spoiled. I found
some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me;
and about a dozen and a half of white liner. haudkerehiet's,
and coloured neekuloths; the former were also very welcome,
being exceedingly refreshing," to wipe my face in a hot day.
Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found
there three great, bags of pieces--of-cight, which held about;
eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped
up in a paper, six donhloons of gold, and some small bars
of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. In
the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but,
by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's
mate ; though there was no powder in it except two pounds
of fine glazed powder. in three small flasks, kept, I suppose,
for charging their fouling--pieces on occasion. Upon the
whole, I got. very little by this voyage that was of any use
to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion
for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would
haw given it all tor three or four pairs ot English shoes and
steekinns which 11 ere things I greatly wanted, but had had
none on my feet for many years. I had, indeed, got two
pairs of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two
drowned men, whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two

pairs more in one of the chests which were very welcome to
me; but they 11 ere not like our English shoes, either
for case or service, being rather what we call pumps than
shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces-of-
eight, in rials, but 110 gold: I suppose this belonged to a.
poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to some
otliccr. Well, however, I logged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had
oronght from my own ship; but it was a great pity, as I
said, that- the other part of this ship had not Come to
my share; for I am satisfied I might have loaded my 0 nee
sv\'t"':tl times over with money; and, thought I, if I ever
escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come
again and fetch it.

Having now hrought all my things onshore, and sec Il'ed
them, I went l):l('l\' to my boat, and rowed her along the
shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made
the host of my way to my old habitation, where I found
everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself,
live alter my old fashion, and take care of my family
aliltirs; and fo- awhile I lived easy enough, only that I was
more vigilant than I used to be. looked out ot'tener, and did
not. go abroad so much; and if, at. any time, 1 did stir with
any freedom, it was always to the east part of the island,
where I was pretty well satislied the savages never came,
and where I could go without so many precautions, and such
a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with
me il' .1 went the other way. I lived in this condition near
two years more ; but my unlucky head, that was always to
let me know it was horn to make my body miserable, was
all these two years filled with projects and designs, how, if
it. were p<.issiblt.-., I might get, away from this island; for,
sonmtimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck,
though my reason told me that there was nothing left
there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for
a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily,
it" I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured to sea, bound anywhere, I knew not whither.

I am new supposed to be retired into my castle, aftermy
late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured
under water, as usual, and my condition restored to whatit
was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than what I had
before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more
use for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
'ame there.

l 11:;111 mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to
yet one of these savages into my hands, cost 1111.11 it would.
My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this, in-
deed, was very ditlicnlt to resolve on; but as I could
pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to
put. myself upon the watch, to see them when they mm: on
shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking such measures
as the olmortnnity should present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon
the scout. as often as possible, and indeed so often, that
I was heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and
a half that I waited ; and for great part, of that time went
out to the west-end, and to the south-west corner of the
island almost every day, to look for 'anoes, but none
apg'mared. This was very discouraging, and began to
trouble me much; but the longer it Seemed to be delayed,
the. more eager l was for it: in a word, I was not at first
so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid
1min}: seen by them, as I vas now eager to be upon
them. Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to malte
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct
them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do me
any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with
this allitir; but nothing still presented itself; all my
fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came
near me for a great while.

About. a year and a half after I entertained these
notions, I was surprised one morning by seeing no less than
five eanoes all on shore together on my side the island, and
the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my
sight. The number of theta broke all my measures; for
seeing so many, and knowing that they always came four or
six, or sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to
think of it, or how to talte my measures, to attack twenty
or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, per-
l'ulexed and dis-comforted. However, I put myself into the
same pesition to - an attack that I had formerly provided,
and wasjust ready for action, if anything had presented
llll'u'itn,r waited a good while, listening to hear it' they
made any noise, at length. being very impatient, I set my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clam'oered up to the top
of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so,
however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that
they could not perceive me by any means. Here I
observed, by the help of my perspective glass, that they
were no less than thirty in number; that they had a fire
kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they had
cooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were
all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures
and figures, their own way, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by
my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from
the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them im-
mediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with
a club or wooden sword, for that was their way; and two
or three others were at work immediately, cutting him
open for their cookery, while the other victim was left
standing by himself, till they should be ready for him. In
that very moment, this poor wretch, seeing himself a little
at liberty, and unbound, Nature inspired him withbopcs of
life, and he started away from them, and ran with in-
credible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me; I
mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation
was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge,
when I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as
I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole body; and now
I expected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and
that he would certainly take shelter in my grove: but I
could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the
other savages would not pursue him thither, and find him
there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began
to recover when I found that there was not above three men
that followed him ; and still more was I encouraged, when
I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running,
and gained ground on them ; so that, if he could but hold
out for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away
from them all.

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which
I mentioned often in the first part of my story, where
I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly
he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be
taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither, he
made nothing of it, though the tide was then 11p, but,
plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or there-
abouts, landed, and ran with exceeding strength and swift-
ness. When the three persons came to the creek, I found
that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and
that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others,
but went no farther, and soon after Went softly back again;
which, as it happened, was very well for him in the end. I
observed that the two who swam were yet more than twice
as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that
fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts,
and, indeed, irresistiblv, that now was the time to vet me a
ser1a11t, and, perhaps, a companion or assistant, and that I
was plainly called by Providence to save this poor creature's
life. I i111mediately ran down the ladders with all possible
expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the
foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and get-ting 11p
again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed to~
11 '11 ds the sea; and having "a very short cut, and all do11 n hill,
placed 1111' selt" 1n the 11'ayD'1bet11een the pursuers and the pur-
sued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking black,
was at first, perhaps, as much frightened at me as at them; but
I beckoned 11 ith my hand to him to come back , and, in the
meantime, I slow ly ad1anced towards the two that follow ed;

then 111sl1inn- at once upon the foremost, I knocked him
down with the stock of my piece. I was loath to fire, be-
cause I would not have the rest hear; though, at that dis-
tance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out of
sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known what
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other,
who pursued him, stopped, as if he had been frightened,
and 1 advanced towards him: but as I came nearer, I pel-
ceiv ed p1csently he had a bow and anew, and was fitting
it to shoot at me: so I was then obliged to shoot at him
first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The
poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw
both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, was so
frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
stock still, and neither came forward nor went backward,
though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come
on. I halloocd again to him, and made signs to come for-
ward, which be easily understood, and came a little way;
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped
again; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling,
as if he had been taken prisoner, and was just going to be
killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned him again to
come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement
that I could think of ; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and
looked pleasantly, and beckoned him to come still nearer:
at length, he came close to me ; and then he kneeled down
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the
ground, and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his
head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and
encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to
do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I had knocked
down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and be-
gan to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed
him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke
some words to me, and though I could not understand
them, yet I thought they were very pleasant to hear; for
they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard,
my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there
was no time for such reflections now ; the savage who was
knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon
the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to
be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other
piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this, my
savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side,
which I did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly, no
executioner in Germany could Have done it sooner or
better; which I thought very strange for one who, I had
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, ex-
cept their own wooden swords: however, it seems, as---.--,---;v:r'..v, --.- - - ,. ""--Q ~ ~- - 5 - . -. "Iva--u".

I learned afterwards, they made their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will
even cut ofi' heads with them, aye, and arms, and that at one
blow, too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in
sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with
abundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it
down, with the head of the savage that he had killed just
before me. But that which astonished him most, was to
know how I killed the other Indian so far off; so pointing
to him, he made signs to me to let him go to him ; and I
bade him go, as well as I could. When he came to him,
he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him first
on one side, then on the other; looked at the wound the
bullet had made, which it seems was just in his breast,
where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood
had flowed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back ;
so I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me,
making signs to him that more might come after them.
Upon this, he made signs to me that he should bury them
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they
followed; and so I made signs for him again to do so. He
fell to work, and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the
sand with his hands big enough to bury the first in,
and then dragged him into it, and covered him ; and did so
by the other also; I believe he had buried them both in
a quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried
him. not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the
farther part of the island : so I did not let my dream come
to pass in that part, that he came into my grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great dis-
tress for, from his running: and having refreshed him, I
made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him
a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon
it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; so the poor
creature lay down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made,
with straight, strong limbs, not too large, tall and well
shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age.MM. 6 MET/2 17054: >

"He kneeled down again. kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the
ground, and. taking me by the foot, set it upon his head."
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly
aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his
face; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a
European in his countenance too, especially when he
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled liko
wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great vi-
vacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of
his skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not
an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Vir-
ginians, and other natives of America are, but of a bright
kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it something very
agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face was
round and plump; his nose small, not flat like the negroes;
a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set,
and as white as ivory.

After he had slumbered about half an hour, he awoke
again, and came out of the cave to me; for I had been
milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by:
when he cspicd me, he came running to me, laying himself
down again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of
an humble, thankful dispOsition, making a great many antic
gestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon
the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon
his head, as he had done before; and after this, made
all the signs of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so long
as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him
know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time, I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and,
first, I let him know his name should be FRIDAY, which
was the day I saved his life: I called him so for the
memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master;
and then let him know that was to be my name: I likewise
taught him to say Yes or No, and to know the meaning of
them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him
see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it; and
gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly
complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all night; but, as soon as it was day, 1
beckoned him to come with me, and let him know I would
give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for
he was stark naked. As we went by the place where he
had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place,
and showed me the marks that he made to find them again,
making signs to me that we should dig them up again and
eat them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my
abhorreuce of it, and beckoned with my hand to him
to come away, which he did immediately, with great sub-
mission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone; and, pulling out my glass, I looked,
and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no ap-
pearance of them or their canoes; so that it was plain they
Were. gone, and had left their two com 'ades behind them,
without any search after them.

But I was not content. with this discovery; but having
now more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took
my man Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand,
with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found
he could use very (lt'xtt'rtmsly, making him carry one gun
for me, and I two for myself; and away we marched to the
place where these creatures had been; for I had a mind
now to get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came
to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my
heart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle ; in-
deed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,
though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and
great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled
and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the tri-
umphant feast they had been making there, after a. victory
over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the
bone< of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other
parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me
understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast
Upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that be,
pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had been a
great battle between them and their next king, of whose
subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners; all of which were
carried to several places, by those who had taken them in
the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by
these wretches upon those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatevur remained, and lay them together in a heap, and
make a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. 1
found Friday had still a. hankering stomach after some
of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I
showed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, that
he durst not discover it: for I had, by some means, let him
know that I would kill him if he offered it.

\Vhen he had done this, we came back to our castle; and
there I fell to work for my man Friday; and, first of all, I
gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the
poor gunner's chest I mentioned, which I found in the
wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very
well; and then I made him a jerkiu of goat's skin, as well
as my skill would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably
good taller); and I gave him a. cap which I made of harc's
skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough: and thus he
was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was
mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as
his master. It is true, he went awkwardly in these clothes
at first: wearing the drawers was very awkward to him,
and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and
the inside of his arms; but a little easing them where he
complained they hurt him, and using himself to them,
he took to them at length very well.

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him,
I began to consider where I should lodge him; and, that I
might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my
two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the out-
side of the first. As there was a door or entrance there
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and adoor
to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, 2: little within
the entrance ; and, causing the door to open in the inside,
I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders. too; so
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my
innermost wall, without making so much noise in getting
over that it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had
now a complete roof o1 er it of long poles, em ering all my
tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill, which was
again laid across 111th smaller sticks, instead of laths,
and then thatched 01er a great thickness with the rice-
st1"a11-, which was strong, like reeds, and at the hole which
was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind
of trap--door, which, if it had been attempted on the 011t-
side, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen
down and made a great noise: as to weapons, I took them
all into my side every night. ButI needed none of all this
precaution; for never man had a more faithful, loving,
sincere servant than Friday was to me; without passions,
sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his
very afl'ections were tied to me, like those of a child to a
father; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life to
save mine, upon any occasion whatsover: the many tes--
timonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon
convinced me that I needed to use no precautions for my
safety on this account.

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my
business to teach him everything that was proper to make
him useful, handy, and helpful ; but especially to make him
speak, and understand me when 1 spoke: and he was the
aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he
could but understand 111e, or make me understand him, that
it was very pleasant tome to talk to him. Now my life be-
gan to be so easy that I began to say to myself, that could
I but have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I
was never to remove from the place where I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday from
his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a
cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I
took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,
indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it home and dress it; but, as I was going, I saw a she-
goat. lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
by her. I caught hold of Friday --" Hold" ' said i,
"stand still; " and made signs for him not to stir: imme-
diately, I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of
the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance, in-
deed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know,
nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised;
tmmbled, and shock, and looked so amazed that I thought
he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot
at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat,
to feel whether he was not wounded; and as I found pre-
sently, thought I was resolved to kill him : for he came and
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great
many things I did not understand; but I could easily see
the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him
no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him,
and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to
him to run and fetch it, which he did: and while he
was wondering, and looking to see how the creature
was killed, I loaded my gun again. By-the-by, I saw a
great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon atree within shot: so,
to let Friday understand a little what I would do, I called
him to me again, pointed at the few], which was indeed a
parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, point-
ing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accord-
ingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he
saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again,
notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was
the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything
into the gun, but thought that there must be some wonder-
ful fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill
man, beast, or bird, or anything near or far off; and
the astonishment this created in him was such as could not
wear off for a long time; and, I believe, if I would have
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As
for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for
several days after; but he would speak to it and talk to it,
as if it had answered him, when he was by himself; which,
as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill
him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this,
I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot,
which he did, hut, stayed some time; for the parrot, not
being quite dead, had fluttered away a good distance from
the lh'aee where she. fell: however, he. found her, took her
up, and brought. her to me; and as .1 had pia'eeived his ig~
norauee about the. gun before, I took this adr:mta}_~;e to
eharge the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that
1 might be ready for any other mark that. might. present;
but nothin}: more oll'ered at that. time: so I brought home
the kid, and the same evening; 'I_ took the skin etl', and cut
it out. as well as 1 ronld; and haviniflr a pot lit for that pur-
pose, 1 hoiled or stewed seine of the flesh, and made some
very good hroth. .Al'ter I had begun to eat some, I gave
some to my man. who seemed very glad of it, and liked it.
very well; but that whieh was strangest. to him was to see
me out salt with it. lle made a sign to me that the salt was
not .L'ood to ca; and putting a little into his own month,
he seemed to nanseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,
washing: his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other
hand, 1 took some meat into my month without salt, and I
pretended to spit andsputter for want of salt. as much as he
had done at the salt; lmt it would not do ; he would never
care for salt with his meat. or in his broth, at least not fora
great while, and then but a very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of
the kid : this 1 did by hanging it before the tire on a string,
as 1 had seen many people do in England, setting two
poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across on the
top, and tying: the string to the cross stiek. letting the meat
turn continually. This Friday admired very much; but
when he came to taste the ilesh, he took so many ways to
tell me how he liked it, that 1 could not but understand
him: and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would
never 'at man's llesh any more, which 1 was very glad to
hear.

The next. day, 1 set him to work at heating some com
out, and sitting it in the manner 1 used to do, as 1 observed
before ; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
especially after he had seen what the meaning of it. was, and
that it was to make bread of ; for after that, I let him see
me make my bread and bake it too; and, in a little time,
Friday was able to do all the work for me as well 2181 could
do it myself.

I began now to consider that, having two mouths to feed
instead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do; so I
marked out a larger piece of land, and began to fence in
the same manner as before, in which Friday not only
worked very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheer-
fully: and I told him what it was for--that it was for corn
to make more bread, because he was now with me, and that
I might have enough for him and myself too. He appeared
very sensible of that part, and let me know that ho thougfiit
I had much more labour upon me on his account than Iliad
for myself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I
would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand
the names of almost everything I had occasion to call for,
and of every place I had to send him to, and talked a great
deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to have some use
for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had little occasion
for before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I hada
singular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple,
unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every
day, and I began really to love the creature; and, on his
side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him
ever to love anything before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his
own country again; and having taught him English so well
that he could answer me almost any question, I asked him
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in
battle? At which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we
always fight the better ;" that is, he meant, always get the
better in fight; and so we began the following dis-
course :--

Master.-You always fight the better; how came you to
be taken prisoner then, Friday?
E'I'o'.I_I1.--'.\l'y n:' 'ion bent much for all that.

came you to be taken?

nation over-beat them in the yonder place, where me no was:

plaee.

Nashua--Have you been here with them?

1"I'l'([(I.I/.--\'CS, l have been here (points to the NJV. side
of the island, which, it seems, was their side).

By this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the
farther part of the island, on the same man-eating occasion:
he was now brought for: and, some time after, when
1 took the courage to earry him to that side, being the same
I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me he was there once, when they eat up twenty men, two
women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in English,
but he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row,
and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what
follows. After this discourse I had with him, I asked him
how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether
the canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no
danger, no canoes crer lost ; but that after a little way out
to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in the
morning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to
be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming
in; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the
great draft and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the
mouth or gulph of which river, as I found afterwards, our
island lay; and that this land which I perceived to the W.
and NW. was the great island of Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand
questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the
coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he knew,
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the
names of tho several nations of his sort of people, but could
get no other name than that of Caribs: from which I
easily understood that these were the Carihbees, which our
maps place on the part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to
St. Martha. He told me, that up a great way beyond the
moon, that was, beyond the setting of the meon, which
must be west from their country, there dwelt white-
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers;
and that they had killed much mans, that was his word: by
all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
eruelties in America had been spread over the whole
country, and were remembered by all the nations from
father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this
island and get among these white men: he told me, " Yes,
yes, you may go in two canoe." I could not understand
what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant
by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he
meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse I relished very well; and
from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or
other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from
this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to
help me.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to and understand me, I was
wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his

mind; particularlyIasked him one time, who made him 2 The
l 1
poor creature did not understand me at all, but thought I
asked him who was his father: but I took it up by another
handle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we
walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, " It was
one Benamuckee, that lived beyond all ;" he could de-
scribe nothing of this great person, but that he was very
old, " much older," he said, "than the sea or the land, the
moon or the stars." I asked him then, if this old person
had made all things, why did not all things worship him?
He looked very grave, and with aperfect look of innocence,
said, "All things say 0 to him." I asked him, if the
people who die in his country went anywhere? He said,
"Yes, they all went up to Benamuckee." Then I asked
him whether those they eat up went thither too? He said,
" Yes."

From these things,I began to instruct him in the know-
ledge of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of
all things lived up there, pointing up towards heaven; that
He governed the world by the same power and providence
by which he made it; that He was omnipotent, and
could do everything for us, give everything to us--take
everything from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his
e cs.

yI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all
the methods I took for this poor creature's instruction, and
must acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same
principle will find, that in laying things open to him,
I really informed and instructed myself in many things that
either I did not know, or had not fully considered before,
but which occurred naturally to my mind upon searching
into them, for the information of this poor savage; and I
had more affection in my inquiry after these things upon
this occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether this
poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had great
reason to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief
sat lighter upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to me
beyond measure: and when I reflected that in this solitary
life which I had been confined to, I had not only been
moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek the hand
that brought me here, but was now to be made an instru--~ -- ~~- . - "wry-mm -g:--.--~:rq-----------.

meat, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I
knew, the soul of a poor savage.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of
my time ; and the conversation which employed the hours
between Friday and me was such as made the three years
Ivhich we lived there together perfectly and completely
lappy.

After Friday and I had become more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I said to
him, and speak pretty fluently, though in broken English,
to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at least so
much of it as related to my coming to this place; how I had
lived there, and how long: I let him into the mystery,
for such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he
was wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a belt,
with a frog hanging to it; and in the frog, instead of a
hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good
a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon other
occasions.

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we
worshipped God, how we behaved to one another; and how
we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him
an account of the wreck which I had been aboard of, and
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay:
but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed
him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped,
and which I could not stir with all my strength then; but
was now fallen almost to pieces. Upon seeing this boat,
Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I
asked him what it was he studied upon. At last, says he,
"Me see such boat like come to place at my nation." I
did not understand him a good while: but, at last, when I
had examined farther into it, I understood by him that a
boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country
where he lived. I presently imagined that some European
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and the
boat might get loose and drive ashore; but was so dull that
I never once thought of men making their escape from
thither, much less whence they might come; so I only in-
quired after the deSeription of the boat.

Friday described the heat to me well enough; hut.
brought me hetter to understand him when he added with
some warmth, "We save the white mans t'rom drown."
Then .I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he
called them, in the heat. " Yes," he said; " the boat full
of white mans." I asked him how many. He. tohl upon
his fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became of
them. lle told me, "they live, they dwell at my nation."

This put new thoughts into my head; for 1 presently
imagined that. these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was east away in the sight. of my island, and who, after
the ship was struelc on the rock, and they saw her ine--
\'itahly lost. had saved themselves in their boat, and were
landed upon that. wild shore among the savages. Upon
this 1 inquired of him more critically what. \'as become of
them. He assured me they still lived there; that they had
been there about four years; that the savages left them
alone, and gave them vietuals to live on. I asked him how
it. came to pass they did not kill and eat them. lle said,
" No. they make brother with them ;" that is, as 1 under-
stood him, a truee; and then he added, " They no eat
mans but when make the war tightf' that is to say, they
never eat any men but such as come to light with them,
and are taken in battle.

It was after this some eousiderahletime, that being upon
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, from
which I had, in a clear day, discovered the eoutineut of
America, the weather being very serene, Friday looks very
earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of sur-
prise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for
I was at some distance from him. I asked what was
the matter. "Ojoy 1" says he; " 0 glad! there, see my
country; there my nation 1" 1 observed an extraordinary
sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes
sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange eager-
ness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again.
This observation at mine put a great many thoughts into
me, which made me, at first, not. so easy about my man
Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that, it
Friday could get back to his own nation again, he would
not only forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me,
and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an
account of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might
be as merry as he used to he with those of his enemies,
when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor,
honest creature very much, for which I was very sorry
afterwards. Howevur, as my jealousy increased, and held
me some weeks, I was a. little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before: the honest, grateful
creature having no thought about it but what consisted
with the best principles, both as a religious Christian and
as a grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full
satisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted. you may he sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of
the new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I
found everything he said was so honest and so innocent,
that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his
own again; nor did he in the least perceive thatI was
uneasy, and therefore 1 could not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I
called to him and said, "Friday, do not you wish your-
self in your own country, your nation?" " Yes," he
said, "I be much 0 glad to be at my own nation."
"What would you do there '2" said I: "would you turn
wild again, eat men's flesh, and be a savage, as you were
before ?" He looked full of concern, and shaking his head.
said, " N o, no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them to
pray God; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, mill:_
no out man again." " Why, then," said I to him, " they
will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then said,
"No, no, they no kill me, they willing love to learn." He
meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added,
" They learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat." Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He
smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so for. I
told him I would make a canoe for him. He told me he
would go, if I would go with him. "I go l" say I; " why
they will eat me if I go there." "No, no," says he, "me
make they no eat you; me make they much love you."
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were
to seventeen white men, who came on shore there in
distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I could possibly join with those bearded men,
who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese;
not doubting but, it' I could, we might find some method
to escape from there, being upon the continent, and a.
good company together, better than I could from an island
forty miles oll' the shore, alone, and without help. So,
alter some days, I took Friday to work again, by 1. ay of
discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to go back
to his own nation: and, accordingly, 1 carried him to my
flirvate, which lay on the other side of the island, and
having cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in
water), I brought it out, showed it to him, and we both
went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at
111anaging it, and would make it go almost as swift again as
I could. So, when 110 11 ere in, I said to him, " Well, now,
F1iday, shall we go to your nation 7" He looked very dull

at 1111's:1ying so; because he tiiotwllt the boat was too small
to go so far. I then told him5 I had a bigger: so the
next day I went to the place where the first boat lay which
I had made, but which I could not get into the water. He
said that was big enough: but then, as I had taken no care
01' it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years there,
the sun had split and dried it, that it was rotten. Friday
told me such a boat would do very well, and would carry
"much enough vittlc, drink, bread."

Upon the whole, I 111 as by this time so fixed upon my de-
sic'n of woing over with him to the continent, that I told
him we Owould go and make one as big as that, and he
should go homoD in it. He answered not one word, but
looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the
matter with him. He asked me again, " Why you angry
mad with Friday i--what me done i" I asked him what
he meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all.
" N o angry i" says he, repeating the words several times,
"why send Friday home away to my nation i" " Why,"
says I, " Friday, did not you say you wished you were
there 1" " Yes, yes," says he, "wish we both there; no
wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would
not think of going there without me. " I go there,
Friday!" says I, " what shall I do there i" He turned very
quick upon me at this. "You do great deal much good,"
says he; " you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame
mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new
life." "Alas, Friday l" says I, "thou knowest not what
thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself." "Yes,
yes," says he, "you teaches me good, you teachee them
good." " No, no, Friday," says I, " you shall go without
me; leave me here to live by myself, as I did before." He
looked confused again at that word ; and running to one of
the hatchcts which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily,
and gives it to me. " What must I do with this i" says I
to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. " What mustI
kill you for ?" said I again. He returns very quick---
" What do you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday,
no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly that I
saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly
discovered the utmost affection in him to me, and a. firm re-
solution in him, that I told him then, and often after, that
I would never send him away from me, if he was willing to
stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled
affection to me, and that nothing could part him from me,
so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own
country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and
his hopes of my doing them good; a thing which, as I had
no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or inten-
tion, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong
inclination to attempt my escape, founded on the suppo-
sition gathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen
bearded men there; and therefore, without any more de-
lay, I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree
proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to un-
dertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the
island to have built a little fleet of good largo vessels ; but
the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the
water that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid
the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched
upon a tree; for I, found that he knew much better than I
what kind of wood was fittest for it. Friday wished to
burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a
boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools; which,
after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily;
and. in about a month's hard labour, we finished it and
made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes,
which [ showed him how to handle, we cut and hewcd the
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, however,
it. cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it
were, inch by inch, upon great rollers, into the water: but
when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with
great case.

When she was in the water, though she was so big,
it amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my
man Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. So I asked him it' he would, and if we might, ven-
ture over in her? " Yes," he said, " we venture over in
her very well, though great blow wim ." However, 1 had
a farther design that he knew nothing of, and that was to
make a must and a sail, and to (it her with an anchor and a
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I
pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found
near the place, and which there were great plenty of in the
island, and 1 set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the
sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had pieces of
old sails enough; but as I had had them now six-undo
twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to pre-
serve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind
of use for them, 1 did not doubt but they were all rotten;
and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two
pieces, which appeared pretty good, and with these I went
to work; and with a great deal of pains and awkward
stitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in
England a shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom
at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how
to manage, as it was such a one as I had to the boat when
1 made my escape from Barbary.

I was near two months performing this last work, viz.,
rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them
very complete, making a short stay, and a sail, or foresail to
it, to assist if we should turn to windward; and what was
more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer
with.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach
as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for,
though he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew
nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was
the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and
again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail gihhed
and tilled, this way or that way, as the course we sailed
changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like one
astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I
made all these things familiar to him, and he became an
expert sailor--except that of the compass I could make
him understand very little. 0n the other hand, as there
was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any
fogs in those parts, there was less occasion for a compass,
seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the
shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody
cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twenticth year of
my captivity in this place; though the last three years that
] had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of
the account, my habitation being quite of another kind than
in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniversary of my
landing here with the same thankfulness to God for his
mercies as at first: and if I had such cause of acknowledg-
ment at first, Iliad much more so now, having such ad-
ditional testimonies of the care of Providence ever me, and
the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily dev
livered; for I had an invincible impression upon my
thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that I
should not be another year in this place. I went on, how-
ever, with my husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing,
as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every
necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, whenI
kept more within doors than at other times. "We had
stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her
up into the creek, where I landed my rafts from the ship;
and hauling her up to the shore at high-w ater mark, Imade
my man I 1iday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold
hm, and just deep enough to give her water to float in;
and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam
across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay
dry as to the tide from the sea: and, to keep the rain oil',
we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was
as well thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the
months of November and December, in which I intended to
make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design came in with the fair weather, I was preparing
daily for the voyage. And the first thing I did was to lay
by a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our
voyage; and intended, in a week or a fortuight's time, to
open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one
morning upon something of this kind, when I called to
Friday, and bade him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could
find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally get
once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh.
Friday had not been long gone when he came running back,
and flew over my outer wall or fence, like one that felt not
the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and before
I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, " 0 master!
0 master! 0 sorrow! O sorrow! 0 bad!" "What's the
matter, Friday ?" says I. " O yonder there," says he,
" one, two, three canoes; one, two, three '" By this way
of speaking I concluded there were six; but on inquiry, I
found there were but three. "Well, Friday," says I," do
not be frightened." So I heartened him up as well as I
could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly
seared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come
to look for him, and would cut him in pieces and eat him;
and the poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely knew what
to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and
told him I was in as much danger as he, that they would
eat me as well as him. "But," says I, "Friday, we must
resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?" " Me
shoot," says he, " but there come many great number."
" No matter for that," said I, again; " our guns will fright
those that we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I
resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as I bid him. He said, "Me die, when
you bid die, master." So I went and fetched a good dram
of rum and gave him; for I had been so good a husband of
my rum, that I had a great deal left. When he had drunk
it, I made him take the two fowling--pieees, which we
always carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as
big as small pistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and
loaded them with two slugs, and five small bullets each. I
hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave
Friday his hatchet. WhenI had thus prepared myself, I
took my perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found quickly by
my glass that there were one-and-twenty savages, three
prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole business
seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three
human bodies. I observed also that they had landed, not
where they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and where a
thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This, with
the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came
about, filled me with such indignation that I came down
again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to
them, and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand
by me. He had now got over his fright, and his spirits
being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was
very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die whenI
bid die. .

In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged,
as before, between us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in
his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder, and I took
one pistol and the other three guns myself; and in this
posture we marched out. 1 took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder
and bullets; and as to orders, 1 charged him to keep close
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I
bid him, and, in the meantime, not to speak a word. In
this posture. I fetched a compass to my right hand of near
a mile, as Well to get orer the creek as to get into the
wood, so that I could come within shot. of them before I
should be discovered, which .1 had seen by my glass it was
easy to do.

While I was makingr this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution: I do not mean
that. l entertained any fear of their number, for, as they
were naked, unarmed wretehes, it is certain I was superior
to tlmm--nay, though I had been alone. lut it occurred
to my thoughts, what occasion, much less what necessity, I
was in to go and dip my hands in blood; to attack people
who had neither done nor intended me any wrong? who,
as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs
were their own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of
(lod's having left them, with the other nations of that part
of the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman
courses, but did not. call me executioner of His justice---
that. whenever He thought tit He would take the cause into
His own hands, and by national vengeance punish them, as
a people, for national crimes; but that, in the meantime, it
was none of my business--that it was true Friday might
justify it, he -ause he was a declared enemy, and in a. state
of war with these very particular people, and it was lawful
for him to attack them--but I could not say the same with
regard to myself. These things were so warmly pressed
upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I
would go and place myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as God
should direct; but unless something oti'ered that was more
a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with
them.
With this resolution, I entered the wood, and with all
possible wariness, Friday following close at my heels. I
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood on the side
which was next to them, only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday,
and showing him a great tree which was just at the corner
of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word
if he could see there plainly what they were doing. He did
so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they
might be plainly viewed there--that they were all about
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that
another lay bound upon the sand a little from them, whom
he said they would kill next, and this fired the very soul
within me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but
one of the bearded men he had told me of, that came
to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at
the very naming of the white bearded man; and going to
the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay
upon the beach of the sea with his hands and feet tied, and.
that he was a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was,
which, by going a little way about, I saw I might come at
them ; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed en-
raged to the highest degree: and going back about twenty
paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree, and then came to a. little rising
ground, which gave me a full view of them at a distance of
about eighty yards.

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the
dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled
together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the
poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, limb by limb to their
tire, and they were steeping down to untic the bands at his
feet. I turned to Friday :--" N ow, Friday," says I, " do as
I bid thee." Friday said he would. " Then, Friday,"
says I, "do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing."
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with
the other musketItook my aim at the savages, bidding him
do the like: then asking him if he was ready, he said
" Yes." " Then fire at them," said I i and at the same mo-
ment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the
side he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three
more; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two.
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation;
and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their feet,
but did not immediately know which way to run, or which
way to look, for they knew not whence their destruc-
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I
had hidden him, he might observe what I did ; so, as soon as
the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took
up the fowling-pieoe, and Friday did the like; he saw me
cock and present; he did the same again. "Are you
ready, Friday ?" said I. " Yes," says he. "Let fly, then,"
says I, "in the name of God i" and with that I fired again
among the amazed wretchcs, and so did Friday; and as
our pieces were new loaded with what I call swan-shot, or
small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop: but so many
were wounded that they ran about yelling and screaming
like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them miserably
wounded, whereof three more fell quickly after, though not
quite dead.

" N ow, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged
pieces, and taking up the musket which was yet loaded,
"follow me," which he did with a great deal of courage;
upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself,
and Friday close at my feet. As soon as I perceived they
saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do
so too, and running as fast as possible towards the poor
victim, who was lying upon the beach between the place
where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were
just going to work with him, had left at the surprise of our
first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and
had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest went
the same we . I turned to Friday, and bade him step
forwards an fire at them; he understood me immediately,
and running about forty yards, to be nearer, he shot; and
I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall ofand at the same moment I fired

a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up again
quickly; however, he killed two of them, and wounded the
third so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he
had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing
his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him in the
Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered in Latin,
Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could
scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket,
and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate.
Then I asked him what countryman he was: and he said
Espagniole ; and being a little recovered, let me know, by
all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in
my debt for his deliverance. " Seignior," said I, with as
much Spanish as I could make up, " we will talk after-
wards, but we must fight now: if you have any strength
left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you." He
took them very thankfully ; and no sooner had he the
arms in his hands, but, as if they had put new vigour into
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had out
two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the
whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so
much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell
down from mere amazement and fear, and had no more power
to attempt their own escape than their flesh had to resist
our shot: and that was the case of those five that Friday
shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt
they received, so the other two fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being
willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the
Spaniard my pistol and sword: so I called to Friday, and
bade him run up to the tree from which we first fired, and
fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged,
which he did with great swiftness: and then giving him
my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again,
and bade them come to me when they wanted. While I
was leading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement
between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at
him with one. of their great wooden swords, the weapon that
was to have killed him before, it' I had not prevented it.
The. Spaniard, who was us hold and brave as could be
imagined, though weak, had fought the Indian 9. good
while. and had out two great wounds on his head; but the
savage, being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had
thrown him down, being faint, and was "winging,r my sword
out of his hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost,
wisely (llliillllg the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle,
shot. the savage through the body, and killed him on the
spot. before 1, who was running to help him, could come
"('ilr.

tlI'riday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying

wretehes, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and
with that he despatelled those three who, as 1 said before,
were wounded at lirst. and fallen, and all the rest he could
come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me 'l'ora. gun, I
gave him omI ol' the t'o\\'linI__I;-pieces, with which he pursued
two of the moors, woundinIr them both- , but, as llL'\ 'as
not able to run, they both II'ot troni him into the wood
where Friday Pill'hlll d them, and killed one. oi them, but
the other was too nimlIle for him: and though he was
wounded, \et h: id pluneed himsell into the sea, and swam
with all liis miIIltt oil to those two who were lelt in the
auoe, which three in the e:,uioe with one "Olllit ',ed that;
we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped
our hands of one- -and- -tweuty. 'l'heaei ouut ol' the. wholeis
as t'sollow :---three killed at our first shot. from the tree;
two killed at the ne.\t. shot; two killed by Friday in the
boat; two killed by Friday, of those: first wounded; one

tour killed, heine; tound dropped here and there, of the
wounds, or killed hv Friday in his ehase ot them; four

tn l "H --oue in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to not out of
gunshot, and though hridav made two or three shots at
them. I did nottind that heliitany of them. Friday \\ ould
fain haVe had met take one of their canoes, and pursue them;
and, indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest
carrying the news home to their people, they should come
back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of the canoes and
devour us by mere multitude; soI consented to pursue
them by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped
in, and bade Friday follow me: but when I was in the
canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature lie
there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for
slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what
was the matter; for be had not been able to look over the
side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and
had been tied so long, that he had really but little life in
him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they
had bound him with, aml would have helped him up; but
he could not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously,
believing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in order
to be killed. When Friday came to him I bade him speak
to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my
bottle, made hilu give the poor wreteh a dram; which, with
the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat up
in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak,
and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears
to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced and hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung;
then eried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and
head; and then sung and jumped about again, like a dis-
tracted creature. It was a good while before I could make
him speak or tell me what was the matter; but when he
came a little to himself, he told me that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see
what ecstacy and filial affection had worked in this poor
savage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered
from death; nor, indeed, can I describe half the extrava-
ganees of his affection after this; for he went into the
boat, and out of the boat, a great many times: when he
Went in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast,
and hold his father's head close to his bosom for many
minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and
ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and
chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving

12
what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to
rub them with, which did him a great deal of good.

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with
the other savages, who were now almost out of sight; and
it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so hard
within two hours after, and before they could be got a
quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all
night, and that from the north-west, which was against
them, that I could not suppose their boat could live, or that
they ever reaehed their own coast.

But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his
father, that l eould not find in my heart to take him off for
some time; but after [thought he eould leave him a little,
[called him to me, and he came jumping and laughing,
and pleased to the highest extreme : then I asked him if he
had given his father any bread? He shook his head, and
said, "None; ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a
eake of bread out of a little pouch I earried on purpose;
I also gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket two or
three bunehes of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them
for his father. He had no sooner given his father these
raisins. but I saw him come out of the boat, and run away
as if he had been bewitehed, for he was the swiftest fellow
on his feet that I ever saw: 1 say, he ran at such a rate
that he was out of sight, as it Were, in an instant; and
though I called, and hallooed out too, after him, it was all
onLH-away he wont; and in a quarter ofan hour I saw him
come back again, though not so fast as he went; and, as
he came nearer, I found his pace slacker, because he had
something in his hand. When he came up to me, I fouml
he had been quite home for an earthen jug, to bring his
father some fresh water, and that he had got two more
loaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he
carried to his father; however, as I was very thirsty too, I
took a little of it. The water revived his father more than
all the mm or spirits I had given him, for he was fainting
with thirst.

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know
if there was any water left? He said " Yes ;" and I bade
him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was as much in
want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes, that
Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very
weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under
the shade of a tree, and. whose limbs were also very stiff,
and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming to him
with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread
and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of
raisins; he looked up in my face with all the tokens of
gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any coun-
tenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so
exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but was
really notable, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to
him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his
father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two
minutes, turn his head about to see if his father was in the
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at last
he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,
and, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to
him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the
ground as he went: but when he came he only found he
had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday came
back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniardto
let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to
the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling,
where I would take care of him. But Friday, a lusty,
strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back, and carried
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the
side of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and than
lifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and
presently stepping out again, launched the boat OE, and
paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk: so he
brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in
the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed
me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went? He
told me, " Go fetch more boat :" so away he went like the
wind; and he had the other canoe in the. creel: almost as
soon as 1 got to it by land ; so he waited me over. and then
went. to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did ;
but they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor
Friday knew not. what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and call-
ing to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he
rame to me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them
on, and Friday and I carried them both up together nponit
between us.

But when we. got. them to the outside of our wall,
we were. at. a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to
get. them over, and l was resolved not: to break it down, so
1 set to work again: and Friday and l, in about. two hours'
time. made a very handsome lent, covered with old sails,
and above that. with houghs of trees, being in the space
without our outward tome, and between that. and lhegrore
of young wood whieh I had planted; and here we made
them two beds 01' sneh things as .I had, win, of good rice-
straw, with blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to
cover them, on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very
rich in snhjeets; and it was a merry retleetion, which I
frequently made, how like a king I looked.

As soon as 1 had seeured my two w 'ak, rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I
began to think of making some provision for them; and
the first thing I did, I ordered .ly'riday to take a yearling
goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular tloek,
to be killed; when 1 cut otl' the himler-qnarter, and
chopping it into small pieees, .1 set Friday to work to boil-
ing and stewing, and made them a. very good dish, I assure
you, of flesh and broth; and as .l cooked without doors, so
1 carried it all into the new tent, and having set, a table
there for them, I sat down, and ate my own dinner with
them, and, as well as I could, cheered and encouraged them.

After We had dined, I ordered Friday to take one of the
canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms,
which, for want of time, we had left upon the place of
battle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and bury
the dead bodies of the savages. I also ordered him to bury
the horrid remains of their barbarous feast: all which he
punctually performed, and efl'aced the very appca ance of
the savages being there; so that when I went again, I
could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by the
corner of the wood pointing to the place.

1 then began to enter into a little conversation with my
two new subjects: and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his
father what he thought of the escape of the savages in that
canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them, with
a power too great for us to resist. His first opinion was,
that the savages in the boat never could live out the storm
which blew that night they went all, but must, of necessity,
be drowned, or driven south of those other shores, where
they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be
drowned if they were to be cast away: but, as to what
they would do, if they got safe on shore, he said he knew
not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell the
people they were all killed by thunder and lightning,
not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared,
\'iz., Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies,
come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons.
This, he said, he knew; because he heard them all cry out
so in their language one to another; for it was impossible
for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and. speak
thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting up the
hand, as was done now: and this old savage was in the
right; for, as I understood since, by other bands, the
savages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards,
they were so terrified with the accounts given by those
four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they
believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be
destroyed with lire from the gods. This, however, I knew
not; and, therefore, was under continual aprehensions for
a good while, and kept always upon my guard, with all my
army; for, as there were now four of us, I would have
ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field,
at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the
fear of their coming were 011'; and I began to take my
former thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ,
being likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might de-
pend upon good usage from their nation, on his account,
il' I, would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended
when I. had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and
when I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who, having; been cast away
and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, in--
deed, with the savages, but were very sore put to for
necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish
ship, bound from the Rio de la l'lata to the liavanna, being
directed to leave their loading there, whieh was chielly
hides and silver, and to bring back what l'iuropean goods
they could meet with there; that they had five I'or-
tuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another
wreck: that five. of their own men wore drowned, when
first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through
iutiuite dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved,
on the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been
devoured every moment. He told me they had some arms
with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they
had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea
having spoiled all their powder but a little, which they
used at their first landing, to provide themselves some
food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them
there, and if they had formed any design of making their
escape? He said they had many consultations about it;
but that having neither vessel nor tools to build one, nor
provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in
tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they
would receive a proposal from me, which might tend
towards their escape? and whether, if they were all here,
it might not be done? I told him, with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put my life
in their hands; for that 51 minute was no inherent virtuein
the nature ol' man, nor did men always square their dealings
by the obligations they had received, so much as they did
by the advantages they expected.

He answered, with a great deal of eandour and in-
gcnuousness, that their condition was so miserable, and that
they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would
abhor the thought of using any man unhindly that should
contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he
would go to them, with the old man, and discourse with
them about it, and return again, and bring me their
answer: that he would make conditions with them upon
their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my
direction, as their commander and captain: and they
should swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be
true to me, and go to such Christian country as I should
agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and
absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely in such
country as I intended; and that he would bring a contract
from them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he
told me he would first swear to me himself, that he
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave
him orders; and that he would take my side to the last
drop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach
of faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all
of them very civil, honest men, and they were under the
greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons or
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion
of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their
own country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake
their relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and the
Spaniard over to them to treat. But when we had got
all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started
an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one
hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could
not but be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put
off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year.
The case was thus: he had been with us now about a
month, during which time Ihad let him see in what manner
I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support: and he saw evidently what stock of com and rice
I. had laid up: which, though it was more than sufficient
for my self yet it was not sutiieient, without good hus-
bandr_\,for1u_v familv, now it was increased to four , but
much less would it be sutlieiont it'his countrymen, who were,
as he said si\teen, still alive, should come over; and, least
of all, would it be sullieient to I'ietnal our vessel, if we should
build one, i'o- a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of
AIIIeriea: so he told me he thought it would be. more ad--
I'isable to let. him and the other two dig and cultivate some
more land. as much as l eould spare. seed to sow, and that
Ire. should wait another harvest that we might have a
supply of eorn for his eouutrymeu, when they should come;
for want might he :1 temptation to them to disagree, or not
to think tlIeIIIselves delivered, otherwise than out of one

that I eonld not but. he very well pleased with his proposal,

digging, all tour ol us. as well as the wooden tools "'0 were

the seed we had to spare : indeed, we lelt ouI'selI es barely
sullieieut for our own food, for the six months that we had
to expect our erop, reekoning from the time we set our seed
aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six
months in the ground in that eountry.

Having? new society enough, and our number being
sutlicient to put us out of tear ot the savawes, if they hail
eome, unless their number had been very great, we went
treely all over the island, whenever we tound occasion , and
as we had our escape. or deliverance upon our thoughts, it
was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out
of mine. For this purpose, I marked out several trees,
which I thought tit tor our work, and I set Friday and his

lather to cut them down, . and then I caused the Spaniard,
to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee
and direct their w ork. I showed them with II tar. in-' \
nosmsox causes. 185

defatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single
planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had
made about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two to four
inches thick: what prodigious labour it took up, any one
may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock
of tame goats as much as I could; and, for this purpose, I
made Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and myself
with Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by this
means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for
curing our grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I believe we could
have filled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, with our
bread, formed a great part of our food.

It was new harvest, and our crop in good order; it was
not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but,
however, it was enough to answer our end; for, from twenty-
two bushels of barley, we brought in and threshed out above
two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in propor-
tion of the rice, which was store enough for our foodto the
next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on
shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage,
it would very plentifully have vietualled our ship to any
part of America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more great
baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very
handy and dexterous at this.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests
I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the
main, to see what he could do with those he had left behind
him there. I gave him a strict charge not to bring any man
with him who would not first swear, in the presence of him-
self and the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight
with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who
was so kind. as to send for them in order to their de-
liverance; but that they would stand by him and defend
him against all such attempts, and wherever they went,
would be entirely under and subjected to his command;
and that this should be put in writing, and signed in their
hands. llow they were to have done this when I knew they
had neither pen nor ink, was a question we never asked.
Under these instructions the Spaniard and the old savage
went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to
have come in, or rather, were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of
them a musket, with a tirelook on it, and about eight
charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good
husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon
ingent oce: lsions.

'lhis "as a cheerful work, being the first 111easures used
by me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven
years and some days. 1 gave them provisions of bread, and
of dried grapes, sullieient for themselves for many days, and
sullieient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time:
and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing
with them about a signal they should hang out at their re-
turn, by 11 lneh I should know them again when they came
back, at a distance, before they came on shore. They went
an .1). 11 1th a fair g .1,le on the day that the moon was at full,
by my account, in the month 01 October.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which
the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was
fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday
came running in to me, and called aloud," Master, maste1,
they are come, they .11e 1.11me'" 1311111111111 up,and 1egard-
less of d.1n;rer,l 11 cut out as soon as I could get my clothes
on, through my little g,rove which, by the way, was by this
time grown to be a very tliiek wood; I went without my
arms, which was not my custom to do: but I was surprised
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at
about a league and a half distance, standing 111 for the
shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and theb 1111111 blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed, presentiy,
that they did not come from that side which the shore lay

on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon
thisI called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for tiiiase
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not
know whether they were friends or enemies. In the next
place, I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see what
I could make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I
climbed to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was
apprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer,
without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot upon
the bill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at
anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from me,
$8.15., but not above a league and a half from the shore.
ly my observation, it appeared plainly to be an English
ship, and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy
of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was
manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends,
was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret
doubts hanging about me, bidding me keep upon my guard.
in the first place, it occurred to me to consider what
business an English ship could have in that part of the
world, since it was not the way to or from any part of the
world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there
had been no storms to drive them in there, in distress ; and
that if they really were English, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good design; and that I had
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers. '

Had I not been made cautious, Ihad been undone inevi-
tably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will
see presently. I had not long kept myself in this posture,
till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for
a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing;
however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did
not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts,
but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a
mile from me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise
they would have landed just at my door, as I may say, and
would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps
have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore,
I was fully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of
them; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not
prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of
them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound;
and when the first four or five of them jumped on shore,
they took those three men out of the boat, as prisoners:
one of the three I could perceive using the most passionate
gestures of intreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind
of extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up
their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, indeed,
but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly con-
founded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it
should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as
he could, " 0 master! you see Englishmans eat prisoner as
well as savage mans!" " Why, Friday," says I, " do you
think they are going to eat them then 9" "Yes," says
Friday, " they will eat them." " No, no," says I, " Friday;
I am afraid they will murder them, indeed; but they will
not eat them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of the
sight, expecting every moment that the three prisoners
would be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up
his arms with a great cutlass to strike one of the poor men;
and I expected to see him fall every moment, at which all
the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I
wished heartily no" for the Spaniard, and the savage that
was gone with him, or that I had any hay to lime come
undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have
secured the three men, for I saw they had among 3them no
fire-arms; but it fell out to my mind another way. After
I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by
the insolent seamen, the fellows ran scattering about the
island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed
that the three other men had liberty to go also where they
pleased, but thex sat down all three upon the ground, very
pensix e, and looked like men in despair.

It wasjnst at high water \\ hen these people came on shore,
and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place
they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide was
spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving
their boat aground. They had left two men in the boat,aosmsox 03050:. 189

who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too far aground
for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were
straggling about; upon which they all soon came to the
boat: but it was past all their strength to launch her, being
very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft, oozy
sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition they gave
it over, and away they strolled about the country again;
and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling him
off from the boat, "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you?
she'll float next tide :" by which I was fully confirmed in
the main inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this
time I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of
my castle, any farther than to my place of observation, near
the top of the hill; and very glad I was to think how well
it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be-
fore the boat could float again, and by that time it would
be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their
motions, and to hear their discourse if they had any. In
the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more caution, knowing that I had to do with
a different kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered
Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with
his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two
fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure,
indeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin
coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked
sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the
heat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling
into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep.
The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con-
dition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the
shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of amile from me,
and, as I thought, out of the sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition: immediately I marched, my

thicket of trees; "my heart tremblcs for fear they have
seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, they will cer-
tainly murder us all." " Have they any fire-arms ?" said I.
He answered, "They had only two pieces, one of which
they left in the boat." "Well, then," said I, "leave the
rest to me. I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prisoners '2"
lle told me there were two desperate villains among them
that it was searee safe to show any mercy to; but if they
were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their
duty. I asked him which they were? He told me he
enuld not, at that distanee, distinguish them, but he would
obey my orders in anything I would direct. "Well," says
1, "let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they
awake, and we will resolve further." So they willingly
went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.

"Look you, sir," said 1, "if I venture. upon your de-
lireranee, you are willing; to make two conditions with
me?" He anticipated my proposals by telling me that
both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly
directed and eonunanded by me in everything; and it' the
ship was not reeuverml, he would live and die with me in
what part of the world soever 1 would send him; and the
two men said the same. " Well," says I, " my conditions
are but two; first--that while you stay in this island with
me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and it' I
put. arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give
them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this
island, and in the meantime be governed by my orders;
seeondly--that if the ship is recovered, you will carry me
and my man to England passage free."

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith
of man could devise that he would comply with these most
reasonable demands, and besides, would owe his life to
me, and acknowledge it, upon all occasions, as long as he
lived. " Well, then," said I, " here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is
proper to be done." He showed all the testimonies of his
~gratitude that ho was able, but ofi'ered to be wholly guided.
by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing any-
thing; but the best. method I could think of was to fire on
them at once as they lay, and if any of them were not
killed at the first volley, and oti'ered to submit, we might
save them, and so put it. wholly upon God's providence to
direct. the shot. He. said, very modestly, thathe was loath
to kill them, if he could help it; but. that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the
mutiny in the ship, and it' they escaped, we should he un-
done still, for they would go on board and bring the whole
ship's company, and destroy us all. "Well, then," says I,
"necessity leeitimates my advice, for it is the only way to
save our lives." llowever, seeing him still cautious of shed-
ding- hlood. .[ told lzim they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient.

in the middle of this discourse, we heard some of them
awake, and soon after. we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him il' either of them were the heads of the mutiny 't
He said, "No." " Well, then," says I, " you may let them
escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on
purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, "if the rest
escape you, it is your fault." Animated with this, he took
the musket. 1 had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his
belt. and his two comrades with him, with each a piece in
his hand; the two men who were with him, going first,
made some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was
awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out to
the rest; but it was too late then, for the moment he cried
out. they tired--I mean the two men, the captain wisely re-
serving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot
at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the
spot, and the other very much wounded; but not being
dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help
'0 the other; but the captain, stepping to him, told him it
was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to
forgive his villany, and with that word knocked him down
with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more:
there were three more in the company, and one of them was
slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and when
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist,
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would
spam their lives if they would give him an assurance of
their abhorrcnee of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,
whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of
their sincerity that could be desired; and he was willing
to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not
against, only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand
and feet while they were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away
the ears and sails, which they did; and by-and-by three
straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from
the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and see-
ing the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and our vic-
tory was complete.

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire
into one another's circumstances. I began first, and told
him my whole history, which be heard with an attention
even to amazement----and particularly at the wonderful
manner of my being furnished with provisions and am--
munition; and indeed, as my story is a whole collec-
tion of wonders, it afl'eeted him deeply. But when be
reflected upon himself, and how I seemed to have been
preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran
down his face, and he could not speak a word more. After
this communication was at an end, I carried him and his
two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, viz., at the top of the house, where I refreshed
him with such provision as I had, and showed them all the
contrivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting
that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but above all, the captain admired my fortifica-
tion, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a
grove of trees, which, having been new planted near twenty
years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,
was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in

any part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my
13
little winding passage into it. I told him this was my
castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in the country,
as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion,
and I would show him that too another time; but at pre-
sent our business was to consider how to recover the ship.
He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly
at a less what measures to take, for that there were still six-
and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a
cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by their des-
peration, and would carry it on, knowing that if they were
subdued they would be brought to the gallows as soon as
they got to England or to any of the English colonies, and
that therefore there would be no attacking them with so
small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found
it was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore some-
thing was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the
men on board into some snare for their surprise, as to pre-
vent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon this,
it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship's
crew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of
the heat, would certainly come on shore in their other boat
to look for them, and that then, perhaps, they might come
armed, and be too strong for us; this he allowed to be
rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to
do was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that
they might not carry her 011', and taking everything out of
her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim; ac-
cordingly, we went on board, took the arms which were
left on board out of her, and whatever else we found there
---which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar
in a piece of canvass, all which were very welcome to me,
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none
left for many years.

When we had carried all these things on shore, we
knocked it great hole in her bottom, that if they had come
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry
ofi' the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that
we should be able to recover the ship; but my view was,
that if they went away without the boat, I did not much
question to make her again fit to carry us to the Leeward
Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way,
for I had them still in my thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first,
by main strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high
that the tide would not float her ofi' at high water mark, and
besides, had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be
quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we should
do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw a waft with her
ensign, as a signal for the boat to come on board: but no
boat stirred ; and they fired several times, making other
signals to the boat. At last, when all their signals and
firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir,
we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat
out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as they
approached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and
that the ' had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we
had a full view of them as they came, and aplain sight even
of their faces; because the tide having set them a little to
the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to
come to the same place where the other had landed, and
where the boat lay ; the captain knew the persons and cha-
racters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led
into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and
frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who it seems
was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were
as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no doubt
made desperate in their new enterprise; and terribly
apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us.
]. smiled at him, and told him that men in our circum-
stances were past the operation of fear. I asked <<him what
he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a
deliverance was not worth venturing for? "And where,
sir," said I, "is your belief of my being preserved here on
purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little while

ago? For my part," said I, " there seems to be but one
thing amiss in all the prospect of it." "What is that ?"
says he. " Why," said I, " it is, that as you say there are
three or four honest fellows among them, who should
he spared, had they been all the wicked part of the crew, I
should have thought God's providence had singled them
out to deliver them into your hands; for depend upon it,
every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die
or live as they behave to us." As I spoke this with a
raised voice and cheerful countenance, 1 found it greatly
encouraged hhn ; so we set vigorously to our business.

We had, upon the first appearance of the boats coming
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners; and
we had, indeed, secured them effectually. Two of them, of
whom the captain was less assured, I sent with Friday, and
one of the delivered men, to my cave, where they were re--
mote enough, and out of danger of being heard or dis-
covered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they
could have delivered themselves: here they left them
bound, but gave them provisions: and promised them, if
they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in
a day or two; but that if they attempted their escape, they
would be put to death without mercy. They promised
faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and
were very thankful that they had such good usage as to have
provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and
they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at
the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were
kept pinioned, because the captain was not able to trust
them; but the other two were taken into my service, upon
the captain's recommendation, and. upon their solemnly
engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the
three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and
I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough
with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain
had said there were three or four honest men among them
also. As soon as they got to the place where their other
host lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on
shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad toI"

see, for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat nl'.
anchor'some distance from the shore, with some hands in
her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the
boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they 'ran
all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were
under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all
that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they
had mused awhile upon this. they set up two or three-great
shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they could
make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose:
then they all came close in a ring, and fired a volley of
their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring. They were so astonished at the
surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they re-
solved to go all on board again to their ship, and let them
know that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat
staved ; accordingly, they immediately launched their boat
again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded,
at this, believing they would go on board the ship again,
and set sail, giving their comrades over for lest, and so he
should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we should
have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the
other way.

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we
perceived them all coming on shore again: but with this
measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted
together upon, via, to leave three men in the boat, and the
rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for
their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for
now we were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven
men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat
escape; because they would row away to the ship, and then
the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so
our recovering the ship would be lost. However, we had
no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things
might present. The seven men came on shore, and the
three who remained in the boat put her 05' to a good dis-
tance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for
them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill under which my
habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though
they could not perceive us. We should have been very
glad it they would have come nearer to us, so that we might
have tired at them, or if they would have gone farther
oil', that we might come abroad. But when they were come
to the brow ot' the. hill, where they could see a great way
into the 'alleys and woods, they shouted and hallooed till
they were w 'ary; and not airing, it seems, to venture far
from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat down
together under a tree to consider.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this
consultation of theirs--viz., that, perhaps, they would all
lire a volley again, to endeavonr to make their fellows hear,
and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture
when their pieces were all discharged, and they would cer-
tainly yield, and we. should have them without bloodshed.
.l liked this proposal, provided it was done while we \vere
near enough to come. up to them before they could load
their pieees again. But this event did not happen; and we
lay still a long time. very irresolnte what course to take.
At length, l. told him there would he nothing done, in my
opinion, till night; and then, it' they did not return to the
boat, perhaps we might tiud a way to get between them and
the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in
the boat to get them on shore. We waited a gr 'at while,
though very impatient for their removing; and were very
uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw them all start
up, and march down towards the sea; it seems they had
such dreadful :qurehensions ot' the danger of the place, that
they resolved to go on board again, give their companions
over for lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with
the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I
thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which
answered my end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the cap-
tain's mate to go over the little creek westward, towards
the place where the savages came on shore when Friday
was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising
ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo
out, as loud as they could, and wait till the seamen heard
them; that as soon as they heard the seamen answer them,
they should return it again; and then, keeping out of
sight, take a roand, always answering when the others
hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the
woods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by
such ways as I directed them.

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the
mate hallooed: and they presently heard them, and, an-
swering, ran along the shore westward, towards the voice
they heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where,
the water being up, they could not get over, and called for
the boat to come up and set them over ; as, indeed, I ex-
pected. When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone a good way into the creek, they
took one of the three men out of her to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to
the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I
wished for: and immediately leaving Friday and the cap-
tain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, and,
crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two
men before they were aware; one of them lying on the
shore and the other being in the boat. The fellow on share
was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up ;
the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him and
knocked him down ; and then called out to him in the boat
to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very few
arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw
five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down: be-
sides, this was, it seems, one of the three men who were
not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew; and,
therefore, was easily persuaded not only to yield, but after-
wards to join very sincerely with us. In the meantime,
Friday and the captain's mate so well managed their
business with the rest, that they drew them, by hallooing
and answering, from one hill to another, and from one
wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but
left them where they were very sure they could not reach
back to the boat before it was dark; and, indeed, they were
heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back
to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they returned to their boat; and we could hear
the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, call-
ing to those behind to come along; and could also hear
them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were,
and not able to come any faster; which was very welcome
news to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it is
impossible to express their confusion when they found the
boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and
their two men gene. We could hear them call to one
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another
they were got into an enchanted island; that either there
were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or
else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should all
be carried away and devoured. They halloocd again, and
called their two comrades by their names a great many
times, but no answer. After some time, we could see them,
by the little light there was, run about, wringing their
hands like men in despair, and sometimes they would go
and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then come
ashore again, and walk about, and so the same thing over
again. My men would fain have had me give them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing
to take them at some advantage, so as to spare them, and
kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was un-
willing to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing
the others were very well armed. Iresolved to wait, to
see if they did not separate; and, therefore, to make sure
of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close
to the ground as they could, that they might not be dis-
covered, aud get as near themas they could possibly, before
they olfered to fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swain, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited
of all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more
of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this prin-
cipal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly
have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him,
for they only heard his tongue before: but when they came
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up to their feet,
let fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot ;
the next man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the
third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately ad-
vanced with my whole army, which was now eight men,
viz., myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general;
the captain and his two men; and the three prisoners of
war whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon
them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our
number; and I made the man they had left in the boat,
who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try if I
could bring them to a parley, and so, perhaps, might
reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired:
for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition then
was, they would be very willing to capitulate. So he calls
out, as loud as he could, to one of them, "Tom Smith!
Tom Smith l" Tom Smith answered immediately, " Is that
Robinson ?" for it seems he knew the voice. The other
answered, "Ay, ay; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw
down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this
moment." "Who must we yield to? Where are they ?"
says Smith again. " Here they are," says he; "here's our
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you
these two hours; the boatswain is killed, Will Fry is
wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do not yield,
you are all lost." "Will they give us quarter then ?" says
Tom Smith, "and we will yield." "I'll go and ask, if you
promise to yield," said Robinson: so he asked the captain,
and the captain himself then calls out, "You, Smith,
you know my voice; if you lay down your arms imme-
diately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will
Atkins."

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, cap-
tain, give me quarter. What have I done ?' They have all
been as bad as 1:" which, by the way, was not true; for
it. seems this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold
of the captain, when they first mutinied. and used him bar-
barously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious
language. However, the captain told him he must lay
down his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's
mercy: by which he meant me, for they all called me
governor. la a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed
with them, and two more, who bound them all ; and then my
great army of fifty men, which, with these three, were in all
but eight, came up and seized upon them, and upon their
boat; only that I. kept myself and one more out of sight for
reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of
seizing the ship: and as for the captain, nmv he had leisure
to parley with them, he expostnlated with them upon the
villany of their practices with him, and upon the further
wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must bring
them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged
hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they were
not his prisoners, but the eonnnander's of the island; that
they thought they had set him on shore in a barren, un-
inhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct
them, that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an
.l'lnglishman; that he might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he supposed
he would send them to England, to be dealt with as justice
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the
governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he would
be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its
desired eti'eet: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the
captain to intereede with the governor for his life; and all
the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that they might not
be sent to England. .

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship;
so I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see
what kind of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me. When I called, at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Captain,
the commander calls for you ;" and presently the captain
replied, " Tell his Excellency I am just coming." This
more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed that the
commander was just by, with his fifty men. Upon the
captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the
ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put
it in execution the next morning. But, in order to execute
it with more art, and to be secure of success, I told him we
must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take
Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This was com-
mitted to Friday and the two men who came on shore with
the captain. They conveyed them to the cave as to a
prison : and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to
men in their condition. The others I ordered to my bower ;
and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a parley with them--in a. word, to try them, and
tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or not to
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to,
and that though the governor had given them quarter for
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were
sent to England, they would all be hanged in chains; but
that if they would join in so just an attempt to recover the
ship, he would have the governor's engagement for their
pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition: they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest im--
precations, that they would be faithful to him. to the last
drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and
would go with him. all over the world; that they would
own him as a father to them as long as he lived. "Well,"
says the captain, "I must go and tell the governor what
you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to
it." So he brought me an account of the temper he found
them in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.
.llowever, that we might be very secure, I told him he
should go back again and choose out those live, and tell
them that they might see. he did not want men, that he would
take out these live to be his assistants, and that the governor
would keep the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the -astle (my cave), as hostages for the
lidelily of those live; and that if they proved unfaithful in
the execution, the live hostages should be hanged in chains
alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced
them that the. governor was in earnest: however, they had
no way left them hot to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners. as much as of the captain, to per-
suade the other live to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:
lirst, the captain, his mate, and passenger; second, then the
two prisoners of the lirst gang, to whom, having their cha~~
raeler from the captain. .1 had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms : third, the other two thatl had kept
till now in my bower pinioued, but, on the captain's motion,
had now released: fourth, these live released at last; so that
they were twelve in all, besides live we kept prisoners in the
cave for hostages.

i asked the captain it' he was willing to venture with
these hands on board the ship ; but as for me and my man
Friday, 1 did not think it was proper for as to stir, having
seven men left behind ; and it was employment enough for
us to keep them asunder and supply them with victuals.
As to the live in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but
Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with
necessaries ; and I made the other two carry provisions to
a certain distance. where Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with
the captain, who told them I was the person the governor
had ordered to look after them; and that it was the
governor's pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by
my direction: that if they did. they would be fetched into
the castle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never
suffered them to see me as governor, I now appeared as
another person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison,
the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him but to
furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man
them. He made his passenger captain of one, with four of
the men; and himself, his mate, and five more, went in the
other; and they contrived their business very well, for they
came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they
came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them,
and tell them they had brought oil" the men and the boat,
but that it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like--holding them in a chat till they came to the
ship's side; when the captain and the mate, entering first,
with their arms, immediately knocked down the second
mate and carpenter with the butt-end of their muskets,
being very faithfully seconded by their men; they secured
all the rest that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and
began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were
below; when the men of the other boat, entering at the
lore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three
men they found there prisoners. When this was done, and
all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three
men, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel
captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and
he, two men, and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands;
and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the
new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and
wounded the mate with amusket-ball, which broke his arm,
and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.
The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-
housc, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new
captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth,
and coming out again behind one of his ears, so that he never
spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded, and theship
Was taken effectually, without any more lives being lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon
with me to give me notice of his success, which, you may
be sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon
the shore for it. till near two o'clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and
it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very
sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun; and
presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of
" Governor! (i-overnor l" and presently I knew the captain's
voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill, there
he stood. and, pointing to the ship, he embraeed me in his
arms. "My dear friend and deliverer," says he, " there's
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that
belong: to her." l cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode, within little more than half a. mile of the shore; for
they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters
of her, and, the weather being fair. had brought her to an
anehorjustagainst the mouth of the little creek; and, the
tide being up. the eaptain had brought the pinnace in near
the place where .I. had at lirst landed my ral'ts, and so
landed just at my door. 1 was at first ready to sink down
with surprise: for 1 saw my deliverance. indeed, visibly
put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship ready
to earry me away whither l pleased to go. At first, for
some time, 1 was not able to answer him one word; but as
he had taken me in his arms, 1 held fast by him, or l should
have fallen to the ground. He pereeived the surprise, and
inunediately pulled a bottle out. of his poeket, and gave me
a dram of cordial. which he had broughton purpose for me.
After 1 had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and
though it brought me to myself, yet. it was a good while be-
fore I could speak a word to him. All this time the poor
man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under any
surprise as I was ; and he said a thousand kind and tender
things to me, to compose and bring me to myself: but such
was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put. all my spirits
into confusion: at last it broke out into tears; and in
a little while after I recovered my speech. I then took
my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer: and we
rejoieed together. Ltold him I looked upon him as a man
sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole trans--
aetiou seemed to be a chain of wonders.
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me he had
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship
afforded, and such as the wretchcs that had been so long
his master: had not plundered him of. Upon this, he
called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the
things ashore that were for the governor; and, indeed, it
was a present as if I had been one that was not to be
carried away with them, but as if I had to dwell upon the
island still. First, he had brought me a case of bottles full
of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira
wine, two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag
of pease, and about a hundredweight of biscuit; he also
brought me a. box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full
of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of
other things. But besides these, and what were a thousand
times more useful to me, he brought me six new clean
shirts, six very good neckeloths, two pairs of gloves, one
pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very
good suit of clothes of his own: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable
present, as any one may imagine, to one in my circum-
stances; but never was anything in the world of that kind
so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to wear
such clothes at first.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began to
consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had. I
told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring
the worst men he spoke of to make it their own request that
he should leave them upon the island. "I should be very
glad of that," says the captain, " with all my heart." So I
caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now dis-
charged, to go to the cave, and bring up the five men,
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there
till I came. After some time I came thither, dressed in my
new habit; and nowI was called governor again. Being
all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them that I had got a full
account of their villanous behaviour to the captain, but that
Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and
that they had fallen into the pit which they had dug for
others. I let them know that by my direction the ship
had been seized; that she lay now in the road; and they
might see, by--and-by, that their new captain had received
the reward of his villany, and that they would see him
hanging at the yard~artn; that, as to them, I wanted to
know what they had to say why I should not execute them
as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they
euuld not doubt but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly
implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what
mercy to show them; for, as for myself, I had resolved to
quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage
with the captain to go to England; and, as for the cap-
tain, he could not carry them to England, other than as
prisoners, in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and running
away with the ship ; the consequence of which, they must
needs know, would be the gallows; so that I could not
tell what was best for them, unless they had a mind to
take their fate in the island. If they desired that, asI
had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to
give them their lives if they thought they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and. said they
would much rather venture to stay there than be carried
to England to be hanged. So I left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difliculty of
it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this, I
seemed a little angry with the captain, and told him that
they were my prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had
otl'ered them so much favour, I would be as good as my
word: and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I
would set them at liberty as I found them; and if he did
not like it, he might take them again if he could catch
them. Upon this, they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into
the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would
leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some
directions how they should live very well if they thought
fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but
told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my
things, and desired him to go on board in the meantime,
and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore
next day for me; ordering him, at all events, to cause the
new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-
arm, that these men might see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to
me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse
with them on their circumstances. I told them I thought
they had made a right choice; that if the captain had
carried them away, they would certainly be hanged. I
showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of
the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them Iwould let them into the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them. Accordingly I gave them the whole history of the
place, and of my coming to it; showed them my fortifica-
tions, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make
them easy. I told them the story also of the seventeen
Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a
letter, and made them promise to treat them in common
with themselves.

I left them my fire-arms--viz., five muskets, three
fowling--pieees, and three swords. I had above a barrel
and a half of powder left. I gave them a description of
the Way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to- make both butter and cheese. In a
word, I gave them every part of my own story; and told
them'I should prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which
I told them I would have been very glad of! Also, I
gave them the bag of pease which the captain had brought
Illa to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase
tiem.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went

on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but

did not weigh that night. The next morning early, two
of the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and,
making the most lamentable complaint of the other three,
begged to be taken into the ship for God's sake, for they
should be murdered, and begged the captain to take them
on board, though he hanged them immediate! . Upon
this, the captain pretended to have no power wit out me 3
but, after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises
of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some
time after, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men; to
which the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests
and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very
thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling them,

that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them
in, I would not forget them.

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the
money I formerly mentioned, as also the mone I found in
the wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I l the island,
the 19th of December, as I found by the ship's account, in
the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty
years, two months, and nineteen days; being delivered
from this second captivity the same day of the month that
I first made my escape in the long-boat from among the
Moore of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, I
arrived in England the 11th of June, in the year 1687,
having bee'n thirty-five years absent.

When I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to
all the world as if I had never been known there. My
benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left my
money in trust with, was alive, but had had great mis-
fortunes in the world; was become a widow the second
time, and very low in the world. I made her very easy
as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give her no
trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my littleA.LIVXEILLL

stock would afford; which at that time would, indeed,
allow me to do but little: but I assiired her I would. never
.forget her former kindness to me; nor did I forget her
when I had sufficient, as shall be observed in its'proper
place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the
children of one of my brothers; and as I had been long
ago given over for dead, there had been no provision
made for me; so that I found nothing to relieve or assist
me; and that the little money I had would not do much
for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude which I did not ex-
pect; and this was, that the master of the ship, whom I
had so happily delivered, and by the same means saved
the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome ac-
count to the owners of the manner how I had saved the
lives of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet
them and some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a. very handsome compliment upon the subject,
and a present of almost 2001. sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the circum-
stances of my life, and how little way this would go to-
wards settling me in the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon,
and see if I might not come at some information of the
state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was be-
come of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had
some years past given me over for dead. With this view
I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April fol-
lowing; my man F 'day accompanying me ve honestly
in all these ramblings, and proving a most fsi servant.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inq ' , and to
my partictflar satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of
the ship, who first took me up at see off the shore of
Africa. . He was now grown old, and had left off going to

men did not know me ; and indeed I hardly knew him. But
I soon brought him to my remembrance, and as soon brought
myself to his remembrance, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of the old acquaint-
ance between us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner. The old man told me he had
not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but that he
could assure me, that when he came away my partner was
living; but the trustees, whom I had joined with him to
take cognizance of my part, were both dead: that, how-
ever, he believed I would have a very good account of the
improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general
belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had
given in the account of the produce of my part of the
plantation to the procurator-fiseal, who had apportioned it,
in case I never came to claim it, oneothird to the king,
and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conver-
sion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I
appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it
would be restored: only that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not
be restored: but he assured me that the steward of the
king's revenue from lands, and the providore, or steward
of the monastery, had taken great care all along that my
partner gave every year a faithful account of the produce,
of which they had duly received my moiety. I asked him
if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought
the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth
looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I should
meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right
in the moiety? He told me he could not tell exactly to
What degree the plantation was improved; but this he
knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon
the enjoying his part of it; but that, to the best of his
remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of my
part, which was, it seems, granted away to some other
monastery or religious house, amounted to above two
hundred moidores a year: that, as to my being restored
to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be
made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title,
and my name being also enrolled in the register of the
country; also he told me that the survivors'of my two
trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy;
and he believed I would not only have their assistance for
putting me in possession, but would find a very consider-
able sum of money in their hands for my account, being
the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up, as above; which, as he re-
membered, was for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this
account, and inquired of the old captain how it came to
pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects,
when he knew that I had made my will, and had made
him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.

He told me that was true; but that as there was no
proof of my being dead, he could not act as executor until
some certain account should come of my death; and, .
besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing
so remote: that it was true he had registered my will,
and put in his claim; and could he have given any
account of my being dead or alive, he would have acted
by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so
they call the sugar-house), and have given his. son, who
was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. " But," says the
old man, "I have one piece of news to tell you, which,
perhaps, may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and
that is, believing you were lost, and all the world believing
so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account with
me, in your name, for the first six or eight years' profits,
which I received. There being at that time great dis-
bursements for increasing the works, building an ingenio,
and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as
afterwards it produced: however," says the old man, "I
shall give you a true account of what I have received in
all, and how I have disposed of it." '

After a few days' farther conference with this ancient
friend, he brought me an account of the first six years'
income of my plantation, signed by my partner and the
merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods; and
I found, by this account, that every year the income con-
siderably increased; but the disbursements being large,
the sum at first was small: however, the old man let me
see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy
moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen
double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship: he
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about
eleven years after my leaving the place. The good man
then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how he
had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his
losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. " However,
my old friend," says he, "you shall not want a supply in
your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall
be fully satisfied." Upon this he pulls out an old pouch,
and gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores
in gold; and giving the writing of his title to the ship,
which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was
quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them
both into my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness
of the poor man to be able to bear this; and remembering
what he had done for me, how he had taken me up at sea,
and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and
particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I
could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me;
therefore I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to
spare so much money at that time, and if it would not
straiten him? He told me he could not say but it might
straiten him a little ; but, however, it was my money,
and I might want it more than he.

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and
I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke; in short,
I took one hundred of the mordores, and called for a pen
and ink to give him a. receipt for them; then I returned
him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the
plantation, I would return the other to him also (as, indeed,
I afterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his

art in his son's ship, I would not take it by any means;
hut that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest
enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive
what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a
penny more from him.

When this was passed, the old man asked me if he
should put me into a. method to make my claim to my
plantation. I told him I thought to go over to it in self!
He said I might do so if I pleased; but that, if I di not,
there were ways enough to secure my right, and imme-
diately to appropriate the profits to my use; and as there
were ships in the river of Lisbon just ready to go away to
Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public register,
with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive,
and that I was the same person who took up the land for
the planting the said plantation at first. This being regu-
larly attested by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he
directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a
merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and then pro-
posed my staying with him till an account came of the
return.

Never was anything more honourable than the pro-
ceedings upon this procuration; for in less than seven
months I received a large packet from the survivors of my
trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went to sea,
in which were the following particular letters and papers
enclosed.

First, there was the account current of the produce of
my plantation, from the year when their fathers had
balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for six
years; the balance appeared to be one thousand one
hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.

Secondly, there was the account of four years more,
while they kept the efl'ects in their hands, before the
government claimed the administration, as being the
effects of a. person not to be found, which they called
civil'death; and the balance of this, the value of the
plantation increasing, amounted to about three thousand
two hundred and forty moidores.

Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine's account,
who had received the profits for above fourteen years;
but not being to account for what was disposed of by the
hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred
and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he

acknowledged to my account: as to the king's part, that
refunded nothing.
There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me
vex J alfectionately upon my being alive, giving me an
account how the estate was improved, and what it pro-
duced a year; with the particulars of the number of acres
that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there
were upon it; and making two-and-twenty crosses for
blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Mafias to
thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me
very passionately to come over and take possession of my
own; and, in the meantime, to give him orders to whom
he should deliver my effects, if I did not come myself;
concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that
of his family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine
leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and
which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He
sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a
hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as
moidores. By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees
shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar,
eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole
account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job
was better than the beginning. It is impossible to
express the flutterings of my very heart when I found all
my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come all in
fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought
myg woods. deg and the effects were safe in the river before my
letters came to my hand.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thou-
sand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, as
I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand
pounds a year, as sure as an estate in England : and, in a
word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to
understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment
of it. The first thing I did was to recompense my
original benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distrc55, kind to me in my
beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him
all that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the pro-
vidence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him,
which I would do a hundredfold: so I first returned to
him the hundred moidores I had received from him; then
I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release from the four hundred and seventy moidores,
which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest
and firmest manner possible. After which, I caused a
procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the
receiver of the annual profits of my plantation; and
appointing my partner to account with him, and make the
returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a
clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores
a- year to him during his life, out of the efi'ects, and fifty
moidores a-ycar to his son after him, for his life: and
thus I requited my old man.

I had now to consider which way to steer my course
next, and what to do with the estate that Providence had
thus put into my hands: and, indeed, I had more care
upon my head now than I had in my silent state of life in
the island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and
had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now a
great charge upon me, and my business was how to secure
it. I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place
where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy
and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it; on
the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust
with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest,
and that was the only refuge I had. In the next place,
my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither;
but now I could not tell how to think of going thither
till I had settled my afi'airs, and left my effects in some safe
hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who I knew was honest. and would be just to me:
but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I
knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way
but to go back to England myself, and take my efl'ects
with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon
this; and, therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain
fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my former
benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose
husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it
was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. So,
the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write
to his correspondent in London, not only to pay abill,
but to go find her out, and carry her, in money, ahundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in
her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a
further supply: at the same time, I sent my two sisters in
the country a hundred pounds each, they being, though
not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one
having been married and left a widow, and the other
having a husband not so kind to her ashe should be. But,
among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my
stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave
things safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to
the place ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about
religion, which insensibly drew me back. However, it was
not religion that kept me from going there for the present;
but that really I did not know with whom to leave my
effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England,
where, if I arrived, I concluded I should. make some
acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful
to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to go to England with
all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first
resolved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful
account of things I had from there; and, first, to the
Prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter full of thanks for
his just dealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and
seventy-two moidores which were undisposed of, which I
desired might be given, five hundred to the monastery,
and three hundred and seventy--two to the poor, as the prior
should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers for me,
and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two
trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much justice
and honesty called for: as for sending them any present,
they were far above having any occasion for it. Lastly, I
wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in im-
proving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the
stock of the works; giving him instructions for his future
government of my part, according to the powers I had
left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send
whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me
more particularly; assuring him that it was my intention
not only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the
remainder of my life. To this I added a very handsome
present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters,
for such the captain's son informed me he had; with two
pieces of fine English broad cloth, the best I could get in
Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace
of a good value.

Having thus settled my afi'airs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my next
difficulty was which way to go to England: I had been
accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange
aversion to go to England by sea" at that time; and though
I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased
upon me so much, that though I had once shipped my
baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind two or three
times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this
might be one of the reasons; but let no man slight the
strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such mo-
ment. Two of the ships which I had singled out to go in,
having put my things on board one of them, and in the
other having agreed with the captain, miscarried; one was
taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned, except
three; so that in either of those vessels I had been made
miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot, to whom I communicated everything, pressed me
earnestly not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the
Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle,
whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land
to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to
Madrid, and so all the way by land through France. In a
word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at
all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel
all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did
not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way:
and to make it more so, my old captain brought an English
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with me; after which we picked up two
more English merchant-s also, and two young Portuguese
gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that, in all,
there were six of us, and five servants; and as for me, I
got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides
my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be
capable of supplying the place of a servant on the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company
being very well mounted and armed, we made a little
troop, wherof they did me the honour to call me captain,
as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had
two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole
journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so
I shall trouble you now with none of my land journal; but
Some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey I must not omit.

\Vhen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers
to Spain, were willing to stay some time to 'see the
court of Spain, and what was worth observing; but,
it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened
away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of
October; but when we came to the edge of Navarre, we
were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an ac-
count that so much snow was fallen on the French side of
the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come
back to Pampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme
hazard to pass on.

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so
indeed; and to me, that had always been used to a hot
climate, and to countries where I could scarce bear any
clothes on, the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed, was it
more painful than surprising, to come but ten days before
out of Old Castile, where the weather was .not only warm,
but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the
l'yrennean mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to
be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing
of our fingers and toes. .

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather,
which he had never seen or felt before in his life. To
mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it con-
tinued snowing with so much violence and so long, that
the people said winter was come before its time; and the
roads, which were difficult before, were now quite im-
passable; for the snow lay in some places too thick for us
to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the
northern countries, there was no going without being in
danger of being buried alive every step. We stayed no
less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better,
for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had
been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we
should go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for
Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while I
was considering this, there came in four French gentle--
men, who, having been stopped on the French side of the
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide,
who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc,
had brought them over the mountains by such ways that
they were not much incommoded with the snow; for
where they met with snow in any quantity, they said it
was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake
to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow,
provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves
from wild beasts; for, he said, in these great snows, it was
frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of
the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the
ground being covered with snow. We told him we were
well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if
he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged wolves,
which, we were told, we were in most danger from, espe--
cially on the French side of the mountains. He satisfied
us that there was no danger of that kind in the way that
we were to go ; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did
also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some
French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to
go, and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from I'ampeluna with our guide,
on the 15th of November; and I was surprised, when, in--
stead of going forward, he came directly back with us on
the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty
miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, We found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen;
but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he approached the
mountains another way; and though it is true the hills
and precipiees looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours,
such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we
inscnsibly passed the height of the mountains without
being much encumbered with the snow; and, all on a
sudden, he showed us the pleasant and fl'uitful provinces
of Langucdoc and Gascony, all green and flourishing,
though, indeed, at a great distance, and we had some
rough way to pass still.

We were a. little uneasy, however, when we found it
snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could
not travel; but he bid us be easy; we should soon be past
it all; we found, indeed, that we began to descend every
day, and to come more north than before; and so, depend-
ing upon our guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide
being something before us, and not just in sight, out
rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear,
from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood: two of the
wolves made at the guide, and, had he been far before us,
he would have been devoured before we could have helped
him; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other
attacked the man with such violence, that he had not time
or presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed
and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday being
next to me, I bade him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the man, he
hallooed out as loud as the other, " 0 master! 0 master !"
but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man,
and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the
head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for, having been used to such creatures in his
country, he had no fear upon him, but went close up to
him and shot him; whereas any other of us would have
tired at a. farther distance, and have perhaps either missed
the Wolf or endangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than
I; and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with
the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the
most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled
by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there
had been a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there
was not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehen-
sion: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other
that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately,
and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily
fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had
stuck in his teeth. But the man was most hurt: for the
raging creature had bitten him twice, once in the arm, and
the other time a little above his knee; and though he had
made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the
disprder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the
wo f.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol
we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way,
which was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what
was the matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees,
which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been
the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide,
though we did not presently discern what kind of creature
it was he had killed.

But never was a. fight managed so hardily, and in such
a. surprising manner, as that which followed between Fri-
da ' and the bear, which gave us all, though at first we
were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest diversion
imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and
does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so
he has two particular qualities, which generally are the
rule of his actions: first, as to men, who are not his proper
prey, if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle
with you; but then you must take care to be very civil to
him, and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentle--
man; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince;
nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you
stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes
it: for an alii'ont; but if you throw or toss anything at him,
and it hits him, though it were but a hit of stick as big as
your linger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other
business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have satis--
faction in point of honour--this is his first quality: the
next is, if he be once afl'ronted, he will never leave you,
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good
round rate until he overtakes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up to him, he was helping him otl' his horse, for the
man was both hurt and li'ightened, when on a. sudden we
espied the bear come out of the wood, and}; monstrous
one it was, the biggest by far that I ever saw. 'We were
all a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday
saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's
countenance: " 0, 0, 0 l" says Friday, three times, point-
ing to him: " 0 master! you give me te leave, me shakee
to hand with him ; me makec you good laugh."

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased: " You
fool," says I, "he will eat you up." " Eatee me up! eatee
me up!" says Friday, twice over again; "me eatee him
up ; me make you good laugh; you all stay here, me
show you good laugh." So down he sits, and gets off his
boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps, gives my
other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew,
swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle
with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him,
as if the bear could understand him, " Hark ye, hark ye,"
says Friday, "me speakee with you." We followed at a
distance, for now being come down on the Gascony side of
the mountains, we had entered a vast forest, where the
country was plain and pretty open, though it had many
trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as
we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly,
and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit
nim just on the head, but did him no more harm than if
no had thrown it against a wall; but it answered F riday's
end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely ~
to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh, as
he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw
him, he turns about, and comes after him, taking very
long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, as would
have put a horse to a middling gallop: away runs Friday,
and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help; so
we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver
my man; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing
the bear back upon us, when he was going about his own
business another way: and especially I was angry that he
had turned the bear upon us, and then run away; and I
called out, "You dog! is this your making us laugh?
Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature." He heard me, and cried out, "No shoot,
no shoot; stand still, and you get much laugh :" and as
the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear's one, he
turned on a sudden on one side of us, a d seeing a great
oak tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned s to follow ; and
doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his
gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards
from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the
tree, and we followed at a distance: the first thing he did,
he stopped at the gun, smelled at it, but let it lie, and up
he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so
monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought
1t, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all
rode near to him.

What; we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the
5
small end of a large branch, and the bear got about halfway
to him. As soon as the bear got out to that part where the
limb of the tree was weaker--"Ha!" says he to us, "now
you see me teachee the bear dance: so he began jumping
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how
he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily.
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal: when
seeing him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had
supposed the bear could speak English, " What, you come
no farther? pray you come farther!" so he left ofl" jump-
ing and shaking the tree ; and the bear, just as if he
understood what he said, did come a little farther; then
he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We
thought now was a good time to knock him in the head,
and called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the
bear: but he cried out earnestly, " O pray, 0 pray! no
shoot--me shoot now and then 2" he would have said by-
and--by. However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much, and the bear stood so tieklish, that we had laughing
enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would
do : for the first we thought he depended upon shaking the
bear off ; and we found the bear was too cunning for that,
too; for he would not go far enough to be thrown down,
but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that
we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what
the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt
quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and
that he would not be persuaded to come any farther,
" "Well, well," says Friday, "you no come farther, me go;
you no come to me, me come to you ;" and upon this he
went to the smaller end of the bough, where it would bend
with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding
down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on
his feet, and away he ran to his gun and took it up. " Well,"
said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now? Why
don't you shoot him?" " N o shoot," says Friday, "no
yet; me shoot now, me no kill ; me stay, give you one more
laugh :" and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear saw he
was gone, he came back to the bough where he stood, but
did it very cautiously, looking behind him every step, and
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree;
then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the
tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one feet at a.
time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he
could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up
close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear,
and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about to see
if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased,
by our looks, he began to laugh very loud. " So we kill
bear in my country," says Friday. "So you kill them?"
Says 1, "why, you have no guns." "No," says he, "no
gun, but shoot great much long arrow." This was a good
diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our
guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew;
the howling of wolves ran much in my head ; and, indeed,
except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
I never heard anything that filled me with so much
horror. .

These things, and the approach of night, called us 05', or
else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly
have taken the skin of this monstrous creature oil, which
was worth saving; but we had three leagues to go, and
our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went forward
on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so
deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the raven-
ous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down
into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger to seek
for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the
villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a
great many of their sheep and horses, andsome people,
too. We had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide
told us, if there were more wolves in the country we should
find them there; and this was a small plain surrounded
with woods on every side, and a. long, narrow defile, or
lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and
then we should come to the village where we were to
lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we
entered the wood, and a little after sunset when we came
into the plain: we met with nothing in the first wood,
except that in a little plain within the wood, which was not
above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the
road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view: they took no
notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments.
Upon this, our guide, who by the way was but a faint-
hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he
believed there were more wolves coming. We kept our
arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw no more
wolves till we came through that wood, which was near
half a league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came
into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us:
the first object we met with was a horse which the wolves
had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we could
not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they
had eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to
disturb them at their feast, neither did they take much
notice of us. Friday would have let fly at them, but
I would not suifer him by any means; for I found we were
like to have more business upon our hands than we were
aware of. We had not gone half over the plain when we
began to hear the wolves bowl in the wood on our left in
a frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and
most of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up
by experienced oflicers. I scarce knew in what manner to
receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line
was the only way ; so we found in amoment: but that we
might not have too much interval, I ordered that only
every other man should fire, and that the others, who had
not fired, should stand ready to give them a second volley
immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and
then that those who had fired at first should not pretend
to use their fusees again, but stand ready, everyone with
a pistol, for we were all well armed with a fusee and
a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method,
able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time: however,
at present, we had no necessity: for, upon firing the first
valley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well
with the noise as with the fire; four of them being shot in
the head, dropped: several others were wounded, and went
bleeding of, as we could see by the snow. I found they
stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, re-
membering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures
were terrified at the voice of man, I caused all the
company to halloo as loud as they could; and I found the
notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they
. began to retire and turn about. I then ordered a second
' volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the
gallop, and away they went to the woods. This gave us
leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose
no time, we kept going; but we had little more than
loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left,
only that it was farther onward, the same way we were
to o. .

ghe night was coming on, and the light began to be
dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the noise in--
creasing, we could easily perceive that it was the howling
and yelling of those hellish creatures ; and on a sudden we
perceived two or three troops of wolves, one on our left,
one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to
be surrounded with them: however, as they did not fall
upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we could
make our horses go, which was only a good hard trot. In
this manner, we came in view of the entrance of a wood,
through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the
plain; but we were greatly surprised, when, coming
nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of
. Wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at
1 another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun,
and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with asaddle and
a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seven-
teen wolves after him at full speed: the horse had the ad--
vantage of them; but as we supposed that "he could not
hold it at that rate, we doubted not but that they would get
up with him at last: no question but that they did.

But here we had a horrible sight; for riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcases
of another horse and of two men, devoured by the raven-
ous creatures; and one of the men was no doubt the same
whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just. by
him fired oll'; but as to the man, his head and the upper
part of his body were eaten up. This filled us with horror,
and we knew not what course to take; but the creatures
resolved as soon, for they gathered about us presently, in
hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three
hundred of them. It happened, very much to our advan-
tage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way
from it, there lay some large timber-trees, which had been
cut down the summer before, and, I suppose, lay there for
carriage. I drew my little troop in among those trees,
and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree,
I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before
us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts,
enclosing our horses in the centre. We did so, and it was
well we did; for never was a more furious charge than the
creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with
a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of tim-
ber, which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they
Were only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs,
it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our
horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before,
every other man ; and they took their aim so sure that they
killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but there
was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would
have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came
forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and
I believe, in these four firings, we had killed seventeen or
eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came
on again. I was loath to spend our shot too hastily; so I
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better
employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he
had charged my fusee and his own while we were engaged
--but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him
a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all along the
piece of timber, and let it be a. large train. He did so, and
had but just time to get away, when the wolves came up to
it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged
pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that
were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or
seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among us with the
force and fright of the fire: we despatched these in an
instant, and the rest were so frightened with the light,
which the night--for it was now very dark--made more
terrible, that they drew back a little; upon which I
ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and
after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned
tail, and we sallicd out immediately upon near twenty
lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell
to cutting them with our swords, which answered our ex--
pectation, for the crying and howling they made was
better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled
and left us.

life had, first and last, killed about threeseore of them,
and had it been daylight we had killed many more. The
field of battle being thus cleared, we came forward again,
for we had still near a league to go. We heard the
ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods, as we went,
several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them; but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not cer--
tain. In about an hour more we came to the town where
we were to lodge, which we found in a. terrible fright, and
all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and
bears had broken into the village, and put them in such
terror, that they were obliged to keep guard night and
day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle,
and, indeed, their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs
swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds, that
he could go no further; so we were obliged to take a new
guide here, and go to Thoulouse, where we found a warm
climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no Snow, no
Wolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our
story at Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary at the foot of the mountains, especially when
the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much
what kind ofa guide we had got, who would venture to
bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it
was surprising we were not all devoured. When we told
them how we had placed ourselves and the horses in the
middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it WM
fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the
sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, see-
ing their prey, and that at other times they were really
afraid of a gun; but being excessively hungry, and raging
on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses had
made them senseless of danger, and that if we had not, by
the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but
that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been
content to have sat still on horseback, and fired as horse-
men, they would not have taken the horses so much for
their own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise;
and, withal, they told us that at last, if we had stood all
together, and left our horses, they would have been so
eager to have devoured them, that we might have come
ofl' safe, especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and
being so many in number. For my part, I was never so
sensible of danger in my life, for, seeing above three hun-
d1 ed devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us,
and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave my-
self ov e1 for lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall never
cum to cross those mountains again , I think I would
much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was
sure to meet with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my
passage through France--nothing but what other travellers
have given an account of with much more advantage than
I can. I travelled from Thoulouse to Paris, and, without
any considerable stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at
Dover the 14th of January, after having a severe cold sea-
son to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had 1n
a little time all my new- -discovered estate safe about me,
the bills of exchange which I brought with me having been
very currently paid.
My principal guide and privy-counseller was my good,
ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money I had sent
her, thought no pains too much nor care too great to
employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with every--
thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my
efl'ects; and, indeed, I was very happy from the beginning,
and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good
gentlewoman.

And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation
in the Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who
having offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of
my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the
offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces-of-eight to
a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form
which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man,
who sent me the bills of exchange for thirty--two thousand
eight hundred pieces-of-eight for the estate, reserving the
payment of one hundred moidores a year to him (the old
man) during his life, and fifty moidores afierwards to his
son for his life, which I had promised them, and which the
plantation was to make good as a rent-charge. And thus
I have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure
----a life of Providence's chequer--work, and of a variety
which the world will seldom be able to show the like of--
beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than
:ny part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope

or.

Any one would think that in this state of complicated
good fortune I was past running,r any more hazards, and so,
indeed, I had been, if other circumstances had concurred;
but I was inured to a wandering life, had no family, nor
many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted much
acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the
Brazils, yet I could not keep that country out of my head,
and had a great mind to be upon the wing again; espe-
cially I could not resist the inclination I had to see my
lsland, and to know if the poor Spaniards were in being
there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven
years she prevented my running abroad. during which
time I took my two nephews, the children of one of my
brothers, into my care: the eldest having something of his
own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a. settlement
of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other
I placed with the captain of a ship; and after five years,
finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I
put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this
young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was,
to farther adventure myself.

In the meantime I in part settled myself here; for, first
of all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or
dissatisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one
daughter; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming
home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my incli.
nation to go abroad and his importunity prevailed, and
engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the East
Indies; this was in the year 1694.

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island--
saw my successors the Spaniards--had the whole story of
their lives, and the villains I left there--how at first they
insulted the poor Spaniards--how they afterwards agreed,
disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards
were obliged to use violence with them--how they were
subjected to the Spaniards--how honestly the Spaniards
used them; a history, if it were entered into, as full of
variety and wonderful accidents as my own part, par-
ticularly, also, as to their battles with the Caribbeans, who
landed several times upon the island, and as to the im-
provement they made upon the island itself, and how five
of them made an attempt upon the mainland, and brought
away eleven men and five women prisoners; by whom, at
my coming, I found about twenty young children on the
island.

Here I stayed about twenty days--left them supplies 0]
all necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder,
shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, whom I brought
from England with me, viz., a carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, re-
served to myself the property of the whole, but gave them
such parts respectively as they agreed on ; and having
settled all things with them, and engaged them not to leave
the place, I left them there.

Sailing from thence I touched at the Brazils, whence
I sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people to
the island; and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven
women, being such as I found proper for service, or for
wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,
I promised them to send them some women from England,
with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply
themselves to-planting, which I afterwards could not per-
form. The fellows proved very honest and diligent after
they were mastered, and had their properties set apart for
them. I sent them also, from the Brazils, five cows, three
of them being big with calf; some sheep, and some
hogs, which when I came again were considerably in-

But all these things, with an account how three hun-
dred Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their
plantations, and how they fought with that whole number
twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed;
but, at last, a storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they
famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and
recovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived
upon the island.

All these things, with some very surprising incidents
in some new adventures of my own, for ten years more,

I shall give a farther account of in the second part of my
history.
PART II.

THAT homely proverb, " That what is bred in the bone
will not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than
in the story of my life. Any one would think that after
the thirty-five years' afliiction, and a variety of unhappy
circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through
before, and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment
in the fulness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it
might be allowed me to have had experience of every state
of middle life, and to know which was most adapted to
make a man completely happy--I say, after all this, any
one would have thought that the native propensity to
rambling, which I gave an account of in my first setting
out. in the world to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, would be worn out, the volatile part be fully
evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, at sixty-one
years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home,
and have done venturing life and fortune any more.

But when I came home, I was still as uneasy as I was
before; I had no relish for the place, no employment in it,
nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person,
This also was the thing which, of all circumstances of life.
was the most my aversion, who had been all my days used
to an active life."

It was now the beginning of the year 1623, when my
nephew, who I had brought up to the sea, and had made
commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage
to Bilboa, being the first he had made. He came to me,
and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had
been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East
Indies and to China. "And now, uncle," says he, "if
you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you upon
your old habitation in the island; for we are to touch at
the Brazils."

I was not long resolving, for, indeed, the importunities
of my nephew joined so effectually with my inclination,
that nothing could oppose me: on the other hand, my wife
being dead, nobody concerned themselves so much for me
as to persuade me to one way or the other, except my
ancient good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled
with me to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and
the needless hazards of a long voyage, and, above all, my
young children. But it was all to no purpose. I had an
irresistible desire for the voyage; and I told her I thought
there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had
upon my mind, that it would be a kind of resisting
Providence if I should attempt to stay at home: after
which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me,
not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in
settling my family afi'airs for my absence, and providing for
the education of my children.

In order to do this, I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and placed
in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they
would have justice done them, whatever might befal me:
and for their education, I left it wholly to the widow, with
a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care--all which
she richly deserved; for no mother could have taken more
care in their education, or understood it better: and as
she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of
January, 1694-5 ; and I, with my man Friday, went
on board, in the Downs, the 8th, having besides a framed
sloop, which was shipped in pieces, a very considerable
cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony;
which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved
to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed
to place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work
there, upon my account, while I stayed, and either to leave
them there or carry them forward, as they should appear
willing; particularly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and
a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade,
and was also a general mechanic; for he was dexterous at
making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, was a good
turner and a good pot-maker; he also made any thing that
was proper to make of earth or of wood; in a word, we
called him our J aok-of--all trades. With these I carried 9
tailor, who had offered himself to go a passenger to the
East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to
stay on our new plantation; and who proved a most neces-
sary, handy fellow, as could be desired, in many other
businesses besides that of his trade; for necessity arms us
for all employments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, consisted of a suf--
ficient quantity of linen, and some English thin studs, for
clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there; and
enough as, by my calculation, might comfmtably supply
them for sex on \e: urs. If I remember 1ight, the materials
I cauied for clothing them amounted to above two hun-
d1ed pounds; and mm a hundred pounds more in iron-
work, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and
every necessary thing I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskcts, and
fusees; besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two pieces
of brass cannon; and, because I knew not what time and
what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred
barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron
part of some pikes and halberts; so that, in short, we had
alarge magazine of all sorts of stores; and I made my
nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he
wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there was occasion;
that when we came there we might build a fort, and man
it against all sorts of enemies ; and, indeed, I at first
thought there would he need enough for all, and much
more, it we hoped to maintain our possession of the island;
as shall be seen in the course of the story.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland; and,
to shorten my story, I came to my old habitation, the
island, on the 10th of April, 1695.

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and
asked him if he knew where he was? He looked about
a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried, " 0 yes,
0 theie, 0 yes, 0 there!" pointing to our old habitation,
and fell dancing and capering like a mad fellow; and I
had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to
swim ashore to the place.

" Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find
anybody here or no? and do you think we shall see your
father ?" The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while;
but when I named his father, the poor affectionate creature
looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his
face very plentifully. " What is the matter ? Friday," says
I; " are you troubled because you may see your father?"
"No, no," says he, shaking his head, "no see him more;
no, never more see him again." " Why so," said I, " Fri-
day? how do you know that?" " 0 no, 0 no," says
Friday; "he long ago die, long ago; he much old man."
"Well, well," says I, " Friday, you don't know: but shall
we see any one else then ?" The fellow, it seems, had
better eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above my
old house; and though we lay half a league 05', he cries
out, "We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much man there,
and there, and there." I looked, but I saw nobody, no,
not with a perspective-glass, which was, I suppose, be-
cause I could not hit the place; for the fellow was right,
as I found upon inquiry the next day; and there were
five or six men all together, who stood to look at the ship,
not knowing what to think of us.

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the
English ensign to be spread, and fired three guns, to give
them notice we were friends; and in about half a quarter
of an hour after, we perceived a smoke arise from the side
of the creek: so I immediately ordered the boat out,
taking Friday with me; and hanging out a white flag, I
went directly on shore. We had about sixteen men well
armed, if we had found any new guests there which we
did not know of : but we had no need of weapons. .

. As we went on shore upon the flood tide, near high
water, we rowed directly into the creek; and the first
man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whose life I
had saved, and whom I knew by his face perfectly well. I
ordered nobody to go on shore at first but myself; but there
was no keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate
creature had spied his father at a. distance, a good way
off the Spaniards, where, indeed, I saw nothing of him;
and if they had not let him go ashore, he would have
jumped into the se. . He was no sooner on shore, but he
flew away to his father, like an arrow out of a bow. It
would have made any man shed tears to have seen the
first transports of this poor fellow's joy when he came to
his father: how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his
face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree,
and lay down by him; then stood and looked at him, as
any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of
an hour together; then lay down on the ground, and
stroked his legs, and kissed them, then got up again, and
stared at him; one would have thought the fellow be-
witched. But it would have made a dog laugh the next
day to see how his passion ran out another way: in the
morning, he walked along the shore, with his father,
several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he
had been a lady; and every now and then he would come
to the boat to fetch something or other for him, either a.
lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit, or something or other
that was geod. In the afternoon, his frolics ran another
way; for then he would set the old man down upon the
ground and dance about him, and make a thousand antic
postures and gestures; and all the while he did this, he
would be talking to him, and telling him one story or
other of his travels, and of what had happened to him
abroad, to divert him.

It would be needless to take notice of all the ceremonies
and civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The
first Spaniard, whose life I had saved, came towards the
boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also ;
and he not only did not know me at first, but he had no
thoughts, no notion of its being me that was come, till I
spoke to him. "Seignior," said I in Portuguese, " do
you not know me 9" At which he spoke not a word, but
giving his musket to the man that was with him, threw
his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that I did
not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, telling
me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that
he had once seen as if an angel from Heaven, sent to save
his life: he said abundance of very handsome things, and
then beckoning to the person that attended him, bade him
go and call out his comrades. He then asked me if I
would wall: to my old habitation, where he would give me
possession of my own house again, and where I should see
they had made but mean improvements: so I walked
along with him; but, alas! I could no more find the
place than if I had never been there; for they had planted
so many trees, and placed them in such a position, so
thick and close to one another, and in ten years' time they
were grown so big, that, in short, the place was in-
accessible, except by such windings and blind ways as they
themselves only, who made them, could find.

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications.
He told me I would say there was need enough of it,
when they had given me an account how they had passed
their time since their arriving in the island, especially after
they had the misfortune to find that I was gone. He told
me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good
tin-tune, when he heard that Iwas gone in a good ship, and
that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time
or other he should see me again: but nothing that ever
hvf'cl him in his life, he said, was so surprising and
afflicting to him at first, as the disappointment he was
under when he came back to the island and found I was
not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were
left: behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to
tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves much better
among the savages, only that their number was so small:
"And," says he, "had they been strong enough, we had
been all long ago in purgatory."

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he
had sent back, and with him eleven more. In the dress
they were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they
were of; but he made all clear, both to them and to me.
First he turned to me, and pointing to them, said, " These,
sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to
you ;" and then turning to them. and pointing to me, he
16
let them know who I was; upon which they all came up,
one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordina
fellows, and the like, but really as if they had been
ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great eon-
qneror: their behaviour was, to the last degree, obliging
and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic
gravity, which very well became them; and, in short, they
had so much more manners than I, that I scarce knew
how to receive their civilities, much less how to return
them in kind.

The, history of their coming to, and conduct in, the
island, after my going away, is so very remarkable, and
has so many incidents, which the former part. of my re-
lation will help to understand, and which will, in most of
the particulars, refer to the account I have already given,
that I cannot but commit them, with great delight, to
the reading of those that come after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the
first person, which will put me to the expense of ten
thousand " said 1's," and "said he's," and "he told ine's,"
and "I told him's," and the like; but I shall collect the
facts historically, as near as I can gather them out of my
memory, from what they related to me, and from what I
met with in my conversing with them, and with the place.

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I
can, I must go back to the circumstances in which I left
the island, and in which the persons were of whom I am
to speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat that I had
sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard to fetch over
the Spaniard's companions that he left behind him.

And I desired the Spaniard would give me a particular
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the
boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me
there was little variety in that part, for nothing remark--
able happened to them on the way, having had very calm
Weather, and a smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it
could not be doubted, he said, but that they were OVer--
joyed to see him; that when he told them the story of
his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for
carrying them away, it was like a dream to them, and
their astonishment, he said, was somewhat like that of
J oseph's brethren, when he told them who he was, and the
story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when he
showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and pro-
visions, that he brought them for their voyage, they were
J<-~tored to themselves, took a share of the joy of their
deliverance, and immediately prepared to come away with
him. Their first business was to get canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty
of it, but to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to
lmrrow two large canoes, on pretence of going out a
fishing, or for pleasure. In these they came away the
next morning. It seems they wanted no time to get them-
selves ready; for they had no baggage, neither clothes,
provisions, nor anything in the world but what they had
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to
make their bread.

They were, in all, three weeks absent; and in that time,
unluckily for them, I had the occasion ofi'ered for my
escape, as I mentioned in the other part, and to get off
from the island, leaving three of the most impudent,
hardened, ungovemed, disagreeable villains behind me,
that any man could desire to meet with; to the poor
Spaniards' great grief and disappointment, you may be sure.

The only just things the rogues did was, that when the
Spaniards came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and
gave them provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered
them to do; also they gave them the long paper of direc-
tions which I had left with them, containing the particular
methods which I took for managing every part of my life
there; nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards
with anything else, for they agreed very well for some time.
They gave them an equal admission into the house, or
cave, and they began to live very sociably; and the head
Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, and
Friday's father together, managed all their affairs; but as
for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about
the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises; and when
they came home at night, the Spaniards provided their
suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had
the others but let them alone; which, however, they could
not find in their hearts to do long; but, like the dog in
the manger, they would not eat themselves, neither would
they let the others eat. The differences, nevertheless,
were at first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating,
but at last it broke out into open war: and it began with
all the rudeness and insolence that can be imagined--
without reason or provocatian, contrary to nature, and,
indeed, to common sense: and though, it is true, the first
relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom
I may call the accusers, yet when I came to-examine the
fellows, they could not deny a word of it.

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must
supply a defect in my former relation: and this was, I
forgot to set down, among the rest, that just as we were
weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened alittle
quarrel on board of our ship, which I was once afraid
would have turned to a second mutiny; nor was it
appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and,
making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he
laid them in irons: and as they had been active in the
ibrmer disorders, and let fall some dangerous words, the
second time he threatened to carry them in irons to
England, and have them hanged there for mutiny, and
running away with the ship. This, it seems, though the
captain did not intend to do it, frightened some other men
in the ship: and some of them had put it into the heads
of the rest, that the captain only gave them good words
for the present, till they should come to some English
port, and that then they should be all put into gaol, and
tried for their lives. The mate got intelligence of this.
and acquainted us with it; upon which it was desired
that I, who still passed for a great man among them,
should go down with the mate, and satisfy the men, and
tell them that they might be assured, if they behaved well
the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time
past should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing
my honour's word to them, they appeared easy, and the
more so when I caused the two men that were in irons to
be released and forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that
night; the wind also falling calm next morning, we found
that our two men, who had been laid in irons, had stolen
each of them a musket and some other weapons (what pow--
der or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the
ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run
away with her to their companions in roguery on shore.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore,
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to
seek the rogues; but they could neither find them nor any
of the rest, for they all fled into the woods when they saw
the boat coming on shore. The mate was once resolved,
in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their plan-
tations, burned all their household stufi' and furniture,
and left them to shift without it; but having no orders,
he let it all alone, left everything as he found itfand,
bringing the pinnace away, came on board without them.
These two men made their number five; but the other
three villains were so much more wicked than they, that
after they had been two or three days together they turned

the two new comers out of doors to shift for themselvesnfi

and would have nothing to do with them; nor could they,
for a good while, be persuaded to give them any food: as
for the Spaniards, they were not yet come.

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business
began to go forward; the Spaniards would have per-
suaded the three English brutes to have taken in their
countrymen again, that they might be all one family; but
they would not hear of it: so the two poor fellows lived
by themselves; and finding nothing but industry and
application would make them live comfortably, they
pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a
little more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages,
who always landed on the east parts of the island.

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the
other to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the
Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and some
of the peas which -I had left them, they dug, planted, and
enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, and
began to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was
on the ground; und'though it was but a little bit of land
_ which they had dug up at first, having had but a
' little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find
' them with bread and other eutables; and one of the
' fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready
at making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as
the rice, and the milk, and such little flesh as they got,
furnished him to do.

They were going on in this little thriving position when
the three unnatural rogues--their own countrymen, too
----in more humour and to insult them, came and bullied
them, and told them that the island was theirs; that the
governor, moaning me, had given them possessibn of it,
and nobody else had any right to it; and that they should
build no houses upon their ground, unless they would pay
rent for them.

The two men, thinking they were jesting, at first asked
them to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses
they were that they had built, and to tell them what rent
they demanded; and one of them merrily said, if they
were the ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built tene-
ments upon their land, and made improvements, they
would, according to the custom of landlords, grant a long
lease; and desired they would get a scrivener to draw the
writings. One of the three, cursing and raving, told
them they should see they were not in jest; and, going to
a little place at a distance, where the honest men had
made a file to dress their victuals, he takes a fire--brand,
and claps it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly sets
it on fire; and it would have been all burned down in a
few minutes if one of the two had not run to the fellow,
thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and
that not without some difficulty.

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a pole
he had in his hand, and had not the man avoided the blow
very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended his days
at once. His comrade, seeing the danger they were both.~,- 1

 

"The man that was first struck at knocked down the follow that began ' w
the quarrel with the butt end of his musket." g
in, ran in after him, and immediately they both came out
with their muskcts, and the man that was first struck at
with the pole knocked the fellow down that began the
quarrel with the stock of his musket, and that before the
other two could come to help him; and then, seeing
the rest come at them, they stood together, and, presenting
the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off,

The others had fire-arms with them too; but one of the
two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made
desperate by his danger, told them, if they ofi'ered to
move hand or foot they were dead men, and boldly com-
nmnded them to lay down their arms. They did not,
indeed, lay down their arms, but seeing them so resolute,
it brought them to a parley, and they consented to take
their wounded man with them and be gone: and, indeed,
it seems the fellow was wounded seriously with the blow.
llowwer, they were much in the wrong, since they had
the advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually,
as they might have done, and have gone immediately to
the Spaniards, and given them an account how the rogues
had treated them; for the three villains studied nothing
but revenge, and every day gave them some intimation
that they did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser
rogueries, such as treading down their corn, shooting three
young kids and a she-goat which the poor men had got to
breed up tame for their store, and plaguing them night
and day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
desperation that they reshlved to fight them all three the
first time they had a fair opportunity. In order to do this,
they resolved to go to the castle, as they called it (that was
my old dwelling), where the three rogues and the Spaniards
all lived together at that time, intending to .have a fair
battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play.
So they got up in the morning before day, and came to the
place, and called the Englishmen by their names, telling
a Spaniard, that answered, that they wanted to speak with
them.

It happened that, the day before, two of the Spaniards,
having been in the woods. had seen one of the two English-
men, whom, for distinction, I call the honest men, and he
had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous
usage they had met with from their three countrymen, and
how they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their
corn that they had laboured so hard to bring forward, and
killed the milch--goat and their three kids, which was all
they had provided for their sustenance; and that if he and
his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them
again, they should be starved. \Vhen the Spaniards came
home at night, and they were all at supper, one of them
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though
in very gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them how
they could be so cruel, they being harmless, inoll'ensive
fellows: that they were putting themselves in a way to
subsist by their labour, and that it had cost them a great
deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they
were then in.

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, "What
had they to do there? that they came on shore without
leave; and that they should not plant or build upon the
island, it being none of their ground." " Why," says the
Spaniard very calmly, "Seignior Inglese, they must not
starve." The Englishman replied, like a rough-hewn tar-
pauling, " They might starve; they should not plant nor
build in that place." "But what must they do, then,
seignior ?" said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes
returned, "Do! they should be servants, and work for
them." "But how can you expect that of them?" says
the Spaniard: "they are not bought with your money:
you have no right to make them servants." The English-
man answered, " The island was theirs; the governor had
given it to them, and no man had anything to do there
but themselves ;" and with that, swore by his Maker that
they would go and burn all their new huts ; they should
build none upon their land. "Why, seignior," says the
Spaniard, "by the same rule, We must be your servants,
too." "Ay," says the bold dog, " and so you shall, too,
before we have done with you ;" mixing two or three oaths
in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only
smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this
little discourse had heated them; and starting up, one
says to the other (I think it was he they called Will
Atkins), " Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other brush
with them; we'll demolish their castle, I'll warrant you;
they shall plant no colonies in our dominions."

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man
a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent
things among themselves, of what they would do to the
Spaniards too, when opportunity ofi'ered; but the Spaniards,
it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to know
all the particulars, only that, in general, they threatened
them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part.

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time
that evening, the Spaniards said they did not know; but
it seems they wandered about the country part of the
night, and then lying down in the place which I used to
call my bower, they were weary, and overslept themselves.
The case was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight,
and so to take the two poor men when they were asleep,
and, as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to set fire
to their huts while they were in them, and either burn
them there or murder them as they came out. As malice
seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should
not have been kept awake.

However, as the two men had also a design upon them,
as I have said, though a much fairer one than that of
burning and murdering, it happened, and very luckily
for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before
the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.

When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins,
who, it seems, was the forwardest man, called out to his
comrade, "Ha, Jack, here's the nest, but the birds are
flown." They mused awhile, to think what should be the
occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested
presently that the Spaniards had given them notice of it;
and with that they shook hands, and swore to one another
that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon
as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to work
with the poor men's habitation; they did not set fire,
indeed, to anything. but they pulled down both their
houses, and pulled them so limb from limb that they left
not the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the
ground where they stood; they tore all their little col-
lected household stuil' in pieces, and threw everything
about in such a manner that the poor men afterwards
found some of their things a mile off their habitation.
\Vhen they had done this, they pulled up an enclosure
they had made to secure their cattle and their corn; and
sacked and plundered everything as completely as a horde
of Tartars would have done.

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them
out, and had resolved to fight them wherever they had
been, though they were two or three; so that, had they
met, there certainly would have been bloodshed among
them ; for they were all very stout, resolute fellows.

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder
than they themselves could do to meet: for, as if they had
dogged one another, when the three were gone thither,
the two were here; and afterwards, when the two went
back to find them, the three were come to the old habita'
tion again: we shall see their dill'ercnt conduct presently.
When the three came back like furious creatures, flushed
with the rage which the work they had been about had
put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told
them what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado;
and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if
they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his
hat as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about,
flooring in his face, says to him, "And you, Seignior Jack
Spaniard, shall have the same sauce if you do not mend
your manners." The Spaniard, who, though a quiet, civil
man, was as brave aman as could be, and withal a strong,
well--made man, looked at him for a good while, and then,
having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him,
and, with one blow from his fist, knocked him down, as an
ex is felled with a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues,
as insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard
immediately: he missed his body, indeed, for the bullets
went through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of
his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood made the
Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really was,
and that put him into some heat, for before he acted all in
a perfect calm; but now, resolving to go through with his
work, he stopped, and took the fellow's musket whom he
had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the man
who had fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards,
being in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to

shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, and took
their arms from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own
countrymen, they began to cool, and, giving the Spaniards
better words, would have had their arms again; but the
Spaniards, considering the feud that was between them
and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the
best method they could take to keep them from killing
one another, told them they would do them no harm ; and
if they would live peaceably, they would be very willing to
assist and associate with them as they did before; but
that they could not think of giving them their arms again
while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them
to their own countrymen, and had even threatened them
all to make them their servants.

The rogues were now more capable to hear reason
than to act with reason; but being refused their arms,
they went raving away, and raging like madmen, threaten-
ing what they would do, though they had no fire-arms.
But the Spaniards, despising their threatenings, told them
they should take care how they ofl'ered any injury to their
plantation or cattle, for if they did, they would shoot them
as they would ravenous beasts, wherever they found them;
and if they fell into their hands alive, they should cer--
tainly be hanged. However, this was far from cooling
them, but away they went, raging and swearing like furies
of hell. As soon as they were gone, the two men came
back, in passion and rage enough also, though of another
kind; for having been at their plantation, and finding it
all demolished and destroyed, as above, itwill easily be
supposed they had provocation enough. They could
scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so
eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange enough to
find that three men should thus bully nineteen, and reeeire
no punishment at all.

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially,
having thus disarmcd them, made lie-ht of their threaten--
ings; but the. two Englishmen resolved to have their
remedy against them, what pains soever it cost to find
them out. But the Spaniards interposed here too, and
told them, that as they had disarmed them, they could not;
consent that they (the two) should pursue them with tire~
arms, and perhaps kill them. "lint," said the grave
Spaniard, who was their governor, "we will endeavour to
make. them do you justice, if you will leave. it. to us; for
there is no doubt lint they will come to us again, when
their passion is over, being not able to subsist without our
assistance: we promise. you to make. no peace with them,
without having a. full satislitction for you; and, upon this
condition, we. hope you will promise to use no violent-e.
with them, other than in your own defence." The. two
l'lnglisluncn yielded to this with great. reluctance; but the
Spaniards protested that they did it only to keep them
from bloodshed, and to make. them all easy at last.

In about five. days' time, the three vagrants, tired with
wandering, and almost: starred with hunger, haringehielly
lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came back to the
grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was
the governor, and two more with him, walking by the side.
ot~ the creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble
manner, and begged to be received again into the iiunily.
'l'he Spaniards used them civilly, but told them that. they
had acted so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so rery
grossly to them (the Spaniards), that. they could not come
to any conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen
and the rest; but, however, they would go to them and
discourse about it, and they should know in half an hour.
it may be guessed that they were very hard put to it; for,
it. seems, as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer,
they begged they would send them out some bread in the
meantime, which they did; sending, at the same. time, a.
large piece of goat's flesh and a boiled parrot, which they
ate very heartily, for they were hungry enough.
After half an hour's consultation, they were called in,
and a long debate ensued; their own countrymen charging
them with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to
murder them; all which they owned before, and therefore
could not deny now. Upon the whole, the Spaniards
noted the moderators between them; and as they had
obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while
they were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the
three to go and rebuild their fellows' two huts, one to be
of the same, and the other of larger, dimensions than they
were before; to fence their ground again, where they had
pulled up their fences, plant trees in the room of those
pulled up, dig up the land again for planting corn, where
they had spoiled it, and to restore everything to the same
state as they found it, as near as they could.

\V ell, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty
of provisions given them all the while, they grew very
orderly, and the whole society began to live pleasantly and
agreeably together again; only that these three fellows
could never be persuaded to Work for themselves, except
now and then a little, just as they pleased. However, the
Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but live
socially and friendly together, and study the good of the
whole plantation. they would be content to work for them,
and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased:
and thus, having lived pretty well together for a month or
two, the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave them
liberty to go abroad with them as before.

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and
went abroad, before the ungrateful creatures began to be
as insolent and troublesome as ever; but, however, an
accident happened presently upon this, which endangered
the safety of them all, and they were obliged to lay by all
private resentments, and look to the preservation of their
lives.

One night, two of the Spaniards went out, to go up to
the top of the hill, where I used to go; and were going
round through the grove, unconcerned and unwary, when
they were surprised with seeing a light, as of fire, a very
little way ofi' from them, and hearing the voices of men---
not of one or two. but of a great number."'14 ROBINSON (TRITSUE.

another, and were so near, that he believed they would
fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but he
did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made
an end of telling his story, when they could perceive, by
the unusual noise they made, that the two little armies
were engaged in a bloody tight.

Friday's t'ather used all the arguments he could to per-
suade our people to lie. close, and not be seen; he told
them their safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing .
to do but he still, and the savages would kill one another
to their hands, and then the rest would go away; and it
was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, espe-
cially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so impor-
tnnate, that they must run out and see the battle ;
however, they used some caution, too: they did not go
openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther into
the Woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they
might securely see them manage. the tight, and, as they
thought, not be seen by them; but it seems the savages
did see them, as we shall find hereafter.

The battle was very lierce; and, if .1 might believe the
Englishmen, one. ofthem said he could perceive that some
of them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirits,
and of great policy in guiding the tight. The battle, they
said. held two hours belhre they could guess which party
Would be beaten; but then that party which was nearest
our people's habitation began to fly; and this put our
men again into a great consternation, lest any one of those
that tied should run into the grove before their dwelling
for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place;
and that, by consequence, the pursners would do the like
in search of them. Upon this, they resolved that they
would stand armed within the wall, and whoever came
into the grove, they resolved to sally out over the Wall
and kill them, so that, if possible, not one should return
'0 give an account of it; they ordered, also, that it
should he done with their swords, or by knocking them
down with the stocks of their nniskets, but not by
shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.".5 n -. = wewwv "Permafrfitvvw-'wazr- "'3' ' NEW 1

256 aoam'son causes.

As they expected, it fell out; three of the routed army
fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the
place, not in the least knowing whither they went, but
running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they
kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this

.addition, to our men's great satisfaction--vim, that the

conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way they

were gone; upon this, the Spaniard governor would not

suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three

, men out, ordered them to go round, come in behind them,
and surprise and take them prisoners; which was done.
The residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes,
and got ofi' to sea; the victors retired, made no pursuit, or
very little, but drawing themselves into a body together,
gave two great screaming shouts, which they supposed
was by way of triumph--and so the fight ended; and the
same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also
nmrched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had
the island again free to themselves, their fright was
over, and they saw no more savages for several years
after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den, and viewing the field of battle, they found about
thirty men dead on the spot; some were killed with
great long arrows, some of which were found sticking in
their bodies; but most of them were killed with great"
wooden-swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found
in the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many
arrows. These swords were strange, great, unwieldy
things, and they must be very strong men that used them:
most of those men that were killed with them had their
brains knocked out, and several their arms and legs
broken; so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible
rage and fury. We found not one man that was not
stone dead--for either they stay by their enemy till they
have killed him, or they carry all the wounded men that
are not quite dead away with them. .

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great
while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the con-
sequences appeared terrible to the last degree, especially

upon supposing that some time or other they should fall
into the hands of those creatures, who would not only kill
them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we kill our
cattle; and they professed to me that the thoughts of
being eaten up like beef 'or mutton, though it was
supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible that it nauseated their very
stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and
tilled their minds with such unusual terror, that they
were not themselves for some weeks after. This, as I said,
' tamed even the three English brutes I have been speaking
of; and for a great while after they were tractable, and '
went about the common business of the whole society well
enough. But some time after this they fell into such
simple measures again, as brought them into a great deal
of trouble.

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and
these three being lusty, stout young fellows, they made
them servants, and taught them to work for them; and
as slaves they did well enough; but they did not take
measures with them as I did by my man Friday--viz, to
begin with them upon the principle of having saved their
lives, and then instruct them in the rational principles of
life, much less of religion--civilizing and reducing them
by kind usage and affectionate arguments; but as they
gave them their food every day, so they gave them their
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery
enough; but they failed in this by it, that they never
had them to assist them and fight for them as I had
my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh
upon my bones.

But to come to the family part. Being all now good
friends--for common danger, as I said above, had effectually
reconciled them--they began to consider their general cir-
cumstances; and the first thing that came under conside~
ration was whether, seeing the savages particularly haunted
that side of the island, and that there were more remote
and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of
living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should m3

17
rather move their habitation, and plant in some more
proper place for their safety, and especially for the security
of their cattle and corn.

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they
would not remove their habitation; because that, some
time or other, they thought they might hear from their
governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any
one to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that
side, where, if they should find the place demolished, they
would conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were
gone, and so our supply would go too. Butas to their
corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the
valley where my cave was, where the land was as proper
for both, and where, indeed, there was land enough;
however, upon second thoughts, they altered one part of
their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there;
and so, if one part was destroyed, the other might be
saved. And one part of prudence they used, which it was
very well they did--that they never trusted those three
savages which they had made prisoners with knowing any-
thing of the plantation they had made in that valley, or
of any cattle they had there, much less of the cave there,
which they kept, in case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and
thither they carried also the two barrels of powder which
I had sent them at my coming away. But, however, they
resolved not to change their habitation; yet they agreed,
that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall or forti-
fication, and then with a grove of trees, so seeing their
safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover
and conceal the place yet more effectually than before.
For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in
stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for some
good distance before the entrance into my apartments,
they went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest
of that whole space of ground from the trees I had set
quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I said, I
landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where thes

InonmsoN caoson. 259

tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or
any sign that there had been any landing thereabouts--
these stakes also being of a wood forward to grow, as I
have noted formerly, they took care to have them gene-
rally much larger and taller than those which I had
planted; and as they grew apace, so they planted them so
very thick and close together, that when they had been
,. three or four years grown, there was no piercing with the
eye any considerable way into the plantation; and as for
that part which I had planted, the trees were grown as
thick as a man's thigh, and among them they placed so
many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word,'it
stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was
next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little army to
cut it all down--for a little dog could hardly get between
the trees, they stood so close.

But this was not all; for they did the same by all the
ground to the right hand and to the left, and round even
to the side of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for
themselves, to come out but by the ladder placed up to the
side of the hill, and then lifted up, and placed again from
the first stage up to the top; and when the ladder was
taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to
assist it could come at them. This was excellently well
contrived; nor was it less than what they afterwards found
occasion for.

They lived two years after this inperfect retirement, and
had no more visits from the savages. Theyhad, indeed,
an alarm given them one morning, which put them into a
gr eat consternation; for, some of the Spaniards being out.
a rly one morning on the west side, or rather end of the
Gland (which was that end where I never went, for fear of
) eing discovered), they were surprised with seeing above
twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. They
made the best of their way home in hurry enough;,and
giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close allthat
day and the next, going out only at night to make their
observation; for wherever the savages went, they did not

land that time on the island, but pursued some other
design. '
And now they had another broil with the three English-
men; one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a
rage at one of the three slaves, whom I mentioned they
had taken, because the fellow had not done something right
which he bade him do, and seemed a little untractable in
his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog~belt, in
which he wore it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage,
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards,
who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut
with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck
into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the poor
creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to
murder the poor man, placed himself between him and the
savage to prevent the mischief. The fellow, being enraged
the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet,
and swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the
savage; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow,
and, with a shovel which he had in his hand, knocked the
brute down. Another of the Englishmen, running at the
same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard
down; and then two Spaniards more came in to help their
man, and a third Englishman fell in upon them. They
had none of them any fire-arms or any other weapons but
.hatchets and other tools, except this third Englishman;
he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which he made
at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both. This
fray set the whole family in an uproar, and more help
coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The
next question was, What shouldbe done with them ? They
had been so often mutinous, and were so very furious, so
desperate, and so idle withal, they knew not what" course
to take with them, for they were mischievous to the
nighest degree, and cared not what hurt they did to any
man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many
words, that if they had been of his own country, he would
have hanged them; for all laws and all governors were to
preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the
society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were
Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness of
an Englishman that they all owed their preservation and
deliverance, he would use them with allpossible lenity, and
would leave them to the judgment of the other two English-
men who were their countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said
they desired it might not be left to them. " For," says he,
" I am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows ;"
and with that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one
of the three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen
join together, and murder all the Spaniards when they were
in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will
Atkins, " How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all?
What have you to say i) that ?" The hardened villain
was so far from denying it, that he said it was true, and

swore they would do it still before they had done with '

them. "Well, but Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard,
"what have we done to you that you will kill us? And
what would you get by killing us? And what must we
do to prevent your killing us ? Must we kill you, or you
killus? Why will you put us to the necessity of this,
Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard very calmly, and
smilingly. Seignior Atkins was in such arage with the
Spaniard making a jest of it, that had he not been held by
three men, and withal had no weapon near him, itwas
thought he would have attempted to have killed the
Spaniard in the middle of all the company. This hair-brain
tarriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to
be done: the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved
the poor savage, were of the opinion that they should hang
._ one of the three, for an example to the rest, and that .
' particularly it should be he that had twice attemptedto '
commit murder with his hatchet. But the governor
Spaniard still said no; it was an Englishman that had saved
all their liveS, and he Would never consent to put an
' Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of
them--nay, he said if he had been killed himself by an
Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that
they should pardon him.

This was so positively insisted on by the governor

I
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful
counsels are most apt to prevail, where they are so
earnestly pressed, so they all came into it; but then it
was to be considered what should be done to keep them
from doing the mischief they designed; for all agreed that
means were to be used for preserving the society from
danger. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that they
should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun,
powder, shot, sword, or any weapon; and should be turned
out of the society, and left to live where they would, and
how they would, by themselves; but that none of the rest,
either Spaniards or English, should converse with them,
speak with them, or have anything to do with them: that
they should be forbidden to come within a certain distance
of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they offered to
I commit. any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy
any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle,
belonging to the society, they should die without mercy,
and they would shoot them wherever they could find
them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, nursing upon
the sentence, considered a little upon it; and turning to
the two honest Englishmen, said, "Hold; you must
reflect that it will be long ere they can raise corn and
cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must
therefore allow them provisions." So he caused to be
added, that they should have a proportion of corn given
them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by
which time they might be supposed to raise some of their
own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-
goats, and. six kids given them, as well for present sub-
sistence as for a. store; and that they should have tools
given them for their work in the fields, such as six
hatchets, an adze, a. saw, and the like; but they should
have none of these tools or provisions, unless they would
swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of
the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them
out to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and
refractory, as neither content to go away nor to stay; but,
as there was no remedy, they. went, pretending to go and
choose a place where they would settle themselves; and
some provisions were given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after, they came again for some
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habita-
tion and plantation; and it was a very convenient place,
indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N.E., much
about the place where I providentially landed in my first
voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord knows
whither, in my foolish attempt to sail round the island,

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and
contrived them in a manner like my first habitation, being
close under the side of a. hill, having some trees growing
already on three sides of it, so that by planting others, it
would be very easily covered from the sight, unless
narrowly searched for. They desired some dried goat-
skins for beds and covering, which were given them;
and upon giving their words that they would not disturb
the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them
hatchets, and what other tools they could spare; some
pease, barley, and rice, for sowing; and anything they
wanted, except arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six months,
and had got in their first harvest, though the quantity was
but small, the parcel of land they had planted being but
little; for having all their plantation to form, they had a.
great deal of work upon their hands; and when they came
to make boards and pots, and such things, they were quite
out of their element, and could make nothing of it: and
when the rainy season came on, for want of a. cave in the
earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and it was in
great danger of spoiling; and this humbled them much:
so they came and begged the Spaniards to help them,
which they very readily did; and in four days worked a
great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to
secure their corn and other things from the rain; but it
was a poor place, at best, compared to mine, and espe-
cially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly en-
larged it, and made several new apartments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation,
these rogues took a new frolic, which, together with the
former villany they had committed, brought mischief
enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin of the
whole colony. The three new associates began, it seems,
to be weary of the laborious life they led, and that without
hope of bettering their circumstances; and a whim took
them that they would make a voyage to the continent,
from whence the savages came, and would try if they
could sieze upon some prisoners among the natives there,
and bring them home, so as to make them do the laborious
part of the work for them.

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone
no farther. But they did nothing, and proposed nothing,
but had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the
event.

The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morn--
ing, and in very humble terms desired to be admitted to
speak with them. The Spaniards very readily heard what
they had to say, which was this :--that they were tired of
living in the manner they did: and that they were not
handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and
that having no help, they found they should be starved;
but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one of
the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms
and ammunition proportioned to their defence, they would
go over to the main and seek their fortunes, and so deliver
them from the trouble of supplying them with any other
provisions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction
they were running into; told them they had suffered such
hardships upon that very spot, they could, without any
spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved or mur-
dered; and bade them consider of it.

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved it?
they stayed here, for they could not and would not work,
and they could but be starved abroad; and if they were
murdered, there was an end of them; they had no wives
or children to cry after them; and insisted importunatcly
upon their demand; declaring they would go, whether
they gave them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if
they were resolved to go, they should not go like naked
men, and be in no condition to defend themselves; and
that though they could ill spare their fire-arms, having not
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two
muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet,
which they thought was sufficient for them. They ac--
cepted the offer: and having baked bread enough to serve
them a month, and given them as much goat's--flesh as they
could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket of dried
grapes, a. pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they
boldly set out in the canoe for avoyage over the sea, where
it was at least forty miles broad.

The boat was a large one, and would very well have
carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather
too big for them to manage; but as they had afair breeze,
and floodtide with them, they did well enough. They had
made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and
away they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called
after them, "Ban voyago!" and no man ever thought
of seeing them any more.

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comfortably they lived, now these three tur-
bulent fellows were gone. As for their coming again, that
was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could
be imagined; when, behold, after two-and-twenty days'
absence, one of the Englishmen, being abroad upon his
planting work, sees three strange men coming towards him
from a distance, with guns upon their shoulders.

Away runs the Englishman as if he was bewitched,
comes frightened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and
tells him they were all undone, for there were, strangers
upon the island, but could not tell who they were. The
Spaniard, pausing awhile, says to him, " How do you
mean, you cannot tell who? They are savages, to be
sure." "No, no," says the Englishman; "they are men
in clothes, with arms." "Na ,' then," says the Spaniard,
"why are you so concerned? the are not savages, they
must be friends; for there is no hristian nation upon
earth but will do us good rather than harm."

While they were debating thus, came the three English-
men, and, standing without the wood, which was new
planted, hallooed to them. They presently knew their
voices, and so all the wonder ceased. But now the admi-
ration was turned upon another question :--what could be
the matter, and what made them come back again?

It was not long before they brought the men in, and in-
quiring where they had been, and what they had been
doing, they gave them a full account of their voyage in a
few words ;--that they reached the land in twa days,
or something less; but finding the people alarmed at their
coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight
them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the north-
ward six or seven hours, till they came to a great opening,
by which they perceived that the land they saw from our
island was not the main, but an island; upon entering that
opening of the sea, they saw another island on the right
hand, north, and several more west; and being resolved
to land somewhere, they put over to one of the islands
which lay west, and went boldly on shore: that they
found the people very courteous and friendly to them;
and that they gave several roots and some dried fish, and
appeared very sociable; and the women, as well as the
men, were very forward to supply them with anything
they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a
great way upon their heads. .

They continued here four days; and inquired, as wellas
they could of them, by signs, what nations were this way,
and that way; and were told of several fierce and terrible
people that lived almost every way, who, as they made
known by signs to them, used to eat men; but as for
themselves, they said, they never eat men or women,
except only such as they took in the wars; and then,
they owned, they made a great feast, and ate their
pnsoners.

The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing someave some conversation with '

of their prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought
they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for
their own eating. So they beckoned to them, pointing to
the setting of the sun, and then to the rising; which was to
signify that the, next morning at sunrising they would
bring some for them; and, accordingly, the next morning
they brought down five women and eleven men, and gave
them to the Englishmen, to carry with them on their voyage,
just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a
seaport town to victual a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know
what to do. To refuse the prisoners would have been the
highest affront to the savage gentry that could be ofi'ered
them, and what to do with them they knew not. How-
ever, aftcr some debate, they resolved to accept of them;
and, in return, they gave the savages that brought them
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven

of their bullets; which, though they did not understand-

their use, they seemed particularly pleased with; and then
tying the poor creatures' hands behind them, they dragged
the prisoners into the boat for our men.

In their voyage, they endeavoured to have some com-
munication with their prisoners; but it was impossible to
make them understand anything. Nothing they could
say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was looked
upon as going to murder them. They first of all unbound
them; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially
the women, as if they had just felt the knife at their
throats; for they immediately concluded they were un--
bound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them anything

' to eat, it was the same thing; they then concluded it was
for fear they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough
to kill. If they looked at one of them more particularly,
the party presently concluded it was to see whether he
or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first; nay, after they
had brought them quite over, and began to use them
kindly, and treat them well, they expected every day to
make a dinner or supper for their captors.

When these three wanderers had given this unac-
countable history of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them
where their new family was? and being told that they had
brought them on shore, and put them into one of their
huts, and were come up to beg some victuals for them, the
whole colony resolved to go all down to the place and see
them; and did so, and Friday's father with them.

When they came into the hut, there they sat, all bound ;
for when they had brought them on shore, they bound
their hands, that they might not take the boat and make
, :heir escape; there, I say, they sat, all of them stark
naked. First, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows,
well shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-
fivc years of age; and five women, whereof two might be
from thirty to forty; two more not above four or five--and--
twenty; and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen
or seventeen. The women were well--favoured, agreeable
persons, both in shape and features, only tawny; and two
of them, had they been perfect white, would have passed '
for very handsome women, even in London itself, having
pleasant, agreeable countenances, and of a very modest be~
haviour; especially when they came afterwards to be
dressed, though that dress was very indifl'erent, it must he
confessed.

The governor, who found that the having women among
them would presently be attended with some incon-
venience, and might occasion some strife, and perhaps
blood, asked the three men what they intended to do with
these women, and how they intended to use them, whether
as servants or as wives ? One of the Englishmen answered
very boldly and readily, that they would use them as
both; to which the governor said, "I am not going to
restrain you from it; you are your own masters as to that ;
but this, I think, is but just, for avoiding disorders and
quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that reason
only, viz. :--That you will all engage, that if any of you
take any of these women as a wife, that he shall take but
one; and that having taken one, none else shall touch her;
for though we cannot marry any one of you, yet it is but
reasonable that, while you stay here, the woman any of
you takes shall be maintained by the man that takes her,
and should be his wife; I mean," says he, "while he con-
tinues here, and that none else shall have anything to do
with her." All this appeared so just, that every one
agreed to it without any difficulty.

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they de- '1'
signed to take any of them P But every one of them
answered " No :" some of them said they had wives in
Spain. and the others did not like women that were not
Christians; to be short, the five Englishmen took them
every one a wife, and so they set up a new form of living:
for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old
habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly within.
The three servants which were taken in the last battle of
the savages lived with them: and these carried on the
main part of the colony, supplied the rest with food, and
assisted them in anything as they could, or as they found
necessity required.

But the wonder of the story was, how five such refrac-
tory, ill-matched fellows should agree about these women,
and that two of them should not choose the same woman,
especially seeing two or three of them were, without com-
parison, more agreeable than the others: but they took a
good way enough to prevent quarrelling among them-
selves ; for they set the five women by themselves in one
of their huts, and they went all into the other hut, and
drew lots among them who should choose first.

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the
but where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out
her he chose: and it was worth observing, that he that
chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and
oldest of the five, which made mirth enough among the
rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it: but the
fellow considered better than any of them, that it was ap~
plication and business they were to expect assistance in, as
much as anything else: and she proved the best wife of all
the parcel.

When the poor women saw themselves set in arow
thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of their con--
dition retiu'ned upon them again, and they firmly believed
they were now going to be devoured. Accordingly,
when the English sailor came in and fetched out one>> of
them, the rest set. up a most lamentable cry, and hung
about her, and took their leave of her with such agonics
and atl'eetion as would have grieved the hardest heart in
the world; nor was it; possible for the Englishmen to
satisfy them that they were not to be immediately mur-
dered till they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who
immediately let- them know that. the five men, who were
to fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for their
wives. -

"'lten they had done, and the fright the women were in
was a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards
came and helped them; and in a few hours they had built
them every one a new but or tent; for their lodging apart;
for those they had already were crowded with their tools,
household stutl', and provisions. The three wicked ones
had pitched larthest otl', and the two honest; ones nearer,
but both on the north shore of the island, so that they eon-
tinucd separated as before: and thus my island \'as
peopled in three dichrcnt; places: and, as I might say,
three towns were begun to be built.

But I now come to a scene diliL-rcnt from all that had
happened before, either to them or to me; and the origin
of the story was this :---Early one morning, there came on
shore five or six canoes of Indians, and there is no room
to doubt they came upon the old errand of fecdinvr upon
their slaves; but. that; part was now so familiar to the
Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not. concern
themsch'es about: it, as I did: but having been made
sensible, by their experience, that their only business was
to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by any of
the savages, they would go 09:" again quietly, when their
husiness vas done, having, as yet, not the least notion of
:h ere being any inhabitants in the island; they had
nothing to do but: give notice to all the three plantations
to keep within doors, and not show themselves, only placing
a scout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats
went to sea again.

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among the
savages that there were inhabitants there; which was, in
the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony. After
the canoes with the savages had gone elf, the Spaniards
peeped abroad again; and some of them had the curiosity
to go to the place where they had been, to see what they
had been doing. Here, to their great; surprise, they
t'ntnid three savages left- behind, and lying fast asleep
upon the ground.

'l'he Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and
perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as
it happened, was with them, and his advice was asked, but
he professed he knew not what: to do. As for slaves, they
had enough already; and as to killing them, there were
none of them inclined to do that. After some consultation,
they resolved upon this; that they w nld lie still a while
longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone.
lint then the governor Spaniard recolleetcd that the three
savages had no boat ; and if they were left to love about
the island, they would certainly discover that there were
inhabitants in it; and so they would be undone that way.
Upon this, they went back again, and there lay the fellows
fast asleep still, and so they resolved to awaken them, and
take them prisoners, and they did so. The poor fellows
Wcl'c strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound; and afraid, like the women, that; they should be
murdered and eaten.

It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them home to their castle ; but they carried them first to
the bower, and afterwards they carried them to the habi-
tation of the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do ; and whether it was by negligence
in guarding them, or that they thought the fellows could
not mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran
away, and, taking to the woods, they could never hear of
him any more.

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon
alter in some other canoes of savages who came on shore
three or four weeks afterwards; and who, carrying on their
revels as usual, went off in two days' time. This thought
terrified them exceedingly: for they concluded, and that
not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow got home
safe among his comrades, he would certainly give them
an account that there were people in the island, and also
how few and weak they were; for this savage, as observed
before, had never been told, and it was very happy he had
not, how many there were, or where they lived; nor had
he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns, much
less had they shown him any of their other retired places; .-
such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat which
the two Englishmen had made, and the like.

About two months after this, six canoes of savages,
with about ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the
north side of the island, where they never used to come
before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a con-
venient place, about a mile from the habitation of the two
Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As
the Spaniard governor said, had they been all there, the
damage would not have been so much, for not a man of
them would have escaped; but the case differed now very
much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. The two
men had the happiness to dissover them about a league off,
so that it was above an hour before they landed; and as
they landed a mile from their huts, it was some time
before they could come at them. Now, having great
reason to believe they were betrayed, the first thing they
did was to bind the two slaves which were lett, and cause
two of the three men whom they brought with the women
to lead them, with their two wives, and whatever they
could carry away with them, to their retired places in the
woods, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot
till they heard farther.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on
shore, and that they had bent their course directly that
way, they opened the fences where the milch-cows were
kept, and drove them all out; leaving their goats to
Straggle in the woods, whit-her they pleased, that the
savages might think they were all bred wild; but the
rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and
he gave them an account of it all, for they went directly
to the place.

When the two poor frightened men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the
three who came with the women, away to the Spaniards
with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy
help, and, in the meantime, they took their arms, and
what ammunition they had, and retreated towards the
place in the wood where their wives were sent; keeping
at a distance, yet so that they might see, if possible, which
way the savages took.

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground
they could see a little army of their enemies come on
directly to their habitation, and, in a moment more, could
see all their huts and household stuff flaming up together,
to their great grief and mortification ; for they had a very
great loss, to them irretrievable, at least for some time.
They kept their station for a while, till they found the
savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the
place, rummaging every way, and every place they could
think of, in search of prey; and in particular for the
people, of whom, now, it plainly appeared they had intel-
ligence.

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because it was likely some of
the wild people might come that way, and they might
come too many together, thought it proper to make
another retreat about half a mile farther; believing, as it
afterwards happened, that the farther they strolled, the
fewer would be together.

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-
grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree
stood, which was hollow and vastly large; and in this tree
they both took their standing, resolving to see there what
might offer. They had not stood there long before two of
the savages appeared running directly that way, as if they
had already had notice where they stood, and were coming
up to attack them; and a little way farther they espied

three more coming after them, and five more beyond them,
18
all coming the same way: besides which, they saw seven
or eight more at a distance, running another way.

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether
they should stand or fly; but, after a very short debate
with themselves, they considered that if the savages ranged
the country thus before help came, they might perhaps
find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would be
lost; so they resolved to stand them there; and if they
were too many to deal with, then they would get up to
the top of the tree, whence they doubted not to defend
themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition
lasted, though all the savages that were landed, which was
near fifty, were to attack them.

Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait for the
three, and so take the middle party, by which the two and
the five that followed would be separated; at length they
resolved to let the first two pass by, unless they ,should
spy them in the tree, and come to attack them. The first
two savages confirmed them also in this regulation, by
turning a little from them towards another part of the
wood; but the three, and the five after them, came for-
ward directly to the tree, as if they had known the
Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so straight
towards them, they resolved to take them in a line as they
came: and as they resolved to fire but one at a time,
perhaps the first shot might hit them all three ; for which
purpose the man who was to fire put three or four small
bullets into his piece; and having a fair loop-hole, as it
were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim,
without being seen, waiting till they were within about
thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on,
they plainly saw that one of the three was the runaway
savage that had escaped from them; and they both knew
him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should
not escape, though they should both fire: so the other
stood ready with his piece, that .if he did not drop at the
first shot, he should be sure to have a second. But the
first was too good a marksman to miss his aim; for as theThe poor ignorant creatures, not sensible of danger. stood. altogether

savages kept near one another, a little behind in a line, he
fired, and hit two of them directly: the foremost was
killed outright, being shot in the head; the second, which
was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and
full, but was not quite dead; and the third had a little
scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that
went through the body of the second; and being dread-
fully frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down .
upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous 1
manner.

The five that were behind, more frightened with the
noise than sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for
the woods made a sound a thousand times bigger than it
really was.

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing
what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came
to the place where their companions layin a condition
miserable enough: and here the poor ignorant creatures,
not sensible that they were within the reach of the same
mischief, stood altogether over the wounded man, tal. ' g,
and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him, how he ' e
to be hurt: and who, it is very rational to believe, told
them that a flash of fire first, and immediately, after that
thunder from their gods, had killed those two and wounded
him. -

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures,
who, at the same time, had no notion of their danger;
yet, having them all thus in their power, and the first
having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both
together among them; and singling out, by agreement,
which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or very
much wounded, four of them; the fifih, frightened even
to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our
men, seeing them all fall together, thought they had killed
them all.

The belief that the savages were all killed, made our
two men come boldly out from the tree before they had
charged their guns, which was a wrong step; and they
were under some surprise when they came to the place,
and found no less than four of them alive, and of them
two very little hurt, and one not at all: this obliged them
to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets; and
first, they made sure of the runaway savage, that had been
the cause of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt
in the knee, and put them out of their pain: then the
man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to
them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous
moans to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but
could not say one word to them that they could under.-
stand. However, they made signs to him to sit down at the
foot of a tree hard by: and one of the Englishmen, with a
piece of rope twined, which he had by great chance in his
pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there they left
him; and with what speed they could, made after the
other two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any
more of them, should find the way to their covered place
in the woods, where their wives, and the few goods they
had left, lay. They came once in sight of the two men,
but it was at a great distance; however, they had the
satisfaction to see them cross over a valley towards the
sea, quite the contrary way to that which led to their
retreat, which they were afraid of; and. being satisfied
with that, they went back to the tree where they left their
prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his
comrades, for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-
yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the foot
of the tree.

They were new in as great concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy
might be, or in what number; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if all was
well there, and to make them easy, who were in fright
enough to be sure; for though the savages were their own
countrymen, yet they were most terribly afraid of them,
and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of
them.

\Vhen they came there, they found the savages had been
in the wood, and very near that place, but had not found
it: for it was, indeed, inaccessible, from the trees standing
so thick, unless the persons seeking it had been directed
by those that knew it, which these did not; they found,
therefore, everything was safe, only the women in a
terrible fright. While they were here, they had the
comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their
assistance; the other ten, with their servants, and old
Friday (I mean Friday's father), were gone in a body to
defend their bower, and the com and cattle that was kept
there, in case the savages should have roved over to that
side of the country; but they did not spread so far.
With the seven Spaniards came one of the three savages;
and with them also came the savage whom the Englishmen
had left bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men,
and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with
them: where, however, they were obliged to bind him
again, as they had the two others who were left when the
third ran away.

The prisoners now began to be a burden to them; and
they were so afraid of their escaping, that they were once
resolving to kill them all, behaving they were under an
absolute necessity to do so for their owu preservation.
However, the Spaniard governor would not consent to it;
but ordered, for the present, that they should be sent out
of the way to my old cave in the valley, and be kept
there, with two Spaniards to guard them and give them
food for their subsistence, which was done; and they were
bound there hand and foot for that night.

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so
encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to stay
any longer there; but taking five of the Spaniards and
themselves, with four muskets and a pistol among them,
and two stout quarter staves, away they went in quest of
the savages. And first they came to the tree where the
men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see that
some more of the savages had been there, for they had
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had dragged
two of them a good way, but had given it over. Thence
they advanced to the first rising ground, where they had
stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where they had

"N
the mortification still to see some of the smoke; but
neither could they here see any of the savages. They then
resolved, though with all possible caution, to go forward
towards their ruined plantation; but a little before they
came thither, coming in sight of the sea--shore, they saw
plainly the savages all embarked again in their canoes, in
order to be gone. They seemed sorry at first that there
was no way to come at them, to give them a parting blow;
but, upon the whole, they were very well satisfied to be
rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being now twice mined, and all
their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come
and help them to rebuild, and aSSist them with needful
supplies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet
noted for having the least inclination to do any good, yet,
as soon as they heard of it, came and offered their help and
assistance, and did very friendly work for some days
to restore their lmbitafions, and make necessaries for
them. And thus, in a little time, they were set upon
their legs again.

About two days after this, they had the further satisfac--
tion of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on
shore, and, at some distance from them, two drowned men:
by which they had reason to believe that they had met
with a storm at sea, which had overset some of them; for
it had blown very hard the night after they went off.

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other
hand, enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well
of what they had done as what had happened to them,
and to whet them on to another enterprise of the same
nature.

It was five or six months after this before they heard any
more of the savages, in which time our men had hopes they
had either forgotten their former bad luck, or given over
hopes of better; when, on a. sudden, they were invaded
with a most formidable fleet of no less than eight-and-
twenty canoes, full of savages, armed with bows and
arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines
of war: and they brought such numbers with them, that,
in short, it put all our people into the utmost conster--
nation. .
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
easternmost side of the island, our men had that night to
consult and consider what to do; and, in the first place,
knowing that their being entirely concealed was their only
safety before, and would be much more so now, while the
number of their enemies would be so great, they there-
fore resolved, first of all, to take down the huts which
were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their
goats to the old cave; because they supposed the savages
would go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play
the old game over again, though they did not now land
within two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove
away all the flocks of goats they had at the old bower, as I
called it, which belonged to the Spaniards: and, in short,
left as little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was
possible: and the next morning early they posted them-
selves, with all their force, at the plantation of the two
men, to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it
happened. These new invaders, leaving their canoes at
the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore,
directly towards the place, to the number of two hundred
and fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our army was
but small, indeed; but that which was worse, they had not

arms for all their number neither. The whole account,'

it seems, stood thus: first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards,
five Englishmen, Friday's father, the three slaves taken
with the women, who proved very faithful, and three
other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards. To arm these
they had eleven muskets, five pistols, eight fowling--pieces,
two swords, and three old halberts.

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee,
but they had each ahalbert, or a long stafi', like a quarter-
stafl', with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of
it, and by his side a hatchet: also every one of our men
had a hatchet. Two of the women could not be prevailed
upon but they would come into the fight, and they had
bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from
the savages when the first action happened, which I have
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another:
and the women had hatchets too.

The Spaniard governor commanded the whole: and
Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful follow for wicked-
ness, was a. most daring fellow, commanded under him.
The savages came forward like lions; and our men, which
was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in their
situation: only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most
useful fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a small
thicket of bushes as an advanced guard, with orders to let
the first of them pass by, and then fire into the middle of
them, and, as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as
nimbly as he conld round a part of the wood, and so come
in behind the Spaniards, where they stood, having a
thicket of trees before them.

"rhea the savages came on, they ran straggling about
every way in heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will
Atkins let about fifty of them pass by him; then seeing
the rest come in a very thick throng, he orders three of his
men to fire, having loaded their muskets with six or seven
bullets a--piece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How
many they killed or wounded they knew not; but the
consternation and surprise was inexpressible among the
savages: they were frightened to the last degree to hear
such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when, in the middle of
their fright, \Vill Atkins and the other three let fly again
among the thickest of them: and in less than a minute
the first three being loaded again, gave them a third
volley.

llad \Vill Atkins and his men retired immediately
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do, or
had the rest of the body been at hand, to have poured in
their shot continually, the savages had been effectually
rented; for the terror that was among them came prin-
cipally from this, that they were killed by the gods with
thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt
them; but Will Atkins staying to load again, discovered
the cheat: some of the savages who were at a distance
spying them, came upon them behind; and though Atkins
and his men fired at them also, two or three times, and
killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet they
wounded Atkins himself, and kllled one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one
Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who came with the
women. This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought
most desperately, killing five of them with his own hand,
having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a
hatchet.

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and
two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the
wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon
them, retreated also; for their number was so great, and
they were so desperate, that though above fifty of them
were killed, and more than as many wounded, yet they
came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and
shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed that
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were
made. outrageous, and fought like madmen.

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the
Englishman that were killed behind them; and the
savages, when they came up to them, killed them over
again in a. most wretched manner, breaking their arms,
legs, and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like
true savages; but finding our men were gone, they did not
seem to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a. ring,
which is, it seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in
token of their victory; after which, they had the mortifica-
tion to see several of their wounded men fall, dying with
the mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up
together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was
wounded, would have them march and charge again all
together at once; but the Spaniard replied, " Seignior
Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight; let them
alone till morning; all the wounded men will be stiff and
sore with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood;
and so we shall have the fewer to engage." This advice
was good: but Will Atkins replied merrily, "That is true,
Seignior, and so shall I, too; and that is the reason I
would go on while I am warm." " Well, Seignior Atkins,"
says the Spaniard, " you have behaved gallantly, and done
your part; we will fight for you if you cannot come on;
but I think it best to stay till morning ;" so they waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded
men, and a great noise and hurry among them where they
lay, they afierwards resolved to fall upon them in the night;
especially if they could come to give them but one volley
before they were discovered, which they had a fair oppor-
tunity to do: for one of the Englishmen in whose quarter it
was where the fight began, led them round between the
woods and the sea-side westward, and then turning short
south, they same so near where the thickest of them lay,
that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in
upon them, and did dreadful execution upon them; in
half a minute more, eight others fired after them, pouring
in their small shot in such a quantity, that abundance were
killed and wounded; and all this while they were not able
to see who hurt them, or which way to fly.

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedi-
tion, and then divided themselves into three bodies, and
resolved to fall in among them all together. They had
in each body eight persons, that is to say, twenty--two men,
and the two women, who, by the way, fought desperately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party, as well
as the halberts and staves. They would have had the
women kept back, but they were resolved to die with their
husbands. Having thus formed their little army, they
marched out from among the trees, and came up to the
teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they
could: the savages stood all together, but were in the
utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting
from three quarters together: they would have fought had
they seen us; for as soon as we came near enough to be
seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was
wounded, though not dangerously; but our men gave
them no time, but, running up to them, fired among them
three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends of their
muskets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and
laid about them so well, that, in a word, they set up a
dismal srceaming and howling, flying to save their lives
which way soever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or
mortally wounded in the two fights about one hundred
and eighty of them; the rest, being frightened out of their
wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills, with
all the speed fear and nimble feet could help them to;
and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them,
they got all together to the sea-side where they landed,
and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at
an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that
evening from the sea, so that it was impossible for them to
go ofi'; nay, the storm continuing all night, when the tide
came up, their canoes were most of them driven by the
surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it required
infinite toil to get them off; and some of them were even
(lashed to pieces against the beach, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little
rest that night; but having refreshed themselves as well
as they could, they resolved to march to that part of the
island where the savages were fled, and see what posture
they were in. This necessarily led them over the place
where the fight had been, and where they found several of
the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering

e.

At length, they came in view of the place where the
more miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where
there appeared about a hundred still: their posture was
generally sitting upon the ground, with their knees up
towards their mouth, and the head put between the two
hands, leaning down upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shots of them,
the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired,
without ball, to alarm them: this he did, that by their
countenance he might know what to expect, whether they
were still in heart to fight, or'were so heartily beaten as
to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might manage
accordingly. This stratagem took; for, as soon as the
savages heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the
second, they started up upon their feet in the greatest
consternation imaginable; and as our men advanced
swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and yelling
away, with a kind of howling noise, which our men did
not understand, and had never heard before; and thus
they ran up the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had been
calm, and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not
then consider that this might probably have been the
occasion of their coming again in such multitudes as not to
be resisted, or, at least, to come so many and so often, as
would quite desolate the island, and starve them. Will
Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept
always with them, proved the best counsellor in this case:
his advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and
step in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of
the capacity of ever returning any more to plague the island.

They consulted long about this; and some were against
it, for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and
live there desperate, and so they should have them to hunt
like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business,
and have their plantations continually rifled, all their
tame goats destroyed, and, in short, he reduced to a life of
continual distress.

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with
a hundred men than with a hundred nations: that as they
must destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or
- be all of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he
: showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all
: came into it; so they went to work immediately with the
. boats, and, getting some dry wood together from an old
3 tree, they tried to set some of them on fire, but they were
so wet that they would not burn; however, the fire so
burned the upper part, that it soon made them unfit for
swimming in the sea as boats. "firm the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running out of
the woods, and coming as near as they could to our men,
kneeled down and cried, " 0a, 0a, Waramaka," and some
other words of their language, which none of the others
understood anything of; but as they made pitiful gestures
and strange noises, it was easy to understand they begged
to have their boats spared, and that they would be gone,
and never come there again. But our men were now
satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, or :
to save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of
these people from ever going home again: depending
upon this, that if even so much as one of them got back
into their country to tell the story, the colony was undone;
so that, letting them know that they should not have any
mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed
every one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the
sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the
woods, which our people heard plain enough, after which
they ran about the island like distracted men; so that, in
a word, our men did not really know, at first, what to do
with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with all their pru-
dence, consider that, while they made those people thus
desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at the
same time upon their plantations; for though, it is true,
they had driven away the cattle, and the Indians did not
find out their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the
hill, nor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all
the fences and planting about it; trod all the corn under
foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just then almost
ripe, and did our men an inestimable damage, though to
themselves not one farthing's worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them on all occa-
sions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or
hunt them up and down: for, as they were too nimble of
foot for our men when they found them single, they durst
not go abroad single, for fear of being surrounded with
their numbers. The best was, they had no weapons ; for
though they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any
materials to make any; nor had they any edge-tool or
weapon among them.

It was some while before any of them could be taken;
but, being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last
surprised and made a prisoner. He was sullen at first, and
would neither eat nor drink; but finding himself kindly
used, and victuals given to him, and no violence offered
him, he at last drew tractable and came to himself. They
brought old Friday to him, who talked ofien with him, and
told him how kind the others would be to them all; that
they would not only save their lives, but give them part
of the island to live in, provided they would give satis-
faction that they would keep in their own bounds, and not
come beyond it to injure or prejudice others; and that
they should have corn given them to plant and make it
grow for their bread, and some bread given them for their
present subsistence: and old Friday bade the fellow go
and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they
said to it; assuring them that, if they did not agree imme-
diately, they should be all destroyed.

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reducedin
number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at
the first offer, and begged to have some food given them;
upon which, twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well
armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday, marched
to the place where they were. The three Indian slaves
carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up
to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats; and
they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they
sat down, ate their provisions very thankfully, and were
the most faithful fellows to their words that could be
thought of ; for, except when they came to beg victuals
and directions, they never came out of their bounds; and
there they lived when I came to the- island, and I went to
see them.

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread,
breed tame goats, and milk them: they wanted nothing
but wives, and would soon have been a nation. They were
confined to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks
behind them, and lying plain towards the sea before them,
on the south-east corner of the island. They had land
enough, and it was very good and fruitful; about a mile
and a half broad, and three or four miles in length. '

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as
I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchetsQwv. '\\\\\\

I; ;__.._______________

"The ship's cook and his mate came on shore to dress our dinner."After the feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought my
03:30 9! goods."cargo pf goods."
to make eve1y one a light coat, like afroclc, which I judged
fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose; and or-
den-d 1h: 1t, whenever they decayed, they should make more.
as they thought fit; the like for pumps, shoes, stockings,
hats, &c.

I cannot express what pleasure and satisfaction sat upon
txel countenances of all these poor men, when they saw the
4:. we I 11: 1d taken of them, and 110w well I had tarnished
:hem. They told me I was a father to them ; and that
having such a correspondent as I was in so remote a. part
of the World, it would make them forget that they were left
in a desolate place; and they all voluntarily engaged to
1110. not. to leave the place without my consent.

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with
1110, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpen-
ters, all of them most necessary people; but, above all, my
general artificcr, than whom they could not name anything
that was more useful; and the tailor, to show his concern
for them, went to work immediately, and, with my leave,
made them every one a shirt, the first thing he did; and,
what was still more, he taught the women not only 110w to
sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them assist to
make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful
they were; for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy
things, and made clever, convenient tables, stools, bed-
steads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and everything they
wanted of that kind. But to let them see how nature made
artiliccrs at first, I carried the carpenters to see lVill
Atkins's basket-house, as I called it; and they both owned
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before,
nor any thing so regular and so handily built, at least of
its kind; and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a
food while, turning about to me, "I am sure," says he,
" that man has no Dneed of us; you need do nothing but
give him tools."

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave
every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we
had no barrows or plough; and to every separate place a
pickaxc, a crow, a broad axe, and a saw: always appoint-
ing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out, they
should be supplied, without grudging, out of the general
stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers,
Chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of iron-work, they had
without reserve, as they required; for no man would take
more than he wanted, and he must he a fool that would
waste or spoil them on any account whatever; and for the
use of the smith, I left two tons of unwrought iron for a
supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice
at them ; for now they could march as I used to do, with a
musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and
were able to fight a thousand savages,~if they had but some
little advantages of situation, which also they could not
miss, it they had occasion.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother
was starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober,
well educated, religious young woman, and behaved so in-
ofl'ensively that every one gave her a good word; she had,
indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in
the ship but herSelf, but she bore it with patience. After
a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine away
of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had
neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to
me, and desired I would give them leave to remain on the
island, and be entered among my family, as they called it.
I agreed to this readily ; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
houses set up, surrounded with a basket--work, pallisadoed
like Atkins's, adjoining to his plantation. Their tents were
cont-rived so that they had each of them a room apart to
lodge in, and a middle tent like a great storehouse, to lay
their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And now the other
two Englishmen removed their habitation to the same place;
and so the island was divided into three colonies, and no
more, viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday and the first
servants, at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in

a word, the capital city, and where they had so enlarged
19
and extended their works, as well under as on the outside
of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet
full at large. Never was there such a little city in a wood,
and so hid, in any part of the world; for I verily believe
that a thousand men might have ranged the island a month,
and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and.
looked on purpose for it, they would not have found it; for
the trees stood so thick and so close, and grew so fast
woven one into another, that nothing but cutting them
down first could discover the place, except the only two
narrow entrances where they went in and out could be
found, which was not very easy; one of them was close
down at the water's edge, on the side of the creek, and it
was afterwards above two hundred yards to the place; and
the other was up a ladder at twice, as I have already de-
scribed it; and they had also a large wood, thickly planted,
on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, which grew
apacc, and concealed the place from all discovery there,
with only one narrow place between two trees, not easily
to be discovered, to enter on that side. .

The only colony was that of Will Atkins, where there
were four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left
there, with their wives and children : three savages that
were slaves ; the widow and the children of the Englishman
that was killed; the young man and the maid; and, by the
way, we made a wife of her before we went away. There
were also the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought
with me for them; also the smith, who was a very necessary
man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take care of their
arms; and my other man, whom I called J ack--of-all-trades,
who were in himself as good almost as twenty men; for he
was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry
fellow; and before I went away we married him to the
honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I men~
tioned before.

Having thus brought the afl'airs of the island to anarrow
compass, Iwas preparing to go on board the ship, when
the young man I had taken out of the famished ship's
company came to me, and told me he understood I had a
clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen
to be married to the savages; that he had a match, too,
which he desired might be finished before I went, between
two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable
to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother's servant, for there was no other Christian woman
on the island: so I began to persuade him not to do any-
thing of that kind rasbly, or because he found himself in
this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he
had some considerable substance in the world, and good
friends, as I understood by himself, and the maid also :
that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was
unequal to him, she being six or seven and twenty years
old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen; that he
might very probably, with my assistance, make a remove
from this wilderness, and come into his own country again;
and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to say
more, but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a
great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses--that
he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts; and he was
very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a
way to see their own country again; and nothing should
have made him think of staying there, but that the voyage
I was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends;
that he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle
him in some little property in the island where he was, give
him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he
would live here like a planter, waiting the good time when,
if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him; and
hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came to
2 England: that he would give me some letters to his friends
' in London, to let them know how good I had been to him,
and in what part of the world, and what circumstances I.
had left him in; and he promised me that, whenever I
redeemed him, the plantation, and all the improvements he
had made upon it, let the value be what it would, should
be wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering

his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, because he
told me positively the match was not for himself. I gave
him all possible assurances that if I lived to come safe to
England, I would deliver his letters, and 'do his business
effectually; and that he might depend I should never
forget the circumstances I had left him in; but still I was
impatient to know who was the person to be married:
upon which he told me it was my Jacli-of-all-trades and his
maid Susan. I was most agreeably surprised when he
named the match; for, indeed, I thought it very suitable.
The character of that man, I have given already; and as
for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and
religious young woman; had a very good share of sense,
was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very hand-
somely and to the purpose, always with decency and good
manners, and was neither too backward to speak when
requisite, nor impertinently forward when it was not her
business; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent
manager; fit, indeed, to have been governess to the whole
island; and she knew very well how to behave in every
respect.

The match being proposed in this manner, we married
them the same day 3 and as I was father at the altar, and
gave her away, so I gave her a portion; for I appointed
her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for
their plantation; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal
the young gentleman made to give him a. small property in
the island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst them,
that they might not quarrel afterwards about their situa-
tion.

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins,
who was now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, per-
fectly reformed, exceedingly pious and religious; and, as
far as I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case,
I verily believe he was a true penitent. He divided things
so justly, and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they
only desired one general writing under my hand for the
whole, which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and
sealed, setting out the bounds and situation of every man's
plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby severally
a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the
respective plantations or farms, with their improvements,
to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island
as my Own property, and a certain rent for every particular
plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or
in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing.

As to the government and laws among them, I told them
I was not capable of giving them better rules than they
were able to give themselves; only I made them promise
me to live in love and good neighbourhood with one
another; and so I prepared to leave them.

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good
circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on
board my ship again on the 6th of May, having been about
twenty-five days among them. .

The next day, giving them a. salute of five guns at part-
ing, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the
Brazils, in about twenty-two days, meeting nothing re-
markable in our passage but this: that about three days
after we had sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting
strong to the E.N.E., into a bay or gulf on the land
side, we were driven something out of our course, and
once or twice our men cried out, "Land to the eastward!"
but whether it was the continent or islands we could not
tell by any means. But the third day, towards evening,
the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea
covered, towards the land, with something very black;
not being able to discover what it was, till, after some time,
our chief mate going up to the main-shrouds a little way,
and looking at them with a perspective, cried out it was an
army. I could not imagine what he meant by an army,
and thwarted him a little hastily. "Nay, sir," says he,
" don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet, too; for
I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see
them paddle along, for they are coming towards us space."

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
nephew, the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories
of them in the island, and having never been in those seas
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said,
two or three times, we shall all be devoured. I must con-
fess, considering we were becalmed, and the current set
strong towards the shore, I liked it the worse: however, I
bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor
as soon as we came so near as to know that we must engage
them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace
towards us; so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and
furl all our sails ; as for the savages, I told them they had
nothing to fear but fire, and therefore they should get their
beats out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and the
other by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the
issue in that posture: this I did, that the men in the boats
might be ready with sheets and buckets to put out any
fire these savages might endeavour to fix to the outside of
the ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians: though my mate was much mistaken
in his calculation of their number, yet when they came up
we reckoned about a hundred and twenty-six; some of
them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more,
and the least six or seven.

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which doubt-
less they had never seen before; nor could they at first, as
we afterwards understood, know what to make of us; they
came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed to go
about to row round us: but we called to our men in the
boats not to let them come too near them. This very
order brought us to an engagement with them, without our
designing it; for five or six of the large canoes came so
near .our long-boat, that our men beckoned with their
hands to keep them back, which they understood very well,
and went back; but at their retreat about fifty arrows
came on board us from those boats,'and one of our men in
the long-boat was very much wounded. However, I called
to them not to fire by any means; but we handed down
some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter presentlyi),-

_ -Wnn.\...//.\

" The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows, and about
three more fell near him."._r.,, "Y

aosmsou onuson. 295

set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, to cover them
from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again.

About half an hour afterwards they all came up in a body
astern of us, and so near that we could easily discern what
they were, though we could not tell their design; and I
found they were some of my old friends, the same sort of
savages that I had been used to engage with; and in a short
time more they rowed a little farther out to Sea, till they
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down
straight upon us, till they came so near that they could
hear us speak: upon this I ordered all my men to keep
close, lest they should shoot any more arrows, and make
all our guns ready; but being so near as to be within
hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and call aloud
to them in his language, to know what they meant; which
accordingly he did. Whether they understood him I knew
not; but as soon as he had called to them, six, who were
in the foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes
from us, and stooping down, showed us their naked backs.
Whether this was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or
whether it was done in mere contempt, or as a signal to
the rest; but immediately Friday cried out they were going
to shoot, and unhappily for him, poor fellow, they let fly
about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inex-
pressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in
their sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than
three arrows, and about three more fell very near him;
such unlucky marksmen they were!

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and
companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be _
loaded with small shot, and four with great, and gave them
such a broadside as they never heard in their lives before.
They were not above half a cable's length off when we
fired; and our gunners took their aim so well, that three
or four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to
believe, by one shot only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare backs tons gave
us no great offence; neither did I know for certain whether
that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us
might be understood so by them or not; therefore, in re-
turn, I had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at
them with powder only, which I knew would frighten
them sufficiently: but when they shot at us directly with
all the fury they were capable of, and especially as they
had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and
valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought
myself not only justifiable before God and man, but would
have been very glad if I could have overset every canoe
there, and drowned every one of them.

I cannot tell how many we killed, nor how many we
wounded at this broadside, but sure such a fright and
hurry never were seen among such a multitude. There
were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and oversct
in all, and the men set a-swimming: the rest, frightened
out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could,
taking but little care to save those whose boats were split
or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them
were lost ; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming
for his life, above an hour after they were gone.

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many; but, in short, we never knew how
it went with them, for they fled so fast that, in three hours
or thereabouts, we could not see above three or four
straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more;
for a breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we
weighed, and set sail for the Brazils.

We went away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in about
twelve days' time we made land, in the latitude of five
degrees south of the line, being the north-easteranst
land of all that part of America. We kept on S. by E.,. in
sight of the shore four days, when we made Cape St.
Augustine, and came to an anchor off the Bay of All
Saints, the old place of my deliverance, whence came both
my good and evil fate.

Never came ship to this port that had less business than
I had, and yet it was with great difficulty that we were
admitted to hold the least correspondence on shore: not
my partner himself, who was alive, and made a great figure
among them, not my own merchant-trustees, not the fame
of my wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain
me that favour; but my partner, remembering that I had
given five hundred moidores to the Prior of the Monastery
of the Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to
the poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the prior that
then was to go to the governor, and get leave for me per-
sonally, with the captain and one more, besides eight sea-
men, to come on shore, and no more; and this upon condi-
tion that we should not offer to land any goods out of the
ship, or to carry any person away without license. They
were so strict with us as to landing any goods, that it was
with extreme difliculty that I got on shore three bales,
such as fine broadcloths, studs, and some linen, which I
had brought as a present to my partner.

He was a very generous, open-hearted man; though,
like me, he began with little at first; and though he knew
not that I had the least design of giving him anything, he
sent me on board a. present of fresh provisions, wine, and
sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores, including some
tobacco, and three or four fine medals of gold: but I was
even with him in my present, which, as I have said, con-
sisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine
Hollands ; also, I delivered him about the value of one
hundred pounds sterling, in the same goods, for other uses;
and I obliged him to set up the sloop, which I had brought
with me from England, for the use of my colony, in order
to send the refreshments I intended to my plantation.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a.
very few days, for she was already framed: and I gave the
master of her such instructions that he could not miss the
place; nor did he, as I had an account from my partner
afterwards. I got him soon loaded with the small cargo
I sent them; and one of our seamen, that had been on
shore with me there, ofl'ered to go with the sloop and
settle there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard, to
allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation, and
giving him some clothes and tools for his planting work, .
which he said he understood, having been an old planter at
Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain. I encouraged
the fellow by granting all he desired; and, as an addition, I
gave him the savage whom we had taken prisoner of war,298 normson 03175019.

to be his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give
him his share of everything he wanted with the rest.

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told
me there was a certain honest fellow, 8. Brazil planter of
his acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of the
Church. "I know not what the matter is with him,"
says he, "but, on my conscience, I think he is a heretic
in his heart, and he has been obliged to conceal himself
for fear of the Inquisition ;" that he would be very glad of
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and
two daughters; and if I would let them go to my island,
and allot them a plantation, he would give them a small
stock to begin with--for the officers of the Inquisition had
seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing left but
a little household stuff, and two slaves; "and," adds be,
"though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him
fall into their hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive
if he does."

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with
them; and we concealed the man, and his wife and
daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go
to sea; and then, having put all their goods on heard some
time before, we put them on board after she was out of the
ba .

36m seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner;
and their stocks, indeed, were much alike, rich in tools, in
preparations, and a farm--but nothing to begin with, ex-
cept as above: however, they carried over with them, what
was worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugar-
canes, with some plants of canes, which he understood very
well.

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the
island, I sent them by the sloop three mileh cows and five
calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows big
with pig, two mares, and a stone-horse. For my Spaniards,
according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal women
to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and
use them kindly. I could have procured more women, but
I remembered that the poor prosecuted man had two
daughters, and that there were but five of the Spaniards
that wanted--the rest had wives of their own, though in
another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily sup-
pose, was very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were
now, with this addition, between sixty and seventy people,
besides little children, of which there were a. great many.
I found letters at London from them all, by way of Lisbon,
when I came back to England, of which I shall also take
some notice immediately.

I have now done with the island, and all manner of
discourse about it: and whoever reads the rest of my me--
morandums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely
from it, and expect to read of the follies of an old man,
not warned by his own harms, much less by those of other
men, to beware; not cooled by almost forty years' miseries
and disappointments--not satisfied with prosperity beyond
expectation--nor made cautious by afflictions and distress
beyond imitation.

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a
man at full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate,
and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there,
and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from England,
and gone directly to the island; had I loaded her, as I did.
the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation,
and for my people; taken a patent from the government
here to have secured my property, - in subjection only to
that of England; had I carried over cannon and ammuni-
tion, servants and people to plant, and taken possession of
the place, fortified and strengthened it in the name of
England, and increased it with people, as I might easily
have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the
ship back laden with good rice, as I might also have done
in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have fitted
her out again for our supply--had I done this, and stayed
there myself; I had at least acted like a. man of common
sense; but I was possessed of a wandering spirit, and
scorned all advantages: I pleased myself with being the
patron of the people I placed there, and doing for them in
a kind of haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal
monarch, providing for them as if I had been father of the
whole family, as well as of the plantation: but I never so
much as pretended to plant in the name of any government
or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call my
people subjects to any one nation more than another: nay,
I never so much as gave the place a name, but left it as I
found it, belonging to nobody, and the people under no
discipline or government but my own; who, though
I had influence over them as a father and benefactor, had
no authority or power to act or command one way or
other, farther than voluntary consent moved them to
comply: yet even this, had I stayed there, would have
done well enough; letters I had from any of them were
by my partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop
to the place, and who sent me word, though I had not the
letter till I got to London, several years after it was
written, that they went on but poorly, were discontented
with their long stay there: that \Vill Atkins was dead--
that five of the Spaniards were come away--and though
they had not been much molested by the savages, yet they
had had some skirmishes with them ; and that they begged
of him to write to me to think of the promise I had made
to fetch them away, that they might see their country
again before they died.

But I was gone awild-goose chase, indeed! and they
that will have any more of me, must be content to follow
me into a new variety of follies, hardships, and wild
adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may be duly
observed; and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge
us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes
be our affliction, and punish us most severely with those
very things which we think it would be our utmost happi-
ness to be allowed in. Whether I had business or no
business, away I went: it is no time now to enlarge upon
the reason or absurdity of my own conduct, but to come
to the history--I was embarked for the voyage, and the
voyage I went.

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a super-
cargo on board, who has to direct all her motions after she
arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a certain number

of days for stay, by charter>>party, at the several ports she
was to go to.
We stayed at the Cape no longer than was needful to
take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the
coast of Coromandel. We were, indeed, informed that a
French man-of--war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant
ships, were gone for the Indies; and as I knew we were at
war with France, I had some apprehensions of them; but
tLiey went their own way, and we heard no more of
t em.

We touched first at the Island of Madagascar, where,
though the people are fierce and treacherous, and very
well armed with lances and bows, which they use with
inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them
a while; they treated us very civilly; and for some trifies
which we gave them, such as knives, scissors, <<Sm, they
brought us eleven good fat bullocks, of a middling size,
which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had
furnished ourselves with provisions : and I, who was always
too curious to look into every nook of the world wherever
I came, went on shore as often as I could. It was on the
east side of the island that we went on shore one evening:
and the people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at a distance: but as
we had traded freely with them, and had been kindly used,
we thought ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the
people, we out three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them
up at a distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in
that country, not only of a truce and friendship, but when
it is accepted, the other set side up three poles or boughs,
which is asignal that they accept the truce too; but when
this tree is a known condition of the truce, that you are
not to pass beyond their three poles towards them, nor
they to come past your three poles, or boughs, towards you;
so that you are perfectly secure within the three poles, and
all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed, like
a market, for free converse, traffic, and commerce. When
you go there, you must not carry your weapons with you;
and if they come into that space, they stick up their jav'elins
and lances all at the first poles, and come on unarmed;
but if any violence is offered them, and the truce thereby
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their
weapons, and the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that
agreater number of their people came down than usual,
but all very friendly and civil; and they brought several
kinds of provisions, for which we satisfied them with such
toys as we had; the women also brought us milk and
roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and all
was quiet; and we made us a little tent or but of some
boughs or trees, and lay on shore all night.

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat riding at
an anchor at about a stone's cast from the land, with two
men in her to take care of her, I made one of them come
on shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us
also in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the
boat, and lay under the cover of the branches of the trees
in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of our
men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for
God's sake, to bring the boat, and come and help them,
for they were all like to be murdered ; at the same time,
I heard the fire of five muskets, which was the number of
guns they had, and that three times over. All this while
I knew not what was the matter, but rousing immedately
from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust
in, and resolved, with three fusees we had on board, to
land and assist our men.

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in
too much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged
into the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition
they could, being pursued by between three and four hun--
dred men. Our men were but nine in all, and only five of
them had fusees with them; the rest had pistols and swords,
indeed, but they were of small use to them.

We took up seven of our men, and with diflieulty enough
too, three of them being wounded; and that which was
still worse was, that while we stood in the boat to take our
men in, we were in as much danger as _ they were in on
shore; for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick
that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat up
with the benches, and two or three loose boards, which,
to our great satisfaction, we had by mere accident in the
boat. And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but the
least part of any of us, they would have been sure of us.
We had, by the light of the moon, a little sight of them,
as they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and
arrows; and having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them
a volley, that we could hear, by the cries of some of them,
had wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle
array on the shore till break of day, which we supposed
was that they might see the better to take their aim at us.'

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs
stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we
were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. We made
signals of distress to the ship, and though she rode a league
of, yet my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and
by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and that we
fired towards the shore, pretty well understood us; and
weighing anchor with allspeed, he stood as near the shore
as he durst with the ship, and then sent another boat,
with ten hands in her, to assist us ; but we called to them
not to come too near, telling them what condition we were
in; however, they stood in near to us, and one of the men,
taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping one
boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not
perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the
line to the boat: upon which we slipped out a little cable,
and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out of reach
of the arrows: we all the while lying close behind the
barricade we had made. '

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the
shore, that we could lay her side to the shore, she ran
along just by them, and poured in a broadside among
them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets,
and such stuff; besides the great shot, which made a
terrible havoc among them.

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray; and,
indeed, our supercargo, who had been often in those
parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure the inhabi-
tants would not have touched us after we had made a
truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to
it. At length, it came out that an old woman, who had
come to sell us some milk, had brought it within our
poles, and a young woman with her, who also brought
some roots or herbs; andwhile the old woman was selling
us themilk, one of our men ofl'ered some rudeness to the
wench that was with her, at which the old woman made
a great noise: however, the seaman would not quit his
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight,
among the trees, it being almost dark: the old woman
went away without her, and as we may suppose, made an
outcry among the people she came from; who, upon
notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four
hours, and it was great odds we had not all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him
just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of
the tent they had made; the rest came off free, all but
the fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief, who
paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we could not
hear what became of him for a great while. We lay upon
the shore two days after, though the wind presented, and
made signals for him, and made our boat sail up shore and
down shore several leagues, but in vain, so we were
obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered
for it, the loss had been less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing
on shore once more, to try if I could learn anything of
him or them: it was the third night after the action that
I had a great mind to learn what mischief we had done,
and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked
again; but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the
men I went with had been under my command, before I
engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as I was
brought into by it, Without design.

We took twenty as stout fellow: with us as any in the
ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and we landed
two hours before midnight, at the same place where the
Indians stood drawn up in the evening before. I landed-
here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to see
if they had quitted the field, and if they had left any
marks behind them of the mischief we had done them : and
I thought if we could surprise one or two of them,
perhaps we might get our man again, by way of exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men into
two bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I
the other. We neither saw nor heard anybody stir when
we landed; and we marched up, one body at a distance
from the other, to the place ; but at first could see nothing,
it being very dark; till by--and-by our boatswain, who led
the first party, fell over a dead body. This made them
halt a while, for knowing by the circumstances that they
were at the place where the Indians had stood, they
waited for my coming up there. We concluded to halt
till the moon began to rise, which we knew would be in
less than an hour, when we could easily discern the havoc
we had made among them. We told thirty-two bodies
upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead; some
had an arm, and some a leg shot off, and one hishead;
those that were wounded, we supposed, they had carried
away.

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of
all we could come to the knowledge of, I resolved on
going on board; but the boatswain and his party sent me
word that they were resolved to make a visit to the
Indian town where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt,
and asked me to go along with them; and if they could
find them, as they still fancied they should, they did not
doubt of getting a good booty; and it might be they
might find Tom J efi'ry there: that was the man's name we
had lost.

I positively refused, and rose up in order to go to the
boat. One or two of the men began to importune me to
go; and when I refused, began to grumble, and say they
were not under my command, and they would go--in a

word, they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay,
20
and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and I, with
the third man, went back to the boat, where we told them
we would stay for them, and take care to take in as many
of them as should be left; for I told them it was a mad
thing they were going about, and supposed most of them
would have the fate of Tom J effi'y.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they
would come again, and they would take care, &c.; so
away they went, and though the attempt was desperate,
and such as none but madmen would have gone about,
yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily
as boldly: they were gallantly armed, for they had every
man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of
them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and
the boatswain and two more had polcaxes: besides all
which, they had among them thirteen hand grenades:
bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any
wicked work in the world.

When they went out their chief design was plunder,
and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but
a circumstance which none of them were aware of set
them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them all.
When they came to the few Indian houses which they
thought had been the town, which was not above half a
mile off, they were under a great disappointment, for there
were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and where the
town was, or how big, they knew not. They consulted,
therefore, what to do, and were some time before they
could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut
all their throats, and it was ten to one but some of them
might escape, it being in the night, though the moon was
up; and if one escaped, he would run and raise all the
town, so they should have a whole army upon them;
again, on the other hand, if they went away and left these
untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not
tell which way to look for the 'town: however, the last
was the best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and
look for the town as well as they could. They went on
for some time, when three of them, who were a little
before the rest, called aloud that they had found Tom"They found the poor fellow hanging, and his throat out."
Jeffry; they all ran up to the place, where they found the
poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat
cut. There was an Indian house just by the tree, where
they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians,
who had been concerned in the fra with us before, and
two or three of them wounded With our shot; and our
men found they were awake, and talking to one another
in that house, but knew not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged
them, that they swore to one another they would be
revenged, and that not an Indian that came into their
hands should have any quarter. This barbarous resolution
they carried into effect immediately, putting all the poor
creatures to death that fell in their way, and setting fire to
every hut in the village. Our men returned early the
next morning without receiving any injury except that
one had sprained his foot, and another had burned one of
his hands.

The next day we set sail for the Gulf of Persia, and
thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat;
but the chief of the supereargo's design lay at the Bay of
Bengal.

The first disaster that befel us_ was in the Gulf of
Persia, where five of our men, venturing on shore on the
Arabian side of the Gulf, were surrounded, and either
killed or carried away into slavery; the rest of the boat's
crew were-not able to rescue them, and had but just time
to get of? their boat.

We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being
willing to see the place, I went on shore with the super-
cargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and towards
evening was preparing to go on board, when one of the
men came to me, and told me he would not have me
trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they had

' orders not to carry me on board any more. Any one my
guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a message;
and I asked the man, who bade him deliver that message
to me ? He told me the coxswain. I said no more to the
fellow, but bade him let them know he had delivered his
message, and that I had given him no answer to it.
I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and
told him the story, adding, what I presently foresaw, that
there would be a mutiny in the ship; and entreated him
to go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat,
and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared
this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore,
the matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the
gunner, the carpenter, and all the inferior officers, as soon
as I was gone off in the boat, came up, and desired to
speak with the captain; and there the boatswain, making
a long harangue, told the captain, in a few words, that as
I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were 10th to use
any violence with me, which, if I had not gone on shore,
they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have
gone. They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they
shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his command,
they would perform it well and faithfully; but if I would
not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they
would all leave, and sail no farther with him; and at that
word all, he turned his face towards the mainmast, which
was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them, at which
the seamen, being got together there, cried out, " One and
all I one and all!"

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of
great presence of mind; and though he was surprised at
the thing, yet he told them calmly that he would consider
of the matter; but that he could do nothing in it till he
had spoken to me. He used some arguments with them,
to show the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing
but it was all in vain, they swore, and shook hands round
before his face, that they would all go on shore, unless he
would engage not to suffer me to come any more on board
the ship.

This was hard upon him, who knew his obligation to
me, and did not know how I might take it; so he began
to talk smartly to them; told them that I was a very con-
siderable owner of the ship, and that, in justice, he could
not put me out of my own house; that let them go into
what ship they would, if ever they came to England again,
it would cost ythem very dear; that the ship was mine,... _.__,".

and that he could not put me out of it; and that he would
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than disoblige
me so much ; so they might do as they pleased. How--
ever, he would go on shore and talk with me, and invited
the boatswain to go with me, and perhaps they might
accommodate the matter with me. But they all rejected
the proposal, and said they would have nothing to do
with me any more; and if I came on board, they would
all go on shore. "Well," said the captain, "if you are
all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with him."
So away he came to me with this account, a little after
the message had been brought to me from the coxswain.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for
I was not without apprehension that they would confine
him by violence, set sail, and run away with the ship;
and then I had been stripped naked in a remote country,
having nothing to help myself. But they had not come
to that length, it seems; and when my nephew told me
what th'ey had said to him, and how they had sworn and
shook hands that they would, one and all, leave the ship,
if I was suffered to come on board, I told him he should
not be concerned in it at all, for I would stay on shore.
I only desired he would take care and send me all my
necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum
of money, and I would find my way to England as well as
I could.

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but
there was no way to help it; so, in short, he went on
board the ship again, and satisfied the men that his uncle
had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his
goods from on board the ship; so that the matter was
over in a few hours, the men returned to their-duty, and
I began to consider what course I should steer.

I was now alone in the most remote part of the world,
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thousand
leagues by sea farther off .from England than I was at my
island; only, it is true, I might travel here by land over
the Great .Mogul's country to' Surat, might go thence
to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and take the
way of the caravans, over the Desert of Arabia, to Aleppo

,-.. ..
and Scanderoon; thence by sea again to Italy, and so
overland into France; and this put together might at
least be a full diameter of the globe or more.

I had another way before me, which was to wait for
some English ships, which were coming to Bengal from
Achin, on the Island of Sumatra, and get passage on
heard them for England. But as I came hither without
any concern with the East India Company, so it would be
dillieult to go hence without their license, unless with
great favour of the captains of the ships, or the Company's
factors; and to both I was an utter stranger.

Here I had the mortification to see the ship sail with-
out me; however, my nephew left me two servants, or
rather, one companion and one servant; the first was
clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to go with me,
and the other was his own servant. I took also a good
lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where several
merchants lodged. Here I was handsomely enough enter-
tained; and that I might not be said to run rashly upon
anything, I stayed here about nine months, considering
what course to take. I had some English goods with me
of value, and a considerable sum of money; my nephew
furnished me with a thousand pieces~of-eight, and a letter
of credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be
straitened, whatever might happen.

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage; and, as
I originally intended, I bought here some very good
diamonds, which, of all other things, were the most proper
for me in my present circumstances, because I could
always carry my whole estate about me.

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for
my return to England, the English merchant who lodged
with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaint-
ance with, came to me one morning: "Countryman,"
says he, " I have a project to communicate to you, which,
as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit
with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered
it. Here we are posted, you by accident, and I by choice,
in a part of the world very remote from our own country;
but it is in a country where, by us, who understand trade
and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you
will put one thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds,
we will hire a ship, the first we can get to our minds; you
shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we'll go a trading
voyage to China ; for what should we stand still for '2"

I liked the proposal very well; and the more so, because
it seemed to be expressed with so much good will, and in
so friendly a. manner.

It was, however, some time before we could get a ship
to our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not
easy to get English sailors: that is to say, as many as
were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the
sailors which we should pick up there. After some time
we got an English mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, a
Dutch carpenter, and three fore-mast men. With these
we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen,
such as they were, to make up. _

We made the voyage to Achin, ' in the island of
Sumatra, and thence to Siam, where we exchanged some
of our wares for opium and arrack; we went up to Snskan,
made a very good voyage, were eight months out, and
returned to Bengal; and I was very well satisfied with
my adventure. '

I got so much money by my first adventure, and such
an insight into the method of getting more, that had I
been twenty years younger, I should have been tempted
to have stayed here and sought no farther for making my
fortune.

My friend, who was always upon the search for business,
proposed another voyage to me among the Spice Islands,
and to bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas,
or thereabouts: places, indeed, where the Dutch trade,
but islands belonging partly to the Spaniards; though we
went not so far, but to some other, where they have not
the whole power, as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. _

We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the
chief difliculty was in bringing me to come into it.
However, at last, nothing else offering, and finding that
really stirring about and trading, the profit being so
great, had more pleasure in it, and more satisfaction to
my mind, than sitting still, which, to me especially, was
the unhappiest part of my life, I resolved on this voyage
too, which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo,
and sewral islands, and came home in about five months.
W'c sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves and nutmegs,
to the Persian merchants, who carried them away to the
Gulf; and making near five of one, we really got a good
deal of money.

But, to be short with my speculations, alittle while
after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia. She
was a coaster, not a European trader, of about two
hundred tons burthen. The men, as they pretended,
having been so sickly that the captain had not hands
enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal; and
having, it seems, got money enough, or being willing, for
other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice he
would sell his ship. This came to my cars before my
new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy
it; so I went to him, and I told him of it. He considered
awhile, for he was no rash man; and musing some time,
he replied, "She is a little too big; but, however, we
will have her." Accordingly, we bought the ship, and
agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took pos--
session. \Vhen we had done so, we resolved to engage
the men, if we could, to join with those we had, for the
pursuing our business; but on a sudden, they having
received not their wages, but their share of the money,
as we afterwards learned, not one of them was to be
found. We inquired much about them, and at length
were told that they were all gone together by land to
Agra, the city of the great Mogul's residence, and thence
to travel to Surat, and go by the sea to the Gulf of
Persia.

We picked up some English sailors here after this, and
some Dutch; and now we resolved on a second voyage
for cloves, among the Philippine and Molucca Isles.

In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged to beat
up and down a great while in the Straits of Malacca,
and among the islands, we were no sooner get clear of
those ditiicult seas than we found our ship had sprung a
leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to find
out where it was. This forced us to make some port, and
my partner, who knew the country better than I did, di-
rected the captain to put into the river of Cambodia.
This river lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf
which goes up to Siam. While we were here, and going
often on shore for refreshment, there came to me, one day,
an Englishman, a gunner's mate on board an English East
India ship, which rode in the same river, near the city of
Cambodia. " Sir," says he, "you are a stranger to me,
and I to you, but I have something to tell you that very
nearly concerns you."

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and thought at
first I had known him, but I did not. "If it very nearly
concerns me," said I, "and not yourself, what moves you
to tell it to me?" "I am moved," says he, " by the immi-
nent danger you are in, and, for aught I see, you have no
knowledge of it." He then went on to say, that we were
supposed to be pirates; and that there were two large
English and three Dutch ships lying up the river, about five
leagues, and that with the next tide they intended sending
down all their large boats and taking our vessel, and then
hanging every one of us.

On hearing this, we immediately ordered the anchor to
be got up; and though the tide was not quite down, yet a
little land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Before
long, a seamen called out that we were chased. " Chased !"
says I; "by what ?" " By five sloops, or boats," says the
fellow, "full of men." "Very well," said I, "then it is
apparent there is something in it." In the next place, I
ordered all our men to be called up, and told them there
was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates,
and asked them if they would stand by us, and by one
another: the men answered cheerfully, one and all, thatthey
would live and die with us. ThenI asked the captain what
way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them;
for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the
last drop. He said readily, that the way was to keep them
off with our great shot as long as we could, and then to
fire at them with our small arms, to keep them from
boarding us; but when neither of these would do any
longer, we would retire to our close quarters; perhaps
they had not materials to break open our bulk-heads, or
get in upon us.

The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to bring two
guns, to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the
deck, and load them with musket-bullets and small pieces
of old iron, and thus we made ready for fight; but all this
while we kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see
the boats at a distance, being five large long boats, follow-
ing us with all the sail they could make.

Two of these boats outsailed the rest, and endeavoured
to come under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter;
upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and
depended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered
to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside;
when immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which
had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the
hindermost boat, and bring them to the necessit of taking
down their sail, and running all to the head of t eboat, to
keep her from sinking; but the others came up one after
the other, but we succeeded in beating them of and dis-
abling them all, for that they had to lay by to refit; we
then crowded all the sail we could, and stood farther out
to sea, and we found that they gave over their chase.

Being thus delivered from this danger, my partner told
me he would put me in on the coast of Cochin China,
intending afterwards to go to Macao. We sailed for a
little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the
mission usually landed from Macao, and where no Euro-
pean ship ever put in, but did not come to it for five days.
When I set my foot on shore, I resolved never to set one
foot on board that unhappy vessel more. When we came
on shore, the old pilot got us a lodging and a. warehouse
for our goods in that country.

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been
over some time: however, we found that there were three
or four junks in the river, and two ships from Japan, with
goods which they had bought in China, and were not gone
away, having some Japanese merchants onshore."He was respected as a king, and attended in all his appearances with

'lhe first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was,
to get us acquainted with three missionary Romish riests
who were in the town. One of these was a Fren an,
whom they called Father Simon, who was courteous, easy
in his manner, and very agreeable company; the other two
were more reserved.

This French priest, Father Simon, was appointed to go
up to Pekin, and waited only for another priest, who was
ordered to come to him from Macao; and we scarce ever
met together but he was inviting me to go the journey
with him; and having, in the course of time, disposed of
our merchandise, and also the vessel to the Japanese mer-
chant, I and my partner, with the old Portuguese pilot, set ,
out with very good advantage, for we got leave to travelin
the retinue of one of their mandarins.

He was respected as a king, surrounded always with his
gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances with such
pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance. But this
I observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue but
that our carriers' paokhorses in England seemed to me to
look much better; though it was hard to judge rightlyd'or
they were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings,
&c., that we could scarce see anything but their feet and
their heads as they went along. -

At length we arrived at Pekin. As for the Portuguese
pilot, he being desirous to see the court, we bore his
charges for his company, and to use him as an interpreter;
indeed, this old man was most useful to us everywhere, for
we had not been above a week at Pekin, when he came
and told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and
Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their
journey by land to Muscovy, within four or five weeks,
and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with
them, and leave him behind, to go back alone.

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news.
"How do on know this?" said I. "Are you sure it is
true 1'" " es," says he: "I met this morning, in the
street, an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is
among them. He came last from Astracan, is now going
with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wclga
to Astracan." "Well, Seignior," says I, " do not be
uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this be a
method for my return to England, it shall be your fault if
you go back to Macao at all." We then went to consult
what was to be done; and we agreed that if our Portuguese
pilot would go with us, we would hear his charges to
Moscow, or to England, if he pleased; nor, indeed, were
we to be esteemed over-generous in that either, if we had
not rewarded him farther, the service he had done us being
really worth more than that; for he had not only been a
pilot to us at sea, but he had been a broker for us on
shore; and his procuring for us the Japan merchant was
some hundred pounds in our pockets. So we consulted
together about it, and being willing to gratify him, which
was but doing him justice, and very willing also to have
him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man on
all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined
gold, which, as I compute it, came to about one hundred
and seventy-five pounds sterling, between us, and to bear
all his charges, both for himself and horse, except only a
horse to carry his goods. Having settled this, we called
him to let him know what we had resolved. I told him
he had complained of our being willing to let him go back
alone, and I was new about to tell him we were resolved
he should not go back at all. That as we had resolved to
go to Europe with the caravan, he should also go with us;
and that we. called him to know his mind. He shook his
head, and said it was a long journey, and that he had no
pecune to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when he
came there. We told him we believed it was so, and
therefore we had resolved to do something for him that
should let him see how sensible we were of his services,
and how agreeable he was to us; and then Itold him
what we had resolved to give him here, which he might
lay out as we would do our own: and that as for his
charges, if he would go with us we would set him safe on
shore either in Muscovy or England, which he would, at
our own charge, except only the carriage of his goods. He
received the proposal like a man transported, and told us
he would go with us over the whole world; and so we all
prepared for our journey.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we
set out from Pekiu. The company was very great, and, as
near as I can remember, made between three and four
hundred horse, and upwards of one hundred and twenty
men, very well armed, and provided for all events: for as
the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the
Arabs, so are these by the Tartars; but they are not
altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous
when they prevail.

The company consisted of people of several nations; but
there were above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants
of Moscow, though some of them were Livonians ; and to
our particular satisfaction, five were Scots, who appeared
also to be men of great experience in business, and of very
good substance.

We travelled near a month still in the dominions of the
Emperor of China, but lay for the most partin the villages,
some of which were fortified, because of the incursions of
the Tartars.

We wanted above two days' journey of the city of N aum,
when messengers were sent express to every part of the
road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till they
had a guard sent for them; for that an unusual body of
'l'artars, making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the
way, about thirty miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news; however, it was carefully
done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we
should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we
had two hundred soldiers sent us from a. garrison of the.
Chinese, on our left, and three hundred more from the
city of Nauru, and with these we advanced boldly; the
three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front,
the two hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of
our camels, with our baggage, and the whole caravan in
the centre; in this order, and well prepared for battle, we
thought ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand
Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next day,
when they did appear, it was quite another thing.

It was early in the morning, when, marching from a
well-situated little town called Changu, we had a riverto
pass, which we were obliged to ferry; and, had the Tartars
had any intelligence, then had been the time to have
attacked us, when the caravan being over, the rear guard
was behind; but they did not appear there. About three
hours after, when we were entered upon a desert of about
fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust
they raised, we saw an enemy was at hand; and they were
at hand indeed, for they came on upon the spur.

The Chinese, our guard in the front, who had talked so
big the day before, began to stagger ; and the soldiers
frequently looked behind them, which is a certain sign in
a soldier that he is just ready to run away. My old pilot
was of my mind; and being near me, called out, " Seignior
Inglese," says he, " those fellows must be encouraged, or
they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on they will
never stand it." "I am of your mind," said I; "but what
must be done ?" "Done 1" says he, "let fifty of our men
advance, and flank them on each wing, and encourage
them; and they will fight like brave fellows in brave com--
pany; but without this, they will every man turn his
back." Immediately, I rode up to our leader, and told
him, who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly fifty
of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to the left, and
the rest made a line of rescue ; and so we marched, leaving
the last two hundred men to make a. body by themselves,
and to guard the camels; only that, if need were, they
should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
company they were: how many we could not tell, but ten
thousand, we thought, was the least; a party of them
came on first and viewed our posture, traversing the ground
in the front of our line; and, as we found them within
gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to advance
swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with their
shot, which was done; and they went off, I suppose, back,
to give an account of the reception they were like to meet
with; and, indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs, for
they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of it, and
wheeling oli' to the left, they gave over their design, and
said no more to us for that time.

Two days after, we came to the city of Naum; we
thanked the governor for his care of us, and collected to
the value of a hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we

gave to the soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested
one day. '

After this, we passed several great rivers; and two
dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days
passing over, and which, as I said, was to be called No
Man's Land; and, on the 13th of April, we came to the
frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think the first
town or fortress, whichever it may be called, that belonged
to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Arguna, being on the

" west side of the river Arguna.

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I
was so soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country,
or, at least, in a country governed by Christians. Not a
town or city we passed through but had their pagoda, their
idols, and their temples, and, ignorant people worshipping
even the works of their own hands. Now we came where,
at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared; where
the knee was bowed to Jesus; whether ignorantly or not,
yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name of the
true God was called upon and adored, and it made my soul
rejoice to see it.

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid
earth, if I understand anything of the surface of the globe,
that is to be found in any part of the world; we had, at
least, twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward; two thou-
sand miles to the bottom of the Baltic sea, westward; and
above three thousand miles, if we lefi; that sea, and went
on west, to the British and French channels; we had full
five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian sea, south;
and about eight hundred to the Frozen sea, north.

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good
while before we came to any considerable towns, we had
nothing to observe there but this; first, that all the rivers
run to the east: as I understood by the charts, which
some in our caravan had with them, it was plain all those
rivers ran into the great Yamour, or Gamour; which

river, by the natural course of it, inust run into the East
See, or Chinese Ocean.Y...._.m--r- - . -- - . -7

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several
considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the
Yamour runs east, and these are all found to join their
waters with the great river Tartarus, named so from the
northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartars; who, as the
Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the world; and who,
as our geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog men-
tioned in sacred history. These rivers, running all north-
ward, as well as all the other rivers I am yet to speak of,
make it evident that the northern ocean bounds the land
also on that side ; so that it does not seem rational in the
least to think that the land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is not a communication
between the northern and eastern ocean: but of this I
shall say no more; it was my observation at that time,
and therefore I take notice of it in this place.

We new advanced from the river Arguna by easy and
moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care
the Czar ofMuscovy has taken to have cities and towns
built in as many places as it is possible to place them, where
his soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary
soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of
their empire: some of which I had read of were placed in
Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging
travellers: and thus it was here; for wherever we came,
though at these towns and stations the garrisons and

governors were Russians and professed Christians, yet the

inhabitants were mere pagans.

In a village near N ortziousky, I had. the curiosity to go
and see their way of living, which is most brutish and
unsufl'erable: they had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that
day; for there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree, an
idol made of wood, frightful as the devil; at least, as
anything we can think of to represent the devil can be
made: it had a head not resembling any creature that the
world ever saw; ears as big as goats' horns, and as high ;
eyes as big as a crown-piece ; a nose like a crooked ram's
horn, and a mouth extending four cornered, like that of
a lion, with horrid teeth, hooked like a parrot's under
bill; it was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you"I mdo up to the image or monsbnr. and with my sword made a. stroke
at, the banner that. was on it-s head. and cut it. in two."
could suppose: its upper garment was of sheepvskins, with
the wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet on the head,
with two horns growing through it; it was about eight
feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion
of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village,
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seven--
teen creatures--whether men or women I could not tell,
for they made no distinction by their habits--all lying flat
upon the ground round this formidable block of shapeless
wood. A little way 01? from the idol, and at the door of a.
tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried,
stood three butchers--I thought they were such when I
came nearer to them, for I found they had long knives in
their hands; and in the middle of the tent appeared three
sheep killed, and one young bullock or steer. These, it
seemed, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol; the
three men were priests belonging to it, and the seventeen
prostrated wretches were the people who brought the
ofi'ering, and were making their prayers to that stock.

I rode up to the image or monster--call it what you
will--and with my sword made astroke at the bonnet that
was on its head, and cut it in two; and one of our men that
was with me took hold of the sheep-skin that covered it and
pulled it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling
ran through the village, and two or three hundred people
came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for it, for
we saw some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from
that moment to visit them again.

Our caravan rested three nights at Nortziousky, which
was about four miles off, in order to provide some horses
which they wanted, so we had some leisure here to put
my design into execution. I communicated it to the Scots
merchant of Moscow. I told him what I had seen, and
with what indignation I had thought human nature could
be so degenerate; I told him if I could get but four or
five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved to go
816. destroy that vile, abominable idol.

_ ,He laughed at me: says he, "Your zeal may be good,
but what do you propose to yourself by it 2" " Propose I"
said I, "to vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted
by this devil--worship." " Look you, sir," said he, "if
your zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it;
but I would have you consider these wild nations are sub-
jected by force to the Czar of Muscovy's dominion; and if
you do this, it is ten to one but they will come by thou-
sands to the governor of N ertsinskay and demand satisfac-
tion; and if he cannot give them satisfaction, it is ten to
one but they revolt, and it will occasion a new war with
all the Tartars in the country."

"his, I confess, put. new thoughts into my head for
awhile; but I harped upon the some string still; and all
that day I was uneasy to put my project in execution.
Towards the evening, the Scots merchant met me by acci-
dent in our wall: about the town, and desired to speak
with me. "I believe," said he, "I have put you off your
good design; I have been a little concerned about it since,
for I abhor idolatry as much as you can do." "Truly,"
said I, " you have put 011' a little the execution of it, but
you have not put it out of my thoughts, and I will do it
before I quit this place, though I were to be delivered up
to them for satisfaction."

Finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me I
should not go alone, but he would go with me, but he
would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his country-
men, to go also with us. He brought me his comrade, a
Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richardson; and I
gave him a full account of what I had seen, and also what
I intended; and he told me readily he would go with me
if it cost him his life. I had proposed it to my partner,
but he declined it; so we resolved upon our work, only
We three and my man-servant, and to put it in execu-
tion that night about midnight, with all the secresy
imaginable.

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to
delay it till the next night, because the caravan being to
set forward in the morning, we supposed the governor
could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us
when we were out of his power. The Scots merchant
brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a
bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the
same for himself and his countryman, that the people, if
they saw us, should not determine who we were.

-We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night.
The people seemed to be all at their rest; only <<that in the
great hut, or tent, where we saw the three priests, we saw
alight, and going close up to the door, we heard people
talking as if there were five or six of them; we concluded,
therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, these men
would come out immediately, and run up to the place to
rescue it from the destruction that we intended for it; and
what to do with them we knew not. " I will tell you
what we will do," said the Scots merchant; "we will try
to make them prisoners, tie their hands, and. make them
stand and see their idol destroyed."

As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough
about us, so we resolved to attack these people first, and
with as little noise as we could. This we accordingly did,
and having bound them, we carried them altogether to the
idol. When we came there, we fell to work with him;
and first we daubed him all over, and his robes also, with
tar, and such other stuff as we had, which was tallow
mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears.
and mouth full of gunpowder. When we had done this,
we took all our prisoners, and having untied their feet and
ungagged their mouths, made them stand up, and set
them before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the
whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the
idol blew up, and we saw it burned into a mere block or
log of wood. After the feat was performed, we appeared
in the morning among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly
busy in getting ready for our journey; nor could any man

suggest that we had been anywhere but in our beds. .

' But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great
number of the country people. to the town gates, and in a
most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the
Russian governor for the insulting their priests, and burn-
ing their great Chem Chi--Thaungu. The Russian governor._ r. -= '- '" "'3'?ng <<w-vv. v 'T""';V<w5'7u'_'r'm_v\<<v-uwu W .._..v

sent out messengers to appease them, assuring them that
he knew nothing of it, but that if they could let him know
who did it, they should be exemplarily punished. ' They
returned haughtily, that all the country reverenced the
great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no
mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image but
some Christian miscreant; and they therefore resolved to
denounce war against him and all the Russians, who, they
said, were miscreants and Christians.

The governor, still patient, gave them still all the good
words he could. At last he told them there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some
of them who had done them this injury; and that if they
would be satisfied with that, he would send after them to
inquire into it. This seemed to appease them a little;
and accordingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a
particular account how the thing was; intimating that
we should make all the haste forward that was possible.
We took the hint that the governor gave us, and
travelled two days and two nights, without any considerable
stop, and then we lay at a village called Plothus : nor did
we make any long stop here, but hastened on towards
Jarawena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and
where we expected we should be safe. But upon the
second day's march from Plothus, by the clouds of dust
behind us at a great distance, some of our people began to
be sensible we were pursued. We had entered a. great
desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks Oser,
when we perceived a. very great body of horse appear on

p the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling west.
We observed they went away west, as we did, but had
supposed we would have taken that side of the lake,
whereas we very happily took the south side; and in two
more days they disappeared again: for they, believing we
were still before them, pushed on till they came to the
river Udda, a very great river when it passes farther
north, but when we came to it, we found it 'narrowfid
fordable. "'

The third day they had either found their mistake, or
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us

" We made our front as
towards the dusk of the evening. We had just pitched
upon a place for our camp, which was very convenient for
the night; for as we were upon a desert that was above
five hundred miles over, we had no towns to lodge at;
the desert, however, had some few woods in it on this
side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river
Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between little but very
thick woods, that we pitched our little camp for that night,
expecting to be attacked before morning.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for:
but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about
in troops in that desert, so the caravans always fortify

themselves every night against them, as against armies of

robbers; and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a
most advantageous camp : for we lay between two woods,
with a little rivulet running just before our front, so that
we could not be surrounded, or attacked any way but in
our front or rear. We took care also to make our front
as strong as we could, by placing our packs, with our
camels and horses, all in a line, on the inside of the river,
and felling some trees in our rear.

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the
enemy was upon us before we had finished. They sent
three messengers to us, to demand the men to be de-
livered to them that had abused their priests, and burned
their god Cham Chi-Thaungu with fire, that they might
burn them with fire ; and upon this, they said, they would
go away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they would
destroy us all. The leader of the caravan sent word he
was was well assured that it was not done by any of our
camp; that we were peaceful merchants, travelling on our
business; that we had done no harm to them or to any
one else; and that, therefore, they must look further for
their enemies who had injured them, for we were not the
people; so they desired them not to disturb us, for if they
did we should defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an
answer; and a great crowd of them came running down
in the morning, by break of day. to our camp; but they

at '-
durst come no farther than the brook in our front, where
they stood, and showed us such a number that indeed
terrified us very much. Here they stood and looked at
us awhile, and then setting up a great howl, they let fly a
crowd of arrows among us; but we were well enough
fortified for that, for we sheltered under our baggage, and
I do not remember that one of us was hurt.

Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our
right, and expected them on the rear : when a Cossack of
Jaraweno calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him,
" I'll go send all these people away to Siheilk: ." This was
a city four or five days' journey at least to the right, and
rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and
getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly,
as it were back to Nertsinskay; after this, he takes a great
circuit about, and comes directly on the army of the
'l'artars, as if he had been sent express to tell them a long
story that the people who had burned the Chain Chi~
Thnungn were gone to Siheilka, and t-hatthey had resolved
to burn the god Schal--Isar, belonging to the 'l'ongucses.

As this fellow was himself a more Tartar, and perfectly
spoke their language, he connterfeitcd so well that they all
believed him, and away they drove in a most violent
hurry to Siheilka. So we passed away safely on to
Jarawena, where there was a garrison of Muscovites, and
there we rested five days; the. caravan being exceedingly
iatigued with the last day's hard march, and with want of
rest in the night.

From this city we had a frightful desert, which hold us
twenty-three days' march. We furnished ourselves with
some tents here, for the better accommodating ourselvesin
the night; and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen
carriages or waggons of the country, for carrying our water
or provisions; and these carriages were our defence, every
night, round our little camp: so that had the Tartars ap-
peared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they
would not have been able to hurt us.

We may well be supposed to have wanted rest again after
this long journey; for in this desert we neither saw house
nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of
the sable hunters, who are all Tax-tars of the Mogul
Tartary, of which this country is a part; and they fre-
quently attack small caravans, but we saw no numbers of
them together.

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country
pretty well inhabited ; we found towns and castles, settled
by the Czar of Muscovy, with ganisons of stationary
soldiers, to protect the caravans, and defend the country
against the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given
such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and
merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard of inthe
country, detachments of the garrison are always sent to see
the travellers safe from station to station. And thus the
governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an opportunity to
make a visit to, by means of the Scots merchant, who was
acquainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty men, if we
thought there was any danger, to the next station.

I thought, long before this, that, as we came nearer to
Europe, we should find the country better inhabited, and
the people more civilized : but I found myself mistaken in
both; for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass
through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and
barbarity.

If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole
village or country, these had idols in every hut and every
cave: besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water,
the snow, and, in a word, everything they do not under-
stand, and they understand but very little; so that every
element, every uncommon thing, sets them sacrificing. I
met with nothing peculiar myself in all this country, which
I reckon was from the desert I spoke of last at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which took
us up twelve days' severe travelling, without house or tree;
and we were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as
well water as bread. After we were out of this desert, and
had travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a. Muscovite
city or station on the great river J anezay, which, they told
us there, parted Europe from Asia. .

Here I observed ignorance and paganism 'still prevailed.

J
except in the Museovite garrisons, - all the country between
the r11 cr Oby and the river Janczay' 15 as entirely pagan,
and the people as barbarous, as the rcmotest of the Tartars;
nay, as any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America.

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a
wild, uncultivated country, barren of people and good 111a-
nagcment, otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant. fruitful,
and agreeable country. What inhabitants we found in it
are all pagans, except such as are sent among them from
llussia: for this is the country--I mean 011 both sides the
river Oby--whithcr the Muscovite criminals that are not
put to death are banished. and front whence it is next to
impossible they should ever get awav.

I have nothing' material to say of my particular atl'airs till
I came to 'l'obolslti, the capital city of Siberia, where I con-
tinued some time on the following account.

We had now been almost seven months on our journey,
and winter began to come on apace ; whereupon my partner
and I called a council about our particular all'airs, in which
we found it proper, as We were bound for England, and
not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves.
They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us orer the
snow in the winter time; and, indeed, they have such
things that it would be incredible to relate the particulars
of, by which means the Russians t1 and more in winter than
they an in summer, as in these sledtrcs they are able to run
night and day; the snow, beinv' frozen, is one universal
covering to nature, by which the hills, vales, mm s, and
lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upon
the surlace, without any regard to what 13 underneath.

But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this

kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my
route lay two ways: either 1 must go on 11s the caravan
went, till I came to Jareslaw, and then go ofi' west for
Narva, and the Gulf of Finland, and so on to Dantzic,
where I 111ight possibly sell my China cargo to good ad-
'antage; or I must leave the caravan at a little town on
the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water to
Archangel, and from thence 111igl1t be sure of shipping
either to England, Holland, or llamburgh.
Now to go any of these journeys in the winter would
have been preposterous: for, as to Dantzic, the Baltic
would have been frozen up, and I could not get passage;
and to go by land in those countries was far less safe than
among the Mogul Tartars; likewise, to go to Archangel
in October, all the ships would be gone from thence, and
even the merchants who dwell there in summer re'tire south
to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that
I could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter,
with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an empty
town all the winter; so that, upon the whole, I thought it
much my better way to let the caravan go, and make pro-
vision to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in
the latitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz., plenty of pro.
visions, such as the country afforded, a warm house, with
fuel enough, and excellent company.

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful
winter I thought it; the cold so intense that I could not
so much as look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and
a mask of fur before my face, or rather a hood, with only a
hole for breath, and two for sight: the little daylight we
had was, as we reckoned for three months, not above five
hours a day, and six at most; only that the snow lying, on
the ground continually, andvthe weather being clear, it was
never quite dark. Our horses were kept, or rather starved,
under ground; and as for our servants, whom we hired
here to look after ourselves and horses, we had, every now
and then, their fingers and toes to thaw and take care of,
lest they should mortify and fall off.

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer,
and the weather at least tolerable; so the other travellers
began to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and
to get things ready to be going; but my measures being
fixed for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I
made no motion; knowing very well that the ships from
the south do not set out for that part of the world till May
or June, and that if I was there by the beginning of
August, it would be as soon as any ships would be ready
to go away; and therefore I made no haste to be gone, asA "lwvr'lm'V'1V""' -

others did: in a word, I saw all the travellers go away
before me. It seems every year they go from thence to
Muscovy for trade, to carry furs, and buy necessaries,
which they bring back with them to furnish their shops:
also others went on the same errand to Archangel; but
then they all being to come back again above eight hun-
dred miles, went out before me.

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote
place; a city, I believe, little heard of in the world; and,
indeed, it is so far out of the road of commerce, that I know
not how it should be much talked of. We were now re-
duced to a very small caravan, having only thirty--two
horses and camels. We had here the worst and the largest
desert to pass over that we met with in our whole journey;

I call it the worst, because the way was very deep in some -

places, and very uneven in others; the best we had to say
for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars or
robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side the
river Oby, or at least very seldom; but we found it
otherwise.

We had just entered Europe, having passed the River
Kama, which in these parts is the boundary between
Europe and Asia, and the first city on the European side
was called Soloy Kamskoi, which is as much as to say, the
great city on the River Kama; and here we thought to see
some evident alteration in the people; but we were mis-
taken; for as we had a vast desert to pass, which is near
seven hundred miles long in some places, but not above
two hundred miles over where we passed it, so, till we
came past that horrible place, we found very little difference
between that country and the Mogul Tartary. The people
are mostly pagans, and little better than the savages of
America; their houses and towns full of idols, and their
way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities, and
the villages near them, where they are Christians of the
Greek Church.

In passing this forest, I thought we must have been
plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop
of thieves, about forty-five in number; they placed
themselves just in our way; upon which we drew up in aOur Portuguese out several arms of trees half off. and laid them
hanging from one tree to another."
little line, before our camels, being not above sixteen men
in all; and sent out a Siberian servant to see who they
were; but he came back no wiser than he went.

About an hour after, they again made a metion to attack
us, but finding us always ready to face them, they went
off again: and we resolved not to stir for that night.

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no
remedy: there was, on our, left hand, at about a quarter
of a mile distance, a little grove, and very near the road:
I immediately resolved we should advance to those trees,
and fortify ourselves as well as could there. We advanced
immediately with what speed we could, and gained that
little wood.

While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving that they made any move-
ment, our Portuguese, with some help, cut several arms of
trees half off, and laid them hanging across from one tree
to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About two
hours before night, they came down directly upon us ;
and though we had not perceived it, we found they had
been joined by some more, so that they were near four-
score horse; whereof, we fancied some were women. They
came on till they were within half-shot of our little Wood,
when we fired one musket without ball, and called to them
in the Russian tongue to know what they wanted, and bade
them keep off; but they came on with double fury up to
the wood side, not imagining we were so barricaded that
they could not easily break in. Our captain desired us
not to fire upon them till they came within pistol-shot, and
when we did fire to take good aim. When they were
within two pikes' length we let fly, and killed fourteen of
them, and wounded several others, on which they retreated,
and did not return that night.

We slept little, but spent the most part of. the night in
strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances
into the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited for
daylight, and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome
discovery indeed; for the enemy were now greatly
increased, and had set up eleven or twelve huts or tents,
as if they were resolved to besiege us; and this little
camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three'
quarters of a. mile from us. We were indeed surprised at
this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave myself up for
lost, and all that I had. As to my partner, he was raging,
and declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin, that
he would rather die than be starved, and he was for fight-
ing to the last drop.

We spent the day in debates of what we should do: but
towards evening we found that the number of our enemies
still increased ; so I began to inquire of those people we had
brought from Tobolski, if there were no private ways by
which we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps
retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over the
desert. The Siberian servant told us, if we designed to
avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to carry us off
in the night, to a way that went north, towards the river
l'etrou, by which he made no question but we might get
away, and .the 'l'artars never discover it.

As soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in
our little camp, which we kept burning. and prepared so
as to make it burn all night, that the 'l'artars might con-
elude we were still there ; but as soon as it was dark, and
we could see the stars (for our guide would not stir belore),
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we followed
our new guide, who I soon found steered himself by the
north star.

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to
be lighter still; and by six o'clock the next morning we
had got above thirty miles. Here we found a Russian
village, named Kermazinskoy, where we rested, and heard
nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two
hours before night, we set out again, and travelled till
eight the next morning, though not quite so hard as
before; and about seven o'clock, we passed a little river,
called Kirtza, and came to a. good large town inhabited by
Russians, called Ozomoys; there we heard that several
troops of Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but
that we were now completely out of danger of them, which
was to our great satisfaction.

A few days more we came to Veuslima upon the River- '11' 32'":st "IT-1m;

Memos causes. '833'

Wirtzogda, and running into the Dwina. We were there;
very happily, near the end of our travels by land, that river
being navigable, in seven days' passage, to Archangel.
From hence, we came to Lawrenskoy, the 3rd of July,
and providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a
barge for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and
arrived all safe at Archangel the 18th; having been a year,
five months, and three days on the journey, including our
stay of eight months at Tobolski. We were obliged to
stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the ships,
and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher
come in above a month sooner than any of the' English ships.

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the
same year; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived
safe' in the Elbe the 18th of September.

To conclude, having stayedP near four months in Ham-4
burgh, I came thence by land to the Hague, where I em-
barked in the packet, and arrived' in London the 10th of
January, 1705, having been absent from England ten years
and nine months. And here I resolved to prepare for a
longer Journey than all these, having lived a life of infinite
variety seventy-two years, and learned sufiiciently to know
the value of retirement, and the blessings of ending my
days in peace.
