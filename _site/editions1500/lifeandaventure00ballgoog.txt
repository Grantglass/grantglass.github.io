<»no€8, iiill of savagesy armed with bows and ar- 
tows, great clubs, wooden swords^ and such-like 
engines of war; and they brought such numbers 
with them, that in short it put all our people into 
the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at 
the easternmost side of the island, our men had 
that night to consult and consider what to do ; and 
in the first place, knowing that their being entirely 
concealed was their only safety before, and would 
much more be so now, while the number of their 
enemies was so great, they therefore resolved, first 
of all, to take down the huts which were built for 
the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to 
the old cave ; because they supposed the savages 
would go directly thither as soon as it was day, to 
play the old game over again* though they did 
not now land within two leagues of it. 

In the next place* they drove away all the flock 
of goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, 
which belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, 
left as little appearance of inhabitants any where 
as possible ; and the next rooming early they 
posted themselves with all their force at the plan- 
tation of the two men, waiting for their coming. 
As they guessed, so it happened ; these new inva* 
ders> leaving their canoes at the east end of the 
island, came ranging along the shore* directly to*

army was but small indeed ; but that which was 
worse, they had not arms for ail their number nei*

loog stafi; like a quarter-stafi^ with a great spike 
of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side 
a hatchet ; also every one of our men had hatchets. 
Two of the women could not be prevailed upon 
but they would come into the fight, and they had 
bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken 
from the savages when the first action happened, 
which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought 
with one another; and the women had hatchets 
too. 

The Spaniard governor, , whom I have described 
so often, commanded the whole; and William 
Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wicked- 
ness, was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded 
Tinder him. The savages came forward like lions, 
and our men, which was the worst of their fate, 
had no advantage in their situation; only that Will 
Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with 
six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of 
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let 
the first of them pass by, and then fire into the 
middle of them; and as soon as he had fired, to 
make his retreat, as nimbly as he could, round a 
part of the wood, and so come in behind the Spa- 
niards where they stood, having a thicket of trees 
all before them. 

Whea the savages came on, they ran straggling 
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of or- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6 

der, and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pass 
by him ; then seeing the rest come in a very thick 
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having 
loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets 
apiece, •about as big as large pistol-bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded they knew not ; but 
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible 
among the savages, who were frighted to the last 
degree, to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their 
men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that 
did it. When in the middle of their fright^ Wil- 
liam Atkins and his other three let fly again among 
the thickest of them; and in less than a minute 
the first three, being loaded again, gave them a 
third volley. 

Had William Atkins and his men retired imme- 
diately, as soon as they had fired, as they were or- 
dered to do, or had the rest of the body been at 
hand to have poured in their shot continually, the 
savages had been efiectually routed ; for the ter- 
ror that was among them came principally from 
this, viz. that they were killed by the gods vf^ith 
thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that 
hurt them : but William Atkins staying to load 
again, discovered the cheat ; some of the savages, 
who were at a distance, spying them, came upon 
them behind; and though Atkins and his men 
fired at them also> two or three times> and killed 



• .'•. 



6 THE LIFB AND ADYENTURES 

above twenty, retiring as fast as they coiild» yet 
they wounded Atkins himself^ and killed one of his 
fellow Englishmen with their arrews, as they did 
afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian 
slaves who came with the women. This sktve was 
a most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, 
killing five of them with his own hand, having no 
weapon but one of the armed staves and an hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound- 
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rising 
ground in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing 
three vollies upon them, retreated also; for their 
number was so great, and they were so desperate, 
that though above fifty of them were killed, and 
more than so many wounded, yet they came on in 
the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot 
their arrows like a cloud ; and it was observed, 
that their wounded men, who were not quite dis* 
abled, were made outrageous by their wounds, and 
fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englishman that were killed, behind them; 
and the savages, when they came up to them, kill* 
ed them over again in a wretched manner, break* 
ing their arms, legs, and heads, with their cloba 
imd wooden swords, like true savages. But find- 
ing our men were gone, they did not seem inclined 
\o pv^rsae them, but drew themselves up in a kind 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOfi. «r 

of ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and shout- 
ed twice in token of their victory ; after which, 
they had the mortification to see several of their 
wonnded men fall, dying with the mere loss of 
blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, 
though he was wounded, would have had lym 
inarch, and charge them again all together at 
once : but the Spaniard replied, " Seignior Atkins, 
ycm see how their wounded men fight; let them 
alone till morning ; all these wounded men will be 
Bttff and sore with their wounds, and faint with the 
loss of blood, and so we shall have the fewer to en* 

The advice was good ; but Will Atkins replied 
merrily, " That's true. Seignior, and so shall I too ; 
and that's the reason I would go on while I am 
warm/' ** Well, Seignior Atkins,* says the Spa- 
niard, " you have behaved gallantly, and done your 
part; v^e will fight for you, if you cannot come on ; 
but I think it best to stay ^11 niorning :" so they 
waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they 
found the savages in great disorder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise 
among them where they lay, they aflerwards re- 
solved to faHl iipon them in the night, especially if 



8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES' 

they could come to giye them but one volley be- 
fore they were discovered. This they had a fair 
opportunity to do ; for one of the two Englishmen, 
in whose quarter it was where the fight began, led 
them round between the woods and the sea-side, 
westward, and turning short souths they came so 
near where the thickest of them lay, that before 
they w^re seen or heard, eight of them fired in 
among them, and did dreadful execution upon 
them; in half a minute more eight others fired 
after them, pouring in their small shot in such a 
quantity, that abundance were killed and wound- 
ed; and all this while they were not able to see 
who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost 
expedition, and then divided themselves into three 
bodies, and resolved to fall in among them all to- 
gether. They had in each body eight persons; 
that is to say, twenty-four, whereof were twenty- 
two men, and the two women, who, by the way, 
fought desperately. 

They divided the fire-arms equally in each 
party, and so of the halberts and staves. They 
would have had the women keep back ; but they 
said they were resolved to die witii their husbands. 
Having thus formed their little army, they march- 
ed out from among the trees, and came up to the 
tteeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

as they could. The savages stood all together, bat 
were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of 
our men shouting from three quarters together; 
they would have fought if they had seen us; and as 
soon as we came near enough to be seen, some ar* 
rows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, 
though not dangerously. But our men gave them 
no time, but running up to them, fired among them 
three ways, and then fell in with the butt ends of 
their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and 
hatchets; and laid about them so well, that in a 
word they set up a dismal screaming and howling; 
flying to save their lives which way soever they 
could^ 

Our m3n wiere tired with the execution; and 
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, 
about one hundred and eighty of them : the rest, 
being frighted out of their wits, scoured through 
the woods and over the hills, with all the speed that 
fear and nimble feet could help them to do ; and 
as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue 
them, they got all together to the sea-side, where 
they landed, and where their canoes lay. But 
their disaster was not at an end yet, for it blew a ' 
terrible storm of wind that evening from the sesa- 
ward, so that it was impossible for them to put 
ofiT; nay, the storm continuing all night, when the 
tide came up their canoes were most of them driven 



10 THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

by the sarge of the sea ao high upon the shore, 
that it required infinite toil to get them off; and 
some of them were even dashed to pieces against 
the beach^ or against one another. 

Oar men, though glad of their victory, yet got 
little rest that night ; but having retreshed them- 
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march 
to that part of the island where the savages were 
fled, and see what posture they were in. This ne- 
cessarily led them over the place where the fight 
had been, and where they found several of the poor 
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering 
life; a sight disagreeable enough to generous 
minds ; for a truly great man, though obliged by 
the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no 
delight in his misery^ 

However, there was no need to give any order in 
this case ; for their own savages, who were their 
servants, dispatched those poor creatures with 
their hatchets. 

At length they came in view of the place where 
the more miserable remains of the savages' army 
lay, where there appeared about one hundred still : 
their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, 
with their knees up towards their mouth, and the 
head put between the hands, leaning down upoii 
^e knees. 

^hen our men came within two musket-idiot of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 11 

theiii^ the S^niard goyernor ordered two mmltets 
to be fired wiihonl baN^ to alarm them ; this he 
didf that by their countonance he might know what 
tb expect, Tiz. whether they were still in heart to 
fight, or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirit- 
ed and discouraged^ aad so he might manage ac- 
cordingty. 

This stratagem took ; for as soon as the savages 
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the se* 
cond, they started up upon their feet in the great- 
est consternation imaginable ; and, as our men ad* 
Taoced swiftly towards them, they all ran scream* 
mg and yawling away, with a kind of an howling 
noise, which our men did not understand, and had 
never heard before ; «id thustthey ran up the hills 
into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather 
had been calm, and they had all gone away to sea; 
bat they did not then consider that this might pro- 
bably hare been the occasion of their coming 
agaift in such multitudes as not to be resisted; or^ 
9t least, to come so many and so often, as would 
quito desolate the island, and starve them. Will 
Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, 
kept always with them, proved the best counsellor 
in this case. His advice was, to take the advan- 
tage thal.c^fered, and clap in between them an4 



12 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

their boats^ and so deprive them of the capacity ot' 
ever returning any more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this, and some were 
against it» for fear of making the wretches fly into 
the woods, and live there desperate ; and so they 
should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid 
to stir about their business, and have their planta>- 
tion continually rifled, all their tame goats destroy- 
ed> and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual 
distress* 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to 
do with one hundred men than with one hundred 
nations ; that, as they must destroy their boats, so 
they must destroy the men, or be all of them de- 
stroyed themselves. In a vFOf^d, he shewed them 
the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came 
into it ; so they went to work immediately with the 
boats, and getting some dry wood together from a 
dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire ; 
but they were so wet that they would scarce burn. 
However, the fire so burned the upper part, that it 
;K>on made them uQfit for swimming in the sea as 
boats. When the Indians saw what they were 
about, some of them came running out of the 
woods, and coming as near as they could to our 
men, kneeled down and cried, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, 
^ud some other words of their language^ which 
none of the others understood any thing of ; but as 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. IS 

they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was 
• easy to understand they begged to have their boats 
spared, and that they would be gone, and never re- 
turn thither again. 

But our men were now satisfied, that they had 
no way to preserve themselves, or to save their colo- 
ny, but effectually to prevent any of these people 
firom ever going home again ; depending upon this, 
that if ever so much as one of them got back into 
their country to tell the story, the colony was 
undone; so that, letting them know that they 
should not have any mercy, they fell to work with 
their canoes, and destroyed them every one that 
the storm had not destroyed before ; at the sight 
of which, the savages raised a hideous cry in the 
woods, which our people heard plain enough ; ailer 
which they ran about the island like distracted 
men; so that, in a word, our men did not really 
know at first what to do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, 
consider, that while they made those people, thus 
desperate, they ought to have kept good guard at 
the same time upon their plantations; for though 
it is true they had driven away their cattle, and the 
Indians did not find their main retreat, I mean my 
old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley; 
yet they found out my plantation at the bower^ 
and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and

pbodiig about it; trod aU the covb under fixA* 
tore up the vines and grapes, being just then &!• 
most ripe^ and did our men an inestiinable damige» 
though to themselves not one faithingVworth of 
service^ 

Though our men weie able to figt^ them upon 
all occasions, yet they were in no condstran to pur* 
sue theaib or hunt them up and down; for as they 
were too nimble of loot for our men when diey 
ibund them single, so our men duffit not go aboot 
single for fear of being surronnded with their nom* 
fieiis: th(a best was, they had no weapons; for 
Ibeugb they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor 
any materials Uk make any, nor had they any* 
ec%ed tool or weapon among them. 

The extremity and dtstcess they w«re redaoed 
to was great, and indeed deplorable^ but at the 
same time (nr men were also brought to reiy faaid 
circumstances by them; for though their retieata 
were preserved, yet their provision was deirtioyed, 
and their harvest spoiled ; and ^vhat to ds^ or wiiick 
way to turn themsel? es, they knew not ; the only 
refuge they had now was, the stock of cattle they 
had in the vaJley bj the ca^^e, and some little corm 
which grew there. . The three Englishmen* Wik 
liam Atkins and his comrades, were now reduced 
to two^ one of them being killed by an mrrawjr 
which struck him on the side of hia head, just

der the temples» so that he never spoke more; and 
it was very remarkable, that this was the same bai^ 
baroas fellow who cut the poor isavage slave with 
his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have 
murdered the Spaniards. 

I look upon their case to have been worse at this 
time than mine was at any time after I first disco* 
vered the grains of barley and ricei and got into 
the method of planting and raising my corn, and 
my tame cattle; for now tliey had, as 1 may say, 
an hundred wolves upon the island, which would 
devour every thing they could come at, yet could 
be very hardly come at themselves. 

The first thing they concluded when they saw 
What their circumstances were, was, that they 
would, if possible, drive them up to the farther part 
of the island, south-east, that if any more savagea 
came on shore, they might not find one another; 
then that they would daily hunt and harass them, 
and kill as many of them as they could come at, 
till they had reduced the number ; and if they could 
at last tame them, and bring them tp any thing, 
they would give them corn, and teach them bow 
to plant, and live upon their daily labour. 

In order to this they followed them» and so ter- 
rified them with their guns, that in a few days, if 
any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not 
hit him^ he wouki fall down for fear; and so dread* 



16 THE LIFfi AND ADVENTURES 

fully frighted they were, that they kept out of sight 
farther and farther^ till at last our men following 
them, and every day almost killing and wounding 
some of them, they kept up in the woods and hol- 
low places so much, that it reduced them to the 
utmost misery for want of food ; and many were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any 
hurt, but merely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts 
relent, and pity moved them ; especially the Spa- 
niard governor, who was the most gentleman-like, 
generous-minded man that ever I met with in my. 
life ; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of 
them alive, and bring him to understand what they 
meant, so far as to be able to act as interpreter, 
and to go among them, and see if they might be 
brought to some conditions that might be depended 
upon, to save their lives, and do us no spoil* 

It was some time before any of them could be 
taken; but being weak, and half-starved, one of 
them was at last surprised, and made a prisoner : 
he was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor 
drink; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals 
given him, and no violence offered him, he at last 
grew tractable, and came to himself. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked oft^ 
en with him, and told him how kind the others 
would be to them all; that they would not only 

3

«aye their lives, but would give them a part of the 
island to live in, provided they would give satis- 
faction ; that they should keep in their own bounds, 
and not come beyond them, to injure or prejudice 
others; and that they should have corn given th&m, 
to plant and make it grow for their bread, and some 
bread giren them for their present subsistence ; and 
old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the 
rest of his countrymen, and hear what they said to 
it, assuring them, that if they did not agree imme* 
diately, they should all be destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re- 
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with 
the proposal at the first olIFer, and begged to have 
some food given them; upon which twelve Spa- 
niards and two Englishmen, well armed, and three 
Indian slaves, dnd old Friday, marched to the place 
where they were; the three Indian slaves carried 
them a lar|^e quantity of bread, and some rice boil- 
ed up to cakes, and dried in the sun, and three live 
goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of 
an hill, where they sat down, ate \he provisions 
very thankfully, and were the most faithful fellows 
to their words that could be thought of; for except 
when they came to beg victuals and directions, 
they never came out of their bounds; and there 
they lived when I came to the island, and I went 
to see them.

18 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

They had taught them both to plant com» make 
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them; they 
wanted nothing but wives, and they soon woukl 
have been a nation : they were confined to a neck 
of land surrounded with high rocks behind them» 
and lying plain towards the sea before thern^ on 
the south-east corner of the island; they had land 
enough, and it was very good and fruitful; for they 
had a piece of land about a mile and a half broad, 
and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spadesi, 
such as I made for myself; and gave among them 
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; and 
there they livedo the most sulyjected innocent crea^- 
iures that were ever heard of. 

After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquil* 
lity with respect to the savages^ till I came to re- 
visit them, which was in about two years. Not 
but that now and then some canoes of savages 
came on shore for their triumphal^ unnatural feasts; 
but as they were of several nations, and« perhaps^ 
had never heard of those that came before, or the 
reason of it, they did not make any search or in- 
quiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it 
would have been very hard for them to have found 
them out. 

Thu^ I think,'! have given a full account of all 

that happened to them to my return, at least that 

to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

was worth notice. The Indians, or sarages, were 
wonderfblly ciyiiized by them, and they frequently 
went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death, 
any of the Indians coming to them, because they 
would not have their settlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they 
taught the savages to make wicker*work, or bas- 
kets; but they soon outdid their masters; for they 
made abundance of most ingenious things in wick* 
er-werk; particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, 
bird-cages, cupboards, &c. as also chairs to sit on, 
stoolfc, beds, couches, and abundance of other 
things, being very ingenious at such work when 
they were once put in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these peo* 
pie, because we furnished them with knives, scis- 
sars, spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all things of 
that kind which they could want. 

With the help of these tools theyv tvere so very 
handy, that they came at last to build up their 
huts, or houses, very handsomely: raddling, or 
working it op like basket-work all the way round, 
which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, 
and looked very odd ; but was an exceeding good 
fence, as well against heat, as against all sorts of 
vermin; and onr men were so taken with it, that 
they got the wild savages to come and do the like 
for them; so that when I came to see the two 



80 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Englishmea's colonies, they looked^ at a distance, 
as if they lived all like bees in a hive ; and as for 
Will Atkins, who was now become a very indus- 
trious, necessary, and sober fellow, he had made 
himself such a tent of basket-work as I believe was 
never seen. It was one hundred and twenty paces 
round on the outside, as I measured by my steps : 
the walls were as close worked as a basket, in pan- 
nels or squares, thirty-two in number, and very 
strong, standing about seven feet high: in the 
middle was another not above twenty-two paces 
round, but built stronger, being eight-square in 
its form, and in the eight comers stood eight very 
strong posts, round the top of which he laid strong 
pieces, joined together with wooden pins, from 
which he raised a pyramid before the roof of eight 
rafters, very handsome I assure you, and joined 
together very well, though he had no nails, and 
only a few iron spikes, which he had made him- 
self too, out of the old iron that I had left there ; 
and indeed this fellow shewed abundance of inge- 
.nuity in several things which he had no know-* 
ledge of; he made himself a forge, with a pair of 
wooden bellows to blow the fire ; he made himself 
charcoal for his work, and he formed out of one 
of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer 
upon ; in this manner he made many things, but 
especially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 81 

hinges.' But to return to the house: after he 
pitched the roof of his innermost tent^ he worked 
it up between the rafters with basket-work, so 
firm, and thatched that oyer again so ingeniously 
with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a 
tree, which covered the top, that his house was as 
dry as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed he 
owned that the savages made the basket-work for 
him. 

. The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all 
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay 
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the 
inner house, being about twenty feet distant ; so 
that there was a space like a walk within the outer 
wicker wall, and without the inner, near twenty 
feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same 
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided into 
six apartments, for that he had six rooms on a 
floor, and out of every one of these there was a 
door: first, into the entry, or coming into the 
main tent: and another door into the space or 
walk that was round it ; so that this walk was also 
divided into six equal parts, which served not only 
for a retreat, but to store up any necessaries which 
the family had occasion for. These six spaces not 
taking up the whole circumference, what other 
apartments the outer circle had, were thus order- 



f2 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ed : BM 800D as you were in at the door of the out- 
er circle, you had a short passage straight before 
you to the door of the inner house ; but on either 
side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by 
which you went first into a large room or store- 
house, twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet longv 
and through that into another not quite so long : 
so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, 
six of which were only to be come at through the 
apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets 
or retired rooms to the respective chambers of the 
inner circle ; and four large warehouses or bams, 
or what you please to call them> which went in 
through one another, two on either hand of the 
passage that led through the outer door to the in-« 
ner tent. «* 

Such a piece of basket>work, I believe, was ne- 
ver seen in the world ; nor an house or tent so neat-i 
ly contrived, much less so built In this great 
bee-hive lived the three families ; that is to say. 
Will Atkins and his companions; the third was 
killed, but his wife renained with three children; 
for she was, it seems, big with child when he died, 
and the other two were not at all backward to give 
the widow her full share of every thing, I mean as 
to their corn, milk, grapes, &c. and when they kil- 
led a kid, or found a turtle on the shore ; so that 
they all lived well enough, though it was true, they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9t 

were not so industrious tiis the other two, as has 
been observed already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that, 
as for religion, I don't know that there was any 
thing of that kind among them ; they pretty often 
indeed put one another in mind that there was a 
-God, by the very common method of seamen, viz. 
swearing by his name ; nor were their poor, igno* 
rant, savage wives much the better for having been 
married to Christians, as we must call them ; for as 
they knew very little of God themselves, so they 
were utterly incapable of entering into any dis- 
course with their wives about a God, or to talk any 
thing to them concerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can 
say the wives had made fro« them was, that they 
had taught them to speak English pretty well ; and 
all the children they had, which were near twenty 
in all, were taught to speak English too, from their 
first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it 
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There 
were none of those chtidren above six years old 
when I came thither ; for it was not much above 
seven years that they had fetched these five savage 
ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitfiil, 
for they had all children, more or less : I think the 
cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child ; and 
the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed.

Englishmen, I must say something of the Spaniards, 
who were the main body of the family, and in 
whose story there are some incidents also remark- 
able enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about 
their circumstances when they were among the sa- 
vages ; they told me readily, that they had no in- 
stances to give of their application W ingenuity in 



^ THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that country; that they were a poor, miserable, 
dejected handful of people; that if means had been 
put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned 
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the 
weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of 
nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and 
very sensible man, told me he was convinced they 
were in the wrong ; that it was not the part of wise 
men to give up themselves to their misery, but al- 
ways to take hold of the helps which reason ofifer- 
ed, as well for present support, as for future deli- 
verance ; he told me that grief was the.most sense- 
less insignificant passion in the world, for that it re- 
garded only things past, which were generally im- 
possible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had 
no view to things to come, and had no share in any 
thing that looked like deliverance, but rather added 
to the affliction than proposed a remedy ; and upon 
this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which though 
I cannot repeat in just the same words that he 
spoke it, yet I remember I made it into an English 
proverb of my own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled. 

Is to haye your trouble doubled* 

He then ran on in remarks upon all the little 
improvements I had made in my solitude ; my un- 
wearied application, as he called it, and how I bad 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ST 

made a condition^ which, in its circumstances, was 
at first much worse than theirs, a thousand times 
more happy than theirs was, even now when they 
were all together. He told me it was remarkable 
that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in 
their distress than any people that ever he met 
with; that their unhappy nation, and the Portu* 
guese, were the worst men in the world to struggle 
with misfortunes ; for that their first step in dan-* 
gers^ after common ef&rts iare over, was always to 
despair, lie down under it and die, without rousing 
their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine difiered exceed- 
ingly ; that they were cast upon the shore without 
necessaries, without (supply of food, or of present 
sustenance, till they could provide it ; that it is 
tme^ I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I 
was alone ; but then the supplies I had providen- 
tially thrown into my hands, by the unexpected 
driving of the ship on shore, was such a help as 
would have encouraged any creature in the world 
to have, applied himself as I had done. " Seig- 
nior,'' says the Spaniard, " had we poor Spaniards 
been in your case, we should never have gotten 
half those things out of the ship as you did. Nay/' 
says he, '' we should never have found means to 
have gotten a raft to carry them, or to have gotten 
a raft on shore without boat or sail ; and how much 



88 THE LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

less should we have done/' said he, " if any of ns 
bad been alone \'* Well, I desired him to abate 
his coippliment, and go on with the history of their 
coming on shore, where they landed. He .told me 
they unhappily lauded at a place where there were 
people without provisions; whereas, had they had 
the common sense to have put off to sea again, and 
gone to another island a little farther, they had 
found provisions, though without people; there 
being an island that way, as they had been told, 
where there were provisions, though no people; 
that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had 
frequently been there, and filled the island with 
goats and hogs at several times, where they have 
bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and sea- 
fowls were in such plenty, that they could have 
been in no want of flesh though they had found no 
bread ; whereas here they were only sustained with 
a few roots and herbs, which they understood not, 
and which had no substance in theqa, and which 
the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough, and 
who could treat them no better unless they would 
turn cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which was the 
great dainty of the country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and 
to teach them rational customs in the ordinary way 
of living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 29 

\ipon them as unjust, that they, who came thither 
for assistance and support, should attempt to set up 
for instructors of those that gave them bread ; inti- 
mating, it seems, that mme should set up for the 
instructors of others but those who could live with- 
out them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremi- 
ties they were driven to ; how sometimes they were 
many days without any food at all, the island they 
were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages 
that lived more indolent, and for that reason were 
less supplied with the necessaries of life than they 
bad reason to believe others were in the same part 
of the world ; and yet they found that these sava- 
ges were less ravenous and voracious than those 
who had better supplies of food. 

Also they added, that they could not but see- 
with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness 
the governing providence of God directs the event 
of things in the world, which they said appeared in 
their circumstances ; for if, pressed by the hard- 
ships they were under, and the barrenness of the 
country vwhere they were, they had searched after 
a better place to live in, they had then been out of 
the way of the relief that happened to them by my 
means. 

Then they gave me an account how the savages 
whom they lived among expected them to go out 



30 TBE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

with them into their wars; aud it was true, that as 
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not 
have been serviceable only to their friends, but 
have made themselves terrible both to friends and 
enemies ; but being without powder and shot, and 
in a condition that they could not in reason deny 
to go out with their landlords to their wars ; when 
they came in the field of battle they were in a 
worse condition than the savages themselves^ ibr 
they neither had bows nor arrows, nor could they 
use those the savages gave them, so that they could 
do nothing but stand still and be wounded with ar* 
rows, till they came up to the teeth of their ene* 
my ; and then indeed the three halberts they had 
were of use to them, and they would often drive a 
whole little army before them with those halberts 
and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their 
muskets : but that for all this, they were sometimes 
surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger 
from their arrows ; till at last they found the way 
to make themselves large targets of wood, which 
they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names 
they knew not, and these covered them from the 
arrows of the savages ; that notwithstanding these, 
Ihey were sometimes in great danger, and were 
once five of them knocked down together with the 
' clubs of the savages, which was the time when one 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SI 

of them was takea prisoner, that is to say, the Spa- 
niard whom I had relieved ; that at first they thought 
he had been killed, but when afterwards they heard 
he was taken prisoner, they were under the great* 
eat grief imaginable, and would willingly have all 
vestured their lives to have rescued him. . 

They told me, that when they were so knocked 
down, the rest •f theif 'Company rescued them, and 
stood over them fighting till they were come to 
themselves, all but he who they thought had been 
dead ; and then they made their way with their 
halberts and pieces, standing close together in a 
line, through a body of above a thousand savages, 
beating down all that came in their way, got the 
victory over their enemies, but to their great sor- 
row, because it was with the loss of their friend ; 
whom the other party, finding him alive, carried 
off with some others, as I gave an account in my 
former. 

They described, most affectionately, how they 
were surprised with joy at the return of their friend 
and companion in misery, who they thought had 
been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, 
viz. by wild men; and yet how more and more 
they were surprised with the account he gave them 
of his errand, and that there was a Christian in a 
place near, much more one that was able, and had 
humanity enough to contribute to their deliverance. 



39 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

They described how they were astonished at the 
• sight of the relief I sent them> and at the appear- 
ance of loayes of breads things they had not seea 
since their coming %o that miserable place ; how 
often they crossed it, and blessed it as bread sent 
from heaven ; and what a reviving cordial it was to 
their spirits to taste it, as also of the other things I 
had sent for their supply. And, after all^ they 
would have told me something of the joy they were 
in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them 
away to the person and place from whence all 
these new comforts came ; but they told me it was 
impossible to express it by words, for their exces- 
sive joy driving them to unbecoming extravagan- 
cies, they had no way to describe them but by 
telling me that they bordered upon lunacy, having 
no way to give vent to their passion suitable to the 
sense that was upon them ; that in some it worked 
one way, and in some another ; and that some of 
them, through a surprise of joy, would burst out in- 
to tears ; others be half mad, and others immedi- 
ately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, 
and called to my mind Friday's ecstacy when he 
met his father, and the poor people*s ecstacy when 
I took them up at sea, after their ship was on fire ; 
the mate of the ship's joy when he found himself 
delivered in the place where he expected to perish ; 
and my own joy, when, after twenty-eight years 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 33 

captivity^ I found a good ship ready to carry me 
to my own country. All these things made me 
more sensible of the relation of these poor men, 
and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a. view of the state of things 
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what I 
did for these people, and the condition in which I 
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that 
they would be troubled no more with the savages ; 
or that, if they were, they would be able to cut 
them ofi^ if they were twice as many as before ; so 
that they had no concern about that Then I en- 
tered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, 
whom I called governor, about their stay in the 
island ; for as I was not come to carry any of them 
ofi^ so it would not be just to carry off some and 
leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to 
stay if their strength was diminished. 
, On the other hand I told them, I came to esta- 
blish them there, not to remove them; and then I 
let them know that I had brought with me relief of 
simdry kinds for them ; that I had been at a great 
charge to supply them with all things necessary, 
as well for their convenience as their defence ; and 
that I had such particular persons with me, as well 
to increase and recruit their number, as by the par- 
ticular necessary employments which they were 

VOL. HI. c 



»l THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those 
things in which at present they were to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thns tm 
them : and before I delivered to them the stores I 
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had 
entirely forgot and buried the first litfimoefties that 
had been among them, and could shake handis 
with one another^ and engage in a stria friendship 
and anion of interest, so that there might be no 
more misunderstandings or jealousies. 

William Atkins, with abundance of frankness 
and. good humour, said, they had met with afl9ic- 
tions enough to make them all sober, and enemies 
enough to make them all friends ; that for his part 
he would live and die with them ; and was so far 
from designing any thing against the Spaniards, 
that he owned they had done nothing to him but 
what his own bad humour made necessary, and 
what he would have done, and perhaps much worse, 
in their case ; and that he would ask them pardon, 
if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he 
had done to them ; and was very willing and de- 
sirous of living on terms of entire friendship and 
union with them ; and would do any thing that lay 
hi his power, to convince them of it : and as for 
going to England, h& cared not if he did not go 
thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said, they had indeed at first dis- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S» 

armed^ and excluded William Atkins and hia two 
countryoien, for their ill conduct, as they had let 
me know ; and they appealed to me for the nece«^ 
sity they were under to do so; but thai William 
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the greait 
fight they had with the savages, and on several oc* 
casions since, and had shewed himself so faithful 
to, and concerned for, the general interest of them 
all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and 
thought he merited as much to be trusted with 
arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any of 
them ; and that they had testified their satisfaction 
in him, by committing the command to hitn, next 
to the governor himself; and as they had an entire 
confidence in him and all his countrymen^ so tbeyi 
acknowledged they had merited thai conikltoce by- 
all the methods that honest men could merit* to be- 
valued and trusted ; and they most heartily embsa^ 
ced^the occasion of giving me this assurance,, that* 
they, would never have any interest separate from 
one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations' of friendi^

the ship's provision, with our punch-bowl, and ma- 
terials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them ten 
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English 
beer; things that neither the Spaniards nor the 
Englishmen had tasted for many years, and which, 
it may be supposed, they were exceeding glad of. . 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, 
which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were 
sent, covered up close, on board our ship to the 
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from 
on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on 
board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocent- 
ly merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, where- 
in, that there might be no dispute about dividing, 
I shewed them that there was sufficient for them 
all ; and degirid that they might all take an equal 
quantity of the goods that were for wearing; that 
is to say, equal when made up. At first, I distri- 
buted linen sufficient to make every one of theok 
four shirts; and, at the Spaniard's request, after- 
wards made them up six; these were exceeding 
comfortable to them, having been what, as I may 
say, they had long since forgot the use of, or what 
it was to wear them. 

I allotted the thin English 8ta£b, which I men- 
tioned before, to make every (me a light coat like 
a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of the

^iseason, cool and loose ; and ordered, that wheneyer 
they decayed, they should make more, as they 
thought fit The like for pumps, shoes, stockiogs, 
and hats, &c. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, 
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men 
when they saw t^e care 1 had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnished them. They told me I was 
a father to them ; and that, having such a corre- 
spondent as I was, in so remote a part of the world, 
it would make them forget that they were left in. a 
desolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged ifi 
me not to leave the place without my consent 

Then I presented to them the people I had 
]>rought with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, 
and the two carpenters^ aU of them most necessary 
people; but above all, my general artificer, than 
whom they could not name any thing that was 
more needful to ihem ; and the tailor, to shew his 
concern for them, went to work immediately, and, 
with my leave, made them every one a shirt the 
first thing he did ; and, which was still more, he 
taught the women not only how to sew 'and stitch, 
and use the needle, but made them assist to make 
the shirts for their husbands and for all the rest 

As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention 
how useful they were ; for they took i^ pieces; ^1 
my clumsy unhandy things, and made them clever 



S8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

convenieat tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, 
loekeiv, shelves, aad every thing they wanted of 
that kind. 

But to let them see how nature made artificers 
lat firet, I carried the carpenters to see William 
Atkins's: basket- hoose, as I called it, and the^y both 
ewned they never saw an instance of such natural 
ingenuity before, nor any thing so regular and so 
handily built, at least of its kind ; and one of them, 
when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning 
about to me, "I am sure,'* says he, '' that nmn 'has 
BO need of us; you need do nothing but give him 
tools.** 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, 
and gave every man a digging spade, a shovel, and 
9 rake, for we had -no harrows or ploughs ; and to 
every separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad* 
axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often as 
any were broken, or worn out, they should be sup- 
plied, without grudging, out of the general stores 
that I left behind. 

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives« 
scissars, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they 
had without tale as they required; for no man 
would care to take more than he wanted, and he 
must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on 
any account whatever. And for the use of the

My ms^BiSifiie of f>owder and 9xms wi^ich I 
bought them, was sMch* even to profusion, that 
they coujM not bqt rejoice at them ; for now they 
.could march, as I used to do, with a musket upoui

I -carried on shore with me the young man whose 
'mother was starved to death, and (the maid also : 
she was a 8ober« wciU-educated, religious young 
woman, and hehaved so inofifeosiveLy, that every 
one gave her a ^ood word. She ;had, indeed, an 
unhappy life with us, there bemg no woman in the 
ship but herself ; but she boi^e it with patience. 
After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and 
in 80 fine a way of thriving upon my island, and 
considering that they iiad neither business nor ac- 
quaintance in the 'East Indies, .or reason for taking 
80 long a voyage ; I say, iconsideciog all this, both 
of them came to me, and de»red I would give 
them leave to semain on the i^nd, and be entered 
among my family, as they called it. 

I agfiged to it readily, and they had a little plot 
>of ground allotted to them, where they had three 
tents or houses 8et up, iraarouAded with a basket*

work^ palisaded like Atkins's, and adjoining to hh 
plantation. Their tents were contrived so, thajt 
they had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, 
and a middle tent, like ^ great storehouse, to lay- 
all their goods in, and to eat and drink in. And 
now the other two Englishmen moved their habita- 
tion to the same place, and so the island was di- 
vided into three colonies, and no more ; viz. the 
Spaniards, with old Friday, and the first servants, 
at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in 
a word, the capital city, and where they had so en- 
larged and extended their works, as well under as 
on the outside of the hill, that they lived, though 
perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was 
there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I be- 
lieve, in any part of the world ; for 1 verily believe 
a thousand men might have rCtnged the island a 
month, and if they had not known there was such 
a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they would 
not have found it; for the trees stood so thick and 
so close, aifd grew so fast matted into one an- 
other, that nothing but cutting them down first, 
could discover the place, except the two narrow 
entrances where they went in and out, could be 
found, which was not very easy. One of them was 
just down at the water's edge, on the side of the 
creek ; and it was afterwards above two hundred 
yards to the place ; and the other was up the lad- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

Her at twice^ as I have already formerly described 
It; and they had a large wood, thick planted, also 
<m the top of the hill, which contained above an 
acre, which grew apace, and corered the place frem 
all discovery there, with only one narrow place be» 
tween two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enr 
ter on that side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where 
there were four fanulies of Englishmen, I mean 
those I had left there, with their wi^es and chil- 
dren ; three savages that were slaves ; the widow 
and children of the Englishman that was killed.; 
the young man and the maid ; and (by the wayj 
we made a wife of her also before we went away* 
There were also the two carpenters and the tailor, 
whom I brought with me ftt them ; also the smith, 
who was a very accessary man to them, especially 
as the gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and 
my other man, whom I caUed Jack of all Trader 
who was himself as good almost as twenty men, 
for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but a 
very merry fellow; and before I went away, we 
married him to the honest maid that came with 
the youth in the ship, whom I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me n*- 
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastic, 
that 1 had brought with me out of the ship's crew 
whom I took at sea. It is triie^ this iQaQi was a ^

of a man,, wbom, before I begin, i must (to set hioi

1o bis tiisadTantage in tbe account of Protestants ; 
as, first, ObsA; he was a Papist ; seoondly^ a Popish 
priest ; and thirdly, a French Popish priest. 

Bat jiastice demands of me to give him a dae 
•oharacter ; and I must say he was a grave, sober^ 
pioaSk and most religious person ; exact in his \\fy, 
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost 
•every thing he 4lid. What then can one say 
Against my being very sensible of the value of 
•euCh a man, notwithstauding his profession ? though 
it may %e my opinion, perhaps as weli as the opi* 
■nion of others who shall read this, that he was mis- 
taken. 

The iirst hour ^at I began to converse with him^ 
after he had agreed to go with me to the East In* 
dies, I found: reason to ileligbt exceedingly in bis 
conversation ; and he ^st began with me about re- 
ligion, in the most obliging manner imaginable. 

« Sir," says he, « you have not only, under God/* 
(and at that he crossed his tMeasI) ** saved my life, 
but you have admitted me to go this voyage in 
your ship, and by your obliging civility have taken 
me into your family, giving me an opportunity of 
free conversation. Now, Sir/' «ays he, ^ you see 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4:1 

/bj my habit what my profession is, and I guess by 
your nation what yonn is. I may think it is my 
'duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost en- 
deavours on all occasions' to bring all the souls that 
1 can to the knowledge of the truth, and to em- 
brace the Catholic doctrine ; but as I am here un- 
der your permission, and in your family, I am 
bound, in justice to your kindness, as well as in de^ 
cency and good manners^ to be under your govern- 
ment; and therefore I shall not, without your leave, 
enter into any debates on the points of religion, in 
iwhicfa we may not agree, farther than you shall 
•give me leave.'' 

I lold him, -his carriage was so modest that I 
•CMwldnot but acknowledge it; that it was true, we 
(were such people as they call heretics, 'but that ^he 
was not the fitst Catholic Chat I hadoonveraed widi 
without falling into any inconveniences, or carry- 
ing the questions to any height in debate ; that he 
•should not find himself the^irorse used for being of 
« different opinion from us ; and if we did not con- 
Terse without any dislike on either side, upon that 
score, it would be his fault, not ours. 

He replied, that he thought our conversation 
might be easily separated frdm disputes ; that it 
was not his business to cap principles with every 
man he discoursed with ; and that he rather dest- 
ined me to converse with him w 9l gciuUman than as 



44 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

a religicwc; that if I would give him leave at any 
.time to discourse upon religious subjects^ he wouM 
.readily comply with it; and that then he did not 
doubt but I would allow him also to defend his own 
opinions as well as he could ; but that without my 
leave he would not break in upon me with any sQcfa 
thing. 

He told me farther^ that he would not cease to 
do all that became him in his office as a priest, as 
well as a private Christian, to procure the good of 
the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; aad 
though perhaps we would not join with him, and he 
could not pray with us, he hoped he might pra}** 
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In 
this manner we conversed ; and as he was of a most 
obliging gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, if I 
may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, 
. aud, ask J believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his lif<$, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of 
many advenlares which had befallen him in the 
few years that he had been abroad in the world, 
and particularly this was very remarkable, vi^. 
that during the voyage he was now engaged in, he 
had the misfortune to be five times shipped and un- 
shipped, and never to go to the place whither any 
of the ships he was in were at first designed : that 
:)^iA fillet int^oit was jto hs^ve gone to Marti^icQ, and

that he went on board a ship bound thtther at St> 
Maloes ; but being forced into Lisbon in bad wesb- 
ther« the ship received some damage by running 
aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was* 
obliged to unload her cargo there : that finding a 
Portuguese ship there^ bound to the Madeiras, and^ 
ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet 
with a vessel there bound to Martinico, he went on 
board in order to sail to the Madeiras; but the 
master of the Portuguese ship being but an indif- 
ferent mariner, had been out in his reckoning, and 
they drove to Fyal ; where, however, he happened 
to find a very good market for his cargo, which 
was com, and therefore resolved not to go to the 
Madeiras, but to load salt at the isle of May, to go 
away to Newfoundland. He had no remedy in the 
exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty 
good voyage as far as the Banks (so they call the 
place where they catch the fish), where, meeting 
with a French ship bound from France to Quebec, 
in the river of Canada, and from'4hence to Mar« 
tinico, to carry provisions, he thought he should 
have an opportunity to complete his first design. 
But when he came to Quebec, the master of the 
^ip died, and the ship proceeded no farther. Sty 
the next voyage he shipped himself for France, m^ 
ihe ship that was burnt when we took them up at

lAdies, as I have already saicL Thus he had been/ 
disappointed ia five voyages^ alU as I may call it* 
ia one voyage, besides^ whata I shall have occasiotti 
tpmeniioQ farther of the same persoo. 

But I shall not make digresMons into other men^at 
stories* W'hich have no relation, to. my own« I re^ 
torDtto what ooooerns our afiair in> the isiand. He: 
came to me one morning, for he lodged among urn 
all the while we were upon the island, and it hap** 
pened to be just when Lwas going to yisit tha? 
Boglishmeu'a colony at the farthest part of the' 
island; l- sa^ he came to me, aad told me with a^ 
very grave eountenance, that he had for two on 
three days desired* an opportunity of some discouna 
with me, which he hoped would not be di^leasing 
to me, because he thought it mi^t, in some nie»* 
sure, correspond with my general design, which' 
was the prosperity of ray newcotony, and perhaps 
might put it,. at least more than he yet thought it 
. was, in the way of God's blessing. 

' I looked a little surprised at the last part of hise 
discourse^ and turning a little short, " How,.Siiv'' 
said I, '^ can it be said that we are not in the way 
of God's blessing; after such risible asst8tances>3ad:

heard me^ you would have found no room to have 
been displeased, much leas to think so hard of me, 
that I should sug^st, that you have aot had won- 
derful asMStances and deliverances ; and I hope, on 
yo«r behalf, that you are in the way QJt' God's 
blessing, and your demgn is exceeding good, and 
will prosper. But, Sir,*' said he, '^ though it were 
more so than is even possible to you, yet there may 
be some among you that are not equally right io 
their actions ; and you know that in the story of 
Israel, one AGhaa» in the campy removed God's 
bkasing from them, and turned his hand so against 
them, that thirty-six of them, though not concern** 
ed in the crimen were the objects of divine veil" 
geance, and bore the weight of that punishment/' 
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and 
told him his inference was so just, and the whole 
design seemed so sincere, and was really so religu* 
ous in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had 
interrupted him, and begged him to go on ; and in 
the meantime, because it seemed that what we had 
both to say might take up some time, I told him I 
fvas going to the Englishmen's plantation, and ask* 
ed him to go with me, and we might discourse of 
« it by the way. He told me he would more willing'- 
ly wait on me thither, because there, partly, the 
thing was acted which he desired to speak to me 



48 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

aboat So we walked on, and I pressed him to he 
free and plain with me in what he had to say. 

** Why then. Sir/* says he, « be pleased to give 
ipe leave to lay down a few propositions as the 
foundation of what I have to say, that we may not 
differ in the general principles, though we may be 
of some differing opinions in the practice of parti- 
culars.. First, Sir, though we differ in some of the 
doctrinal articles of religion, (and it is very unhappy 
that it is so, especially in the case before us, as I 
shall shew afterwards,) yet there are some general 
principles in which we both agree ; viz. first, that 
there is a God, and that this God, having given us 
some stated general rules for our service and obe- 
dience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to 
oflfend him, either by neglecting to do what he has 
commanded, or by doing what he has expressly 
forbidden ; and let our different religions be what 
they will, this general principle is readily owned 
by us all, that the blessing of God does not ordina- 
rily follow a presumptuous sinning against his com- 
mand ; and every good Christian will be affection- 
ately concerned to prevent any that are under his 
care, living in a total neglect of God and his com- 
mands. It is not your men being Protestants, 
whatever my opinion may be of such, that dis- 
charges me from being concerned for their souls^ 
and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that 

2 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

they shoald lire in as little distance from^ and en* 
mity with their Maker as possible; especially if 
you give me leave to meddle so far in your cir- 
cuiU'* 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at^ and 
told him I granted all he had said; and thanked him 
that he would so far concern himself for us ; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of what 
he had observed, that, like Joshua (to take his own 
parable,) I might put away the accursed tiling from 
us. 

'* Why then. Sir,'* says he, " I will take the li- 
berty you give me; and there are three things 
which, if I am right, must stand in the way of 
God's blessing upon your endeavours here, and 
which I should rejoice, for your sake, and their 
own, to see removed. And, Sir,'' says he, '' I pro- 
mise myself that you will fully agree with me in 
them all as soon as I name them ; especially be- 
cause I shall convince you that every one of them 
may with great ease, and very much to your satis- 
faction, be remedied." 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civili- 
ties, but went on : ** First, Sir," says he, '' you have 
here four Englishmen, who have fetched women 
from among the savages, and have taken them as 
their wives, and have had many children by them 
all, and yet are not married to them afler any sta- 

VOU 111, D 



50 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ted legal manner^ as the laws of God and man re* 
quire ; and therefore are yet, in the sense of both, 
no less than adnlterers, and living in adultery. To 
this. Sir/' says he, " I know you will object, that 
there was no clergyman or priest of any kind, or of 
any profession, to perform the ceremony ; nor any 
pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of 
marriage, and have it signed between them. And 
I know also. Sir, what the Spaniard governor has 
told you ; I mean of the agreement that he obliged 
them to make when they took these women, viz. 
that they should choose them out by consent, and 
keep separately to them ; which, by the way, is 
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the wo- 
men as wives, but only an agreement among them- 
selves, to keep them from quarrelling. 

" But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament of ma- 
trimony (so he called it, being a Roman) consists 
not only in the mutual consent of the parties to 
take one another as man and wife, but in the for- 
mal and legal obligation that there is in the con- 
tract to compel the man and woman at all times to 
own and acknowledge each other; obliging the 
man to abstain from all other women, to engage in 
no other contract while these subsist ; and on all 
occasions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for 
them and their children ; and to oblige the women 

8 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 

to the same^ or like conditions, mutatis mutandis^ on 
their sid6. 

" Now, Sir/' says he, ** these men may, when 
they please, or when occasion presents, abandon 
these women, disown their children, leave them to 
perish, and take other women and marry them 
whilst these are living/' And here he added, with 
some warmth, " How, Sir, is God* honoured in this 
unlawful liberty ? And how shall a blessing suc- 
ceed your endeavours in this place, however good 
in themselves, and however sincere in your design, 
while these men, who at present are your subjects, 
under your absolute government and dominion, are 
allowed by you to live in open adultery ?" 

I confess I was struck at the thing itseli> but 
much more with the convincing arguments he sup- 
ported it with. For it was certainly true, that 
though they had no clergyman on the spot, yet a 
formal contract on both sides, made before wit- 
nesses, and confirmed by any token which they had 
all agreed to be bound by, though it had been but 
the breaking a stick between them, engaging the 
men to own these women for their wives upon all 
occasions, and never to abandon them or their chil- 
dren, and the women to the same with their hus- 
bands, had been an effectual lawful marriage in the 
sight of God; and it was a great neglect that it was 
not done* 



58 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Bat t thought to have gotten off with my young 
priest by telling him, that all that part was done 
when I was not here ; and they had lived so many 
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was 
past remedy, they could do nothing in it now. 

" Sir,*' says he, " asking your pardon for such 
freedom, you are right in this ; that it being done 
in your absence,* you could not be charged with 
that part of the crime. But I beseech you, flatter 
not yourself that you are not therefore under an 
obligation to do your uttermost now to put an end 
to it. How can you think, but that, let the tim^ 
past lie on whom it will, all the guilt for the future 
will lie entirely upon you ? Because it is certainly 
in your power now to put an end to it* and in no- 
tody's power but yours." 

I was so dull still, that I did not take him right, 
but I imagined that, by putting an end to it, he 
meant that I should part them, and not suflfer them 
to live together any longer; and I said to him I 
could not do that by any means, for that it would 
put the whole island in confusion. He. seemed sur- 
prised that i should so far mistake him. '' Noj 
Sir," says he, *' I do not mean that you should se- 
parate them, but legally and ei&ctually marry them 
now. And, Sir, as my way of marrying may not 
be so easy to reconcile them to# though it will be 
as effectual even by your own laws; so your way 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 53 

inay be as well before God, and as Valid among 
men; I mean by a written contract signed by both 
man and woman^ and by all the witnesses present; 
which all the laws of Europe would decree to be 
valid," 

I was amazed to tee so much true piety, and so 
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar- 
tiality in his discourse, as to his own party or church, 
and such a true warmth for the preserving people 
that he had no knowledge of, or relation to ; I say, 
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of 
God ; the like of which I had indeed not met with 
any where. But recollecting what he had said of 
marrying them by a written contract, which I knew 
would stand too, I returned it back upon him, and 
told him I granted all that he had said to be just, 
and on his part very kind ; that I would discoiurse 
with the men upon the point now when I came to 
them. And I knew no reason why they should 
scruple to let him marry them all ; which I knew 
well enough would be granted to be as authentic 
and valid in England as if they were married by 
one of our own clergymen. What was afterwards 
done in this matter, I shall speak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the se- 
cond complaint which he had to make, acknow- 
ledging I was very much his debtor for the first, 
and thanked him heaitily for it. He told me he 



M TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

would use the same freedom and plainness in the 
second* and hoped 1 would take it as well ; and 
this was, that, notwithstanding these English sub* 
jects of mine, as he called them, had lived with 
these women for almost seven years, and had taught 
them to speak English, and even to read it, and 
that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable 
understanding, and capable of instruction; yet 
they had not to this hour taught them any thing of 
the Christian religion ; no not so much as to know 
that there was a God, or a worship, or in what 
n^anner God was to be served ; or that their own 
idolatry, and worshipping they knew not who, was 
false and absurd. 

This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and 
what God would certainly call them to an account 
for ; and, perhaps, at last take the work out of their 
hands. He spoke this very afiectionately and 
warmly. '' I am persuaded,'' says he, *' had those 
men lived iu the savage country whence their 
wives came, the savages would have taken more 
pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and to 
worship the devil, than any of these men, so far as 
I can see, has taken with them to teach them the 
knowledge of the true God. " Now, Sir,'' said he, 
^ though I do not acknowledge your religion, or 
you mine, yet we should be all glad to see the de- 
vil's servants, and the subjects of his kingdom* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. K> 

taught to know the general principles of the Cbris- 
tiaii seligion ; that they might at least hear of God, 
and of a Redeemer, and of the resarrection, and of 
a future state, things which we all believe; they 
had at least been so much nearer coming into the 
bosom of the true church, than they are now in the 
public profession of idolatry and devil-worship.'' 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, 
and embraced him with an excess of passion.— 
" How far,'' said I to him, ** have I been from un- 
derstanding the most essential part of a Christian, 
viz. to love the interest of the Christian church, 
and the good of other men's souls ! I scarce have 
known what belongs to being a Christian." — '' O 
Sir, do not say so," replied he ; *' this thing is not 
your fault"—" No," said I; " but why did I never 
lay it to heart as well as you ?"— '' It is not too late 
yet," said he; ''be not too forward to condemn 
yourself." — '* But what can be done now ?" said I; 
" you see I am going away."— ^' Will you give 
me leave," said he, " to talk with these poor men 
about it ?"-*'' Yes, with all my heart," said I, " and 
I will oblige them to give heed to what you say 
too."—" As to that," said he, " we must leave 
them to the mercy of Christ; but it is our business 
to assist them, encourage (hem, and instruct them ; 
and if you will give me leave, and Grod his blessing, 
I do not doubt hut the poor ignorant souls shall be

brought home into the great circle of Christianity, 
if not into the particular faith that we all embrace; 
and that even while you stay here/' Upon this I 
said, " I shall not only give you leave, but give 
you a thousand thanks for it." What followed oa 
this account, I shall mention also again in its place. 
I now pressed him for the third article in which 
we were to blame. " Why, really," says he, '* it 
is of the same nature, and I will proceed (asking 
your leave) with the same plainness as before ; it is 
about your poor savages yonder, who are, as I may 
say> your conquered subjects. It is a maxim. Sir, 
that is, or ought to be, received among all Chris- 
tians, of what church, or pretended church soever, 
viz. that Christian knowledge ought to be propa^ 
gated by all possible means, and on all possible oc- 
casions. It is on this principle that our church 
sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China; 
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, wil- 
lingly engage in the most hazardous voyage, and 
the most dangerous residence among murderers and 
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the 
true God, and to bring them over to embrace the 
Christian faith. Now, Sir, you have an opportu- 
nity here to have six or seven-and-thirty poor sa- 
vages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge 
of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder 
how you can pass by such an occasion of doing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

goodf which is really worth the expense of a maa's 
whole life." 

I was now struck dumb indeed^ and had not one 
word to say ; I had here a spirit of true Christian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- 
cular principles^ be of what kind soeyer. As for 
me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of 
this in my heart before, and I believe should not 
have thought of it ; for I looked upon these sava-* 
ges as slaves, and people whom, had we any work 
for them to do, we would have used as such, or 
would have been glad to have transported them to 
any other part of the world ; for our business was 
to get rid of them, and we would all have been sa^ 
ttsfiedt'if they had been sent to any country, so 
they had never seen their own. But to the case : 
I say I was confounded at his discourse, and knew 
not what answer to make him. He looked ear* 
nestly at me, seeing me in some disorder; ** Sir,'' 
said he, ** I shall be very sorry, if what I have said 
gives you any offence,'* — " No, no," said I, « I am 
offended with nobody but myself; but I am per- 
fectly confounded, not only to think that I should 
never take any notice of this before, but with re- 
flecting what notice I am able to take of it now. 
You know. Sir," said I, /' what circumstances I 
am in ; I am bound to the East Indies, in a ship 
freighted by merchants, and to whom it would h%

sa tosiiSeraUe piece of injustice to detain their ship 
here, the men lying all this while at yictuaU and 
wages upon the owners' account. It is tme, I 
agreed to he allowed twelve days here, and if I 
stay more I must pay S/. sterling per diem demur- 
rage ; nor can I stay upon demurrage ahove eight 
days more, and I have been here thirteen days al- 
ready ; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in 
this work, unless I would sufifer myself to be left 
behind here again ; in which case, if this single 
ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I 
should be just in the same condition that I was left 
in here at first, and from which I have been so 
wonderfully delivered." 

He owned the case was very hmxA upon nie as 
to my voyage, but laid it home upon my con- 
science, whether the blessing of saving seven-and 
thirty souls was not worth my venturing all I had 
in the world for ? I was not so sensible of that as 
he was, and I returned upon him thus : " Why, 
Sir» it is a valuable thing ind«*ed to be an instru- 
ment in God's hand to convert seven-and*thirty 
heathens to the knowledge of Christ ; but as you 
are an. ecclesiastic, and are given over to that work, 
so that it seems naturally to fall into the way of 
your profession, how is it then that you do not ra- 
ther offer yourself to undertake it, than press me 
to it V' 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. &9 

' tJpon this he faced about;, just before me, as be 
walked along, and putting me to a full stop, made 
me a very low bow : " I most heartily thank God, 
and you. Sir/' says he, " for giving me so evident 
a call to so blessed a work ; and if you think your- 
self discharged from it, and desire me to under- 
take it, I will most readily do it* and think it a 
happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of 
such a broken disappointed voyage as I have met 
with, that I have dropped at last into so glorious a 
work." 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while 
he spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, 
his face glowed, and his colour came and went as 
if he had been falling into fits ; in a word, he was 
fired with the joy of being embarked in such a 
work. I paused a considerable while before I could 
tell what to say to him, for I was really surprised 
to find a man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried 
out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not 
of his profession only, but even of any profession 
whatsoever. But after I had considered it awhile, 
I asked him seriously if he was in eamesl^ and 
that he would venture, on the single consideration 
of an attempt on those poor pec^le, to be locked 
up in an unplanted island for perhaps his life, and 
at last might not know whether he should be able 
lo do them any good or not? 



60 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I 
called a venture ? *' Pray, Sir/' said he, " what do 
you think I consented to go in your ship to the 
East Indies for ?'*— -« Nay,'' said I, « that I know- 
not, unless it was to preach to the Indians. "•i— 
^ Doubtless it was," said he ; '' and do you think 
if I can convert these seven-and-thirty men to the 
&ith of Christ, it is not worth my time, though I 
should never be fetched off the island again ? Nay, 
is it not infinitely of more worth to save so nnuiy 
souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of 
the same profession ? Yes, Sir," says he, *' I would 
give Christ and the Blessed Virgin thanks all my 
days, if I could be made the least happy instrument 
of saving the souls of these poor men, though I 
was never to set my foot off this island, or see my 
native country any more. But since you will 
honour me," says he, '' with putting me into this 
work ( for which I will pray for you all the days 
of my life,) I have one humble petition to you," 
said he, « besides."— « What is that?" said I. 
" Why," says he, " it is, that you will leave your 
man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, 
and to assist me ; for without some help I cannot 
speak to them, or they to me." 

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, 
because I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reasons. He had been the compa- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOS. 61 

nion of my trayels; he was not only &ithfal to 
me, bat sincerely afifectionate to the last degree; 
and I had resolved to do something considerable 
for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he 
would. Then I knew that as I had bred Friday up 
to be a Protestant, it would quite confound him to 
bring him to embrace another profession; and he 
would never, while his eyes were open, believe that 
his old master was a heretic, and would be damned; 
and this might in the end ruin the poor fellow's 
principles, and so turn him back again to his first 
idolatry. 

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this 
strait, and it was this : I told him I could not say 
that I was willing to part with Friday on any ac« 
count whatever; though a work that to him was of 
more value than his life, ought to me to be of 
much more value than the keeping or parting with 
a servant. But on the other hand, I was persuaded 
that Friday would by no means consent to part with 
me ; and then to force him to it without his con- 
sent would be manifest injustice, because I had 
promised I would never put him away, and he had 
promised and engaged to me that he would never 
leave me unless I put him away. 

He seemed very much concerned at it; for he 
had no rational access to these poor people, seeing 
he did not understand one word of their language, 
nor they one word of his. To remove this diffi« 



«« THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

calty> I told him Fridaj^s father had learnt Spa* 
nisb» which I found he also understood, and he 
fhould serve him for an interpreter; so he was 
much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade 
him but he would stay to endeavour to convert 
them; but Providence gave another and very hap- 
py turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objec- 
tions. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent 
for them all together ; and after some accounts given 
them of what I had done for them, viz. what ne- 
cessary things I had provided for them, and how 
they were distributed, which they were sensible oi^ 
and very thankfiil for ; I began to talk to them of 
the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full 
account of the notice the clergyman had already 
taken of it ; and arguing how unchristian and ir- 
religious a life it was, I first asked them if they 
were married men or bachelors ? They soon ex* 
plained their condition to me, and shewed me that 
two of them were widowers, and the other three 
were single men or bachelors. I asked them with 
what conscience they could take these women, and 
lie with them as they had done, call them their 
wives, and have so many children by them, and not 
be married lawfully to them ? 

They all gave me the answer that I expected, 
vi«. that there was nobody to marry them; that 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6S 

they agreed before the governor to keep them as 
their wives ; and to keep them and own them as 
their wives; and they thought, as things stood 
with them, they were as legally married as if they 
had been married by a parson, and with all the 
formalities in the world. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in 
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience 
to keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of 
men being otherwise, they might pretend they 
were not married, and so desert the poor women 
and children hereafter; and that their wives being 
poor, desolate women, friendless and moneyless, 
would have no way to help themselves : I therefore 
told them, that unless I was assured of their ho- 
nest intent, I could do nothing for them; but 
would take care that what I did should be for the 
women and children without them ; and that un** 
less they would give some assurances that they 
would marry the women, I could not think it was 
convenient they should continue together as man 
and wife ; for that it was both scandalous to men - 
and ofiensive to God, who they could not think 
would bless them, if they went on thus. 

All this passed as I expected ; and they told me, 
especially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak 
for the rest, that they loved their wives as well as 
if they had been born in their own native countr}% 



64 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and would not leave them upon any account what- 
ever ; and they did verily believe their wives were 
as virtuous and as modest, and did to the utmost 
of their skill as much for them and for their chil- 
dren as any women could possibly do, and they 
would not part with them on any account: and 
Will Atkins for his own particular added, if any 
man would take him away, and ofifer to carry him 
home to England, and to make him captain of the 
best man of war in the navy, he would not go with 
him if he might not carry his wife and children 
with him ; and if there was a clergyman in' the 
ship, he would be married to her now with all his 
heart. 

This was just as I would have it. The priest 
was not with me at that moment, but was not far 
ofH So, to try him farther, I told him I had a cler- 
gyman with me, and if he was sincere I would have 
him married the next morning, and bade him con- 
sider of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for 
himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he was 
, very ready to do it, aad was glad I had a minister 
with me; and he believed they would be all willing 
also. I then told him that my friend the minister 
was a Frenchman, and could not speak English, 
but that I would act the clerk between them. He 
never so much as asked me whether he was a P^ 
pist or Protestant, which was indeed what I was 



Of BOBINSON CRUSOE. Oft 

afVaid of. But I say they never inquired about it. 
Sawe parted; I went back to my clergyman, and 
Will Atkins went in to talk with his companions. 
I desired the French gentleman not to say any 
thing to them till the business was thorough ripe» 
and 1 told him what answer the men had given me. 
Before I went from their quarter, they allcame 
to me, and told me, they had been considering 
what I had said ; that they were very glad to hear 
I had a clergyman in my company ; and they were 
very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, 
and to be formally married as soon as I pleased ; 
for they were iar from desiring to part from their 
wives ; and that they meant nothing but what was 
very honest when they chose them. So I appoint- 
ed them to meet me the next morning, and that in 
the mean time they should let their wives know 
the meaning of the marriage law; and that.it was 
not only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige 
them that they should not forsake them whatever 
might happen. 

The women were easily made sensibleof the mean- 
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with 
it, as indeed they had reason to be ; so they failed 
not to attend all together at my apartment next 
morning, where I brought out my clergyman : and 
though he had not on a minister's gown, after the

maimer of England, or the habirof a priest, after 
the maimer of France ; yet having a black yesi, 
something like a cassock, with a sash round it;, he 
did not look very unlike a minister; and as for his 
language I was interpreter. 

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, 
and the scniple he made of marrying the women 
because they were not baptized, and professed 
Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for 
his person ; and there was no need, after that, to 
inquire whether he was a. clergyman or no. 

Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been 
carried so far as that he would not have married 
them at all : nay, notwithstanding all I was able 
to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly, 
yet very steadily ; and at last refused absolutely to 
marry them, unless he 'had first talked with the 
men and the women too ; and though at first I 
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to 
it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of his 
design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that 

I had acquainted him with their circumstances, and 

with the present design ; that he was very willing 

to perform that part of his function, and marry 

them as I had desired; but that before he could 

do it he must take the liberty to talk with them. 

He told them that in the sight of all different men, 

3 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 67 

and in the sense of the laws of society, they had 
lived all this while in an open adultery ; and that 
it was true that nothing but the consenting to mar- 
ry, or efifectually separating them from one another 
now, could put an end to it; but there was a diffi- 
culty in it too, with respect to the laws of Christian 
matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, 
viz. that of marrying one that is a professed Chris- 
tian, to a savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one 
that is not baptized ; and yet that he did not see 
that there was time left for it to endeavour to per- 
suade the women to be baptized, or to profess the 
name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard 
nothing of, and without which they could not be 
baptized. 

He^told them he doubted they were but indiffe- 
rent Christians themselves; that they had but little 
knowledge of God or his ways, and /therefore he 
could not expect that they had said much to their 
wives on that head yet; but that unless they would 
promise him to use their endeavours with their 
wives to persuade them to become Christians, and 
would» as well as they could, instruct them in the 
knowledge and belief of God that made them, and 
to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, lie 
could not marry them; for he would have no 
hand in joining Christians with savages ; nor was 
it consistent with the principles of the Christian re-

ligion, and was indeed expiiessly forbidden in 
God's law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I deli- 
vered it very faithfully to them from his mouth, as 
near his own words as I could, only sometimes ad- 
ding something of my own, to convince them how 
just it was, and how I was of his mind : and I ak 
ways very faithfully distinguished between what I 
said from myself> and what were the clergyman's 
words. They told me, it was very true what the 
gentleman had said, that they were but very indif- 
ferent Christians themselves, and that they had ne- 
ver talked to their wives about religion.—'' Lprd^ 
Sir/' says Will Atkins, " how should we teach 
them religion ? Why, we know nothing ourselves ; 
and besides. Sir," said he, " should we go to talk 
to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven and 
hell, it would be to make them laugh at us, and 
ask us what we believe ourselves ? and if we should 
tell them we believe all the things that we speak 
of to them, such as of good people going to hea- 
ven, and wicked people to the devil, they would 
ask us, where we intended to go ourselves who be- 
lieve all this, and yet are such wicked fellows, as 
we indeed are : why. Sir," said Will, " 'tis enough 
to give them a surfeit of religion, at first hearing : 
folks must have some religion themselves before 
they pretend to teach other people,"— " Will At-.

kins/' said I to him, «' though I am afraid what 
yoa say has too much truth in it, yet can you not 
tell your wife that she is in the wrong ? that there 
is a God, and a religion better than her own ; that 
her gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor 
speak; that there is a great Being that made all 
things, and that can destroy all that he has made ; 
that he rewards the good, and punishes the bad; 
that we are to be judged by him, at last, for all we 
do here ? You are not so ignorant but even nature 
itself will te^ch you that all this is true ; and I am 
satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it 
yourself/' 

«' That's true. Sir," said Atkins; ** but with 
what face can I say any thing to my wife of all 
this, when she will tell me immediately it cannot 
be true ?" 

'' Not true !" said I ; *\ what do yoa mean by 
that ?"— » Why, Sir," said he, '« she will tell me it 
cannot be true, that this God (I shall tell her of) 
can be just, or can punish or reward, since I am 
not punished and sent to the devil, that have been 
such a wicked creature as she knows I have been, 
even to her, and to every body else ; and that I 
should be suffered to live, that have been always 
acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good, 
and to what I ought to have done." 

" Why truly, Atkins/' said I, '' I am afraid thou 



70 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

speakest too roach truth ;" and with that I let the 
clergyman know what Atkins had said, for he was 
impatient to know. '* O !" said the priest, ?" tell 
him there is one thing will make him the best mi* 
fiister in the world to his wife, and that is repent* 
ance; for none teach repentance like true penitents. 
He wants liOthing but to repent, and then he will 
be«oitkuch the bet^r qualified to instruct his wife; 
he will then be able to tell her, that there is not 
only a God, and that he is the just rewaider of good 
and evil ; but that he is a merciful Being, and, with 
infinite goodness and long-sufiering, forbears to pu- 
nish those that offend ; waiting to be gracious, and 
willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he 
should return and live ; that he often suffers wick- 
ed men to go on a long time, and even reserves 
damnation to the general day of retribution : that 
it is a clear evidence of God, and of a future state, 
that righteous men receive not their reward, or 
wicked men their punishment, till they come into 
another world ; ai^d this will lead him to teach his 
wife the doctrine of the resurrection, and of the last 
judgment : let him but repent for himself, he 
will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his 
wife.'' 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very 
serious all the while, and who, we could easily per- 
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it : 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

when being eager» and hardly soffering me to make 
an end — " I knew all this, master/' says he, " and 
a great deal more ; but I han't the impudence 
to talk thus to my wife, when God and my own 
conscience knows^ and my wife will be an un- 
deniable evidence against me, that I have lived 
as if I had never hbard of Crod, or a future state, 
or any thing about it; and to talk of my repent* 
ing, alas ! (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, 
and I could see that tears stood in his eyes,) 'tis 
past all that with me." — ^* Past it, Atkins !" said 
I; " what dost thou mean by that ?">—'' I know 
well enough what I mean. Sir/' says he ;" I mean 
it is too late ; and that is too true." 

I told my clergyman word for word what he 
said. The poor zealous priest (I must call him 
90 ; for, be his opinion what it will, he had certain- 
ly a most singular affection for the good of other 
men's souls; and it would be hard to think he had 
not the like fer his own)— I say, this zealous, afiec* 
tionate man could not refrain tears also : but re- 
covering himself, he said to me, '^Ask him but one 
question : Is he easy that it is too late, or i^ he 
troubled, and wishes it were not so ?" I put the 
question fairly to Atkins ; and he answered with a 
great dealof passion, '* How could any man be 
easy in a condition that certainly must end in eter 
nal destruction? That he was far from being easy; 



41 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

but that, on the contrary, he belieTed it would one 
time or the other ruin him.'' 

** What do you mean by that?'' said I.— « 
** Why/' he said, '' he believed he should, one time 
or another, cut his own throat, to put an end to the 
terror of it." \ 

The ciergyman shook his head, with a great 
concern in his face,* when I toki^himall this; but 
turning quick to me upon it, said, '* If that be his 
case, you may assure him it is not too late ; Christ 
will give him repentance. But pray," says he, 
'< explain this to him, that as no man is saved but 
by Christ, and the merit of his passion, procuring 
divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for 
any man to receive mercy } Does he think he is 
able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine 
mercy \ Pray tell him, there may be a time when 
provoked mercy will* no longer strive, and when 
God may refuse to hear ; but that 'tis never too 
late for men to ask mercy ; and we that are Christ's 
servants are commanded to preach mercy at all 
times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those 
that sincerely repent : so that 'tis never too late 
to repent." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with 
great earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned 
oiF the discourse to the rest ; for he said to me 
he would go and have some talk with his wife : so 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7S 

be went out awhile, and we talked to the rest. I 
perceiyed they were all stupidly ignorant as to 
matters of religion ; much as I was when I went 
zambling away from my father; and yet that there 
were none- of them backward to hear what had 
been said ; and all of them seriously promised 
that they would talk with their wives about it> and 
do their endeavour to persuade them to turn Chris- 
tians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported 
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good 
while ; but at last shaking his head, " We that are 
Christ's servants/' says he, " can go no farther than 
to exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, sub- 
mit to the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis 
all we can do ; we are bound to accept their good 
words ; but believe me. Sir," said he, " whatever 
you may have known of the life of that man you 
call William Atkins, I believe he is the only sin- 
cere convert among them ; I take that man to be 
a true penitent. I won't despair of the rest; but 
that maa is perfectly struck with the sense of his 
past iHe ; and I doubt not but when he comes to 
talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself ef- 
fectually into it ; for attempting to teach others is 
sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. I 
knew a man," added he, " who, having nothing but 
a summary notion of religion himself, and being 



74 , THB LIFE AND ADVENl^URES 

wicked and profligate to the last degree in his life^ 
made a thorough reformation in himself by labour- 
ing to conYert a Jew : and if that poor Atkins be- 
gins but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his 
wife, my life for it he talks himself into a thorough 
convert, makes himself a penitent ; and who knows 
what may follow?'' 

Upon this discourse, however, aild their promi- 
sing as aboye to endeavour to persuade their wives 
to embrace Christianity, he married the other three 
couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet 
come in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile^ 
was curious to know where Atkins was gone ; and 
turning to me, says he, " I entreat you. Sir, let us 
walk out of your lab3rrinth here and look ; I dare 
say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other 
talking seriously with his wife, and teaching her 
already something of religion/' I began to be of 
the same mind ; so we went out together, and I 
carried him a^way which none knew but myself, 
and where the trees were so thick set, as that it was 
not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and 
far harder to see in than to see out ; when, coming 
to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins, and his taw* 
ny savage wife, sitting under tlK shade of a bush. 
Very eager in discourse. I stopped short till my 
clergyman came up to roe, and then having shew- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

ed him where they were, we stood and looked very 
steadily at them a good while. 

We observed him very earnest with her, point- 
ing up to the sun, and to every quarter of the hea- 
vens ; then down to the earth> then out to the sea, 
then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the 
trees. '* Now,** says my clergyman, *' you see my 
words are made good; the man preaches to her; 
mark him ; now he is telling her that our God has 
made him, and her, and the heavens, the earth, the 
sea, the woods, the trees, &c.'' *' I believe he is,'' 
said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkins 
start up upon his feet, fall down upon his knees^ 
and lift up both his hands ; we supposed he said 
something, but we could not hear him; it was too far 
oflPfor that : he did not continue kneeling half a mi* 
nute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and 
talks to her again. We perceived then the woman 
very attentive, but whether she said any thing or 
no we could not tell. While the poor fellow was 
upon his knees, I could see the tears run plentifully 
down my clergyman's cheeks ; and I could hardly 
forbear myself; but it was a great affliction Ho us 
both, that we were not near enough to hear any 
thing that passed between them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear 
of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an end 
of this piece of still conversation, and it spoke low) 



76 TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

enough to us without the help of voice. He sat 
down again, as I have said, close by her, and talk- 
ed again earnestly to her, and two or three times 
we could see him embrace her passionately ; aiv 
other time we saw him take out his handkerchief 
and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a 
kind of transport very unusual ; and after several 
of these things, we saw him on a sudden jump up 
again and lend her his hand to help her up, when 
immediately leading her by the hand a step or 
two, they both kneeled down together, and conti- 
nued so about two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out- 
aloud, " St Paul, St Paul, behold he prayeth!"— I 
was afraid Atkins would hear him ; thereibre I en- 
treated him to withhold himself a while, that we 
might see an end of the scene, which to roe, I must 
confess, was the most afiecting, and yet the most 
agreeable, that ever I saw in my life. Well, he 
strove with himself, and contained himself for a 
while, but was in such raptures of joy to think that 
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, 
that he was not able to contain himself. He wept 
several times; then throwing up his hands, and 
crossing his breast, said over several things ejacu- 
latory, and by way of giving God thanks for so 
miraculous a testimony of the success of our endea- 
Tours : some he spoke softly, and I could not well 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. TT 

hear; others audibly; some in Latin> some in 
French ; then two or three times the tears of joy- 
would interrupt him, that he could not speak at alL 
But I begged that he would compose himself, and 
let us more narrowly and fully observe what was 
before us, which he did for a time, and the scene 
was not ended there yet; for after the poor roan 
and his wife were risen again from their knees, we 
observed he stood talking still eagerly to her ; and 
we observed by her motion that she was greatly 
affected with what he said, by her frequent liding 
up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and 
such other postures as usually express the greatest 
seriousness and attention. This continued about 
half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked 
away too ; so that we could see no more of them 
in that situation. 

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; 
and first I told hhn, I was glad to see the particu- 
lars we had both been witnesses to ; that though I 
was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I 
began to think it was all very sincere here, both ia 
the man and his wife, however ignorant they both 
might be ; atid I hoped such a beginning would 
have yet a more happy end : *' And who knbwib'' 
said I, " but these two may in time, by iustructioa 
and example, work upon some of the others ?": — 
" Some of them !'' said he, turning quick upon me. 



18 THE LIFE AND ADYENTIJRES 

^ ay^ upon ail of tbem : depend upon it,^ if thoae 
two savages (for he has been but litUe better as yoa 
relate it) should embrace Jesus Christy they will 
never Icoire till they work upon all the rest ; for 
tiua religion is naturally coromunioetive^ and he 
that is once made a Christian will never leave a 
Pagan behind him» if he can help it'' I owned it 
was a most Christian principle to think so, and a 
testimony of a true zeal, as well as a generous heart 
in him. ** But, my friend/' said I, ** will you give 
me liberty to start one difficulty here ? I cannot tell 
how to object the least thing against that afiection- 
ate concern which you shew for the turning the 
poor people from their Paganism to the Christtaa 
legion ; hut how does this comfort you, while 
these people are, in your account* out of the pale 
of the Catholic church, without which, you be- 
Keve, there is no salvation; so that you esteem 
'these but heretics still; and, for other reasons^ as 
effectually lost as the Pagans themselves ?'* 

To this he answered, with abundance of candour 
and Christian chanty, thus : " Sir, I am a Catho- 
lic of the Roman church, and a priest of the order 
of St Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of 
the Roman faith. But yet, if you will believe me« 
and this I do not speak in compliment to you, or 
in .respect to my circumstances and your civilities ; 
I say, nevertheless, I do not look upon you, wh^ 



OF AOBINSQN CRUSOE. 19 

call younelres reformed, without some charity : I 
dare not say, thoagh I know it ift oar opinion in 
general, yet I dare not say, that you cannot be sa- 
ved ; I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ;, 
so far as to think that he cannot receive you into 
the bosom of his church, in a manner to us imper* 
ceivable, and which it is impossible for us to know; 
and I hope you have the same charity for us. I 
pray daily for your being all restored to Christ's 
church, by whatsoever methods he, who is alUwise, 
ia pleased to direct In the mean time, sure you 
will allow it to consist with me, as a Roman, to dii^ 
tinguish far between a Protestant and a Pagan; 
between him that caUs on Jesus Christ, though in 
a way which I do not think is according to the 
true faith; and a savage, a barbarian, that knows 
no God, no Christ no Redeemer at all; and if you 
are not within the pale of the Catholic church, we 
hope you are nearer being restored to it than those 
that know nothing at all of God or bis church. I 
rejoice, therefore, when I see this poor man, who, 
you say, has been a profligate, and almost a mur- 
derer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we 
suppose he did, though not fully enlightened ; be- 
lieving that 9od* from whom every such work pro- 
ceeds, will sensibly touch his heart and bring him 
to the further knowledge of the truth in his own 
time ; and if God shall influence this poor man to 



go THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

convert and instract the ignorant savage^ his wife, 
I can never believe that he shall be cast away him- 
self; and have I not reason then to rejoice, the 
nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christy 
though they may not be broug^ht quite home into 
"the bosom of the Catholic church, just at the time 
when I may desire it ; leaving it to the goodness 
of Christ to perfect his work in his own time, and 
his own way } Certainly I would rejoice ii all the 
savages in America were brought, like this poor 
woman, to pray to God, though they were to be all 
Protestants at first, rather than they should con- 
tinue pagans and heathens ; firmly believing^ that 
He, who had bestowed that first light upon them, 
would farther illuminate them with a beam of his 
heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of 
his church, when he should see good.''

1 WAS astonished at the sincerity and temper of this

curred to my thoughts^ that if such a temper was

whatever church or particular profession we joined

work us all up into right principles; and, in a word, 
as he thought that the like charity would make us 
all Catholics, so I told him, I believed, had all the 
members of his church the like moderation, they

88 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

would soon be all Protestants ; and there we left 
that party for we never disputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way; and, ta- 
king him by the hand, *' My friend/' said I, '' X 
wish all the clergy of the Roman church were 
blessed with such moderation, and an equal share 
of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion; 
but I must tell you, that if you should preach such 
doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would put you into 
the Inquisition/' 

*' It may be so,'' said he ; '' I know not what 
they might do in Spain and Italy ; but I will not 
say they would be the better Christians for that se- 
verity; for I am sure there is no heresy in too 
much charity." 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, 
our btuiiness there was over ; so we went back our 
own way; and when we came back we found them 
waiting to be called in. Observing this, I asked 
my clergyman, if we should discover to him that 
we had seen him under the bush, or no ; and it was 
his opinion we should not ; but that we should talk 
to him first, and hear what he would s£iy to us : so 
we called him in alone, nobody being in the place 
but ourselves ; and I began with him thus : 

" Will Atkins," said I, « pr'ylhee what educa- 
tion had you ? What was your father ?"

^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 

W. A. A better mdn than ever I shall be. Sir; 
my father was a clergyman: 

A. C, What education did he give yoa ? 

W. A, He would haye taught me well. Sir ; but 
I despised all education, instruction, or correction, 
like a beast as t was. 

R. C, It is true, Solomon says, *' He that despi- 
seth reproof is brutish/' 

W, A, Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed ; I murdered 
my father : for God's sake. Sir, talk no niore about 
that. Sir; t murdered my poor father. 

Priest. Ha ! a murderer ? 

[ Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word 
as he spoXe it), and looked pale : it seems he belie- 
ved that iVill had really killed his own fother.] 

, R. C. No, no. Sir, I do not understand him so. 
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill 
your father, did you, with your own hands ? 

W, A. Nd, Sir; I did not cUt his throat; but I 
cut the thread of all his coDdforts, and shortened 
his days ; I broke his heart by the most ungrate- 
ful, unnatural return, for the most tender, affection- 
ate treatment that ever father gave, or child could 
receive. 

R, C Well, I did not ask you about your father 
to extort this confession ; I pray God give you re- 
pentance for it, and forgive you that and all your 
other sins: but I asked you, because I see that. 



g4 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

thoagh yoa have not mach learning, yet you arc 
not so ignorant as some are in things that are good; 
that you have known more of religion a great deal, 
than you have practised. 

W. A, Though you. Sir, did not extort the con- 
fession that I make ahout my father, conscience 
does ; and whenever we come to look back upon 
our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are 
certainly the first that touch us; the wounds they 
make lie deepest; and the weight they leave will 
lie heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we can 
commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for 
me, Atkins ; I cannot bear it 

W.A. You bear it, master! I dare say you 
know nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, 
I may say every tree in this island, is witness to 
the anguish of my soul for my ingratitude, and 
base usage of a good tender father ; a fathdr much 
like yours by your description; and I murdered 
my father as well as you. Will Atkins; but think> 
for all that, my repentance is short of yours too, 
by a great deal. 

|[I would have said more, if I could have restrained my 
pa&sions ; but I thought this poor man^s repentance 
was so much sincerer than mine, that I was going to 
leave off the discourse and retire ; for I was surprised 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

with what he said, and thought, that, instead of my 
goio^ about to teach and instruct him, the man was 
made a teacher and instructor to me, in a most sur- 
prising and unexpected manner.] 

I laid all this before the young clergymaD, who 
was greatly affected with it, and said to me, '' Did 
I not say. Sir, that when this man was converted, 
he would preach to us all ? I tell you. Sir, if this 
one man be made a true penitent, here will be no 
need of me, he will make Christians of all in the 
island/' But having a little composed myself, I 
renewed my discourse with Will Atkins. 

" But, WilV said I, " how comes the sense of 
this matter to touch you just now ?'' 

W» A, Sir, you have set me about a work that 
has struck a dart through my very soul ; I have 
been talking about God and religion to my wife, in 
ordeo as you directed me, to make a Christian of 
her ; and she has preached such a sermon to me as 
I shall never forget while I live. 

R, C. No, no; it is not your wife has preached 
to you; but when you were. moving religious ar- 
guments to her, conscience has |lung them back 
upon you. 

IV, A, Ay, Sir, with such a force as is not to be 
resisted. 

K C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be- 
tween you and your wife ; for I know something of 
it already. 



80 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac- 
count of it : I am too full to hold it, and yet have 
no tongue to express it : but let her have said what 
she will, and though I cannot give you an account 
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to 
amend and reform my lifet 

R. C. But tell us some of it How did you be- 
gin, Will ? for this has been an extraordinary case, 
tfiat is certain ; she has preached a sermon indeed, 
if she has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our 
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were 
that men and women were obliged to enter into 
such compacts, as it was neither in the power of 
one or other to break ; that otherwise, order and 
justice Qould not be maintained, and men would 
run from their wives, and abandon their children, 
mix confusedly with one another, and neither fa- 
milies be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by 
a legal descent 

jR. C. You talk like a civilian. Will. Could you 
make her understand what you meant by inheri- 
tance and families? They know no such thing 
among the savages, but marry any how, without 
any regard to relation, consanguinity, or family ; 
brother and sister, nay, as I have been told, even 
the father and daughter, and the son and the mo- 
ther. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

W* A» I believe^ Sir, you are misinfonned; piy 
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they ab- 
hor it Perhaps for any further relations they may 
not be so exact as we are ; but she tells me they 
never touch one another, in the near relations you 
speak of. 

R, C. Well, what did she say to what you told 
her? 

W. A. She said she liked it very well ; and it 
vras much better than in her country. 

R. C But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A, Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I 
asked her, if she would be married to me our way ? 
She asked me, what way that was ? I told her mar- 
riage was appointed of God ; and here we had a 
strange talk together indeed, as ever man and wife 
had, I believe. 

[ N. B. This dialogQe between W. Atkins and his wife, 
as I too^ it doiprn In writing just after be told it me, 
was as follows :] 

Wife, Appointed by your Grod ! Why, have you 
a God in your country ? 

W* A. Yes, my dear, God is in eyery country. 

Wife. No your Grod in my country ; my coun- 
try have the great old Benamuckee God. 

W, A, Child, I am very unfit to shew you ^ho 
God is ; God is in heaven, and made the heaven 
and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. 



S8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Wife. No makee de earth; no you God makee 
de eaiUi ; no makee my country. 

[ W. A. laughed a little at her expre«ion of God not 
making her country.] 

Wife* No laugh : why laugh me ? This no ting 
to laugh. 

[He was justly reproved by his wifo, for she was ipore 
serious than he at first.] 

W. A, That's true, indeed ; I will not laugh any 
more, my dear. 

Wife, Why you say, you God make all ? 

W. A. Yes, child;, our God made the whole 
world, and you, and me, and all things ; for he is 
the only true God ; there is no God but he ; he 
lives for ever in heaven. 

Wife, Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true, indeed ; but I have been a 
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac- 
quaint thee with any Uiing before, but have lived 
without God in the world myself. 

Wife, What have you de great God in your 
country, you no know him ? No say O to him ? No 
do good ting for him ? That no possible ! 

W. A. It is too true though, for all that : we live 
as if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no 
power on earth. 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 8» 

Wife. But why God let yoa do so ? Why he no 
makee you good lire ? 

W, A. It is all oar own fault. 

Wife. But you say me he is great, much great, 
have much great power ; can make kill when he will : 
why he no makee kill when you no serve him ? no 
say O to him ? no be good mans ? 

W. A, That is true ; he mi^ht strike me dea<l 
and I ought to expect it ; for I have been a wick- 
ed wretch, that is true : but God is merciful, and 
does not deal with us as we deserve. 

Wife. But then do not you tell God tankee for 
that too? 

W* A, No, indeed ; I have not thanked God for 
his mercy, any more than I have feared God for 
his power. 

Wife. Then you God no Grod ; me no tink, be* 
lieve he be such one, great much power, strong; 
no makee kill you, though you makee him much 
angry? 

W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you 
from believing in God ! What a dreadful creature 
am I ! And what a sad truth is it, that the horrid 
lives of Christians hinder the conversion of hea* 
thens ! 

Wife. How me tink you have great much God 
up t^iere (she points up to heaven), and yet no do 
well, no do good ting ? Can he tell? Sure he no tell 
what you do. 



90 THE UFK AND ADVBNTURBS 

W. A* Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; 
he hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what 
we think, though we do not speak. 

JVifs. What! he no hear yon swear, curse, 
speak the great damn?> 

W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it alL 

Wife. Where be then the muchee great power 
strong? 

JV. A, He is merciful ; that is all we can say for 
it; and this proves him to be the true God: he is 
God, and not man ; and therefore we are not con- 
sumed. 

[^Here Will Atkios told us he was stinck with horror, 
to think how he coald tell his wife so clearly that 
God sees, and hears, and knows the secret thoughts of 
the heart, and all that we do ; and yet that he had 
dared to do all the Tile things he iiad done.] 

Wife. Merciful ! what you call dat ? 

W. A. He is our father and maker ; and he pities 
and spares us. 

Wife. So then he never makee kill, never angry 
when you do wicked ; then he no good himself, or 
no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear ; he is infinitely good, 
and infinitely great, and able to punish too; and 
sometimes, to shew his justice and vengeance, he 
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners, and make ex- 
amples ; many are cut off in their sins. 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

Wife, Bat no makee kill you yet ; then he tell 
yoa, may he, that he no makee you kill, so you 
make de bargain with him, you do bad ting, he no 
be angry at you, when he be angry at other mans? 

W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions 
upon his goodness ; and he would be infinitely just 
if he destroyed me, as he has done other men. 

Wife, Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead i 
What yoQ say to him for that ? You no tell him 
tankee for all that too ! 

W. A, I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that 
is true. 

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better? 
You say he makee you. 

W. A, He made me, as he made all the world; 
'tis I have deformed myself, and abused his good* 
ness, and have made myself an abominable wretch. 

Wife. I wish you makee God know me; I no 
makee him angry ; I no do bad wicked ting. 

[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunic within htm, to 
hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to 
know God, and he such a wicked wretch that he 
could not say one word to her about God, but what 
the reproach of his own carriage would make most 
irrational to her to belie?e $ nay, that already she 
could not believe in God, because he that was so 
wicked was not destroyed.] 

• W. A, My dear, you mean, you wish I could 



9t THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

teach you to know God, hot God to know yon, for 
he knows you already, and every thoaght in your 
heart 

Wife, Why then he know what I say to you 
now ; he know me wish to know him ; how shall 
me know who makee me ? 

W. A, Poor creature, he must teach thee, I can- 
not teach thee; I'll pray to him teach thee to 
know him; and to forgive me, that I am unworthy 
to teach thee. 

[Tbe poor fellow was io such an agony at her desiring 
him to ma](e her know God, and her wishing to know 
him, that he said he fell down on his knees before 
her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with 
tbe saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon 
his sins, and accept of his being the unworthy instru- 
ment of instructing her in the principles of religion ; 
after which he sat down by her again, and tlieir dia- 
logue went on.] 

N. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel down 
and lift \ip his hands. 

JFife. What you put down the knee for ? What 
you hold up the hand for ? What you say ? Wha 
you speak to? What is that? 

/^- ^- ^'y ^ear, I bow my knees in token of my 
submission to Him that made me: I said O to him, 
as you call It, and an you say your old men do to 
their Idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him. 



\ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

Wife. What you say O to him for ? 

W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and 
your understanding, that you may know him> and 
be accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too } 
> W. A, Yes, he can ; he can do all things. 

Wtfe, But he no hear what you say ? 

W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him ; and 
promised to hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray ! When he bid you ? How 
he bid you ? What you hear him speak ? 

W. A, No, we do not hear him speak ; but he 
has revealed himself many ways to us. 

[Here he was at a great loss to mak^ her understand 
that God had revealed himself to us by his word ; and 
what his word was $ but at last he told it her thus :] 

W, A. God has spoken to some good men in 
former da3's, even from heaven, by plain words ; 
and God has inspired good men by his spirit; and 
they have written all his laws down in a book. 
Wife, Me no understand that : where is book ? ' 
W. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this 
book ; but I hope t shall, one time or other, get it 
for you to read it. 

£Here he embraced her with great affection; but with 
inexpressible grief, that he had not a Bible.] 



94 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Wife. But how you makee me know that God 
teachee them to write that book ? 

W. A. By the same rule that we know him to 
be God. 

Wife, What rule ? what way you know ? 

W. A. Because he teaches and commands no- 
thing but what is good^ righteous, and holy, and 
tends to make us perfectly good, as well as per- 
fectly happy ; and because he forbids, and com- 
mands us to avoid, all that is wicked, that is evil in 
itself, or evil in its consequences. 

Wife, That me would understand, that me ftiin 
see ; if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked 
thing, he teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked 
thing, he makee all thing, he give all thing; he 
hear me when I say O to him, as you go to do just 
now; he makee me good if I wish be good; he 
spare me, no makee kill me when I no be good ; 
all this you say he do : yes, he be great God ; me 
take, think, believe him be great God; me say 
O to him too with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man said he could forbear no 
longer; but, raising her up, made her kneel by 
him ; and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her 
in the knowledge of himself by his Spirit; and 
that, by some good providence, if possible, she 
might some time or other come to have, a Bible, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

that khe might read the w6rd of God« and he taught 
by hiih to know him. 

[This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the 
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.] 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after 
this, too long to set down here ; and particularly 
shis ihade him promise, that, si dee he confessed his 
own life had been a wicked, abominable course of 
proYOcation against God, he would reform it, and 
not make God angry any more, lest he should 
make him dead, as she called it, and then she 
should be left alone, and neyer be taught to know 
thi^ God bbtt^r ; and lest he should be miserable. 
Its he had told her wicked men should be after 
death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting 
to as both, but particularly the young clergyman : 
he was indeed wonderfully surprised with it ; but 
under the greatest affliction imaginable that he 
could not talk to her; that he could not speak £ng« 
lish to make her understand him ; and as she spoke 
but very broken English, he could not understand 
her. However, he turned himself to me, and told 
me, that he believed there must be more to do with 
this woman than to marry her. I did not under- 
stand him at first, but at length he explained him* 
self, viz. that she ought to be baptized. 



96 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was 
for going about it presently : '* No, no ; hold. Sir/* 
said he; '' though I would have her baptized by 
all means, yet I must observe, that Will Atkins, 
her husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonder* 
ful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious 
life ; and has given her just ideas of the being of a 
God, of his power, justice, and mercy; yet I desire 
to know of him, if he has said any thing to her of 
Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the 
nature of faith in him, and the redemption by him ; 
of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the last judg- 
ment, and a future state/' 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but 
the poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told 
us he had said something to her of all those things, 
but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and 
his own conscience so reproached him with his hor- 
rid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the appre- 
hensions, that her knowledge of him should lessen 
the attention she should give to those things, and 
make her rather contemn religion than receive it : 
but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so 
disposed to receive due impressions of all those 
things, that, if I would but discourse with her, she 
would make it appear to my satisfaction, that my 
labour would not be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself 

at 



OF ROBINSON CRjUSOE. 07 

as interpreter between my religious priest and the 
woman/ I entreated him to begin with her. But 
sure such a seitnbn was never preached by a po« 
pish priest in these latter iages of the world ; and^ 
as I told him; I thought he had all the zeal, all the 
knowledge^ all the sincerity of a Christian, without 
the errors of a Roman Catholic ; and that I took 
hini to be' such a clergyman as the Roman bishop;i 
were, before the church of Rome assumed spiritual 
sovereignty over the consciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to em- 
brace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption 
by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, 
as she did the first notions of a God, but with joy 
and faithy with an affection, and a surprising de- 
gree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much 
less to be expressed ; and at her own request she 
was baptized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I en- 
treated him, that he would perform that office with 
some caution, that the man might not perceive he 
was of the Roman church, if possible; because of 
other ill consequences which might attend a differ- 
ence among us in that very religion which we were 
instructing the other in. .He told me, that as he 
had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for 
the office, I should see he would do it in a manner

Will Atkins, and in a very a&ctionate manner ex-

position he was in, but to support the convictions 
that were upon him by a resolution- to reform his 
life; tokl-him it was in vain to say he repented> if 
he did not forsake his crimes; represented to him,

Christian religion ; and that he should be carefid

he did, he would see the headien a better Chrisi- 
tian than himself; the savage converted, and the 

htstruQient cast away !

He said a great many good things to them both* 
luid then recommended tbem> ia a few words^ tQ 
God's goodness ; gave them the benediction againf^ 
I repeating every thing to them in English: and 
tfaftts ended the ceremony. I think it was the most 
plea3ant« agreeable day to me that ever I passed 
in my whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thought|( 
hung contiaually upon the conversion of the thirty'- 
seven savages^ and fain he would have staid uppn 
the island to have undertaken it : but I convinced 
bim« firstj that his undertaking was impratcticable 
in itself; and secondly, that, perhaps^ I could put 
it into a way of being done in his absence, to his 
satisfactiou ; of which by and by« 

Having thus brought the a!!air of the island to a 
narrow cotnpass, I was preparing to go on bos^rd 
the ship, when the young man, whom I had taken 
out of the famished ship's company, came to me, 
and told me, be understood I bad a clergyman 
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to 
be married to the savages whom they called wives; 
that he had a match too, which he desired might 
be finished before I went, between two Christians^ 
which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was 
his mother^s servant, for there was no other Cbriis* 
lian woman on the island. So 1 began to persuade 



758804 



100 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

him not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or be- 
cause he found himself in this solitary circimistance. 
I represented that he had some considerable sub* 
stance in the world, and good friends, as I under* 
stood by himself, and by his maid also ; that the 
maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was un- 
equal to him, she being twenty-six or twenty-seven 
years old, afnd he not above seventeen or eighteen; 
that he might very probably, with my assistance, 
make a remove from this wilderness, and come in- 
to his own country again, and that then it would be 
a thousand to one but he would repent his choice, 
and the dislike of that circumstance might be dis- 
advantageous to both. I was going to say more, 
but he interrupted me, smiling; and told me, with 
a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my 
guesses; that he had nothing of that kind in his 
thoughts, his present circumstances being melan-< 
choly and disconsolate enough, and he was very 
glad to hear that I had some thoughts of putting 
them in a way to see their own country again ; 
and that nothing should have set him upon staying 
there, but that the voyage I was going was so ex- 
ceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him 
quite out of the reach of all his friends ; that he had 
nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle 
him in some little property of the island where he 
was; give him a servant or two, and some few ne- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 101 

•essaries, and he would settle himself here like a 
planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I re- 
turned to England, I would redeem him, and ho- 
ped I would not be unmindful of him when I came 
to England ; that he would give me some letters to 
his friends in London, to let them know how good 
I had been to him, and what part of the world, and 
what circumstances I ^had left him in; and he 
promised me, that whenever I redeemed him, the 
plantation, and all the improvements he had made 
upon it, let the value be what it would, should be 
wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, consi- 
dering his youth, and was the more agreeable to 
me, because he told me positively the match was 
uot for himself. I gave him all possible assurances, 
that, if I lived to come safe to England, I would 
deliver his letters, and do his business efifectually, 
and that he might depend I would never forget the 
circumstances I left him in. But still I was im- 
patient to know who was the person to be married; 
upon which he told me it was my Jack of all Trades 
and his maid Susan. 

I was most agreeably surprised when he named 
the match; for mdeed I had thought it very suit- 
able. The character of that man I have given 
already; and as for the maid, she was a very ho- 
nest, modest, sober, and religious young woman; 



iDfe THE LIF£ AND ADVENTURES 

had a very good share of sense; was agreeable 
enough in her person; spoke tery handsomely, 
and to the purpose ; always with decency and good 
manners^ and not badcward to speak when any 
thing required it» or ioapertinently forward to speak 
when it was not her business; very handy and 
housewifely in any ttdng that was before her; aa 
^cellent manager, and fit indeed to have been 
governess to the whole island ; she knew very well 
how to behave herself to all kind of folks she had 
about her> and to better if she had found any there. 

The match being proposed in ^is manner, we 
married them the same day : and as I was father 
at the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I 
gave her a portion'; for I appointed her and her 
. husband a handsome large space of ground for 
their plantation ; and indeed this match, and the 
prpposal the young gentleman made to me, to give 
him a small property in the island, put me upon 
parcelling it out among them, that they might ndt 
quarrel afterwards about their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a most sober, 
grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, ex- 
ceeding pious and religious, and, as far as I may 
be allowed tto "speak positively in such a case, I 
verily believe was a true sincere penitent.

He divided things so justly^ and so nmch lo 
•Tory -one's satisiactioB, that they only desired one 
genwal Dvritmg under my hand for the whole, 
which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and 
sealed to theni> setting out the bounds and situa^ 
tion of every man's plantation, and testifying that 
I gave them thereby, severally, a right to Uie 
whole possession and inheritance of the respective 
plantations 4>r ferms, with their improvements, to 
them and their heirs; reserving all the rest of the 
island as my own property, and ascertain rent fer 
every partaoolar phmtation after eleven years, if I or 
any one from me, or in my name, -came to demand 
it» producing an attested copy of the same writing*

rales than ttey^vere able to give themselves; only

pared to 4eave them. 

One thing 1 mast not omit, and that is/ that 
being now eettled in a Icind of commonwealth

enough in doing sometimes, they had no manjier

of bosioess or property to manage:. I proposed 
therefore to the governor Spaniard, that he should 
go to them with Friday's father, and propose to 
them to remove, and either plant for themselves^ 
or take, them into their several families as servants 
to be maintained for their labour, but without 
being absolute slaves; for 1 would not admit them 
to make them slaves by force by any means, be- 
cause they had their liberty given by capitulation, 
and as it were articles of surrender, which they 
ought not to break. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and 
came all very cheerfully along with him ; so we al- 
lotted them land and plantations, which. three or 
four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be em- 
ployed as servants in the several families we had 
settled; and thus my colony was in a manner 
settled as follows: The Spaniards possessed my 
original habitation, which was the capital cit}^ and 
extended their plantation all along the side of the 
brook which made the creek that I have so often 
described, as far as my bower; and as they in- 
creased their culture, it went always eastward. The 
English lived in the north^-east part, where Will 
Atkios and his comrades began, and came on 
^southward and south-west^ towards the back part 
of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great 
a^ditipn of land to take in^ if they found occasiosii

80 that they need not jostle one another for want 
of room. 

All the west end of the island was left uninha* 
bited, that, if any of the savages should come on 
shore there, only for their usual customary barba« 
rities, they might come and go; if they disturbed 
nobody, nobody would disturb them ; and no doubt 
but they were often ashore, and went away agaiq^ 
for I never heard that the planters were eyer at* 
packed and disturbed any more. '

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted 
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con- 
verting the say ages might perhaps be set on foot 
in his absence to his satisfaction ; and I told him 
that now I thought it was put in a fair way ; for 
the savages being thus divided among the Chris- 
tians, if they would but every one of them do their 
part with those which came under their hands, I 
hoped it might hsMre a very good effect. 

He agreed presentlyin that ; ** if/* said he, '* they 
will do their part ; but how,''«says he, ** shall we ob- 
tain that of them }" I told htm we would call them 
all together, and leave it in charge with them, or

go to them one by one, which he thought best; so 
we dmded it— he to speak to the Spaniards, who 
were all Papists, and I to the English, who were 
all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly 
to them, and made them promise thaf^they would 
never make any distinction of Papist or Protestant 
in their exhorting the savages to torn Christians, 
but leach them the general knowledge of the true 
God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they 
likewise promised us that they would never Jbave 
any diiTerences or disputes one with another about 
teligion. 

When I came to Will Atkins's house, (I may 
call it so, for such a house, or such a piece of 
basket-work, I believe was not standing in the 
world again !) I say, when I came thither, I found 
the young woman I have mentioned above, and 
William Atkins's wife, were become intimates; and 
this prudent and religious young woman had per- 
fected the work Will Atkins had begun; and 
though it was not above four days after what I 
have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman 
was made such a Christian as I have seldom heard 
of any like her, in all my observation or conversa*- 
lion in the world.* 

Jt came next into my mind in the morning, be- 
fore I went to them, that among all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, I had not left a 



108 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Bible, in which I shewed myself less coDsideriag 
for them than ray good friend the widow was for 
me, when she sent me the cargo of 100/. irom 
Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a 
Prayer- book. However, the good woman's cha- 
rity had a greater extent than ever she imagined, 
for they were reserved for the comfort and instruc- 
tion of those, that made much better use of them 
than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket ; and when 
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found 
the young woman and Atkins's baptized wife had 
been discoursing of religion together (for William 
Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy.) I asked 
if they were together now ? And he said yes ; so I 
went into the house, and he with me, and we 
found them together, very earnest in discourse: 
*'0 Sir," says William Atkins, *'whcn God has 
sinners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring 
home, be never wants a messenger : my wife has 
got a new instructor— I knew I was unworthy, as I 
was incapable of that work— that young woman 
has been sent hither from Heaven-— she is enough 
to convert a whole island of savages." The young 
woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I de- 
sired her to sit still; I told her she had a good 
work upon her hands, and I hoped God would 
bless her in it. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1(» 

We talked a little^ and I did not perceive they 
had any book among them, though I did not ask, 
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out 
my Bible. " Here/' said I to Atkins, "I have 
brought you an assistant, that perhaps you had 
not before.'' The man was so confounded, that he 
was not able to speak for .some time \ but recover- 
ing himself, he takes it with both hands, and turn* 
ing. to his wife, " Here, mj dear,'* says he, " did 
not I tell you our God, though he lives above, 
could hear what we said ? Here is the book I pray- 
ed for, when you and I kneeled down under the 
bush; now God has heard us, and sent it." When 
he had said thus, the man fell in such transports 
of a passionate joy, that between the joy of having 
it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down 
his face like a child that was crying. 
. The woman was surprised, and was like to have 
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of; 
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon 
her husband's petition : it is true that providential- 
ly it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent 
sense ; but I believed it would have been no diffi- 
cult matter at that time to have persuaded the poor 
woman to have believed that an express messenger 
came from Heaven on purpose to bring that indi- 
vidual book; but it was too serious a matter to suf- 
fer any delusion to take place : so I turned to the 



110 THE LIFB AKD ADVENTURES 

young wonaoj and told her we did not deabe to 
impose upon the new convert m her ficrt and move 
ignorant understanding of things, and begged her 
to explain to her that Grod may be very properly 
said to answer our petitioni^ when in the conrse of 
his providence such thingt are in a particular man** 
ner brought to pew as we petitioned for ^ bot we do 
not expect returns from Heaven in a miraciiloQ# 
and particular manner; and that it is our mercy it 
is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards efiectual* 
ly ; so that there was, I assure you» no priestcraft 
used here; and I should have thought it one of the 
most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had 
it so : but the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is 
really not to be expressed ; and there we may be 
sure was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more 
thankful in the world for any thing of its kind than 
he was for this Bible ; and I believe never any 
man was glad of a Bible from a better principle ; 
and though he had been a most profligate creature^ 
desperate^ headstrong, outrageous^ furious, and wick* 
ed to a great degree, yet this man is a standing 
-rule to us all for the well instructing childreoi viz» 
that parents should never give over to teach and 
instruct, or ever despair of the success of their en* 
deavours, let the children be ever so obstinate, re^ 
factory, or to appearance insensible of instruction; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi. Ill 

for if ever God in his proYidence touches the con- 
sciences of sQchg the force of their education re* 
turns upon them, and the early instruction of p^b^ 
rents is not losl;^ though it msy have heen many 
years laid asleep^ but some time or other they may 
find the benefit of it 

Thus it was with this poor man. However ig* 
Dorant he was> or divested of religion and Christian 
knowledge^ he found he had some to do with now 
more ignorant than himself; and that the least 
part of the instruction of his good father^ that 
could now come to his mind, was of use to him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how 
his father used to insist much upon the inexpres* 
sible value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing 
of it to nations, families, and persons; but he ne- 
ver entertained the least notion of the worth of it 
till now, when, being to talk to heathens, savages, 
and barbarians, he wanted the help of the written 
oracle for his assistance. 

The young woman was very glad of it also fi)r 
the present occasion, though she had one, and so 
had the youth, on board our ship, among the goods 
which were not yet brought on shore. And now, 
having said so many things of this young woman, 
I cannot omit telling one story more of her and 
myself, which has something in it very informing: 
and remarkable* 



lis THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I have related to what extremity the poor'yoaii^ 
woman was reduced; how her mistress' was star-' 
ved to deaths and did die on board that unhappy 
ship we met at sea; and how the whole ship's 
company being reduced to the last extremityy the 
gentlewoman and her son> and this maid, were first 
hardly used as to proyisioos, and at last' totally 
neglected and starved; that is to say, brought to 
the^ast extremity of hunger* 

One day, being discoursing with her upon the 
extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could 
describe, by what she fdt, what it was to starve, 
and how it appeared? She tdd me she believed 
she could; and she told her tale very di^nctly 
thus : 

*' First, Sir," said she, f' we had for some days 
fared exceeding hard, and suffered very great hun- 
ger, but now at last we were wholly without food 
of any kind except sugar, and a little wine, and a 
little water. The first day after I had received no 
food at all, I found myself towards evening, first 
empty and sickish at my stomach, and nearer 
night mightily inclined to yawning, and sleepy ; I 
lay down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep, 
and slept about three hours, and awaked a litUe 
refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay 
down. After being about three hours awake, tt 
being about five o'clock in the morning, I fouofd 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE^ 1 13 

tnyBelf etanpty, aad my stomach sicki^ again, and 
lay down again, but coald not sleep at all, being 
Tery faint and ill ; and thus I continued all th« 
second day with a strange variety-*first hungry, 
then sick again, with retchings to vomit The se- 
cond night, being obliged to go to bed again with* 
out any food more than a draught of fair water, and 
being asleep, I dresuned I was at Barbadoes, and 
that the market was mightily stocked with provi« 
8ions> that I bought some for my mistress, and 
went and dined very heartily* 

'' I thought my stomach was full after this, as it 
would have been after or at a good dinner; but 
when I waked, I was exceedingly sunk. in my spurits 
to find myself in the extremity of famine ; the last 
glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar into 
it, because of its having some spirit to supply, nou- 
rishment; but there being no substance in the sto- 
mach for the digesting office to work upon, T found 
the only efjfect of the wine was to raise disagreeable 
fumes from the stomach into the head ; and I lay, 
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, 
for some time. 

" The third day in the morning, after a night of 
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and ra- 
ther dozing than sleeping^ I awaked ravenous and 
furious with hunger; and. I. question, had not my 
understanding returned and conquered it, I say,

'« Thb lasted about three hours, during which 
time I was twice raging mad as any creature in 
Bedlam, as my young master told me, and as he 
can now infoim you. 

** In one of these -fits of lunacy or distraction, 
whether by the motion of the ship or some slip of 
my foot I know no^ I fell down, and struck my 
face against the comer of a palleUbed, in which 
my mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gush- 
ed out of my nose, and the cabin-boy bringing me 
a little bason, I sat down and bled into it a great 
deal, and as llie blood ran from me I came to my- 
self and the violence of the flame or the fever I 
was in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the 
hunger. 

*' Then I grew sick, and retched to vomit; but 
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to 
bring up. After I had bled some time I swooned, 
and they all believed I was dead ; but I came to 
myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful 
pain in my stomach, not to be described, not like 
the colic, but a gnawing eager pain for ibod ; and 
towards night it went off with a kind of earnest 
wishing or longing for food, something like, as I 
'Suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I

took another draught of water witii sugar in it, but 
my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all 
xxp again ; then I took a draught of water without 
sugar, and that stayed with me, and I laid me down 
upon the bed, praying most heartily that it would 
please God to take me away ; and camposkig my 
mind in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile; and then 
waking, thought my^f dying, being light with 
Tapours frt>m an empty stomach : I recommended 
my soul to God, and earnestly wished that some- 
body would throw me into the sea. 

'' All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as 
I thought, expiring, but bore it with much more 
patience than I, and gave the last bit of bread she 
had to her child, my young master, who would not 
have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it, and I 
believe it saved his life. 

'' Towards the moi'ning I slept again, and first 
when I awaked I fell into a violent passion of cry- 
ing, and after that had a second fit of violent 
hunger, so that I got up ravenous, and in a most 
dreadful conditiott. Had my mistress been dead, 
so much as I loved her, I am certain I should have 
eaten a piece of her fiesb with as much relish, and 
"as unconcerned, as ever I did the flesh of any crea« 
ture appointed for food; and once or twice I was 
going to bite my own arm. At last I saw the ba- 
son in which was the blood I had bled at my nose

the day before; I ran to it^ and swallowed it witftr 
such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I had 
wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid 
it should be taken from me now. 

'' Though, after it was down, the thoughts of it 
filled EBB with horror, yet it checked the fit of hun- 
ger, and I drank a draught of fair water, and was 
composed and refreshed for some hours after it. 
This was the fourth day ; and thus I held it till to- 
wards night, when, within the compass of three hours, 
I had all these several circumstances over again, 
one after another, viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, 
pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick 
again, then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous, 
again, and so every quarter of an hour ; and my 
strength wasted exceedingly. At night I laid me 
down, having no comfort bat in the hope that I 
should die before morning. 

" All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger 
was now turned into a disease, and I had a terrible 
colic and griping, wind instead of food having 
found its way into my bowels ; and in this condi- 
tion I' lay till morning, when I was surprised ^ 
little with the cries and lamentations of my young- 
master, who called out to me that his mother was 
dead. I lifted myself up a little, for I had not 
strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though 
she wa» able to give very little signs of life. 



OF Q^OBI^SPN CRUSOE. 117 

^ I had then kucbconyulsions in my stomach for 
.want of some si3stenance> that I cannot describe 
them» with such frequent throes and pangs of ap- 
petite that nothing but the tortures of death can 
imitate ; and this condition 1 was in when I heard 
the seamen above cry out, ' A sail ! a sail 1' and 
halloo and jump about aa if , they were distracted. 

" I was not able to g^t off from the bed, and my 
mistress much less, and my master was so sick thajb 
I thought he bad been spiring ; so we could not 
open the cabin- door, or get any account what it 
was that occasioned such a combustion ; nor had 
we any conversation with the ship's company for' 
two days, they having told us they had not a 
mouthful of any thing to eat in the ship; and they 
told us afterwards they thou^ght we had been dead. 

"It was this dreadful condition we were in when 
you were sent to save our lives; and how you 
found nSjt Sir, you know as well as I, and better 
too." 

This was her own relation ; and is such a distinct 
account of starving to deatha as I confess I never 
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : 
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a tnie ac- 
count, because the youth gav^ me an account of a 
good part of it; though I must own not so distinct 
and 80 feelingly as his maid, and the rather because 
it seiems bis mother fed him at the price of her own

life : bat the pocr maid, tiMMigh her constkutioQ 
being stronger than that of her mistmssy who was 
in yean» and a weakly wcMuan too, she might 
struggle harder with it ; I say, the {xior maid might 
be supposed to feel the extremity som^ing soon* 
er than her mistresif, who might be allowed to keep 
the last bits soiiiething longer than she parted with 
any to relieve the maid. No question, as the case 
is here related, if our ship, or some other, had not 
so providentially met then, a few days more would 
have ended all their Utcs, unless they had preyent>- 
ed it by eating ^one another ; and even that, as 
their case stood, would have served them but a 
little while, they being five hundred leagues from 
any land, or any possibility of relief, other than in 
the miraculous manner it happened. But this is 
by the way ; . I return to my disposition of things 
among the pe<^le. 

And first, it is to be observed here, that for many 
reasons I did not think fit to let them know any 
thing of *the sloop I had framed, and which I 
thought of setting up among them ; for 1 found, at 
least at my first coming, such seeds of division 
amoiig them, that I saw it plainly, had I set up 
the sloop, and left it among them, they would, 
upon very light disgust, have separated, and gone 
away from one another; or perhaps have turned 
pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves. 



Oi^ ROBINSON 0RU6O& U9 

instead of a plMlalioil of sober SMWl religiouB 
people^ ds I ktewfed it to be-; nor did I leave the 
two pieces of brass cannoQ tlrait I hjeul on bo^rd, or 
the two quarter-deck gOB9» that my nephew tool^ 
estraordinary, for the sAme reasoo : I thought they 
had enough to qoaltfy .them for a defensive war, 
against any th»t shoukl invade (hesd ( i>ut I wa^ 
not to set them up for an ofifeosive war, or to eii*- 
courage them to go abroad to attack others, which^ 
in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction 
upon themselves and all their undertakii^s : I re* 
served the sloop, therefore, and the g^n% for theif 
service another way, as I shall observe in its place. 

I have now done with the island : I left them 
all in good circumstances, and in a fiattrishing con- 
dition, and went oh board my ship again the fifth 
day of May, having been five-and-tweoty day^^ 
among them ; and, as they were all resolved to 
stay upon the island till I came to remove them, I 
promised to send some further relief from the Bra- 
zils, iflconki possibly find an opportunity; and 
particularly I promised to send them some cattle, 
such as sheep, hogs, and cows ; for as .to the two 
covirs and calves which I brought from England, we 
had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to 
kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns 
at parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of 



IfO THE LIFE AND ADVlOmrRES 

All Saints; in the Brazils, in aboat twenty-two day*; 
meeting nothing remarkable in onr paasage iMit 
this, that abont three days affter we sailed, being 
becalmed, and the current setting strong to the N. 
N. £., running, as it were, into a bay or gnlf on the 
land-side, we were driven something out of onr 
course ; and once or twice our men cried. Land, to 
die westward ; but whether it was the continent, or 
islands, we could not teU by any means. 

%t the third day, towards evening, the sea 
smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it 
were, covered towards the land, with something 
very black, not being able to discover what it was; 
but, after some time, our chief mate going up the 
main shrouds a little way, and looking at them 
with a perspective, cried out, it was an army. I 
could not imagine what he meant by an army, and 
spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or 
some such word : ^ Nay, Sir,*' says he, ** don't be 
angry, for it is an army, and a fleet too ; for I be- 
lieve there are a thousand canoes, and you may see 
them paddle along, and they are coming towards us 
too apace, and full of men/' 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was 
my nephew, the captain ; for he had heard such 
terrible stories of them in the island, and having 
never been in those seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but said two or three time^. 



mt should aU be d0^0ured^ I must co0f«$%r ooiibi' 
dering' we were becatinedr and the oirreot mt 
sirong towards the sbore^ I liked it the wonse ; how- 
ever« I bade him not be afrdd, but bring the ship 
t^ aA aochorj as soon as we came so near as lo 
know that we miist. engage them. 

The weather qontioued calm> and they came on 
apace towards us; so I gave; orders to come to an 
anchor, and. fur) all our sails. As for the savages, 
I told them they had nothing to f<^r from them but 
fire ; and therefore thfy should get their boats ou|» 
and fasten thepa, oi^ dose by the head, and the 
other by the stern, and oian them both well» and 
wait the issue in that posture : this I did, that tl^e 
men in the boats might be ready, with sheet and 
buckets, to put out any fire these savages might enh 
deavour to fix upon the outside of the ship- 
In this posture we lay by for them, and in a 
little while they came up with us ; but never w^ 
such a- horrid $i|^t seen by Christians : my mate 
was much mistaken in his calculation of their nuni* 
' ber, I mean of a thousand canoes ; the most we 
could make of them, when they c^me up, being 
. about 126 ; aiid a great many of them too ; for 
some of them had e^teen or seventeen men in 
l^hem, some more, and the least six or seven.. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be 
#t^Qk with wonder and astoniehn^ei^ty as at a sight 



in THE UFB AND ADVBNTURBS 

which they had« doiibtleBs, neyer seen before ; nor 
Goald thej, at first, as we afterwards understood, 
know what to make of as. They came boldly up, 
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about 
to row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats, not to let them come too near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement 
with them, without our designing it; for live or six 
of their large canoes came so near our longboat, 
that our men beckoned with their hands to them to 
keep back ; which they understood very well, and 
went back; but at their retreat about 500 arrows 
came on board us from those boats ; and one of 
our men in the long-boat was very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any 
means ; but we handed down some deal boards into 
the boat» and the carpenter presently set up a kind 
of a fence, like waist boards, to cover them from the 
arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they came all up 
in a body astern of us, and pretty near ; so near that 
we could easily discern what they were, though we 
could not tell their design. I easily found they 
were some of my old friends, the same sort of sa- 
vages that I had been used to engage with; and in 
a little time more they rowed somewhat farther out 
to sea, till they came directly broadside with us, 
aud then rowed down straight upon us, till they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. ISS 

came so near^ that they coald hear uft speak. Upon 
thisj I ordered all my men to keep close^ lest they 
Bfaonld 'shoot any more arrows, and make all our 
guns ready; but being so near as to be within 
hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and 
call out aloud to them in his language, to know 
what they meant ; which accordingly he did : whe- 
ther they understood htm or not, that I know not; 
but, as soon as he had called to them, six of them, 
who were in the foremost, or nighest boat to us, 
turned their canoes from us ; and, stooping down, 
shewed us their naked backsides; just as if, in 
English (saving your presence), they had bid us 
kiss — . Whether this was a defiance or 

challenge, we knew not; or whether it was done in 
mere contempt* or a signal to the rest ; but immedi- 
ately Friday cried out, they were going to shoot ; and 
unhappily for him (poor fellow !) they let fly about 
three hundred of their arrows ; and, to my inex* 
pressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man 
being in their sighL The poor fellow was shot 
with no less than three arrows, and about three 
more fell very nigh him; such unlucky marksmen 
they were ! 

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, 
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that 
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with 
small riiot, and four with great; and gave theni 



494 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

sach a broadside as they had never had in their 
iives before, to be sure. 

They were not above half a cable's length off 
when we fired ; and our gunners took their aim so 
vreW, that three or four of their canoes were over- 
set, as we had reason to believe, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare back«>- 
sides to us, gave us no great offence ; neither did I 
know foe certain whether that, which would pasi 
for the greatest contempt among us, might be un- 
derstood so by them or not ; therefore, in return, I 
kad only resolved to have fired four or five guns 
with powder only, which 1 knew would fright them 
suJQBciently : but when they shot at us directly 
with all the fury they were capable of, and espe- 
cially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I 
80 entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so 
well deserved it ; I not only had been justified be- 
fore God and man, but would have been very glad, 
if I could, to have overset every canoe there, and 
•drowned every one of them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, or how 
many we wounded, at this broadside ; but sure such 
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a 
multitude : there were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes split, and overset in all ; and the men all 
jSet a-swimming ; the rest, frighted out of their wits, 
scoured away as fast as they could, Ukmg but little 




OF ROBTNSON CIIU90E. l^ 

card to save those whose boats were split or spoiled 
with our shot : so I suppose that they were many 
<if them lost; and our men took up one poor fellow 
swimming for hift Ufe» above an hour after they 
Were all gone. 

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill 
and wound a great many ; bat, in short, we never 
knew any thing how it went with them ; for they 
fled so fast, that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we 
could not see above three or four straggling canoes; 
nor did we ever see the rest any more ; for a breeze 
of wind springing up the same evening, we weigh-' 
ed and set sail f6r the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was 
80 8uUen> that he would neither eat nor speak ; and 
we all fancied he would starve himself to death : 
but I took a way to cure him; for I made them, 
take him and turn him into the long-boat, and make 
him believe they would toss him into the sea again,, 
and so leave him where they found him, if he would 
not speak : nor would that do, but they really did 
throw him into the sea, and came away from him; 
and then he followed them, for he swam like a 
cork, and called to them in his tongue, though they 
knew not one word of what he said. However, al 
kst, they took him in again, and then he began 
to be more tractable ; nor did I ever design they 
shpuld drown, him. 



ISG THE LIFB^ AND ADYSKTURES 

We were now under sail again ; bot I was the 
most disconsolate creature alive, for want of my 
man Friday, and would have been very glad to 
have gone back to the island, to have taken one of 
the rest from thence for my occasion ; but it could 
not be, so we went on. We had one prisoner, as 
I have sflkid; and it was a long while before we 
could make him understand any thing ; but in time, 
our men taught him some English, and he began 
to be a little tractable; afterwards we inquired 
what country he came from, but could make no- 
thing of what he said ; for his speech was so odd, 
all gutturals, and spoken in the throat, in such a 
hollow and odd manner, that we could never form 
a word from him ; and we were all of opinion that 
they might speak that language as well if they were 
gagged, as otherwise ; nor could we perceive that 
they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, 
or palate ; but formed their words just as a hunt- 
ing-horn forms a tune, with an open throat: he 
told us, however, some time after, when we had 
taught him. to speak a little English, that they were 
going, with their kings, to fight a great battle* 
When he said kings, we asked him, how many 
kings ? He said there were five nation (we could not 
make him understand the plural s), and that they 
all joined to go against two nation. We asked him. 
What made them come up to us ^ He said, ** To

makee te great wonder look''-*»Where it is to be 
obierved, that all those natives, as also those of 
Africa^ when they learn English, they always add 
two tf's at the end of the words where we use one, 
and place the accent upon the last of them ; as 
makee, takee, and the like ; and we could not break 
tbem off it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave 
it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
must take my last leave of him ; poor honest Fri- 
day ! We buried him with all decency and so- 
lemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin, and 
throwing him into the sea ; and I caused them to 
fire eleven guns for him : and so ended the life of 
the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affec- 
tionate servant that ever man had. 

We now went away with a fair wind for Brazil, 
anil, in about twelve days time, we made land in 
the latitude of five degrees south of the Line, being 
the north-easternmost land~of all that part of Ame- 
rica. We kept on S. by £. in sight of the shore 
four days, when we made the Cape St Augustine, 
and in three days came to an anchor off the Bay of 
All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, front 
whence came both my good and evil fate. 

Never did a ship come to this part that had less 
business than I had ; and yet it was with great dif- 
ficulty that we were admitted to hold the least cor- 



1Z8 THE UF£ AND ADV£NTt7KE8 

respondence on shore. Not ttiy partner himadf^ 
wko was aliye, and made a great figure among 
them, not my two merchant trustee^ nor the feme 
of my wooderinl preservation in the island, could 
obtain me that favour : but my partner remember- 
ing that I had given five hundred moidores to the 
prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and three 
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the 
monastery, and obliged the prior that then waa^ to 
go to the governor, and beg leave for me present* 
]y, with the captain, and one more, besides eight 
seamen, to come on shore, and no more ; and thi» 
upon condition absolutely capitulated for, that we 
should not offer to land any goods out of the ship, 
or to carry any person away without licence. 

They were so strict with us, as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got 
on shore three bales of English goods, such as fine 
broad*cloths, stuffs, and some linen, which I had 
brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, 
though (like me) he came from little at first ; and 
though he knew not that I had the least design of 
giving him any thing, he sent me on board a pre- 
sent of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, 
worth above thirty moidores, including some to- 
bacco, and three or four fine medals in gold. But 

I was even with him iq my present, which, as I 

12

have said, consisted of fine broad-cloth> English 
stuf]&> lace, and fine Hollands. Also, I delivered • 
him about the value of 100/. sterling, in the same 
goods, for other uses : and I obliged him to set up 
the sloop which I had brought with me from £ng* 
land, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in 
order to send the refreshments I intended to my 
plantation.

Accordingly he got hands^ and finished the sloop 
in a very few days, for she was already framed^ 
and I gave the master of her such instructions as 
he could not miss- the place ; nor did he miss it, 
as I had an account from my paitner afterwards. 
I got him soon loaded with the small cargo I had 
sent them; and one of our seamen, that had been 
on shore with me there, offered to go with the sloop,, 
and settle there, upon my letter to the governor 
Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of land 
for a plantation ; and giving him some clothes, and 
tools: for his planting work, which he said he nn-

dentood, having been an old planter in Maryland^ 
and a baccaneer into the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow^ by granting all he de^ 
sired ; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage 
whom we had taken prisoner of war, to be his 
slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give 
him his share of every thing he wanted, with the 
rest. 

When we came to fit this man oat> my old part*- 
ner told me, there was a certain very honest fellow> 
a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had fall- 
en into the displeasure of the church : '* I know not 
what the matter is with him/' sayS he, " but, on 
my conscience, I think he is a heretic in his heart ; 
and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear 
of the Inquisition ;" that he would be very glad of 
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his 
wife and two daughters; and if I would let them go 
to the island, and allot them a plantation, fa^ would 
give them a small stock to begin with ; for the o€&< 
cers of the Inquisition had seized all his efi^ts and 
Estate, and he had nothing left but a little houses 
hold stufi^ and two slaves; " and,'' adds he^ 
*' though I hate his principles, yet I would not 
have him hM into their hands, for he will assured- 
ly be burnt alive if he does." 

I granted this pesently, and joined my English- 
man witU them ; and we concealed the man, and 



133 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

bis wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the 
sloop put out to go to sea j and then (having put 
all their goods on board the sloop some time be- 
fore) we put them on bojMpd the sloop, after she was» 
got out of the bay. 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new 
partner ; and their stock, indeed, was much alike 
rich in tools, and in preparations, for a farm ; but 
nothing to begin with, but as above. However, 
they carried over with them (which was worth ail 
the rest) some materials for planting sugar-canes, 
with some plants of canes; which he (I mean the 
Portugal man) understood very welk 

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants 
in the island, I sent them, by this sloop, three milch- 
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among 
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a 
stone-horse. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go; and recom- 
mended it to them to marry them, and use them^ 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but 
I remembered that the poor persecuted man had 
two daughters, and there were but five of the Spa- 
niards that wanted; the rest had wives of their 
own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may 
easily suppose, very welcome to my old inhabi* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13S 

tants, who were now (with this addition] between 
sixty and seventy people^ besides little children; 
of which there were a great many : I found letters 
at London from them alU by way of Lisbon, when 
I came back to England, being sent back to thb 
Brazils by this sloop ; of which I shall take some 
notice in its place. 

I haye now done with my island, and all manaer 
of discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest 
of my mefnorandums, would do well to turn his 
thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read only 
of the follies of an old man, not warned by his 
own harms, much less by those of other men, to 
beware of the like ; noj cooled by almost forty 
years misery and disappointments; not satisfied 
with prosperity beyond expectation ; not made cau- 
tious by affliction and distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies^ 
than a man at fnll liberty, and haying committed 
no crime, has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and 
desire him to lock him up among the prisoners 
there, and starve him. Had I taken a smalf ves- 
sel from England, and gone directly to the island ; 
had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all 
the necessaries for the plantation, and for my 
people; took a patent from the government here, 
to have secured my property, in subjection only 
40 that of England^ which, to be sure, I might ha^e 



ISil THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

obtained ; had I carried over cannon and ammunU 
tion, servants and people to plant, and, taking pos- 
session of the place, fortified and strengthened it in 
the name of England, and increased it with people^ 
as I might easUy have done; had I then settled 
myself Uiere, and sent the ship back, loaded with 
good rice, as I might also have done in six months 
time, and ordered my friends to have fitted her out 
again for our supply; had I done this, and staid 
there myself, I had, at least, acted like a man of 
common sense : but I was possessed with a wan- 
dering spirit, scorned all advantages, pleased my- 
self with being the patron of these people I had 
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of 
haughty nuyestic way, like an old patriarchal mo- 
narch; providing for them, as if I had been father 
of the whole family, as well as of the plantation : 
but I never so much as pretended to plant in the 
name of any government or nation, or to acknow- 
ledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to 
any one nation more than another ; nay> I never so 
much as gave the place a name ; but left it as I 
found it, belonging to no man ; and the people un- 
der no discipline or government but my own; who, 
though I had an influence over them as father and 
benefactor, had no authority or power to act or 
command one way or other, farther than voluntary 
i:»»ndent pioved th^m tocofnply : yet even this, h^4 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 195 

I staid there, would have done well enough ; but as 
I rambled from them, aud came thither no more, 
the last letters I had from a^y of them, were by 
my partner's means, who afterwards sent another 
sloop to the place; and who sent me word, though 
I had not the letter till five years after it was writ- 
ten, that they went on but poorly, were malcon^ 
tent with their long stay there ; that Will Atkins 
was dead; that fiv^ of the Spaniards were come 
away ; and that though they had not been much 
molested by the savages^ yet they had had some 
skirmishes with them ; that they begged of him to 
write to me to think of the promise I had made to 
fetch them away, that they might see their own 
country again before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed, and 
they who will have any more of me, must be am* 
tent to follow me through a new variety of follies, 
hardships, and wild adventures,; wherein the justice 
of Providence may be duly observed, and we may 
see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own 
desires, make the strongest of our wishes to be our 
affliction, and punish us most severely with those 
very things which we think at would be our utmost 
happiness to be allowed in. 

Let nowise man flatter himself with the strength 
of his own judgment, as if he were able to choose 
any particular station of life for himself. Man is 



136 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

a short-sighted creature, sees but a very little way 
before him; and as bis passions are none of bis 
best friends, so his particular affections are gener- 
ally his worst counsellors. 

I say this vdth respect to the impetuous desire 
I iiad from a youth to wander into the world, and 
how evident it now was that this principle was pre- 
served in me for my punishment. How it came 
on, the manner, the circumstance, and the conclu- 
sion of it, it is easy to give you historically, and 
with its utmost variety of particulars. But the se- 
cret ends of Divine Providence, in thus permitting 
us to be hurried down the stream of our own de- 
sires, are only to be understood of those who can 
listen to the voice of Providence, and draw religi- 
ous consequences from God's justice, and their own 
mistakes. 

Be it I had business or no business, away I went 
It is no time now to enlarge any farther upon the 
reason or absurdity of my own conduct; but to 
come to the history-— I was embarked for the 
voyage, and the voyage I went. 

I shall only add here, that my honest and truly 
pious clergyman left me here; a ship being ready 
to go to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither; 
being still, as he observed, bound never to finish 
any voyage he began. How happy had it been 
for me, if I had gone with him ! 



OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. IST 

But it was too late now ; all things Heaven ap« 
points are best Had I gone with him, I had never 
had so many things to be thankful for, and you had 
never heard of the Second Part of the Travels and 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe ; so I must leave 
here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on 
with my voyage. 

From the brazils we made directly away over the 
Atlantic sea to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, 
as we call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a 
tolerable good voyage, our course generally south- 
east; now and then a storm, and some contrary 
winds. But my disasters at sea were at an end ; 
my future rubs and cross events were to befal me 
on shore ; that .it might appear the land was as 
well prepared to be our scourge as the sea, when 
Heaven, who directs the circdmstauces of things^ 
pleases to appoint it to be so. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage^ and had a 
supercargo on board, who'was to direct all her mo- 
tions after she arrived at the Cape ; only being li- 
mited to a certain number of days for stay, by 
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. 
This vms none of my business, neither did I meddle 
with it at all; my nephew, the captain, and the su- 
percargo, adjusting all those things between them 
as they thought fit. 

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was 



IS8 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

needful to take in fresh water, but made the best 
of our way for the coast of Coromandel ; we were 
indeed informed that a French man of war of fifty 
guns, and two large merchant-ship^ were gone for 
the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with 
France, I had some apprehensions of them ; but 
they went their own way, and we heard no more 
of them. 

I shall not pester my account, or the reader* 
with descriptions of places, journals of our voy- 
ages, variations of the compass, latitudes, meri- 
dian distances, trade^ winds, situation of ports, and 
the like; such as almost all the histories of long 
navigation are full of, and which make the read- 
ing tiresome enough, and are perfectly unprofit- 
able to all that read, except only to those who are 
to go to those places themselves. 

It is enough to name the ports and places which 
we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our 
passing from one to another. We touched first 
at the island of Madagascar, where, though the 
people are fierce and treacherous,, and, in panh- 
cuiar, very well armed with lances and bows, which 
they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared 
very well with them awhile; they treated us very 
civilly; and for some trifles which we gave them, 
such as knives, scissars, &c. they brought us 
eleven good fat bullocks, middling in size, but 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. U9 

very good in flesh, which we took in, partly for 
fresh provisions for our present spending, and the 
rest to salt for the ship's use. 
• We were obliged to stay here for some time 
after we had furnished ourselves with provisions ; 
and I, that was always too curious to look into every 
nook of the world wherever I came, was for going 
on shore as often as I could. It was on the east 
side of the island that we went on shore one even- 
ing, and the people, who by the way are very nuf- 
merous, came thronging about us, and stood ga- 
ting at us at a distance; as we had traded freely 
with them, and had been kindly used, we thought 
ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the 
people, we cut thre boughs out of a tree and stuck 
them up at a distance from us, whicb» it seems, 
is a mark in the country not only of truce and 
friendship, but when it is accepted, the other side 
set up three poles or boughs also, which is a 
signal that they accept the truce too; but then 
this is a known condition of the truce, that yoii 
are not to pass beyond their three poles towards 
them, nor they conie past your three poles or 
boughs towards you; so that you are perfectly se- 
cure within the three poles, and all the space be* 
tween your poles and theirs is allowed, like a mar* 
^et| for free converse, traffic, and comn^erce. When 



U9 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

yoQ go thither you must not carry your weapons 
with you; and iflhey come into that space^ they 
stick up their javelins and lances all at the first 
poles^ and come on unarmed; but ii any violence 
is ofiered them, and the truce thereby broken, 
away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their 
weapons, and then the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening when we went on 
shore, that a greater number of their people came 
down than U3ual, but all was very friendly and civil. 
They brought with them several kinds of provi- 
.siotts, for which we satisfied them with such toys 
as we had; their -women also brouuht us milk and 
roots^ and' several things viery acceptable to us, and 
all was quiet; and we made us a little tent or hul^ 
of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore, all thai 
night. ' » 

I know iiqt what was the occasion, but I was 
not so well satisfied to lie' on* shore as the rest; 
and the-bbat lying at an anchor about a stone's 
cast from 'the land, with two men in her to take 
care of her, I made one of them come on shore, 
and getting some boughs of^ trees to cover us also 
in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the 
boat, and lay on board,- under the cover of the 
branches of the trees, all night. 
< About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one 
<of our men make a terrible noise on the shore. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 14} 

calling out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and 
come and help them, . for they were all like to^ be 
murdered; at the same time I heard the firing of 
five muskets, which was the number of the guns 
they had, and that three times over ; for, it seems, 
the natives here were not so easily frighted with 
guns as the savages were in America, where I had 
to do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter; 
but rousing in^mediately from sleep with the noise, 
I caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, 
with three fusils we had on board, to land and as- 
sist our men. . . 

We got the boat soon to the shore ; but our men 
were in too much haste; for, being come to the 
shore, they plunged into the water to get to the 
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur- 
sued by between three and four hundred men. 
Our men were but nine in all, and only five of 

* 

them had fusils with them : the rest, indeed, had 
pistols and swords, but they were of small use to 
them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with diffi- 
culty enough too, three of them being very ill 
wounded; and that which was still worse was, that 
while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we 
were in as much danger as they were in on shore ; 
for. they poured their arrows in upon us so thick. 



142 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that we were fain to barricade the side of the boat 
up with the benches and two or three loose boards,* 
which, to our great satiistfaction, we had by mere ac- 
cident, or providence rather, in the boat. 

And yet had it been daylight, they are, it seems, 
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen 
but the least part of any of us, they would have 
been sure of us. We had, by the light of the 
moon, a little sight of them as they stood pelting 
us from the shore with darts and arrows ; and ha- 
ving got ready our fire-arms, we gave them a vol- 
ley, and we could hear by the cries of some of 
them, that we had wounded several; however, 
they stood thus in battle array on the shore till 
break of day, which we suppose was that they 
might see the better to take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because 
we must needs stand up in the boat, and they were 
as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree 
with small shot. We made signals of distress to 
the ship, which though she rode a league ofi^ yet 
my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, and 
by glasses perceiyng the posture we lay in, and 
that we fired towards the shore, pretty well under- 
stood us ; and weighing anchor with all speed, he 
stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, 
and then sent another boat with ten hands in her 



OF ROBINSON CRU90E. 113 

to assist us; but we called to them not to come 
too 06ar, telling them what condition we were in. 
However,. they stood in nearer to us; and one of 
the men taking the end of a tow-line in his band, 
and keeping our boat between him and the enemy, 
to that they ,could not perfectly see him, swam 
on board us, and made the line fast to the boat, 
upon which we slipt our little cable, and leaving 
our anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach 
of the arrows, we all the while lying close behind 
the barricade we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship 
and the shore, that she could lay her side to the 
shore, we ran along just by them, and we poured 
in a broadside among them, loaded with pieces of 
iron and lead, small bullets, and such stujQI^ besides 
the great shot, which made a terrible haToc among 
them. 

When we were got on board, and oat of danger, 
we had time to examine into the occasion of thi& 
fray; and indeed our supercargo, who had been 
ofien in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said 
he was sure the inhabitants would not have touch*- 
ed us afler we had made a tri^ce, if we had not 
done something to provoke them to it. At length 
it came out, viz. that an old woman, who had 
come to sell us some piilk, had brought it within 
^r pole^ with a young woman with her, whcr 



144 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

also brought some roots or herbs ; and while tba 
old womaii (whether she was mother to the young 
woman or^ no they could not tell) was selling us 
the milk> one of our men offered some rudeness 
to the wench that was with her, at which the old 
woman made a great noise. However, the seaman 
would not quit his prize, but carried her out of 
the old woman's sight, among the trees, it being 
almost dark. The old woman wenC away without 
her, and, as we suppose, made an outcry among 
the people she came from; who, upon notice, 
raised this great army upon us in three or four 
hours; and it was great odds but we had been all. 
destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was 
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack, 
as he sallied out of the tent we had made ; tlie rest 
came off free, all but the fellow who was the occa- 
sion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for 
his black mistress, for we could not hear what be- 
came of him a great while. We lay upon the shore 
two days after, though the wind presented, and 
made signals for him ; made our boat sail up shore 
and down shore several leagues, but in vain ; so we 
were obliged to give him over; and if he alone had 
sufifered for it, the loss had been the less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without ven- 
tqring on shore once more, to try if I could learn 



OF ROBINSON CRUIftOfi. 145 

iauy thing of him or thetn. It was the third night 
after the action, that I had a great mind to leat'n, if 
I could by any means, what mischief we had done, 
and how the game stood on the Indian side. I was 
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be at^ 
tacked again; bat I ought indeed to have been sure 
that the men I went with had been under my com- 
mand before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and 
mischievous, as I was brought into it without my 
knowledge or desire. 

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in 
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and 
we landed two hours before midnight, at th^ same 
place where the Indians stood drawti up the eren- 
ing before. I landed here, because my design, as 
I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted 
the field, and if they had left any marks behind 
them, or of the mischief we had done them; and I 
thought if we could surprise one or two of them, 
perhaps we might get our man again by way of 
exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and dirided our 
men into two companies, whereof the boatswain 
commanded one, and I the other. We neither 
could hear nor see any body stir when we landed ; 
so we marched up, one body at a distance from the 
other, to the field of battle. At first we could see 
nothing, it being rery dark; but by and by our 

VOL. III. K 



M6 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

boatswain^ that led the first party, stumbled and fell 
over a dead body. This made them halt there 
awhile; for koowiog by the circumstances that 
they were at the place where the Indians had stood^ 
they waited for my coming up. Here we conclu- 
ded to halt till the moon began to rise, which we 
knew would be in less than an hour> and then we 
could easily discern the havoc we had made among 
them. We told two-and-thirty bodies upon the 
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some 
had an arm, and some a leg, shot ofi^ and one his 
head ; those that were wounded we supposed they 
had carried away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full disco- 
very of all we could come at the knowledge of, I 
was for going on. board again; but the boatswain 
and his party often sent me word, that they were 
resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where 
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and desired 
me to go along with them, and if they could find 
them, as they still fancied they should, they did not 
doubt, they said, getting a good booty; and it might 
be they might find Thomas JefFrys there, that was 
the man^s name we had lost« 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew 
well enough what answer to have given them ; for 
J would have commanded them instantly on board, 
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us t« run, who 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. UT 

had a ship and a ship's loading in our charge^ and 
a voyage to make, which depended very much 
upon the lives of the men ; but as they sent me 
word they were resolved to go, and only asked me 
and my company to go along with them, I posi- 
tively refused it, and rose up (for I was sitting on 
the ground) in order to go to the boat One or 
two of the men began to importune me to go, and 
when I still refused positively, began to grumble, 
and say they were not under my command, and 
they would go. *' Come, Jacf says one of the 
men, j** will you go with me ? I will go for one/' 
Jack said he would ; and another followed, and then 
another ; and, in a word, they all left me but one, 
whom, with much difficalty too, I persuaded to 
stay ; so the supercargo and I, with one man^ went 
back to the boat, where, I told them, we would 
stay for them, and take care to take in as many of 
them as should be left,* for I told them it was a 
mad thing they were going about, and supposed 
most of them would run the fate of Thomas Jefiiys. 
. They told me, like seamen, they would warrant 
it they would come off again, and they would take 
care, &c. So away they went. I entreated them 
to consider the ship and the voyage ; that their 
lives were not their own ; and that they were en* 
trusted with the voyage in some measurer; that if 
they miscanied, the ship might be lost for want of 



148 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

their help; and that they could not answer it t^ 
God and man. I said a great deal more to them 
on that head, but I might as well have talked to 
the main-mast of the ship; they were mad upon 
their jourtiey ; only they gave me good words, and 
begged I would not be angry ; said they would be 
very cautious, and they did not doubt but they 
would be back again in about an hour at farthest ; 
for the Indian town, they said, was not above half 
a mile off; though they found it above two miles 
before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away as above ; and though 
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but 
madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them 
their due, they went about it warily as well as 
boldly. They were gallantly armed, that is true ; 
for they had every man a fusil or musket, a bay- 
onet, and every man a pistol ; some of them had 
broad cutlasses, some of them hangers, and the 
boatswain and two more had pole-axes ; besides all 
which, they had among them thirteen hand-gre- 
nadoes. Bolder fellows, and better provided, never 
went about any wicked work in the world. , 

When they went out, their chief design was 
plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding 
gold there ; but a circumstance, which none of them 
were awareo f, set them on fire with revenge, and 
made devils of them all. When they came to the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 140 

few Indiaa houses, which they thought had heen 
the town, which were not ahoTe half a mile ofi^ 
they were under a great disappoiDlmeiit; for there 
were not above twelve or thirteen hottses; and 
where the town was, or how big, they knew not 
They consulted therefore what to do, and were 
some time before they could resolve; for, if they 
fell upon these, they must cut all their throats, and 
it was ten to one but some of them might escape^ 
it being in the night, though the moon waa up; and 
if one escaped, he would run away, and raise all 
the town, so they should have a whole army upon 
them. Again, on the other hand, if they went away, 
and left those untouched (for the people were aU 
asleep), they could not teU which way to look for 
the town. 

However, the last was the best advice ; so they 
resolved to teave those houses, and look for the 
town as weU as they could. They went on a little 
way, and found a cow tied to a tree : this they pre- 
sently concluded would be a good guide to them; 
for they said the cow certainly belonged to the 
town before them, or the town behind them, and if 
they untied het, they should see which way she 
went: if she went back, they had nothing to say 
to her, but if she went forward, they had nothing 
to do but to follow her ; st^ they cot the covd, which 
was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on be* 



150 THE LIFE AND ADVENtURES 

fore them. In a word, the cow led them directly 
to the towD, which, as they reported, consisted of 
abo^e two hundred houses or huts ; and in some of 
these they found several families living together. 

Here they found all silent ; as profoundly secure 
as sleep and a country that had never seen an ene« 
my of that kind could make them. Upon this they 
called another council to consider what they had to 
do> and in a word they resolved to divide them- 
selves into three bodies, and to set three houses on 
fire m three parts of the town; and as the men 
came out, to seize them and bind them ; if any re- 
sisted, they need not be asked what to do then, and 
so to search the rest of the houses for plunder; but 
resolved to march silently first through the town, 
and see what dimensions it was of, and consider if 
they might venture upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they 
would venture upon them; but while th^y were 
animating one another to the work> three of them 
that were a little before the rest called out aloud, 
and told them they had found Thomas Jefirys; 
they all ran up to the place ; and so it was indeed, 
for there they found the poor fellow, hanged up 
naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was 
an Indian house just by the tree, where they found 
sixteen or seventeen of ihe principal Indians, who 
h^d been conceraed in the fray with us before, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 161 

two or three of < them woanded with our shot ; and 
our men found they were awake, and talking one 
to another in that house, hut knew not their num- 
ber. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en- 
raged them, as before, that they swore to one an- 
other they would be revenged, and that not an In- 
dian who came into their hands should have quar- 
ter ; and to work they went immediately, and yet 
not so madly as by the rage and fury they were in 
might be expected. Their first care was to get 
something that would soon take fire ; but after a 
little search they found that would be to no pur- 
pose, for most of the houses were low, and thatched 
with flags or rushes, of which the country is full : 
so they presently made some wild-fire, as we call 
it, by wetting a little powder in the palms of their 
hands ; and in a quarter of an hour they set the 
town on fire in four or five places, and particularly 
that house where the Indians were not gone to bed. 
As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor fright- 
ed creatures began to rush out to save their lives, 
but met with their fate in the attempt, and espe- 
cially at the door, where they drove them back, 
the boatswain himself killing one or two with his 
pole-axe ; the house being large, and many in it, 
be did not care t* go in, but called for an hand- 
grenado, and threw it among them, which at first 



I0t TH£ UFE AND AD VENTURES 

frighted them ; but when it burst, made such hm» 
voc among Uitm> that th^y cried out in a hideous 
ipanner. 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the 
open part of the house* were killed or hurt with the 
grenado, except two or three more, who pressed to 
the door, which the boatswain and two more kept 
with the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces^ 
and dispatched all who came that way. But there 
was another apartment in the bouse, where the 
prince or king, or whatsoever he was, and several 
others^ were ; and they kept in till the house, which 
was by this time all of a light flame, fell in upon 
them, and they were smothered or burnt together. 

AH this while they fired not a gun, because they 
would not waken the people faster than they could 
master them ; but tl^ fire began to waken them 
fast enougbi and our fellows were glad to keep a 
little together in bodies ; for the fire grew so rin- 
ging, all the houses being made of light combus- 
tible stufi^ that they couki hardly bear the str^t 
between them* and their buBiness was to follow the 
fire for the surer execution. As fast as the fire 
either forced the people out of those houses which 
were burning, or frighted them out of others, our 
people were ready at their doors to knock them 
on the head, sJiiil calling and hallooAOg to one aft- 
other to nemeqiber Thomas Jeifirys. 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 153 

While thb was doing, I must confess I was very 
uneasy* and especially when I saw the flames of 
the town, which, it being night, seemed to be just 
by me. 

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by hit 
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not 
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I 
was in ; especially hearing the guns too^ for by this 
time they began to use their fire-arms, A thou- 
sand thoughts oppressed his mind couceming me 
and the supercargo, what should become of us ; and 
at last, though he could ill spare any more men, 
yet, not knowing what exigence we might be in, 
be takes another boat, and with thirteen men and 
himself, comes on shore to me. 
. He was surprised to see me and the supercargo 
in the boat with no .more than two men, for one 
had been left to keep the boat ; and though he waa 
glad that we were well, yet he was in the same 
impatience with us to know what was doing, for 
the noise continued, and the flame increased. I 
confess it was next to an impossibility for any men 
in the world to restrain their curiosity of knowing 
what had happened, or their concern for the safety 
of the men. In a word, the captain told me ha 
would go and help his men, let what, would come. 
I argued with him, as I did before with the men, 
the safety of the ship^ and thft danger of the 



164 THB LIFE AI^D ADVENTURES 

Toyage, the interest of the owners and merchants, 
&c. and told him I would go, and the two men, and 
only see if we could, at a distance, learn what 
was like to be the event, and come back and 
tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to 
talk to the rest before ; he would go, he said, and 
he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, 
for he could not think of haying his men lost for 
want of help; he had rather, he said, lose the ship, 
the voyage, and his life, and all: and so away 
went he. 

Nor was I any more able to stay behind now than 
I was to persuade them not to go before ; so, in 
short, the captain ordered two men to row back the 
pinnace, and fetch twelve men more from the ship/ 
leaving the long-boat at an anchor ; and that when 
they came back, six men should keep the two boats, 
and six more come after us, so that he left only six- 
teen men in the ship ; for the whole ship's com- 
pany consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were 
lost in the first quarrel which brought this mis- 
chief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we 
felt little of the ground we trod on, and being guid- 
ed by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly 
to the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns 
were surprising to us before, the cries of the poor 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 156 

people were now qaite of another nature, and filled 
us with horror. I must confess I never was at the 
Backing of a city, or at the taking of a. town by 
storm ; I have heard of Oliver Cromwell taking 
Drogheda in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and 
child ; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the 
city of Magdebourg, and cutting the throats of 
22,000 of both sexes; but I never had an idea of 
the thing itself before, nor is it possible to de- 
scribe it, or the horror which was upon our minds 
at hearing it. 

However, we went on, and at length came to the 
town, though there was no entering the streets of 
it for the fire. The first object we met with was 
the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the .slies of 
«it, for the house was consumed ; and yht b^foi^e it, 
plain now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay 
-four men and three women killed; and, as we 
thought, one or two more lay in the heap among 
the fire. In short, these were such instances of a 
rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury something 
beyond what was human, that we thought it im- 
possible our men could be guilty of it; or, if they 
were the authors of it, we thought that every one of 
them ought to be put to the worst of deaths : but 
this was not all ; we saw the fire increased forward, 
and the cry went on just as the fire went on, so that 
we were in the utmost confusion. . We advanced a 
)ittle way farther, and beheld, to our astonishmeuti

three women naked^ or}' log in a most dreadful man- 
ner, and flying as if they had indeed had wings^ 
and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives^

oar English butchers (for I can call them no better) 
in the rear, who, when they could not overtake 
them, fired in among them, and one that was kill- 
ed by their shot fell down in our sight : when the 
rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and 
that we would murder them as well as those that 
pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, 
especially the women, and two of them fell down 
as if already dead with the fright.

they staid till daylight, they would have a hundred 
thousand men about their ears : I say> I left them 
and went among those flying people, taking only 
two of our men with me ; and there was indeed a 
piteous spectacle among them : some of them had 
their feet terribly burnt with trampling and running 
through the fire, others their hands burnt; one of the 
women had fallen down in the fire, and was almost 
burnt to death before she could get out again ; two 
or three of the men had cuts in their backs and 
thighs, from our men pursuing, and another was 
shot through the body, and died while I was there. 
I would fain have learnt what the occasion of all 
this was, but I could not understand one word they 
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them 
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I 
was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous 
attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back 
to my own men : I told them my resolution, and 
commanded them to follow me, when in the very 
moment came four of our men, with the boatswain 
at their head, running over the heaps of bodies 
they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as 
if they wanted more people to massacre, when our 
men hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo^ 
and with much ado one of them made them hear.

80 that they knew who we were, and came up t» 
us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us^ he set up a 
halloo, like a shout of triumph, for havings as he 
thought, more help come; and without bear- 
ing to hear me, " Captain," says he, '' noble cap-

many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his 
head. We have sworn to spare none of them ; we 
will root out the very name of them from the 
earth." And thus he ran on, out of breath too 
with action, and would not give us leave to speak 
a word. 

At last, •raising my voice, that I might silence 
him a little, " Barbarous dog!'' said I, " what are 
you doing ? I won't have one creature touched more 
upon pain of death. . I charge you upon your life 
to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are 
a dead man this minute." 

" Why, Sir," says he, *' do you know what you 
do, or what they have done ? If you want a reason for 
what we have done, come hither ;" and with that 
he shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree« 
with his throat cut

thought they had carried their rage too fiaur, and 
thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and 
Levi, '' Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce ; 
and their wrath, for it was cruel.'' But I had now 
a new task upon my hands ; for when the men I 
carried with me saw the sight as I had done/ 1 had 
as much to do to restrain them, as I should hare 
had with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell

in with them, and to]d me in their hearings that he 
was only concerned for fear of the men being over- 
powered ; for as to the people, he thought not one 
of them ought to live; for they had all glutted 
themselves with the murder of the poor man, and 
that they ought to be used like murderers. Upon 
these words away ran eight of my men with the 
boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody 
work; and I^ seeing it quite out of my power to 
restrain them, came away pensive and sad, for I 
could not bear the sight, much less the horrible 
noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into 
their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the su- 
percargo and two men, and with these I walked 
back to the boats. It was a very great piece of 
folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it were 
alone ; for as it began now to be almost day, and 
the alarm had run over the country, there stood 
about forty men, armed with lances and bows, at 
the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses 
stood, mentioned before, but by accident, I missed 
the place, and came directly to the sea-side; and 
by that time I got to the sea-side it was broad day : 
immediately I took the pinnace and went aboard, 
and sent hf r back to assist the men in what might 
happen.

boaUside, the fire was pretty well out, and the noise 
abated; but in about half an hour after I got on 
board> I heard a volley of our men's fire-arms> and 
saw a great snioke ; this« as I understood, after- 
wards^ was our men falling upon the forty men, 
vrhOf as I said, stood at the few houses on the way ; 
of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set 
all those houses on fire, but did not meddle with 
the women or children. 

By the time the men got to the shore again 
mdth the pinnace^ our men began to appear : they 
came dropping in some and some, not in two hoo- 
dies, and in form, as they went out, but all in 
heaps, straggling here and there in such a manner 
that a small force of resolute men might have cut 
them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole 
country. The people were amazed and surprised, 
and so frighted, that I believe a hundred of them 
would have fled at the sight of but five of our men. 
Nor in all this terrible- action was there a man who 
made any considerable defence ; they were so sur- 
prised between the terror of the fire, and the sud^ 
den attack of our men in the darky that they knew 
not which way to turn themselves ; for if they fled 
one way, they were met by one party, if back 
again, by another; so that they were every where 
knocked down. Nor did any of our men receive

the least hurt, except one who strained his foot, 
and another had one of his hands very much burnt. 

I was yerf ang^ with my nephew, the captain, 
and indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with 
him in particular, as well for his acting so out of 
his duty, as commander of the ship, and haying the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompt- 
ing rather than cooling the rage of his men in so 
bloody and cruel an enterprise : my nephew an- 
swered me very respectfully, but told me that when 
he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they 
had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous man- 
ner, he was not master of himself, neither could he 
govern his passion ; he owned he should hot have 
done so, as he was commander of the ship, but as 
he "was a man, and nature moved him, he could not 
bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not 
subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough, 
so they took no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed; some said one thing, some 
another; but, according to the best of their ac- 
counts, put all together, they killed or destroyed 
about a hundred and fifty people, men, women, 
and childireni and lef^ not a house standing in the 
town. 

« As for the poor fellow, Thomas Jeffrys, as he 

2 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 103 

was quite deSicI, for his throat was so cat that his 
head was half off, it would do him no service to 
bring him away; so they left hini where they 
found him> only took him down from the tree 
where he was hanged by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action to 
be, I was against them in it, and I always after that 
time told them God would blast the voyage ; for I 
looked upon the blood they shed that night to be 
murder in them; for though it is true that they 
killed Thomas Jeffirys, yet it was as true that Je& 
frys was the aggressor, had broken the truce^ and 
had violated or debauched a young woman of theirs, 
who came to our camp innocently, and on the faith 
of their capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board. He said, it was true 
that we Seemed to break the truce, but really had 
not, and that the war was begun the night before 
.by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and 
killed one of our men without any just provocation; 
so that as we were in a <;apacity to fight them, we 
might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice 
upon them in an extraordinary manner; that, 
though the poor man had taken liberty with a 
wench, he ought uot to have been murdered, and 
4hat in such a villanous manner; and that they did

nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God 
allowed to be done to murderers. 

One would think this should have been enough 
to have warned us against going on shore among 
heathens and barbarian^; but it is impossible to 
make mankind wise but at their ovim experience ; 
and their experience seems to be always of most 
use to them when it is dearest bought 

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and 
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, onlv to 
touch at Surat ; but the chief of the supercargo's 
design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where, if he misl- 
ed of the business outward-bound, he was to go up 
to China, and return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befel us was in the Gulf 
of Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore 
en the Arabian side of the Gulf, were surrounded 
by the Arabs, and either all killed or carried away 
into slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not 
able to rescue them, and had but just time to get 
off their boat I began to upbraid them with the 
just retribution of Heaven in this case; but the 
boatswain very warmly told me^ he thought I went 
farther in my censures than I could shew any war- 
rant for in Scripture, find referred to the thirteenth 
of St. Luke, ver. 4, where our Saviour intimates, 
that those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell, 
were not sinners above all the Galileans ; but that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSpE. 165 

ivhich indeed put me to silence in this case was> 
that none of these five men vyl\o were now lost, 
were of the number of those who went on shore to 
the massacre of Madagascar (so I always called it, 
though pur men could not bear the word massacre 
with any patience) : and indeed this last circum- 
stance, as I have said, put me to silence for the 
present. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this sub- 
ject had worse consequences than I expected ; and 
the boatswain, who had been the head of th^. atr 
tempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me 
he found that I continually brought that affair upon 
the stage, that I made unjust reflections upon it, 
and had used the men very ill on that accpuut, and 
himself in particular; that as I was but a passen- 
ger, and had no command in the ship, or concern 
in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; 
that they did not know but I might have some ill 
design in my head, and perhaps call them to an 
account for it when they came to England ; and 
that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have done 
with it,^nd also not to concern myself farther with 
^im, or any of his afiairs, he would leave the ship, 
for he did not think it waa safe to sail wit(i me 
among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till be had done, 
and then told him that I did confess I had all along 



160 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

opposed the massacre of Madagascar, for sach I 
would always call it ; and that I had on all occa- 
sions spoken my mind freely about it, though not 
more upon him than any of the rest ; that as to my 
liaving no command in the ship, that was true, nor 
did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty 
of speaking my mind in things which publicly con- 
cerned us all : as to what concern I had in the 
voyage, that was none of his business ; I was a 
considerable owner of the ship, and in that claim I 
conceived I had a right to speak, even farther than 
I had yet done, and w6uld not be accountable to 
him or any one else ; and began to be a little 
warm with him : he made but little reply to me at 
that time, and I thought that affair had been over. 
We were at this time in the road to Bengal ; and 
being willing to see the place, I went on shore 
with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert 
myself; and towards evening was preparing to go 
on board, when one of the men cslihe to me, and 
told me be would dot have liie trouble myself to 
come down to the boat, for they had orders not to 
carry me on board. Any one may guess what a 
surprise I Was in at so insolent a message ; and I 
asked the man who bade him deliver that errand 
to me ? He told me, the coxswain. I said no more 
to the fellow, but bid him let them know he had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

delivered im message and that I had given him no 
answer to it 

I immediately went and found out Uie supercar* 
go^ and t^ld him the story, adding, what I present- 
ly foresaw, viz. that there would certainly be a 
mutiny in the ship ; and entreated him to go im- 
mediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and 
acquaint the captain of it : but I might have spared 
this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him 
on shore, the matter was effected on board: the 
boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and, in a 
word, all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone 
off in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and 
desired to speak with the captain; and there the 
boatswain making a long harangue (for the fellow 
talked very well), and repeating all he had said to 
me, told the captain in a few words, that as I was 
now gone peaceably on shore, they were loath to 
use any violence with me; which, if I had not 
gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to 
oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought 
fit to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to 
serve in the ship under his command, they would 
perform it faithfully : but if I would not quit the 
ship, or the captain oblige me to quit i%, they would 
all leave the ship, and sail no farther with him ; and 
at that word all, he turned his face about .towards 
ihe main-mast, which was, it seems, the signal 



1^9 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

agreed on between them, at which all the seamen 
being got together, they cried out, " One and all. 
One and all!^' 

My nephew, the captain, was a man .of spirit^ 
and of great presence of mind ; and though he waft 
surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he 
told them calmly he would consider of the matter, 
but that he could do nothing in it till he had spo* 
ken to me about it : he used some arguments with 
them, vto shew them the unreasonableness and in- 
justice of the thing, but it was all in vain ; they 
swore, and shook hands round, before his face, that 
they would go all on shore unless he would engage 
to them not to sufier me to come on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his 
obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them ; 
told them that I was a very considerable owner of 
the ship, and that in justice he could not put me 
out of my own house ; that this was next door to 
serving me as the famous pirate Kid had done, who 
made the mutiny in the ship, set the captain on 
shore in an' uninhabited island, and ran away with 
the ship; that let them go into what ship they 
would, if ever they came to England again it would 
cost them dear; that the ship was mine, and that 
he would not put me out of it; and that he would 
rather lose the ship, and the voyager too, than dis* 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

oblige me so moch ; m they might do as they plea* 
sed. However, he would go on shore^ and talk 
with me there^ and invited the boatswain to go with 
him, and perhaps they might accommodate the 
matter with me. • 

But they all rejected the proposal; and said» 
they •would have nothing to do with me any more, 
neither on board nor on shore ; and if I came on 
board, they would go on shore. '* Well/' said the 
captain, " if you are all of this mind, let me go on 
shore, and talk with him :" so away he came to me 
with this account, a little after the message had 
been brought to me from the coxswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must con< 
fess; for I was not without apprehensions that they 
would confine him by violence, set sail, and run 
away with the ship ; and then I had been stripped 
naked, in a remote country, and nothing to help 
myself: in short, I had been in a worse case than 
when I was all alone in the island. 

But they had not come to that length, it seems, 
to, my great satisfaction; and when my nephew 
told me what they had said to him, and how they 
had sworn, and shook hands, that they would one 
and all leave the ship, if I was iufifered to come on 
board, I told htm he shoold not be concerned at it 
at all, for I would stay on shore ; I only desired he 
would take care and send me all my necessary 



lU THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

dit for more, if I had occasion^ that I might not be 
straitened, whatever might happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage 
too ; and, as I originally intended, I bought here 
some very good diamonds, which, of all other 
things, was the most proper for me, in my circum- 
stances, because I might always carry my whole 
rstate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made 
for my return to England, but none falling to my 
mind, the English merchant, who lodged with me^ 
and with whom I had contracted an intimate ac- 
quaintance, came to me one morning : '^ Country- 
man,'' says he, '' I have a project to communicate 
to you, which, as it suits with my thought^ niay> 
for aught I know, suit with yours also, when yon 
shall have thoroughly considered it. 

f Here we are posted,'' says he, " you by acci* 
dent, and I by my own choice, in a part of the 
world very remote from our own country; but it is 
in a country wher^ by us who understand trade 
and business, a great deal of money is to be got : 
if you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand 
pounds, we will hire a ship here,, the first we can 
get to our minds; you shall be captain, I'll be 
merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to Chi- 
na ; for what should we stand sUU for } The whole 
world is in motion^ rolling round and round ; ^U the 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 

oreatures of God^ heavenly bodies nnd earthly^ are 
busy and diligent : why should we be idle ? There 
Are no drones/' says he, *' living in the world but 
men: why should we be of that number?". 

I liked this proposal very well ; and the more 
because it seemed to be expressed with so much 
good-will^ aud in so friendly a manner. I will not 
say, but that I might, by my loose and unhinged 
circumstances^ be the fitter to embrace a proposal 
for trade, and indeed for any thing else ; or other- 
wise trade was none of my element; however, I 
might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade 
was not my element, rambling was; and no propo- 
sal for seeing any part of the worlds which I had 
never seen before, could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some time before we could get 
a ship to our mind ; and when we got a vessel, it 
was not easy to get £nglish sailors; that is to say^ 
80 many as were necessary to govern the voyage, 
and manage the sailors which we should pick up 
there. After some time we got a mate, a boat- 
swain, and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, 
and three Portuguese foremast- men : with these we 
found we could do welLenough, having Indian sea- 
men, such as they are, to make up. 

There are so many travellers who have written 
the history of their voyages and travels this way, 
tifaat it would be but very little diversion to any

body, to give a long account of the places we went 

to, and the people who inhabit there : those, things 

I leaYe to others^ and refer the reader to those 

journals and trarels of Englishmen^ many of which* 

I find, are published, and more promised every day. 

It is enough for me to tell you, that we made the 

voyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, first; 

and from thence to Stam, where we exchanged some 

of oar wares for opium, and some for arrack; the 

first a commodity which bears a great price among 

the Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much 

wanted there : in a word, we went up to Susham ; 

made a very great voyage; were eight months out; 

and returned to Bengal ; and I was very well satis- 

fied with my adventure. 

I observe, that oi3ir people in England often ad- 
mire how the officers, which the Company send in* 
to India, and the merchants which generally stay 
there, get such very g«)od estates as they do, and 
sometimes come home worth sixty, seventy, and a 
hundred thousand pounds at a time. But it is no 
wonder, or, at least, we shall see so much farther 
into it, when we consider the innumerable ports and 
places where they have a free commerce, that it 
will then be no wonder; and much less will it be so, 
wften we consider, that at all those places and ports 
where the English ships come, there is so much, 
and such constant demand for the growth of all 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 11$ 

Other countries, that there is a certain vent for the 
retora, as well as a market abroad fop the goods 
carried out. 

In shorty we made a very good voyage, and I got 
so much money by the first adventure, and such 
an insight into the method of getting more, that, 
had I been twenty years younger, I should have 
been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no 
farther for making my fortune : but what was all 
this to a man on the wrong side of threescore, that 
was rich enough, and came abroad more in obe- 
alienee to a restless desire of seeing the world, than 
a covetous desire of getting in it? And indeed I 
think it is with great justice that I now call it a 
restless desire, for it was so: when I was at home, 
I was restless to go abroad ; and now I was abroad, 
I was restless to be at home. I say, what was this 
^in to me ?. I was rich enough already ; nor had 
I any uneasy desires about getting more money; 
and therefore, the profits of the voyage to me were 
things of no great force to me, for the prompting 
me forward to farther undertakings; hence I thought^ 
that by this voyage I had made no progress at all; 
because I was come back, as I might call it, to th& 
place from whence I came, ns to a home ;' where-f 
as my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks 
of, was never satisfied witl^ .seeing, was still more 
4«9iiou8 of wandering and seeing, I was come in* 



ITft THE LIFE AND ADVflNTURES 

to a part of the wofld which I never was in before ; 
«nd that part in particular^ which I had heard 
much of; and was resolved to see as much (^ it as 
2 could ; and then I thought I might say I had 
seen all the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different nO' 
lions : I do not name this to insist upon my own« 
for I acknowledge his was most just, and the most 
suited to the end of a merchant's life ; who, when 
he is abroad upon adventures^ it is his wisdom to 
stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he- is 
like to get the most money by. My new friend 
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would 
have been content to have gone, like a carrier's 
horse, always to the same inn, backward and for- 
ward^ provided he could, as he called it, find his ac- 
count in it : on the other hand, mine, as old as I 
was, was the notion of a mad rambling boy, that 
never cares to see a thing twice over. 

But this was not all : I had a kind of impatience 
Upon me to be nearer home, and yet the most un- 
settled resolution imaginable, which way to go. In 
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who 
was always upon the search for business, proposed 
another voyage to me, viz. among the Spice 
Islands; and to bring home a load of cloves from 
the Manillas, or thereabouts ; places where, indeed, 
the Dutch do trade> but the islands belong partly 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

to the Spaniards; though we went not so far, but 
to some other> where they have >not the whole 
power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We 
were not long in preparing for this yoyage ; the 
chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into it; 
however, at last, nothing else ofiering, and finding 
that really stirring about and trading, the profit be- 
ing so great, and, as I may say, certain, had more 
pleasure in it, and more satisfaction to the mind, 
than sitting still; which, to me especially, was the 
unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voyage 
too: which we made very successfully, touching 
at Borneo, and several islands, whose' names I do 
not remember, and came home in about five months. 
We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and 
som€ nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who car- 
ried them away for the Gulf; and, making near 
five of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smi- 
led at me : " Well now,'' said he, with a sort of an 
agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, '' is not 
this better than walking about here, like a man of 
nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at 
the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans }'''^** Why 
truly,'' said I, '' my friend, I think it is; and I be- 
gin to be a convert to the principles of merchan- 
dising. But I must tell you," said I, " by the way, 
you do not know lyhat I am doing; for if once I

oki as I am, I shall harass you up and down the 
world till I tire you ; fer I shall pursue it so eager- 
ly» I- shall never let you lie still'' 

Bat to be short with my specvdationfl^ a little 
while after this there came in a Dutch ship from 
Batavia ; she was a coaster, not an European tra- 
der, and of about two hundsed tons burden : the 
men, as they pretended, having been so sick]y> 
that the captain had not men enough to go to sea 
with, he lay by at Bengal ; and, as if having g«t 
money enough, or being willing, for other reasons^ 
to go for Europe, he gave public notice, that he 
would sell his ship : this came to my ears before 
my new partner heard of it; and I had a great 
mind to buy it. So I went home to him, and tdd 
him of it : he considered awhile, for he was no rash 
man neither ; but musing some time, be replied, 
''She is a little too big; but, however, we will have 
her/' Accordingly we bought the ship; and, agree- 
ing with the master, we paid for her, and took pos- 
session ; when we had done so, we resolved to en*> 
tertain the men, if we could, to join them with those 
we had, for the pursuing our business ; but on a 
sudden, they not having received their wages, but 
their share of the money, as we afterwards learnt, 
not one of them was to be found. We inquired 
much about them, and at length were told, that

such conpany as would both have guayrdeid me and 
diyefted me, would have CHiited migbtify with my 
great design; and I should both have seen the 
worlds and gone homiewards too ; but I viras much 
better satisfied a few days after, when I i?ame to 
know what sort of fellows they were ; for, in short, 
their history was, that this man they called captain 
was the gunner only, not the commander; that 
they had been a trading voyage, in which they 
were attacked on shore by some of the Malaccans, 
who had killed the captain and three of his men ; 
and that after the captain was killed, these men, 
eleven in number, had resolved to run away with 
the ship, which they did ; and had brought her in 
at the Bay of Bengal, leaving the mate and five 
men more on shore; of whom we' shall hear far- 
ther. 

Well; let them come by the ship how they 
would, we came honestly by her, as we thought ; 
though we did not, I confess, examine into things 
so exactly as we ought; for we never enquired any

would certainly have faltered in their accounts, con-

age to China ; but designing first to go to Slam, 
to boy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of 
M alacca» and among the islands, we were no sooner 
got clear of those difficult seas, but we found our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by 
all our industry, to find oilt where it was. This 
forced us to make for some port; and my partner, 
who knew the country better than I did, directed 
the captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for 
I had made the English mate, one Mr Thompson, 
captain, not being willing to take the charge of 
the ship upon myself. This river lies oti the 
north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up 
to Siam. 

While we were here, and going of^en on shore 
fbr r^ffei^ment, there comfes to me one day an Eng- 
lishman, and he was, it seems^ a gunner's mate on 
board an English East India ship, which rode in 
the same river, up at, or near the city of Cambo* 
dia : what brought him hither we knew not ; but 
he comes up to me, and, speaking English, " Sir,'' 
says he, ** you are a stranger to me, and I to you; 
but I have something to tell you, that very nearty 
concerns you.** . 

I looked stf dfast^ at hiin a good while^ and he 
thought at first I had known him, but I did not

** If it very nearly concerns me/' said I, ** and not 
yourself, what moves you to tell it me ?*'•— <^ I am 
moved/' says he, " by the imminent danger you 
are in ; and, for aught I see, you have no know- 
ledge of it" — '' I know no danger I am in/' said I, 
'* but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it 
out ; but I propose to lay her aground to-morrow, 
to see if I can find it/'—" But, Sir," says he, 
** leaky or not leaky, find it or not fiad it, you will 
be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, 
when you hear what I have to say to you. Do 
you know. Sir/' said he, '' the town of Cambodia 
lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? And there 
are two large English ships about five leagues on 
this side, and three Dutch." — " Well," said I, " and 
what is that to me ?"— " Why, Sir," says he, " is 
it for a man that is upon such adventures as you 
are, to come ii^to a port, and not examine first what 
ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal 
with them ? I suppose you do not think you are a 
match for them ?" I was amused very much at his 
discourse, but not amazed at it; for I could not 
conceive what he meant ; and I turned short upon 
him, and said, '< Sir, I wish you would explain 
yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have to 
be afraid of any of the Company's ships, or Dutch 
ships ; I am no interloper; what can they have, to 
say to me ?" , *

' He looked like a man half Mgry, ^half pleased ; 
and pausing anvhile, bat amiling^ " WeU^ Sir,^ saya 
he, ** if you think yoaraelf secure^ you moat take 
your chance; I am aony your fate shoald blind 
you against good advice ; but assufe yoaraelf if yo« 
do not put to sea immediately, you will the Tery 
next tide be attacked by five loag-boats full of 
men ; and^ perhaps, if you are taken, you will be 
hanged for a pirate, and the particolars be exa- 
mined into afterwards. I thought, Sir,'' added he, 
** I should have met with a better receptitm than 
this, for doing you a piece of service of such im- 
portance/'—-" I can never be ungrateful," said I, 
<« for any service, or to any man that offers me any 
kindness; but it is past my comprehension," said I, 
" what they should have such a design «pon me for: 
however, since you say there is no time to be lost;, 
and that there is some villanous design in hand 
against me, I will go on board this minute, and 
put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the 
leak, or if we can swim without stopping it : bnt^ 
Sir," said I, " shall I go away ignorant of the rea« 
son of all tihis? Can you give me no farther light 
into it?" 

'' I can tell yon but part of the story. Sir," saya 
he ; " but 1 have a Dutch seaman here with me, 
and, I believe, I could persuade him to tell you the 
rest ; but there ia scarce time for it : but the short 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ittft 

of the story is this> the first part of which, I sup-r- 
pose> yoa know well enoogh, viz. that you were 
with this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain 
was muvdeffed by the Malaocans, witfai three of his 
men ; and that yoa, or some of thos6 that were on 
board with you, ran away with the ship> aud are 
since turned piratbs. This is the sum of the story, 
and you wUl all be seized as pirates, I can assure 
you, and executed with very little ceremony; for 
yon know merchant-ships shew but little law to 
pirates, if they get them in their power/' 

^ Now you speak plain English," said I, *' and I 
thank you ; and though I know nothing that we 
have done, like what you talk of, but I am sure we 
came honestly and fairly by the ship ; yet seeing 
such work is a-doing, as you say, and that you seem 
to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard/' — 
'' Nay, Sir," says he, ** do not talk of being upon 
your guard; the best defence is to be out of the 
danger : if you have auy regard to your lif^ and 
the lives of all your men, put out to sea without 
fail at high-water ; and as you have a whole tide 
before you, you will be gone too far out before they 
can come down ; for they will come away at high 
water; and as they hav« twenty mRes to come, 
you'll get near two. hours of them by the diiference 
of the tide, not reckoning the length of the way : 
besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they 



186 TH£ life and adventures 

will not Tentare to follow you far oat to sea» es^ 
pecially if it blows." 

« Well/' said I, " you have been rery kind in 
this: what shall I do for you to make you amends?'' 
— " Sir/' says he, '' you may not be so willing to 
make me amends, because you may not be convin'* 
ced of the truth of it : I will make an ofifer to you ; 
I have nineteen months pay due to me on board the 
ship , which I came out of England in : 

and the Dutchman, that is with me, has seren 
month3 pay due to him ; if you will make good 
our pay to us, we will go along with you: if you 
find nothing more in it, we will desire no more ; 
but if we do convince you, that we have saved your 
life, and the ship, and the lives of all the men in 
her, we will leave the rest to you/' 

I consented to this readily; and went immedi# 
ately on board, ahd the two men with me. As 
soon as I came to the ship's side; my partner, who 
was on board, came on the quarter-deck, and calU 
ed to me with a great deal of joy, '* O ho ! O hof 
we have stopped the leak !"— *' Say you so?" said 
I ; " thank God ; but weigh the anchor then im« 
mediately/'—" Weigh !" says he ; " what do you 
mean by that ? What is the matter ?" says he. 
*' Ask no questions/' said I, " but all bands to work, 
and weigh without losing a minute." He was sur- 
prised : but, however, he called the captain, and 



OF ROBINSON (JRUSOE. I8T 

He immediately ordeftkl the ahchor to be got up ; 
and though the tide was not quite done, yet a little 
land-breez^ blowing, we stood otrt to sea ; then I 
called him into the cabin, and told htm the story 
at large ; and we called in the men, atid they told 
lis the rest of it : but as it took us up a great deal 
of time, sd before We had done, a seamdn comes to 
the cabin-door, slnd calls out to us, that the captain 
bade him tell us, we were chased. "Chased!" 
said I ; "by whotti, and by what ?"— ." By five 
sloops, or boats," said the fellow, "full of men."«*— 
" Very well/' said I ; " then it is apparent there is 
something in it." In the next place, 1 ordered all 
our men to be called up, and told them, that there 
was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for 
pirates ; and asked them, if they would stand b}^ 
us, and by one another? The men answered, 
cheerfully, one ahd all, that they would live and 
die with us. Then I asked the captain,* what way 
he thought best for Us to manage a fight with them; 
for resist them I resolved we would, and that to the 
last drop. He said, readily, that the way was to 
keep them off with our great shot, as long as we 
could, and then to fire at them with our small arms, 
to keep them from boarding us ; but when neither 
of these would do any longer, we should retire to 
Odf close quarters, perhaps they had not materi^l^ 
to break open our bulk-heads^ or get iif upoh m. 



I8» THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to 
bring two guns to bear fore and aft, oat of the 
fiteerage^ to clear the deck, and load them with 
musket-buUets and small pieces of old-iron, and 
what next came to hand; and thus we made ready 
for fight ; but all this while kept out -ix) sea, with 
wind enough, and could see the boats at a distance, 
being five large long-boats following us, with all 
the sail they could make. 

Two of these boats, which, by our glasses, we 
could see were English, had outsailed the rest, were 
near two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon 
us considerably; so that we found they would 
come up with us : upon which we fired a gun with- 
out a shot, to intimate that they should bring to ; 
and we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for par- 
ley ; but they kept crowding afler us, till they came 
within shot : upon this we took in our white flag, 
they having made no answer to it; hung out the 
red flag, and fired at them with shot : notwith- 
standing this,' they came on till they were near 
enough to call to them with a speaking-trumpet, 
which we bad on board ; so we called to them,. and 
bade them keep off at their peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and en- 
deavoured to come under our stern, so to board us 
on our quarter: upon which, seeing they were re- 
solute for mischief, and depended upon the strength 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 160 

that followed them^ I ordered to bring the ship to, 
so that they lay upon our broadside, when imme- 
diately we fired five guns at them ; one of them had 
been levelled so true, as to carry away the stem of 
the hindermost boat, and bring them to the neces- 
sity of taking down their sail, and running all to 
the head of the boat to keep her from sinking; so 
she lay by, and had enough of it; but seeing the 
foremost boat still crowd on after us, we made 
ready to fire at her in particular. 
While this was doing, one of the three boats that 
' was behind, being forwarder than the other two, 
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to re- 
lieve her, and we could afterwards see her take out 
the men : we called again to the foremost boat, and 
ofiered a truce to parley again, and to know what 
was her business with us; but had no answer: 
only she crowded close under our stem. Upon 
this our gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, 
run out his two chase guns, and fired at her; but 
the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, wa- 
ved their caps, and came on ; but the gunner, get- 
ting quickly ready again, fired among them a se- 
cond time; one' shot of which, though it missed the 
boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could 
easily see had done a great deal of mischief among 
them ; but we, taking no notice sf that, weared the 
ship again, and brought our quarter to bear upon 



190 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

them ; and, firing Ihrae giui4 more, we foooiil the 
boat was split aioK»t tp pieces ; in particqlar, her 
rudder, and a piece pf her stern> were shot quite 
away ; so they handed their sail immediately, and 
were in great disorder : but, to cemf^ete their mifl» 
fortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again; 
where be hit th^m we could not tell, but we found 
the boat was sinking, and some of the men already 
in the water. Upon this I immediately manned 
out our pinnace, which we had kept close by our 
side, with orders to pick up some of the men, if 
they could, and saye them from drowning, and im* 
mediately to come on board with them; because 
we saw the rest of the boats began to come up. 
Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and 
took up three men ; one of which was just droWn* 
ing, and it was a good wbil^ before we coqid reco- 
ver him. As soon as they were on board, we 
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood far- 
ther out to sea ; and we found, that when tbie other 
three boats came up to the first two, they gav^ 
over their chase. 

Being thus delivered frpm a danger, which though 
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much 
greater than I apprehended, I took care that we 
should change our course, and not let any one imaff 
gine whither we were going ; so we stood oat to sea 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOE. 101 

eastward, quite out of the oourse of all Europeau 
ships, whether they were bound to China, or any 
where else within the commerce of the European 
nations. 

When we were now at sea, we began to consult 
with the two seamen, and inquire, first, what the 
meaning of all this should be ? The Dutchman let 
us into the secret of it at once ; telling us, that the 
fellow that sold us the ship, as we said, was no more 
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he 
told us how the captain, whose name too he men- 
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was 
treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast 
of Malacca, with three of his men; and that he^ 
this Dutchman, and four more, got into the woodsy 
where they wandered about a great while ; till at 
length he, in particular, in a miraculous manner, 
made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, 
which sailing near the shore, in its way from Chi« 
na, had sent their boat on shore for fresh water; 
that he durst not come to that part of the shore 
where the boat was, but made shifl in the night to 
take in the water farther off, and swimming a great 
while, at last the ship's boat took him up. 

He then told us» that he went to fiatayia, where 
two of the seamen belonging to the ship had ar- 
rived, having deserted the rest in their travels; and 
gave an account, that the fellow who had run away 



Id2 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

with the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, 
which were gone a-cruizing in her; and that they 
had already taken an English ship, and two Dutch 
ships, very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us directly; 
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my part- 
ner said very well, if we had fallen into their handa^ 
and they had such a prepossession against us be- 
forehand, it had been in vain for us to have defend* 
ed ourselves, or to hope for any good quarters at 
their hands ; especially considering that our accu- 
sers had been our judges, and that we could have 
expected nothing from them but what rage would 
have dictated, and ungoverned passion have exe- 
cuted ; and therefore it was his opinion, we should 
go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, 
without putting in at any port whatever ; because 
there we could give an account of ourselves, and 
could prove where we were when the ship put in, 
whom we bought her of, and the like ; and which 
was more than all the rest, if we were put to the 
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, 
we should be sure to have some justice ; and not be 
hanged first, and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but 
after a little more serious thinking, I told him, I 
thought it was a very great hazard for us to at- 
tempt returning to Behgal, for that we were on the 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 193 

wrong side of the Straits of Malacca; and that if 
the alarm was given^ we should be sure to be way- 
laid on every side, as well by the Dutch of Bata- 
via,' as the English elsewhere; that if we should be 
taken, as it were, running away, we should even 
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more 
evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English 
sailor's opinion, who said, he was of my mind, and 
that we should certainly be taken. 

This danger a little startled my partner, and all 
the ship's company ; and we immediately resolved 
to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to 
China ; and from thence pursuing the first design; 
as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the 
ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the 
country, such as we could get. This was appro* 
ved of as the best method for our security ; and ac- 
cordingly we steered away N. N. K keeping above 
fifty leagues off fi-om the usual course to the east- 
ward. 

This, however, put us to some inconveniences ; 
for first the winds, when we came to that distance 
from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against 
us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, firom the £. 
and E. N. E. ; so that we were a long while upon 
our voyage, and we were Vut ill provided with 
victuals for so long a run ; and, which was still 
worse, there was some danger that those English 

VOL. nu N 



194 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, whereof 
some were bound that way, might be got in before 
us; and if not, some other ship bound to China 
might have information of us from them, and pur<^ 
sue us with the same vigour. 

I must confess I was now veiy uneasy, and 
thought myself, including the late escape from the 
long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous con- 
dition that ever I. was in through all my past life ; 
for whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was 
never pursued for a thief before ; nor had I ever 
done any thing that merited the name of dishonest 
or fraudulent, much less thievish. I had chiefly 
been mine own. enemy ; or, as I may rightly say, 
I had been nobody's enemy but my own. But now 
I was embarrassed in the worst condition imagin* 
able ; for though I was perfectly innocent, I was 
in no condition to make that innocence appear : and 
if I had been taken». it had been under a supposed 
guilt of the worst kind ; at least, a crime esteemed 
so among the people I had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an escape, 
though which way to do it I knew not ; or what 
port or place we should go to. My partner, see- 
ing me thus dejected, though hef was the most con- 
. cerned at first, began to encourage me; and de*- 
scribing to me the several ports of that coast, told 
me, he would put in on the coast of Cochin-chiuaj,

or the bay of Tonquin; iatending to go afterwards 
to Macao^ a town once in the possession of the 
Portuguese, and where still a great many Europe- 
an families resided, and particularly the mission- 
ary priests usually went thither, in order to their 
going forward to China. 

Hither we then resolved to go ; and accordingly 
though after a tedious and irregular course, and 
very much straitened for provisions, we came within 
sight of the coast very early in the morning; and 
upon reflection upon the past circumstances we 
were in, and the danger, if we had not escaped, we 
resolved to put into a small river, which, however, 
had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we 
could, either over land or by the ship's pinnace, 
come to know what ships were in any port there- 
abouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliver- 
ance ; for though we did not immediately see any 
European ships in the bay of Tonquiu, yet the next 
morning there came into the bay two Dutch ships ; 
and a third without any colours spread out, but 
which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by 
at about two leagues distance, steering for the coast 
of China; and in the afternoon went by two Eng- 
lish ships, steering the same course ; and thus we 
thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both 
one way and the other. The place we were in was 
wild and barbarous, the people thieves, evtn by oc-

cupatioQ or profession ; and though^ it is trae, we 
* had not much to seek of them, and except getting 
a few provisions, cared not how little we had to do 
with them ; yet it was with much difficulty that we 
kept ourselves from being insulted by them several 
ways.

situation. 

We were in a small river of this country, within a 
few leagues of its utmost limits northward, and by 
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land 
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin ; and it 
was in this beating up along the shore that we dis- 
covered as above, that, in a word, we were sur- 
rounded with enemies. The people we were among 
were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of 
the coast; having no correspondence with any 
other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and 
such gross commodities ; and it may be particularly 
seen that they are, as I said, the most barbarous 
of any of the inhabitants, viz. that anK>ng other 
customs they have this one, that if any vessel had 
the mistbrtune to be shipwrecked upon their coast. 



198 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they presently make the men all prisoners ; that is 
to say, slaves ; and it was not long before we found 
a spice of their kindness this way, on the occasion 
following : 

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a 
leak at sea, and that we conld not find it out ; and 
however it happened, that, as I have said, it was 
stopped unexpectedly, in the ^ happy minute of our 
being to be seized by the Dutch and English ships, 
near the bay of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the 
ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we 
resolved, while we were in this place, to lay her on 
shore, take out what heavy things we had on board, 
which were not many, and to wash and clean her 
bottom, and if possible to find out where the leaks 
were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and 
brought all our guns and other moveable things, 
to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we 
might come at her bottom ; for, on second thoughts, 
we did not care to lay her dry aground, neither 
could we find out a praper place for it 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with such a sight, came wondering down to the 
shore to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down 
on one side in such a manner, and heeling towards 
the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at 
work on her bottom with stages, and with their 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOK. 19!) 

boats, oa the offside, they presently concluded that 
the ship was cas^ away, and lay so very fast on the 
ground. 

On this supposition, they came all about us in 
two or three hours time, with ten or twelve large 
boats, having some of them eight, some ten men in 
a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board 
and plunder the ship; and if they had found us 
there, to have carried us away for slaves to their 
king, or whatever they call him, for we knew not 
who was their governor. 

When they came up to the ship, and began to 
row round her, they discovered us all hard at work, 
on the outside of the ship's bottom and side, wash^ 
ing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring 
man knows how. 

They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, 
who were a little surprised, could not imagine what 
their design was; but being willing to be sure, we 
took this opportunity to get some of us into the 
ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunif- 
tion to those that were at work, to defend them- 
selves with, if there should be occasion ; and it was 
no more than need ; for in less than a quarter af 
an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that 
the ship was really a wreck; that we were all at 
work endeavouring to save her, or to save our lives 
by the help of our boats; and when we handed 



SOO TiJE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

our arms into the boats^ they concluded by that 
motion that we were endeavouring to save some of 
our goods. Upon this, they took it for granted they 
all belonged to them, and away they came directly 
upon our men, as if it had been in a line of battle. 

Our men seeing so many of them, began to be 
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture, to fight, 
and cried out to us to know what they should do ? 
I immediately called to the men who worked upon 
the stages, to slip them down, and get up the side 
into the ship, and bade those in the boat to row 
round and come on board; and those few of us who 
were on board, worked with all the strength and 
hands we had, to bring the ship to rights; but, 
however, neither the men upon the stage, nor those 
in the boats, could do as they were ordered, before 
the Cochin-chinese were upon them, and with two 
of their boats; boarded our long-boat, and began to 
lay hold of the men as their prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold of was an English 
seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who, having a mus* 
Icet in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it 
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But 
he understood his business better than I could 
teach him ; for he grappled the Pagan, and drag* 
ged him by main force out of their own boat into 
ours ; where, taking him by the two ears, he beat 
his head so against the boat'i gunnel, that the fel- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ui 

low died instantly in his hands ; and in the mean 
titae, a Dutchman^ who stood next, took up the 
musket, and with the butt-end of it, so laid about 
him, that he knocked down fiTe of them who at- 
tempted to enter the boitt. But this was little to- 
wards resisting thirty or forty men, who fearless, 
because ignorant of their danger, began to throw 
themselves into the long-boat, where we had but 
five men to defend it. But one accident gave our 
men a complete victory, which deserved our laugh- 
ter rather than any thing else, and that was this:— - 
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out- 
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where 
he had caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two 
kettles just let down into the boat; one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and 
oil, and sudh stuff as the shipwrights used for that 
work; and the man that tended the carpenter had 
a great iron ladle in his hand» with which he sup- 
plied the men that were at work with that hot stuff: 
two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where 
this fellow stood, being in the fore- sheets; he im- 
mediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stufi» 
boiling hot^ which so burnt and scalded them, being 
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and, 
eni^ged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. 
The carpenter saw it, and cried out, " Well done. 
Jack, give them «ome more of it;'' when, stepping 



f(» THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

forward himself^ he takes one of their mops, and 
dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his' man threvr 
it among them so plentifully, that in short, of all 
the men in three boats, there was not one that was 
not scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful, 
pitiful manner, and made such a howling and cry- 
ing, that I never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, 
nothing like it ; for it was worth observing, that 
though pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet 
every nation have a particular way of exclamation, 
and make noises as different from one another as 
their speech. I cannot give the noise thete crea- 
tures made, a better name than howling, nor a name 
more proper to the tone of it ; for I never heard 
any thing more like the noise of the wolves, which, 
as I have said, I heard howl in the forest on the 
frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never pleased with a victory better in my 
life; not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, 
and that our danger was imminent before ; but as 
we got this victory without any bloodshed, except 
of that man the fellow killed with his naked hands, 
and which I was very much concerned at; for I 
was sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even 
though it was in my own defence, knowing they 
came on errands which they thought just, and 
knew no better; and th^t though it may be a just 
thing, because necessary, for there is no necessary

wickedness in nature ; yet I thought it was a sad 
life, when we must be always obliged to be killing 
our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves ; and> in* 
deed, I think so still ; and I would, even now, suf- 
fer a great deal> rather than I would take away the 
life even of the worst person injuring me. I be- 
lieve also, all considering people, who know the 
value of life, would be of my opinion, if they en- 
tered seriously into the consideration of it. 

But to return to my story. All the while this 
was doing, my partner and I, who managed the 
rest of the men on board, had, with great dexterity, 
brought the ship almost to rights ; and, having got- 
ten the guns into their places again, the gunner 
called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for 
he would let fly among them. I called back again 
to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the car- 
penter would do the work without him ; but bade 
him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who 
was on board, took care of. But the enemy was 
so terrified with what thev met with in their first 
attack, that they would Bot come on again ; and 
some of them that were farthest ofi; seeing the ship 
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, 
to see their mistake, and gave over the enterprise, 
finding it was not as they expected. Thus we got 
clear of this merry fight f and having gotten some 
nee, and some roots and bread, with about sixteen 



204 THE LIFB AND ADYBNTURKS 

good big hogs on board, two days before, we resol* 
▼ed to stay here no longer, but go fofvvard, whatever 
came of it; for we made no doubt but we should 
h% surrounded the next day with rogues enough, 
perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose 
of for us. 

We therefore got all our things on board the 
same evening, and the next rooming were ready to 
sail. In the mean time, lying at an anchor some 
distance from the shore, we were not so much con- 
cerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as 
in a sailing posture, if any enemy had presented. 
The next day, having finished our work within 
board, and finding our ship was perfectly healed of 
all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone 
into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform 
ourselves of what was to be known concerning the 
Dutch ships that had been there ; but we durst not 
stand in there, because we had seen several ships 
go in, as we supposed, but a little before ; so we 
kept on N. K towards the isle of Formosa, as much 
afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English mer- 
chant-ship, as a Dutch or English merchant-ship 
in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man of war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philip- 
pine islands, and this we did, that we might not 
fall into the way of any of the European ships; 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 905 

mnd then we steered north again, till we came to 
the latitude of 22 degrees 20 minutes, by which 
means we made the island of Formosa directly, 
where we came to an anchor, iu order to get wa* 
ter and fresh provisions, which the people there, 
who are very courteous and civil in their manners, 
supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly 
and punctually with us in all their agreements and 
bargains, which is what we did not find among 
other people, and may be owing to the remains of 
Christianity, which was once planted here by a 
Dutch mission of Protestants, and is a testimony of, 
what I have oilen observed, viz. that the Christian 
religion always civilizes the people, and reforms 
their manners, where it is received, whether it 
works saving effects upon them or not. 

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the 
coast of China at an equal distance, till we knew 
we were beyond all the ports of China where our 
European ships usually come ; but being resolved, 
if possible, not to fall into any of their hands, espe- 
cially in this country, where, as our circumstances 
were, we could not fail of being entirely ruined; 
nay, so groat was my fear in particular, as to my 
being taken by them, that I believe finnly I would 
much rather have chosen to fall into the hands of 
the Spanish Inquisition. 

JBeiiig now cpme to the latitude of 3.0 degrees^ 



SOG THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we resolved to p«t into the first trading port we 
should come at; and standing in for the shore, a 
boat came off two leagues to us, with afi old Por- 
tuguese pilot on board, who, Icnowing us to be an 
European ship, came to ofier his service, which, 
indeed, we were very glad of, and took him on 
board ; upon which, without asking us whither we 
would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and 
sent it back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to 
make the old man carry us whither we would, that 
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the 
gulf of Nanquin, which is the roost northern part 
of the coast of Chinau The old man said he knew 
the gulf of Nanqnin very well; but smiling^ asked 
us what we would do there ? 

I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase 
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silksi 
&c. and so would retura by the -same course we 
came. He told us our best port had been to have 
put in at Macao, where we could not fkil of a market 
for our opium to our satisfaction, and might, for 
our money, have purchased all sorts of China goods 
as cheap as we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited^ I 
told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants) 
and that we had a mind to g^ and see the great

city of Pekio, and tl\e famous court of the monarch 
of China. ** Why then/' says the old man» " you 
should go to Ningpo, where> by the river that 
nns into the sea there^ you may go up within five 
leagues of the great canal. This canal is a navi- 
gable made stream^ which goes through the heart 
of all that vast empire of China, crosses all the ri- 
rersy passes some considerable hills by the help of 
sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin, 
being in length near two hundred and seventy 
leagues." 

" Well/' said I, " Seignior Portuguese, but that 
is not our business now ; the great question is, if 
you can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from 
whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards ?'' Yes, 
he said, he could do so very well, and there was a 
great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. 
This gave me a little shock; a Dutch ship was 
now our terror, and we had much rather have met 
the devil, at leasi^ if he had not come in too fright- 
ful a figure ; we depended upon It that a Dutch 
ship would be our destruction, for we were in no 
condition to fight them ; all the ships they trade 
with in those parts being of great burden, and of 
much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and un* 
der some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; 
and said to me, ** Si|^ you need be under no appre*

hension of the Butch ; I suppose they are not now 
at war with your nation/*-*-" No/' said I, " that^s 
true ; but I know not what liberties men may take 
when they are out of the reach of the laws of their 
country/'—'* Why/' said he, " you are no pirates^ , 
what need you fear } They will not meddle with 
peaceable merchants, sure/' 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly 
up into my face at that word, it was hindered by 
some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to 
circulate it ; for it put me into the greatest disor- 
der and confusion imaginable ; nor was it possible 
for me to conceal it so, but that the old man easily 
perceived it, 

*' Sir/' said he, " I find you are in some disorder 
in your thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to 
go which way you think fit, and depend upon it, 
rU do you all the service I can/' — " Why, Seig- 
nior/' said I, " it is true, I am a little unsettled iu 
my resolution at this time, whither to go in parti- 
cular ; and I am something more so for what you • 
said about pirates. I hope there are no pirates in 
these seas; we are but in ill condition to meet 
with them ; for you see we have but a small for^ 
and but very weakly manned/'

not know that there have been any pirates in these 
seas these fifteen years, except one, which was seeQ»

-as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; 
but you may be assured she is gone to the south- 
ward; nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit 
for the work: she was not built for a privateer, 
but was run away with by a reprobate crew that 
were on board, after the captain and some of his 
men had been murdered by the Malaccans, at or 
near the island of Sumatra/' 

" What !" said I, seeming to know nothing of 
the matter, " did they murder the captain ?" " No," 
said he, '* I do not understand that they murdered 
him; but as they- afterwards ran away with the 
ship, it is generally believed they betrayed him 
into the bands of the Malaccans, who did murder 
him ; and, perhaps, they procured them to do it/' 
*' Why then,'* said I, *' they deserved death, as 
much as if they had done it themselves."—'^ Nay," 
said the old man, " they do deserve it, and they 
will certainly have i|; if they light upon any Eng- 
lish or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed to- 
gether, that if they meet that rogue, they will give 
him no quarter/' 

" But," said I to him, " you say the pirate is 
gone out of these seas ; how can they meet with 
him then ?"— " Why, that is true," said he, " they 
do say so ; but he was, &s I tell you, in the bay of 
Siam, in the river Cambodia, and was discovered 
there by some Dutchman ^ho belonged to the

ship> and who were left on shore when they ran 
away with her ; and some English and Dutch trad- 
ers being in the river, they were within a little of 
taking him. Nay," said he, ** if the foremost boats 
had been well seconded by the rest, they had cer* 
tainly taken him ; but he finding only two boats 
within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at 
these two, and disabled them before the others 
came up ; and then standing off* to sea, the others 
were not able to foHow him, and so he got away. 
But they have all so exact a description of the ship, 
that they will be sure to know him ; and where- 
ever they find him, they have vowed to give no 
quarter to either the captain or the seamen, but to 
hang them all up at the yard-arm." 

" What !" said I, '* will they execute them, right 
or wrong ; hang them first, and judge them after- 
wards ?"— '^ O Sir !" said the old pilot, " there is 
no need to make a formal business of it with such 
rogues as those ; let them tie them back to back, 
and set them a-diving; it is no more than they 
rightly deserve." 

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that 
he could do me no harm ; so I turned^short upon 
him. ** Well, Seignior," said I, " and this is the 
very reason why I would have you carry us to Nan- 
quin, and nflt to put back to Macao, or to any 
other part of the country where the English or

\ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 81 1 

Batch ships came ; for be it known to you^ Seig« 
nior, those captains of the English and Batch ships 
are a parcel of rash, proud> insolent fellows, that 
neither know what belongs to justice, or how to 
behave themselves as the laws of God and nature 
direct ; but being proud of their offices, and not 
understanding their power, they would act the 
muderers to punish robbers; would take upon 
them to insult men falsely accused, and determine 
them guilty without due inquiry ; and perhaps I 
may live to call some of them to an account of it, 
where they may be taught how justice is to be exe- 
cuted ; and that no man ought to be treated as a 
criminal, till some evidence may be had of the 
crime, and that he is the man/' 

With this I told him, that this was the very ship 
they had attacked ; and gave him a full account 
of the skirmish we had with their boats, and how 
foolishly and coward-like they had behaved. I 
told hini all the story of our buying the ship, and 
how the Butcbmen served us. I told him the rea- 
sons I had to believe that this story of killing the 
master by the Malaccans was not true ; as also the 
running away with the ship ; but that it was all a 
fiction of their own, to suggest that the men were 
turned pirates ; and they ought to have been sure 
it was so, before they had ventured to attack us by 
surprise, and oblige n^ to resist them ; adding, that 



312 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they would have the blood of those men who were 
killed there, in oar just defence, to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation ; and 
told us, we were very much in the right to go away 
to the north; and that if he might advise us, it 
should be to sell the ship in China, which we might 
very well do, and buy or build another in the coun- 
try ; " and," said he, " though you will not get so 
good a ship, yet you may get one able enough to 
carry you and all your goods back again to Ben- 
gal, or any where else/' 

I told him I would take his advice when I came 
to any port where I could find a ship for my turn, 
or get any customer to buy this. He replied, I 
should meet with customers enough for the ship at 
Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me 
very well to go back again; and that he would 
procure me people both to buy one and sell the 
other. 

" Well, but. Seignior," says I, " as you say they 
know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow 
^our measures, be instrumental to bring some ho- 
nest, innocent men, into a terrible broil, and, per- 
haps, be murdere^ in cold blood ; for wherever they 
find the ship, they will prove the guilt upon the 
men, by proving this was the ship, and so innocent 
men may probably be overpowered and murder- 
ed."— <' Why " said the old man, '' FU find out a

way to prevent that also ; for as I know all those 
commanders you speak of very well^ and shall see 
them alt as they pass by, I will be sure to set them 
to rights in the thing, and let them know that they 
had been so much in the wrong ; that though the 
people who were on board at first might run away 
with the ship, yet it was not true that they had 
turned pirates; and that in particular those were 
not the men that first went off with the ship, but 
innocently bought her for their trade ; and I am 
persuaded they will so far believe me; as, at least, 
to act more cautiously ibr the time to come/'-«- 
** Well,'' said I, " and will you deliver one message 
to them from me V* — " Yes, I will," says he, " if 
you will give it under your hand in writing, that I 
may be able to prove it came from you, and not 
out of my own head." I answered, that I would 
readily give it him under my hand. So I took a 
pen and ink^ and paper, and wrote at large the 
story of assaulting me with the long-boats, . &c. 
the pretended reason of it, and the unjust, cruel 
design of it; and concluded to the commanders 
that they had done what they not only should have 
been ashamed of, but also, that if ever they <;ame 
to England, and I liv^d to see them there, they 
should all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my coun- 
try were not k grown out of use before I arrived 
there. 



214 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

My old pilot tead thin oyer and oyer again, and 
asked me leyeral times if I would stand to it. I 
answered^ I woald stand to it as long as I had any- 
thing left in the world ; heing sensible that I should, 
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it 
home to them. But we had no occasion eyer to 
let the pilot carry this letter, for he neyer went 
back again. While those things were passing be- 
tween us, by way of discourse, we went forward 
directly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days 
sail, came to anchor at the south-west point of 
the great gulf of Nanquin ; where, by the way, I 
came by accident to understand, that the two 
Butch ships were gone that length before me, and 
that I should certainly fall into their hands. I 
consulted my partner again in this exigency, and 
he was as much at a loss as I was, and would yery 
gladly haye been safe on shore almost any where. 
Howeyer, I was not in such perplexity neither, but 
I asked the old pilot if there was no creek or har« 
hour, which I might put into, and pursue my busi* 
ness with the Chinese priyately, and be in no dan« 
ger of the enemy. He told me, if I would sail to 
the southward about two-and^forty leaguea» there 
was a little port called Quinchang> where the fa- 
thers of the mission usually landed from Macao, on 
their progress to teach the Christian religion to the 
Chinese, and where no European ship&eyerputin: 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 81ft 

and, if I thoaght proper to put in there^ I might 
consider what further course to take when I was on 
shore. He confessed, he said, it was not a place 
for merchants, except that at some certain times 
they had a kind of a fair there, whea the mer- 
chants from Japan came over thither to buy the 
Chinese merchandises. 

We all agreed to no back to this place : the 
name of the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps^ 
spell wrong, for I do not particularly remember it^ 
having lost this, together with the names of many 
other places set down in a little pocket-book, which 
was spoiled by the water, on an accident which I 
shall relate in its order ; but this I remember, that 
the Chinese or Japanese merchants we correspond 
with, call it by a different naihe from that whk:h 
oar Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as 
above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go 
to this place, we weighed the next day, having 
only gone twice on shore, where we were to get 
fresh water; on both which occasions the people 
of the country were very civil to us, and brought 
us abundance of things to sell to us ; I mean of 
provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls; 
but nothing without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being con- 
trary) not till five days ; bu^it was very much to 



316 THE hlFB AND ABVBJITUAES 

4)ar satisfaction, and I was joyful, and I may .iay 
thankful, when I set my foot safe on shores xeaoX^^ 
y'lng, and my partner too, that ii' it was possible t« 
dispose of ouraelyes and efiects any other way^ 
though nol every way to our satisfoction, we would 
never set. one foot on board that unhappy vessel 
again : and indeed I must acknowledge, Jkhat of all 
the circumstances of life that ever I had. any ex* 
perience of, nothing makes mankind, so completely 
miserable as that of being in constant fear* Well 
does the Scripture say, '* The fear of. man brings » 
snare;" it is a life of death, and the mind is so en* 
tirely suppressed by it, that it is capable of no. re- 
lief; the animal spirits sink, and all the vigour of 
nature, which usually supports men under other af« 
Mictions, and is present to them in the greatest ex- 
igencies, fails them. here. 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the 
fancy, by heightening every danger; representing 
the English and Dutch captains to be men inca- 
pable of hearing reason, or distinguishing between 
honest men and rogues ; or between a storj' calcu- 
lated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on pur- 
pose to. deceive, and a true genuine account of our 
whole voyage, progress, and design; for we might 
many ways have convinced any reasonable crea* 
ture that we were not pirates ; the goods we had 
on board, the course we sheered, our frankly shew- 



OjT ROBII^ON CRUSOE. «IT 

iiig onrielvtBSy and entering into such and stich ports ; 
even our Tory manner, the fbrce we had, the num- 
ber of tnen^ the fen arms, little ammuniti6n, and 
short provisions; all the^ would have served to 
convince any man that we were no pirates. The 
opium, and other goods we had on board, would 
make it appear the ' ship had been at Bengal ; the 
Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the names of all 
the men that were in the ship, might easily see 
that we were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and 
Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These, 
and many other particular circumstances, might 
have made it evident to the understanding of any 
commander, whose hands we night fall into, that 
we were no pirates. 

But fear, that blind useless passion, worked an- 
other way, and threw us into the vapours ; it be- 
wildered our understandings, and set the imagina- 
tion at work, to form a thousand terrible things, 
that, perhaps, might never happen. We first sup- 
posed, as indeed every body had related to us, that 
the seamen on board the Engli^ and Dutch ships, 
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the 
name of a pirate, and especially at our beating off 
their boats, and escaping, that they would not give ' 
themselves leave to enquire whether we were pi- 
rates or no; but would execute u» ofF-hand, as we 
call it,' without giving us any room for a defence. 



21 S THE LIFE AND ADVENTURBS 

We reflected that there was really so much appa- 
rent evidence before them» that they would scarce 
inquire after any more : as, first, that the ship was 
certainly the same, and that some of the seamen 
among them knew her, and had been on board her ; 
and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at the 
river Cambodia^ that they were coming down to 
examine us, we fought their boats, and fled: so 
that we made no doubt but they were as fully sa- 
tisfied of our being pirates, as we were satisfied of 
the contrary ; and I often said, I knew not but I 
should have been apt to have taken the like cir- 
cumstances for evidence, if the tables were turned, 
and my case was theirs ; and have made no scruple 
of cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, 
or perhaps considering, what they might have to 
ofier in their defence. 

But let that be how it will, those were our appre- 
hensions; and both my partner and I too, scarce 
slept a night without dreaming of halters and yard- 
arms; that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and 
being taken ; of kilUng, and being killed ; and one 
night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying 
the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking 
one of their seamen down, that I struck my double 
fist against the side oi the cabin I lay in, with such 
a force as wounded my hand most grievously, broke 
my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

that it not only waked me oat of my sleep, but I - 
was once afraid I should have lost two of my fingers. 
Another apprehension I had« was, of the cruel 
usage we should meet with from them, if we fell 
into their hands : then the story of Amboyna came 
into my head« and how the Dutch might, perhaps, 
torture us, as they did our countrymen there ; and 
make some of our men, by extremity of torture, 
confess those crimes they never were guilty of; 
own themselves, and all of tis, to be pirates ; and 
so they would put us to death, with a formal ap« 
pearance of justice ; and that they might be tempts 
ed to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo^ 
which was worth four or five thousand pounds, put 
all together. 

. These things tormented me, and my partner too, 
night and day ; nor did we consider that the cap- 
tains of ships hate no authority to act thus ; and 
if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they couki 
not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but 
would be accountable for it when they came into 
their own country. This, I say, gave me no satis* 
faction ; for if they will act thus with us, what ad- 
vantage would it be to us, that they would be call- 
ed to an account for it ? or, if vTe were first to be 
murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to 
have them punished when they came home ? 
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflec*

tioos I now had upon the past variety of my parti- 
cular circumstances; how hard 1 thought it was^ 
that I, who had sp^nt forty years in a life of con- 
tioued difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, 
at the port or haven which all mea drive at, viz. 
to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in 
new sorrows, by my own unhappy choice; and 
that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my 
youth, should now come to be hanged in my old 
age, and in so remote a place, for a crime I was 
not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of; 
and in a place and circumstance, where innocence 
was not like to be any protection at all to me. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would 
come in ; and I would be considering that this 
seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate Pro- 
vidence; and I ought to look upon it, and submit 
to it as such :. that although I was innocent as to 
men, I w»s far from being innocent as to my Ma- 
ker; and I ought to look in, and examine what 
other crimes in my life were mgst obvious to me, 
, and for which Providence might justly inflict this 
punishment as a retribution ; and that I ought to 
submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck, if it 
had pleased God to have brought such a disaster 
upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take 
its place ; and then I would be talking myself up 




OF ROBINSON CRUSO£« S«l 

to vigorous resolation^ that I would not be taken to 
be barbarouslyused by a parcel of merciless wretch- 
es, in cold blood ; that it was much better to have 
hiWen into the hands of the savages^ who were men<* 
eaters^ and who, I was sure, would feast upon me, 
when they had taken me, than by those who would 
perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tor- 
tures and barbarities : that, in the case of the sava- 
ges, I alWays resolved to die fighting to the last 
gasp ; and why should I not do so now, seeing it 
was much more dreadful, to me at least, to think of 
falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to 
think of being eaten by men : for the savages, 
give them their due, would not eat a man till he 
was dead ; and killed him first, as we do a bullock ; 
but that these men had many arts beyond the 
cruelty of death. Whenever these thoughts pre- 
vailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of fe- 
ver, with the agitations of a supposed fight; my 
blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was 
engaged ; and I always resolved that I would take 
no quarter at their hands ; but even at last, if I 
could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship, 
and all that was ii^ her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

But by how much the greater weight the anxieties 
and perplexities of those things were to our thoughts 
while we. were at sea> by so much the greater was

and ray partner told me he dreamed that he bad a 
▼ery heavy load upon his hack, which he was to 
carry up a hill, and found that he was not able to 
stand long under it; but the Portuguese pilot came, 
and took it off his back, and the hill disappeared, 
the ground before him shewing all smooth and 
plain : and truly it was so ; we were all like men 
who had a load taken off their backs.

Jb OR my part, I had a weight taken ofF from my 
heart> that I was not able any longer to bear; and, 
as I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea 
itt that ship. When we came on shore, the old 
pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging, 
and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, 
was much the same : it was a little house or hut, 
with a large house joining to it, all built with canes, 
and palisadoed round with large canes, to keep out 
pilfering thieves, of which it seems there were not 
a few in the country. However, the magistrates 
allowed us all a little guard, and we had a soldier 
with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, who stood sen- 
tinel at our door, 'to whom we allowed a pint of rice. 



284 THE LIFE AND ADYSirTURES 

and a little piece of money^ aboat the value of 
three-pence* per day : so that oar goods were kept 
very safe. 

The fair or mart usually kept in this fdace had 
been oyer some time ; however* me found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two Ja- 
panners, I mean ships fran Japan, with goods 
which they had bought in China, and were not 
gone away, having Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for 
us was to bring us acquainted with three mission- 
ary Romish priests^ who were in the town, and who 
bad been there some time, converting the people 
to Christianity; but we thought they made but 
poor work of it, and made them but sorry Christians 
when they had done. However, that was not our 
business. One of these was a Frenchman, whom 
they called Father Simon ; he was a jolly well-con- 
ditioned man, very free in his conversation, not 
seeming so serious and grave as the other two did, 
one of whom was a Portuguese, and the other a 
Genoese ; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in 
his manner, and very agreeable company; the 
other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and 
austere, and applied seriously to the work they 
came about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate them- 
selves among the inhabilatita ii4l|rever they had 
opportunity. We often ate and drank with those 



or II0BIN80K GRUME. M 

men; and thoagh I most coafesB, the converaiony 
ag they call il» of the Chinese to Chnitianity, is id 
far from the true converakm required to bring faea^ 
then people to the fakfa of Christ, that it aeems to 
amonnt to little more than letting them know the 
name of CbrisI, say some prayers to the Virgin 
Mary and her Son, in a tongue whieh they under^ 
stand not» and to cross themseWes, and the like ; 
yet it moat be confessed, that these religions, whom 
we call missionaries, have a &>m belief that these 
people should be fnved, and that they are the in^ 
strument of it; and, on this account, they undergo 
not only the &tigue of the voyage, and hasatds of 
living in snch places, bat oftentimes death itself, 
with, the most violent tartoMs^ lor the sake of this 
work; and it wonld be a great want of charity in 
ti% whatever opinion we have of the work itself 
and the manner of their doing it, if we should not 
have a good opinion of their neal, who undertake 
it with so many haaarda, and whp have no prospect 
of the least temporal advantage to themselves. 

But to retnrn to. my stovy : This French priest. 
Father Simon, was appomted, it seems, by order 
of the chief of the mission, to goiip to Pekin, the 
loyal seat of the Chinese emperor; And waited

scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to 
go that journey with him, telling me, how he would 
shew me all the glorious things of that mighty em- 
pire ; and among the rest, the greatest city in the 
world ; " a city/' said he, '* that your London and 
our Paris put together, cannot be equal to/' This 
was the city of Pekin, which, I confess, is very 
great, and infinitely full of people ; but as I looked 
on those things with different eyes from other men, 
so I shall give my opinion of them in few words, 
when I come, in the course of my travels, to speak 
more particularly of them. 

But first I come to my friar or missionary : Dining 
with him one day, and being very merry together, 
I shewed some little inclination to go with him; 
and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and 
with a great many persuasionsi to consent '' Why, 
Father Simon," says my partner, " why should 
you desire our company so much ? You know we 
are heretics, and you do not love us, nor can keep 
us company with any pleasure." — " O V*. says he, 
.''you may, perhaps, be good Catholics in. time; 
my business here; is to convert heathens, and who 
knows but I may copvert you too?"— '5 Very well. 
Father," said I, " so you will preach to us all the 
.^ay."-— ''I won't be troublesome to. you/' said he; 
''our religion does not divest us of good manners; 

besides/' said he, " we are all here like country*

men; and so we are, compared to the place we 
Are in ; and if yoii are Hugnenots, and 1 a Catholic, 
we may be all Christians at last ; at least/^ said he, 
*' we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so, 
without being uneasy to one another/' I liked that 
part of his discourse very well, and it began to put 
me in mind of my priest that I had left in the 
Brazils; but this Fatht^r Simon did not come up to 
his character by a great deal ; for though Father 
Simon had no appearance of a criminal levity in 
him neither, yet he had not that fund of Christian 
zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection to religion, 
that my other good ecclesiastic had, of whom I 
have said so much. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left 
us, nor soliciting us to g6 with him, but we had 
something else before us at that time ; for we had 
all this while our ship and our merchandise to dis- 
pose of; and we began to be very doubtful what 
we should do, for wd were now in a' place of very 
little business ; and once I was ab(jut to venture to 
sail for the river of Kilam, and the city of Nan^- 
quin : but Providence seemed now more visibly, as 
I thought, than ever, to concern itself in our affairs; 
and I was encouraged from this very time to think 
I should, one way or other, get out of this entang- 
led circumstance, «nd be brought home to my own 
country again, though I had not the least view of 



nB THE LIFB AND ADTBNTURES 

the manner; and when I began sometimes to think 
of it» could not imagine by what method it was to 
be done. ProTidence, I say, began here to clear 
up oar way a little; and the first thing that ofier- 
ed was* that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Ja- 
pan merchant to us, who began to inquire what 
gooisi^ had; and, in the first place, he bought 
all our opipm, and gave us a very good price for it, 
paying us in gold byweighl, some in small pieces 
of their own coin, and jome in small wedges^ of 
about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our opium, it camis into my 
bead that he inight, perhaps, deal with us for the 
ship too ;■ and I ordered the interpreter to propose 
It to him. He shrank up his shoulders at it when 
it was first proposed to him; but in a few days 
after he came to me, with one of the missionary 
priests for his interpreter, and told me he bad a 
proposal to maJce to me^ and that was this ; he had 
bought a great quantity of goods of us when he had 
no thoughts (or proposals made to him) of bu^ng 
the ship, and that, therefore, he had not money 
enough to pay for the qhip^ but if I would let the 
same men who were in the ship navigate her, he 
would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would send 
them from thence to the Philippine islands with 
another loading, which he would pay the freight of 
before they went from Ja|San; and that, at their 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. n» 

f«turn, he would buy the ship. 1 began to listen 
to this proposal; and so eager did my head still run 
upon rambling^ that I could not but begin to enter- 
tain a notion myself of going with him, and so to 
sail from the Philippine islands away to the South 
Seas ; and accordingly I asked the Japanese mer- 
chant if he would not hire uik to the Philippine is- 
lands, and discharge us there. He said, no, he could 
not do that, for then he could not have the return 
of his cargo ; but he would discharge us in Japan, 
he said, at the ship's return. Well, still I was, for 
taking iiim at that proposal, and going piyself ; but 
my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded me from 
it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas, as 
of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, treacherous 
people ; and then of the Spaniards at the Philip- 
pines, more felse, more cruel, more treacherous 
than they. 

But, to bring this long turn of our affairs to a 
conclusion, the first thing we had to do was to con- 
sult with the captain of the ship, and with the men, 
and know if they were wilting to go to Japan ; and, 
while I was doing this, the young man whom, as I 
said, my nephew had left with me as my compa- 
nion for my travels, came to me and told me that 
he thought that voyage promised very fair, and 
that there was a great' prospect of advantage, and 
he would be very gfa(f if I undertook it; but that 



SSO THE LIFE AND ADVSN TURES 

if I woulclooty and would gire him leave^ he would 
go as a merchant, or how I pleased to order him ; 
and if ever he came to England, and I was there, 
and aliv.e, he would render me a faithful account 
of his success, and it should be as much mine as I 
pleased. 

I was really loath to part with him ; but consi- 
dering the prospect of advantage, which was really 
considerable, and that he was a young fellow, as 
likely to do well in it as any 1 knew, 1 inclined to 
let him go ; but first I told him, I would consult 
my partner, and give him an answer the next day. 
My partner and I discoursed about it, and my 
partner made a most generous offer : he told me, 
'' You know it has been an unlucky ship, and we 
both resolve not to go to sea in it again ; if your 
steward (so he called my man) will venture the 
voyage, I'll leave my share of the vessel to him, 
^nd let him make the best of it ; and if we live 
to meet in England, and he meets with success 
abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits 
of the ship's freight to us, the other shall b^ his 



own/* 



If my partner, who was no way concerned with 
my young man, made him such an offer, I could 
d6 no less than ofier him the same; and all the 
ship's company being willing to go with him, we 
made over half the ship to him in ptoperty, and 
i 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 231 

^ took a writing from him, obliging him to account 

I for the other ; and away he went to Japan. The 



Japan merchant proyed a very punctual honest man 
to him, protected him at Japan, and got him a 
license to come on shore, which the Europeans in 
general have not lately obtained, paid him his freight 
very punctually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded 
him with Japan and China wares, and a supercargo 
of their own, who trafficking with the Spaniards, 
brought back European goods again, and a great 
quantity of cloves and other spice ; and there he 
was not only paid his freight very well, and at a 
very good price, but being not willing to sell the 
ship then, the merchant furnished him with goods 
on his own account; that for some money and 
some spices of his own, which he brought with 
him, he went back to the Manillas^ to the Spaniards, 
where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having 
gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his 
ship made a free ship ; and the governor of Manilla 
hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the 
coast of Mexico ; and gave him a license to land 
there, and travel to Mexico ; and to pass in any 
Spanish ship to Europe, with all his men* 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, 
and there he sold his ship; and having there also 
obtained allowance t^ travel by land to Porto Bello, 
he found Bie%|i3» some how or other« to goi to Ja«

after came to Eogtand^ ezoeeding rich ; of which I 
shall take notice in its place ; in the mean tinfte, I 
retom to onr particolar affiurs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's coi»* 

pany, it came before ns, of ooon^ to consider what 

recompense we should give to the two men that 

gave OS such timely notice of the design against as 

in the river of Cambodia. The troth wa% they had 

done OS a considerable service and deserved wdl 

at onr hands ; though* by the way, they were a 

conple of rogues too : for, as they believed the 

story of our being pirates, and that we had really 

run away with the ship, they came down to us^ Bot 

only to betray the design that was formed againsft 

us, but to go to sea with us as pirates ; and one of 

them confessed afterwards, that nothing else baft 

the hopes of going a^roguing brought him to do it. 

Hou'ever, the service they did us was not the less; 

and therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to 

them, I first ordered the money to be paid to them, 

which thejr said was due to them on board their 

respective ships; that is to say, the Englishman 

nineteen months pay, and to the Dutchman seven^ 

^nd, over and above that, i gave each of them a 

small sum of money in gold, which contented them 

very well : then I made the Englishman gunner of 

the ship, the gunner being now made second mate 



OF BOBIXSON CRUSOE. SSS 

tod parser ; the Dutchman I made boatswain : so 
they were both very well pleased, and proved very 
serviceable^ being both able seamen^ and very 
stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China. If I thought 
myself banished^ and remote from my own coun. 
try at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home 
for ray money, what could I think of myself now, 
when I was gotten about a thousand leagues far* 
ther off from home, and perfectly destitute of all 
manner of prospect of return ! 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
months time there was to be another fair at that 
place where we were, and then we might be able 
to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the 
country, and withal might possibly find some Chv« 
nese junks or vessels from Nanquin, that would be 
to be soki, and would carry us and oar goods whi«» 
ther we pleased. This I liked very well, and re- 
solved to watt ;• besides, as our particular persons 
were not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch 
ships came thither, perhaps we might have an op- 
portunity to load our goods, and get passage to 
seme other place in India nearer home. 

Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; 
bat* to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour- 
lues into the country ; firsts we went ten days jour- 
ney to see the city pf Nanquid, a city well worth 



ffS4 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

•eeiDg indeed : they say it has a million of people 
ii> k ; which, however, I do not believe : it is re- 
gularly built, the streets all exactly straight^ and 
cross one another in direct lines, which gives the 
figure of it great advantage. 

But when I came to compare the miserable peo- 
ple of these countries with ours; their fabrics, their 
manner of living, their government, their religion, 
their wealth, and their glory (as some call it), I 
must confess, 1 do not so much as think it worth 
naming, or worth my while to write of, or any that 
shall come after me to read. 

It is very observable, that we wonder at the 
grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the 
government, the manufactures, the ccmimerce, and 
the conduct of these people ; not that they are to 
be wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be re- 
garded ; but because, having first a notion of the 
barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the 
ignorance that prevail there, we do not expect to 
find any such things so far ofi^ 

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the pala- 
ces and royal buildings of Europe ? What theip 
trade to the miversal commerce of England, Hol- 
land, France, and Spain } What their cities to ours, 
for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furni- 
ture, and an infinite variety ? What atf their ports^ 
mpplied with % few junks and barks^ to oor uavi- : 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SS& 

gation, our merchants' fleets, our large and power* 
ful navies? Our city of London has more trade 
than all their mighty empire. One English^ or 
Dutch, or French man of war of eighty guns, would 
fight with and destroy all the shipping of China, 
But the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the 
power of their government, and strength of their 
armies, are surprising to us, because, as I have said, 
considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans, 
little better than savages, we did not expect such 
things among them ; and this, indeed, is the ad- 
vantage with which all their greatness and power 
is represented to us : otherwise, it is in itself no- 
thing at all ; for, as I have said of their ships, so it 
may be said of their armies and troops; all the 
forces of their empire, though they were to bring 
two millions of men into the field together, would 
be able to do nothing but ruin the country, and 
starve themselves. If they were to besiege a 
strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplined 
army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of French 
cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of China ; a 
million of their foot could not stand befoie one em- 
battled body of our infantry, posted so as not to 
be surrounded, though they were not to be one to 
twenty in number : nay, I do not boast, if I say, 
that 30,000 (Urman er English foot, and 10,000 
French horse, would fairly be^t all ^e forces of.

China. And so of our fortified towns, and of the 
art of our engineers, in assaulting and defending 
towns ; there is not a fortified town in China could 
hold out one month against the batteries and at- 
tacks of an European army ; and at the same time, 
all the armies of China could never take snch a 
town as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved ; no, 
taot in ten years siege. They have fire-arms, it is 
true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and uncertain 
in going off; they have powder, but it is of no 
strength ; they have neither discipline in the field, 
exercise in their arms, skill to attack, nor temper 
to retreat. And therefore I must confess it seemed 
strange to me when I came home, and heard our 
people say such fine things of the power, riches, 
glory,^ magnificence, and trade of the Chinese, be- 
cause I saw and knew that they were a contenl)>ti- 
ble herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, sub- 
jected to a government qualified only to rule such 
a people ; and, in a word, for I am now launched 
quite beside my design, I say, in a word, were not 
its distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, 
and were not the Muscovite empire almost as rude, 
impotent, and ill-governed a crowd of slaves as they, 
the czar of Muscovy might, with much ease, drive 
them all out of their country, and conquer them in 
one campaign ; and had the czar, who I since hear 
is a growing prince, and begins to appear fbrmU

tacking the warlike Swedes, in which attempt none 
of the powers of Europe would have enyied or in* 
terrupfced him ; he might* by this time, have been 
emperor of China, instead of being beaten by the 
king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not 
one to six in number. As their strength and their 
grandeur, so their navigation, commerce, and hus- 
bandry, are imperfect and impotent, compared to 
the same things in Europe. Also, in their know* 
ledge, their learning, their skill in the sciences; 
they have globes and spheres, and a smatch of the 
knowledge of the mathematics; but when yoii 
come to inquire into their knowledge, how short- 
sighted are the wisest of their students ! They 
know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies; 
and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when Uie 
ann is eclipsed, they think it is a great dragon has 
assaulted and run away with it ; and they fall a- 
clattering with all the drums and kettles in the 
country, to fright the monster away, just as we do 
|o hive a swarm of bees. 

As this is the only excunion of this kind which 
I have made in all the account I have given of my 
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of 
countries and people : it is none of my business, or 
any part of my design ; but giving an account of

wandeiingSj and a long variety of changes, which 
perhaps, few have heard the like of, I shall say 
nothing of the mighty places, desert countries, and 
nmneroos people, I have yet to pass through, 
more than relates to my own story, and which my 
concern among them will make necessary. I was 
BOW, as near as I can compute, in the heart of 
China, about the latitude of thirty degrees north 
of the line, for we were returned from NaBK]fatn ; 
I had indeed a mind to see the 'city of Pekin, which 
I had heard so much of, and Father Simon impor- 
tuned me daily to do it. At length his time of 
going away being set, and the other missionary 
who was to go with him, being arrived from 
Macoa, it was necessary that we should resolve 
either to go, or not to go ; so I referred him to 
my partner, and left it wholly to his choice ; who 
at length resolved it in the affirmative; and we 
prepared for our journey. We set out with very 
good advantage, as to finding the way ; for we got 
leave to travel in the retinue of one of their man- 
darins, a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate; 
in the province where they reside, and who take 
great state upon them, travelling with great atten- 
dance, and with great homage from the people; 
who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them*, 
because all the countries they pass through are 
[ obliged to furnish provisions for thei% and all 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S30 

their attendants. That which I particularly ob- 
served, as to our travelling with his baggage, was 
this; that though we received sufficient provi« 
sions, both. for ourselves. and our horses, from the 
country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we 
were obliged to pay for every thing we had after 
the market-price of the country, and the mandarin's 
steward> or commissary of the provisions, collected 
it duly from us ; so that our travelling in the re- 
tinue of the mandarin, though it was a very great 
kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in 
him, but was, indeed, a great advantage to him> 
considering there were about thirty other people 
travelling in the same manner besides us, under 
the protection of his retinue, or, as we may call 
it, under his convoy^ This, I say, was a great 
advantage to him ; for the country furnished all 
the provisions for nothing, and he took all our 
money for them. 

. We were five-and-twenty days trarelling to 
Pekin, through a country infinitely populous, but 
miserably cultivated; the husbandry, oeconomy, 
and the way of living, all very miserable, though 
they boast so much of the industry of the people : 
I say miserable ; and so it is ; if we, who under- 
stand how to live, were to endure it, or to compare 
it with o^r own ; but not so to these poor wretchei^ 
fvho kncyr no other. The pride of these people is 



SID THB LIFE AND ADVENTUEES 

infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their 
poverty, which adds to that which I call their 
misery. I mast needs think the naked savages 
of America live much more happy, because, as 
they have nothing, so they desire nothing ; where- 
as these are proud and insolent, and, in the main, 
are mere beggars and drudges ; their ostentation 
is inexpressible, and is chiefly shewed in their 
clothes and buildings, and in the keeping multi- 
tudes of servants or slaves, and, which is to the 
last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the 
world but themselves. 

I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after- 
wards, in the desartsand vast wildernesses of Grand 
Tartary, than here ; and yet the roads here are well 
paved and well kept, and very convenient for tra* 
Tellers; but nothing was more awkward to mo 
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent 
people, in the midst of the grossest simplicity and 
ignorance ; for all their famed ingenuity is no more. 
My friend Father Simon, and I, used to be very 
merry upon these occasions, to see the beggarly 
pride of those people. For example, coming by 
the house of a country-gentleman, as Father Simon 
called him, about ten leagues off from the city of 
Nanquin, we had, first of all, the honour to ride 

frith the master of the house about two miles; 

1 



OF ROBINSON CRU60£. 841 

the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism^ 
being a mixtare of pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for 
a scararaoach, or merry-andrefv; being a dirty 
calico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's 
coat, such as hanging sleeves^ tafifety^ and cots 
and slashes almost on every side; it covered a 
rich taflfety vest, as greasy as a butcher, and which 
testified, that his honour must needs be a most 
exquisite sloven. 

His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling 
creature, such as in England might sell ibr about 
thirty or forty shillings; and he had two slaves 
followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature 
along : he had a whip in his hand, and he bela- 
boured the beast as fast about the head as his staves 
did about the tail ; and thus he rode by us with 
about ten or twelve servants : and we were told he 
was going from the city to his country*seat, about 
half a league before us. We travelled on gently, 
but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us; 
and as we stopped at a village about an hour to rth 
fresh us, when we came by the country-seat of this 
great man, we saw him in a little place before his 
door, eating his repast ; it was a kind of a garden, 
but he was easy to be seen ; and we were given tb 
understand, that the more we looked on him, Uie 
better he would be pleased. 

VOL. III. a

He sat imder a tree, somethiog like the palmetto- 
tree, which efifectnally shaded him over the head, 
and on the south side; but under the tree also was 
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look 
well enough : he sat lolling back in a great elbow- 
chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat 
being brought him by two women-slaves : he had 
two more, whose office, I think, few gentlemen 
in Europe would accept of their service in, viz. 
one fed the 'squire with a spoon, and the other 
held the dish with one hand, and scraped off what 
he let iisdl upon his worship's beard and taffety vest, 
with the other ; while the great fat brute thought 
it below him to employ his own hands in any of 
iboae familiar offices, which kings and monarchs 
would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy 
fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pain men's pride 
.puts them -to, and how troublesome a haughty tem- 
per, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of common 
sense; and, leaving the poorvrretch to please him- 
self with our looking at him, as if we admired his 
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him, 
we pursued our journey; only Father Simon had 
the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dain- 
ties the country justice had to feed on, in all his 
state ; which he said he had the honour to taste of, 

and which was, I think, a dose that an English

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S W 

hound would scarce have eaten^ if it had been 
<^red him, viz. a mess of boiled rice, with a great 
piece of garlick in it, and a little bag filled with 
green pepper, and another plant 'which they have 
there, something like our ginger, but smelling like 
musk, and tasting like mustard : all this was put 
together, and a small lump or piece of lean mutton 
boiled in , it ; and this was his worship's r^past^ 
four or five servants more attending at a distance. 
If he fed them meaner than he was fed himself^, 
the spice excepted, they must fare ^ery coarsely 
indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was respected like a king ; surrounded always with 
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a 
distance ; but this I observed, that there was not 
a horse in his retinue, but that our carriers' pack- 
horses in England seem to me to look much better; 
but they were so covered with equipage, mantles, 
trappings^ and such-like. trumpery, that you can- 
not see whether they are fat or lean. In a word, 
we could scarce see any thing but their feet and 
their heads. 

. I was now light-hearted, and all my tronble and 
perplexity that I had given an account of being 
over, I had no anxious thoughts about me; which 
made this journey much the pleasanter to me: 



344 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in 
the passing or fording a smaU river, my horse fel], 
and made me free of the country, as Uiey call it : 
that is to say, threw me in : the place was not 
deep, but it wetted me all oyer : I mention it, be- 
cause it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had 
set down the names of seyeral people and places 
which I had occasion to remember, and which not 
taking due care of, the leaves it)tted, and the words 
.were neyer after to be read, to my great loss as to 
the names of some places which I touched at in 
this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Piekin : I had nobody 
with me but the youth, whom my nephew the cap* 
lain had given me to attend me as a servant, and 
who proved very trusty and diligent; and my 
partner had nobody with him but one servant, who 
was a kinsman. A.s for Uie Portuguese pilot, he 
being desirous to see the court, we gave him his 
passage, that is to say, bore his charges for his com- 
pany; and to use him as an interpreter, for he 
understood the language of the country, and spoke 
good French and a little English ; and, indeed, ^lis 
old man^was a most useful implement to us every 
where; for we had not been above a week at Pe- 
kin, when he came laughing: ''Ah, Seignor In- 
glese,'' said he, «' I have something to tell yoti, 
will make your heart glad/'«-»<<My heart glad V^ said 
I; ''what can that be? I don't know any thing in 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S45 

this country can either give me joy or griefs to any 
great degree."— ''Yes» yea/' said the old man, in 
broken £ngUsh» ''make you glad, me sorrow;'' 
sorry, he would have said. This made me more 
inquisitive. ** Why/' said I, '' will it make you 
sorry ?" — " Because/' said he, " you have brought 
me here twenty-five days journey, and will leave 
me to go back alone ; and which way shall I get 
to my port afbrwards, without a ship, without a 
horse, without pecune?'' so he called money; 
being his broken Latin, of which he had abun- 
dance to make us merry with. 

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of 
Muscovy and Polish merchants in the city, and 
that they were preparing to set out on their journey 
by land, to Muscovy, within four or five weeks, 
and he was sure we would take the opportunity to 
go with them, and leave him behind to go back 
alone. I confess I was surprised with this news : 
a secret jpy spread itself over my whole soul, which 
I cannot describe, and never felt before or since ; 
and I had no power, for a good while, to speak a 
word to the old man ; but at last I turned to him : 
"How do you know this?" said I: ** are you sure 
it is true?" — ^Yes," he said, ''I met this morning 
in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Ar- 
menian, or one you call a Grecian, who is among - 
them; he came last from Astracan, and was de- 
signing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew 



846 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

hiin> but has altered hu mind, and is now resolved 
to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and so 
down the river of Wolga to Astracan." — *^ Well, 
Seignor/' said I, ** do not be uneasy about being 
left. to go back alone ; if this be a method- for my re- 
turn to England, it shall be your fault if- 1 go 
back to Macao at all/' We then went to con- 
sult together what was to be done, and I ask- 
ed my partner what he thought of the pilot's 
news, and whether it would suit with his affairs : 
he told me he would do just as I would ; for he had 
settled all his aflairs so well at Bengal, and left 
his effects in such good hands, that as we made a 
good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks 
wrought and raw, such as might be worth the car- 
riage, he would be content to go to England, and 
then make his voyage back to Bengal by the 
Company's ships.

riAyiMG .resolved upon this^ we agreed^ that« if 
our Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would 
bear his charges to Moscow, or to England^ if he 
pleased ; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over- 
generous in that part neither, if we had not re- 
warded him farther ; for the service he had done 
us was really worth all that, and more; for he had 
not ooly been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been 
also like a broker for us on shore ; and his pro- 
curing for us the Japan merchant was some hundreds 
of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted together 
about it; and, being willing to gratify him, which ' 



848 THB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

was, indeed, but doing him justice, and very willing 
also to have him with us beside^ for he was a most 
necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to gWe 
him a quantity of coined gold, which as I compute 
it, caikie to about one hundred and seventy- five 
pounds sterling between us, and to bear his charges, 
both for himself and horse, except only a horse to 
carry his goods. 

Having settled this among ourselves, we called 
him to leit him know what we had resolved : 1 told 
him, he had complained of our being like to let 
him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we 
were resolved he should not go back at all : that 
as we had resolved to go to £urope with the ca- 
ravan, we resolv^ also he should go with 09, and 
that we called him to know his mind. He shook 
his head, and said it was a long journey, and he 
had no pecune to carry htm thither, nor to subsist 
himself when he came thither. We told him, we 
believed it was so, and therefore we had resolved 
to do something for him, that should let him see 
how sensible we were of the service he had done 
us; and also how agreeable he was to us: and 
then I told him what we had resolved to give him 
here, which he might lay out as we would do our 
own ; and that as for his charges, if he would go 
with jus; we would set him safe ashore (life and 
pasn^ties excepted,) either in Muscovy or in Eng- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. U9 

Iftndy which he wonld, at our own charge, except 
only the carnage of his goods. 

He receiTed the proposal like a man transported, 
and ^ told us, he would go with us over the whole 
woHd ; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves 
for the journey. However, as it was with us, so 
it was with the other merchants, they had many 
things to do ; and instead of heing ready in five 
weeks, it was four months and some odd days be« 
fore all things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, 
when we set out from Pekin. My partner and the 
old pilot had gone express back to the port where 
we had first put in, to dispone of some goods which 
we had left there ; and I, with a Chinese mer- 
chant, whom I had some knowledge of at Na^ 
quin, and who came to Pekin on his own afiain^ 
went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of 
fine damasks, with about tifo hundred pieces of 
other very fine silks, of several sorts, some mixed 
with gold, and had all these brought to Pekili 
against my partner's return : besides this, we bought 
a very large quantity of raw silk, and some other 
goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods only, 
to about three thousand five hundred pounds ster* 
ling, which, together with tea, and some fine cali- 
coes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and cloves^ 
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besklet 



250 THE LIFB AND ADYBNTURES 

those we rode upon; which/ with two or thsee- 
spare horses, and two horses loaded with proTisiona^^ 
made us, in short, twenty-six eameh and horses ia 
our retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hun* 
dred horses and camels, and upward of a hundred 
and twenty men, very well anned, and provided for 
all events. For, as the eastern caravans are sab-* 
ject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by 
the Tartars; but they are ctot altogether so danger* 
ous as theArabs, nor so barbarous when they pre-* 
vail. 

The company consisted of people of several nst- 
tions, such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were 
about sixty of them who were merdiants or inha- 
bitants of Moscow, though of them some were Li- 
Yonians : and to our particular satisfaction, five of 
them were Scots, who appeared also to be men of 
great experience ini business^ and very good sub* 
stance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the 
gentlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the 
passengers, except the servants, to a great council, 
as they terOied it. At this great council every one 
deposited a certain quantity of money to a common 
stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage 



OF aOBINSOH CRUSOE. 251 

on the way, where ifc was not otherwise to be had« 
and for satisfying the guides, gettiug horses, and 
the like. And here they constituted the journey, 
as they called it, viz. they named captains and of- 
ficers to draw us all up, and give the command in 
case of an attack ; and gave every one their turn of 
command. Nor was this forming us into order any 
more than what we found needful upon the way, 
as shall be observed in its place. 

The road all on thb side of the country is very 
populous, and is full of potters and earth-makers ; 
that is to say, people that tempered the earth for 
the China ware; and, as I was going along, our 
Portuguese pilot, who had always something or 
other to say to make us merry, came sneering to 
me, and told me, he would shew the greatest ra- 
rity in all the country ;~ and that I should have this 
to say of China, after all the ill-humoured things 
I had said of it, that I had seen one thing which 
was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was 
very importunate to know what it was ; at last he 
told me, it was a gentleman's house, built all with 
China ware. " Weil,'' said I, " are not the mate- 
rials of their building the product of their own 
country; and so it is all China ware, is it not ?''-*- 
*f No, no," says he, '' I mean, it is a house all made 
of China ware, such as you call so in England; 
Of, as it is called ip our country, pojrqelain."— 



»3 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

''Well/' said I, ** rach a thiog may be : how tug 
is it ? can we carry it in a box upon a camel ? If 
we can, we will buy it.''-*-'' Upon a camel !" said 
tbe old pilot, holding op both his hands ; ** why, 
there is a family of thirty pe(^le lives in it.'' 

I was then carious, indeed, to see it; and wh«i 
I came to see it, it was nothing but this : it was a 
timber houses or a house built, as we call it in 
England, with lath and plaster, but all the plas- 
tering was really China ware, that is to say, it was 
plastered with the earth that makes China ware. 

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfectly white, and 
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware 
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been 
bornt As to the inside, all the walls, instead of 
waiawot, were lined with hardened and painted 
tiles, like the little square til^ we call galley tiles 
in England, all made of the finest china, and the 
figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary 
yariety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles 
making but one figure, but joined so artificially 
with mortar, being made of the same earth, that it 
was very hard to see where the tiles met The 
floors of the rooms were of the same composition, 
and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in 
several parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, 
Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c. as hard a^ 



OF KOBINSON CRUSOE. ^9 

stone^ and smooth, but not burnt and painted, ex- 
cept some smaller rooms, like closets, which were 
all, as it were, paved with the same tile : the 
ceilings, and in a word, all the plastering work in 
the whole house, were of the same earth; and, 
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the 
same, but of a deep shining black. 

This was a china warehouse indeed, truly and 
literally to be called so ; and had I not been upon 
the journey, I could have staid some days to see 
and examine the particulars of it. They told me 
there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, 
all paved at the bottom and sides with the same, 
and fine statues set up in rows on the walks, en* 
tirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt 
whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so 
they may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very 
sure they excel in their accounts of it ; for they 
told me such incredible things of their performance 
in crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to 
relate, as knowing it could not be truc-^— One told 
me, in particular, of a workman that made a ship, 
with all its tackle, and masts, and sails, in earthen- 
ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he had 
told me he launched it, and made a voyage to 
Japan in it, I might have said something to it in- 
deed; but as it was, I knew the whole story, which 



854 TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

was^ in short, asking pank>n for the word» that the 
fellow lied ; so I smiled, and said nothing to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the 
caravan, for which the leader of it for the day fin- 
ed me about the value of three shillings ; and told 
me, if it had been three days journey without the 
wall, as it was three days within, he must have 
fined me four times as much, and made . me ' ask 
pardon the next council-day : so I promised to be 
more orderly ; for, indeed, I foond afterwards the 
orders made for keeping all together were abso- 
lutely necessary for our common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China 
wall, made for a fortification against the Tartars ; 
and a very great work it is, going over hills and 
mountains in an endless track, where the rocks are 
impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy 
could possibly enter, or, indeed, clin»b up, or where 
if they did^ no wall could hinder them. They tell 
us, its length is near a thousand English miles, but 
that the country is five hundred, in a straight 
measured line, which the wall bounds, without 
measuring the windings and turnings it takes : it is 
about, four fathom high, and as many thick in 
some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without 
trespassing on our orders, for so l«ng the caravan 
was in passing the gate ; I say, I stood still an 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 255 

hour to look at it^ on every side, near and far off; 
I n^ean^ what was within my view ; and the guide 
of onr caravan, who had been extolling it for the 
wonder of the world, was mighty eager to hear my 
opinion of it, I told him it was a most excellent 
thing to keep off the Tartars, which he happened 
not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for 
a compliment : but the • old pilot laughed : '' O 
Seignior Inglese,'' said he, " you speak in colours/' 
— " In colours !" said X ; " what do you mean by 
that ?''— « Why, you speak what looks white this 
way, and black that wa^; gay one way, and dull 
another way : you tell him it is a good wall to 
keep out Tartars; you tell me, by that, it is good 
for nothing but to keep out Tartars ; 'or, will keep 
out none butTartars. I understand you. Seignior In- 
glese, I understand you,'' said he, joking; "but 
Seignior Chinese understand you his own way." 

"Well," said I, "Seignior, do you think it 
would stand out an army of our country-people, 
with a good train of artillery; or our engineers, 
with two companies of miners ? Would they not 
batter it doWn in ten days, that an army might 
enter in battalia, or blow it up in the air, founda- 
tion and all, that there should be no sign of it 
left ?"— " Ay, ay," said he, " I know that." The 
Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, 
and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after. 



256 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for we were then almost out of tbeir country, and 
he was to leave us in a little time aflerwards; but 
when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all 
the rest of the way, and we heard no more of hia 
fine story of the Chinese power and greatness while 
be staid. 

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called 
a wall, something like the Picts wall, so famous in 
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we 
began to find the country thinly inhabited, and the 
people rather confined to live in fortified towns 
and cities, as being subject to the inroads and de- 
predations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, 
and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked 
inhabitants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the necessity of keep* 
ing together in a caravan, as we travelled ; for we 
saw several troops of Tartars roving about ; but 
when I came to see them distinctly, I wondered 
how that the Chinese empire could be conquered 
by such contemptible fellows ; for they are a mere 
herd or crowd of wild fellows, keeping no onler, 
and understanding no discipline, or manner of fight 

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, 
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing ; and this 
we found the first day we saw them, which was 
after we entered the wilder part of the country. 
Our leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29t 

of US to go a-hunting, as they call it; and what 
was this but hunting of sheep *. However, it may 
be called hunting too ; for the creatures are the 
wildest, and swiftest of foot, that ever I saw of their 
kind; only they will not run a great way, and you 
are sure of sport when you* begin the chase ; for 
they appear generally by thirty or forty in a flock, 
and, like true sheep, always keep together when 
they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our 
hap to meet with about forty Tartars: whether 
they were hunting mutton as we were, or whether 
they looked for another kind of prey, I know not ; 
but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a 
kind of horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound 
that I had never heard before, and, by the way, 
never care to hear again. We all supposed this 
was to call their friends about them; and so it 
was; for in less than half a quarter of an hour, a 
troop of forty or fifty more appeared at about a 
mile distance; but our work was over first, as it 
happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow hap- 
pened to be amongst us ; and as soon as he heard 
the hom« he told us, in short, that we had nothing 
to do but to charge them immediately, without loss 
of time ; and, drawing us up in a line, he asked, 
if we were resolved ? We told him, we were ready 

VOL. III. R 



258 THE LIFB AND ADYBNTUREB 

to follow him: so be rode directly up to them. 
They stood gazing at us^ like a me^e crowd, drawn 
up in no order, nor shewing the face of any order 
at all ; but as soon as they saw ue advance, they 
let fly their arrows ; which, however, missed us very 
happily ^ it seems they mistook not their aim, bat 
their distance ; for their arrows all fell a little short 
of us, but with so true an aim« that had we been 
about twenty ys^rds nearer, we must have had 
several men wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted ; and though it was at a 
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bul- 
lets for wooden arrows, following our shot iull gal- 
lop, resolving to fall in among them sword in hand; 
for so our bold Scot that led us, directed. He was, 
indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that 
vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with 
such a cool courage too, that I never saw any man 
in action fitter for command. As soon as we came 
up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and 
then drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion 
imaginable ; the only stand any of them .made was 
on our right, where three of them stood, and by 
signSj called the rest to come back to them, having 
a kind of scymitar in their hands, and their bows 
hanging at their backs. Our brave commander, 
without asking any body to follow him, galloped 
up close to them, and with his fusil knocked one of 

3 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2A9 

them oflPhis horse, killed the second with his pistol, 
and the third ran away; and thas ended our fight; 
but we had this misfortune attending it, viz. that 
all our mutton that we had in chase got away. We 
had not a man killed or hurt ; but, as for the Tar- 
tars, there were about five of them killed ; how 
many were wounded, we knew not ; but this we 
knew, that the other party was so frighted with the 
noise. of our gunsy that they fled, and never made 
any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, 
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as.after* 
wards; but in about five days we entered a vast 
great wild desert, which held us three days and 
nights march ; and we were obliged to carry our 
water with us in great leather bottles, and to en- 
camp all night, just as I have heard they do in the 
deserts of Arabia, 

I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in ? 
and they told me this was a kind of border that 
might be called No Man's Land ; being part of the 
Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary.; but that, how- 
ever, it was reckoned to. China; that there was no 
care taken h^re to preserve it firom the inroads of 
thieves; and therefore it was reckoned the worst 
desert in the whole march, though we were to go 
over some much larger. 

In passing this wikiemes?, which, I confess, was 



SflO THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

at the first view Tery fiightfal to me^ i»e saw two 
or three times little parties of the Tartars, but they 
seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have 
no design upon us ; and so, like the man who met 
the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had 
nothing to say to them ; we let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came so near as 
to stand and gaze at us ; whether it was to consider 
what they should do, viz. to attack us, or not at- 
tack us, we knew not ; but when we were passed 
at some distance by them, we made a rear guard of 
forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the 
caravan pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us. 
After a while they marched off, only we found they 
assaulted us with five arrows at their parting ; one 
of which wounded a horse, so that it disabled him ; 
and we led him the next day, poor creature, in 
great need of a good farrier. We suppose they 
might shoot more arrows, which might fall short 
of us; but we saw no more arrows, or Tartars, at 
that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
being not so good, as at first, though still in the 
dominions of the emperor of China ; but lay, for 
the most part, in villages, some of which were for- 
tified, because, of the incursions of the Tartars. 
When we came to one of these towns (it was about 
two days and a half's journey before we were to 



OF R0BIN80N CRUSOE. 80& 

come to the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a 
came], of which there are plenty to be sold all the 
way upon that road, and of horses also, such as 
they are, because so many carayans coming that 
way, they are very often wanted. The person that 
I spoke to, to get me a camel, would have gone and 
fetched it for me ; but I, like a fool, must be offi- 
cious, and go myself along with him. The place 
was about two miles out of the village, where, it 
seems, they kept the camels and horses feeding 
under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in com- 
pany, and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of 
a little variety. When we came to this place, it 
was a low marshy ground, walled round with a 
stone wall, piled up dry, without mortar or earth 
among it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese 
soldiers at the doors. Having bought a camel, and 
agreed for the price, I came away ; and the Chinese 
man, that went with me, led the camel, when on a 
sudden came up five Tartars on horseback ; two of 
them seized the fellow, and took the camel from 
him, while the other three stepped up to me and 
my old pilot ; seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I 
bad no weapon about me but my sword, which 
could but ill defend me against three horsemen. 
The first that came up stopped short upon my 
drawing my svrord, (for they are arrant cowards;} 



868 THE UFE AND ADVENTURES 

but a second coming upon my left, gave me a blofr 
on the heady which I never felt till afterwards, and 
wondered, when I came to myself, what was the 
matter with me, and where I was, for he laid me 
flat on the ground ; but my never-failing old pilol^ 
the Portuguese (so Providence, unlooked for, di- 
rects deliverances from dangers, which to us are 
unforeseen,) had a pistol in his pocket, which I 
knew nothing of hor the Tartars neither; if they 
had, I suppose they ^ould not have attacked ns ; 
but cowards are always boldest when there is no 
danger. 

The old man, seeing me down, with ^ bold heart 
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and 
laying hold of his arm with one hand, and palling 
him down by main force a little towards him with 
the other, he shot him into the head; and laid him 
dead on the spot ; he then immediately stepped up 
to him who had stopped us, as I said, and before he 
could come forward again (for it was all done as it 
were in a moment] made a biow at him with a 
scymitar, which he always Wore, but missing the 
man, cut his horse into the side of his head, cut 
one of his ears off by the root, and a great slice 
down the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged 
with the wounds, was no more to be governed by 
his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too ; but 
away he flew, and carried him quite out of the 



OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. «63 

pilot's reach; and, at some distance, rising upon 
his hind legs^ threw down the Tartar, and fell 
upon him. 

In this interval the poor Chinese came in, who 
bad lost the camel, but he had no weapon ; how- 
ever, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen 
upon him, he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly- 
ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, something 
like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe either, he 
wrenched it from him, and made shift to knock his 
Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man had 
the third Tartar to deal with still ; and, seeing he 
did not fly as he expected, nor come on to fight 
him, as he apprehended, but stood stock still, the 
old man stood still too, and falls to work with his 
tackle to chsurge his pistol again : but as soon as 
the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it 
to be the same or another, I know not ; but away 
he scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called 
him afterwards, a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for I thought, 
when I first began to awake, that I had been in a 
sweet sleep ; but as I said above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was 
the matter : in a word, a few minutes after, as sense 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where; 
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody; then I felt my head ache, and then, in 



264 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

another moment, memory returned, and every thing 
was present to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got 
hold of my sword, but no enemies in yiew. I 
found a Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing very 
quietly by him; and looking farther, I saw my 
champion and deliverer, who had been to see what 
the Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger 
in his hand. The old man, seeing me on my feet, 
came running to me, and embraced me with a great 
deal of joy, being afraid before that I had been kil- 
led ; and seeing me bloody, would see how I was 
hurt ;- but it was not much, only what we call a 
broken head; neither did I afterwards find any 
great inconvenience from the blow, other than the 
place which was hurt, and which was well again in 
two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this vic- 
tory ; for we lost a camel, and gained a horse : but 
that which was remarkable, when we came back to 
the village, the man demanded to be paid for the 
camel ; I disputed it, and it was brought to a 
hearing before the Chinese judge of the place ; that 
is to say, in English, we went before a justice of 
the peace. Give him his due, he acted with a 
great deal of prudence and impartiality ; and having 
heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man 
that went with me to buy th(^ camel, whose servant 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 885 

he was } '' I am no servant/' said he, " but went 
with the stranger."—*' At whose request?" said 
the justice. " At the stranger's request," said he. 
** Why then/' said the justice, •' you were the stran* 
ger's servant for the time; and the camel being 
delivered to his servant, it was delivered to him, 
and he must pay for h/' 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not 
a word to say ; but admiring to see such just rea- 
soning upon the consequence, and so accurate sta- 
ting the case, I paid willingly for the camel, and 
sent for another ; but you may observe, / sou for 
it ; I did not go to fetch it myself any more ; I had 
had enough of that. ' 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese 
empire : they call it fortified, and so it is, as forti- 
fications go there ; for this I will venture to affirm, 
that all the Tartars in Karakathy, which, I believe, 
are some millions, could not batter down the walls 
with their bows and arrows ; but to call it strong, 
if it were attacked with cannon, would be to make 
those who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, about two days jour- 
ney of this city, when messengers were sent express 
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and 
caravans to halt, till they had a guard sent to them; 
fi>r that an oaosual body of Tartars, making ten 



S60 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about 
thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers; however, 
it was carefully done of the govemor, and we were 
Tery glad to hear we should have a guard. Accord- 
ingly^ two days after, we had two hundred soldiers 
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, 
and three hundred more from the city of Naum, 
and with those we advanced boldly : the three bun* 
dred soldiers froni Naum marched in our front, the 
two hundred in oar rear, and our men on each side 
of our camels with our baggage, and the whole 
caravan in the centre. In this order, and well pre- 
pared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for 
the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had 
appeared ; but the next day, when they did appear, 
it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when marching 
from a little welUsituated town, called Changu, we 
had a river to pass, where we were obliged to ferry; 
and had the Tartars had any intelligence, then liad 
been the time to have attacked us, when, the cara- 
van being over, the rear guard was behind : but 
they did not appear there. 

About three hours after, when we were entered 
upon a desart of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 86T 

enemy was at hand ; and they were at huul indeed, 
for they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had 
talked so big the day before, began to stagger, and 
the soldiers frequently looked behind them ; which 
is a certain sign in a soldier, that he is just ready 
to run away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and 
being near me, he called out : " Seignior Inglese,'' 
saud he, " those fellows must be encouraged, or they 
will ruin us all ; for if the Tartars come on, they 
will never stand it/'—- ^' I am of your mind,'' said 
I : ** but what course must be done ?"— " Done ?" 
said he; " let fifty of our men advance, and flank 
them on each wing^ and encourage them, and they 
will fight like brave fellows in brave company ; but 
without it, they will every man turn his back." — 
Immediately I rode up to our leader, and told him, 
who was exactly of our mind; and accordingly 
fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fifty to 
the left, and the rest made a line of reserve; for so 
we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to 
make another body to themselves, and to guard the 
camels; only that, if need were, they should send 
a hundred men to assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumer- 
able company they were; how many, we could 
not tell, but ten thousand we thought was the least. 
A party of them came on first, and viewed our pos- 



868 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tare, trav^ramg tke groand in the iioiit of oar line; 
and as we found them within gun-shot, our leader 
ordered the two wings to adyance swiftly, and give 
them a stdvo on each wing with their shot, which 
was done ; but they went o£^ and I suppose went 
back to giye an account of the reception they were 
like to meet with; and, indeed, that salute clogged 
their stomachs; for they immediately halted, stood 
awhile to consider of it, and, wheeling off to the 
left, they gave oyer the design, and said no more 
to us for that time; which was yery agreeable to 
our circumstances, which were but yery indifferent 
for a bi^ttle with such a number.

Idol; which we destroy-^^reat danger we incur

Two days after this we came to the city of Nauin, 
or Naunm. We thanked the governor for his care 
for us, and collected to the value of one hundred 
crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the sol- 
diers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day. 
This is a garrison indeed, and there were nine hun* 
dred soldiers kept here ; but the reason of it was, 
that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to 
them than they do now, the Muscovites having 
abandoned that part of the country (which lies 
from the city west, for about two hundred miles) 
as desolate and unfit for use ; and more especially, 
being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops 



S70 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

hither for its defence ; for we had yet above two 
thousand miles to Muscovy^ properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivef^, and two 
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days 
passing over, and which, ais I said, was to be called 
No Man's Land ; and on the 13th of April we came 
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. I 
think the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it 
mi'jht be called, that belonged to the czar of Mus- 
covy, was called Argun, being on the west side of 
the river Argun. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction^ 
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian 
country; or, at least, in a country governed by 
Christians :* for though the Muscovites do, in my 
opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians* 
(yet such they pretend to be, and are very devout 
in their way) ; it would certainly occur to any man 
who travels - the world as 1 have done, and who 
had any power of reflection ; I say, it would occur 
to him, to reflect, what a blessing it is to be brought 
into the world where the name of God, and of a 
Redeemer, is known,, worshipped, and adored— and 
not where the people, given up by. Heaven to 
strong delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate 
themselves to stocks and stones ; v/orship monster^ 
elements, horrible-shaped animalsi and statues, or 
images, of monsters. Not a town or city we passed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 871 

through but had their pagods^ their idols, and their 
temples ; and igaorant people worshipping even Uie 
works of their own hands ! 

Now we came where, at least, a face of the 
Christian worship appeared, where the knee was 
bowed to Jesus; and whether ignorantly or not, 
yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name 
of the true God was called upon and adored; and 
it made the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see 
it I saluted the brave Scotch merchant I mention- 
ed above, with my first acknowledgment of this; 
and, taking him by the hand, I said to him, ** Bles- 
sed be God, we are once again come among Chris- 
tians?'' He smiled, and answered, ''Do not re- 
joice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are 
-but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the 
name of it, you may see very little of the substance 
for some months farther of our journey/' 

'' Well,'' said I, " but still it is better than paga- 
nism, and worshipping of devils/'— " Why I'll tell 
you/' said he; "except the Russian soldiers ia 
garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities 
upon the road, all the rest of this country, for above 
a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst 
and most ignorant of pagans/' And so indeed we 
found it. 

We were now launched into the greatesC piece 
of solid earth. If I understand any thing of the sur- 



272 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

face of the globe, that is to be found in ai^ part 
of the world : we had at least twelve hundred 
miles to the 8ea> eastward ; we had at least two 
thousand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, westward ; 
and almost thre^ thousand miles, if we lefi that sea 
and went on west to the British and French chan- 
nels; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian 
or Persian Sea, south; and about eight hundred 
miles to the froasen sea, north ; nay if some people 
may be believed, there might be no sea north- 
east till we came round the pole, and consequent- 
ly into the north-west, and so had a continent of 
land into America, no mortal knows where ; though 
I could give some reasons why I believe that to 
be a mistake too. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions^ a 
good while before we came to any considerable 
town, we had nothing to observe there but this : 
first, that all the rivers run to the east. As I un- 
derstood by the charts which some of our caravans 
had with them, it was plain that all those rivers 
ran into the great river' Yamour, or Gammour. 
This river, by the natural course of it, must run 
, into the east sea, or Chinese ocean. The story they 
tell MB, that the mouth of this river is choked up 
with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz. three 
feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I must 

be allowed to say I believe nothing of; but asito

navigsitioii \s pf no pse, b^c^iuse there is; no trs^de 
that W9J, the Tartars* to. whpp:i alpne it belongs^ 
dealing in qothing but cattle ; so. nobody that ever 
I heard of^ bas .b^en curious enough either to go 
dpwn tp the niputh of it in boals« or to come up 
from the mouth pf it in ships ; but this is certain^ 
that thJ9 river rqnniug due east, in the latitad«i of 
sixty degrees, carried a vast concourse of rivers 
along with it> and find9 an ocean to empty itself in 
that latitude ; so we are sure of sea there. 

Spmp leagues to the npith of this river there are 
8^vera.l considerable rivers, whose streams run as 
due north as the Yamour runs east; and these are 
all found to jqin their waters with the great river 
Tartarus, named so from the northernmost nations 
of the Mogul Tartaric, who, the Chinese say, 
^ere the first Tartars in the world ; and who, as 
Qur geographers allege, are the Qog and Magog 
mentioned in sacred story. 

These rivers running all northward, as well as 
all the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it 
evident thai the northern ocean bounds tlie land 
also on that sid^ ^ so that it does not seeo^ rational 
in the least to think that the land can extend itself 
ia join with America on that side, or that there is 
ROt a cotpmnnication between th^ northern and 
the eastern oc^an ; but of this I shall say no more^ 
it was my ohseryation at diat time, and therefore

rJ THE LIFE AND ABVENTURE* 

I take notice of it in this place. We now advaD^^ 
ced from the river Arguna by 'easy and moderate 
journies, and were very visibly obliged to the care 
the czar of Muscovy has taken to have cities anA 
towns built in as many places as are possible to 
place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, 
something like the stationary soldiers placed by 
the Romans in the remotest countries of their em- 
pire, some of which I had read were particalafly 
placed in Britain for the seamty of commerce, and 
for the lodging of travellers; and thus it wasf liere; 
though wherever we came at these towns and 
,8tations> the garrisons and governor were Russians 
and professed mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and 
worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the 
host of heaven : and not only so,' but.were, of' all 
the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, ^e 
most barbarous, except only that they did not eat 
man's flesh, as our savages of America dlcf. 

Some instances of this we met with in tlie 
country between Arguua, where we enter the Mus^ 
covite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Rus- 
sians together, called Nertzinskay ; in which space 
is a continued desert or forest, which cost i^'twenty 
days, to travel over it. In a village near the last 
of those places, I had the' curiosity t6r go and '^e 
their way of living^ which is most brdtish and tin- 
sufierable : they had, I suppose, a greall'sacHfiee'thdit 
day; for there stood out upon an old stump of a 



tr^» an idol mode of .wood,, frightful as the devil, 
at leo^t as ax^y thing we can think of to represent 
the deyil that can he .made* It had a head certain- 
ly not 80 much as resembling any creature that 
the world . ever saw ; ears as big as goats ; horns, 
and as, high; eyes as big as. a crown-piece; and a 
nose, like a crpol^ed ram's horn, and a mouth ex- 
tended fout^-cpmered, like that of a Hon, with hor- 
rible teeth» hooked like a parrot's under bill. It 
was dressed up. in the filthiest manner that you 
can suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, 
with the wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet on 
the .head, with two horns growing through it : it 
^as about eight feet high, yet had no feet or le^, 
or. any other proportion of parts. 
. This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the 
Triage; and when I came near to it, there were 
sixteen or seventeen creatures, whether men or 
women I oould not tell, for they make no distinc- 
tion by their habits, either of body or head; these 
lay^ all flat on the ground, round, this formidable 
block of shapeless wood. I saw i^o n^otipn among 
theq[i any more than if they had been Ipgs of wood, 
like their idol ; at .first I really thought they had 
b^en so;, but .when I came a little nearer, they 
^t^rt^ up u|)«>n. their fee^ and raised a howling^

houndf^ and walked away as if they were displeased

moiiftler, and at the door of a tent on hut, made M 
of sheep-sk^M and cow-skins^ dried^ stood three 
butchers; I thottgfhl Ihey were such; for when I 
came nearer to tY^^ta, I found they had lon^ knives 
in their hands, and in the middle of ^e tent ap- 
peared three sheep killed, and oiie young bu]k>ck 
or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifiees to that 
senseless log of an idol ; and these three men priests 
belonging to it ; and the seventeen prostrated 
wretches were the people who brought the oflfering, 
and were making their prayers to that stock. 

I confess I wa$ more moved at their stupidity* 
and this brutish worship of a hobgoMin, than ever I 
was at any thing in my life; to see God*a most 
glorioad and best ci«ature> to whom he had grant- 
ed so many advantages, even by creation* above 
the rest of the works of his hands, vested with a 
reasonable soul* and that soul adorned with faculties 
and capacities adapted both to honour his Maker 
and be honoured by him ; I' say, to see it sunk 
and degenerated -to a degree so mere than stupid, 
as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere 
imagioary ol\|e0k dressed up by themselves, and

the Scots merchant, of Moscow, of whose courage 



rt9 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

• 
I bad had a sufficient testimonyy as above. I told 
him what I had seen^ and with what indignation I 
had since thought that human nature could be so 
degenerate. I told him^ I was resolved, if I could 
get but four or five men well armed to go with me, 
to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol ; to let 
them see, that it had no power to help itself, and 
consequently could not be an object of worship,' or 
to be prayed to, much less help them that offered 
sacrifices to it. 

• He laughed at me: said he, ''Your zeal may- 
be good ; but what do you propose to yourself by 
it?" ''Propose!" said I: "to vindicate the honour 
of God, which is insulted by tliis devil-worship. 

"But how will it vindicate' the honour of God,' 
said he, "while the people will not be able to 
know what you.mean by it, unless you could speak 
to them too, and tell them so ? and then they will 
fight you too; I will assure you, for they are des- 
perate fellows, and that especially in defence of 
their idolatry."—" Can we not," said 1, " do it in 
the night, and then leave them the reasons in 
writing, in their own language?"— "Writing !" 
said he ; " why, there is not in five nations of them 
one man that knows any thing of a letter, or how 
to read a word in any language, or in their bwni.^'^ 
"Wretched ignorance !" said I to him: ''how-

ever, I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature 
may draw inferences from it to them, to let them 
see how brutish they are to worship such horrid 
things.'' — ^" Look you. Sir,*' said he; "if your zeal 
prompts yoa to it so warmly, you must do it ; but 
in the next place, I would have you consider these 
wild natioos of people are subjected by force to the 
czar of Muscovy's dominion ; and if you do this, 
it is ten to one but they will come by thousands to 
the governor of Nertzinskay, and complain, and de- 
mand satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them sa- 
tisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt ; and it 
will occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the 
country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head 
for a while ; but I harped upon the same string 
still ; and all that day I was uneasy to put my 
project in execution. Towards the evening the 
£lcot8 merchant met me by accident in our walk 
about the town, and desired to speak with me : ''I 
believe,'' said he, " I have put you ojQT your good 
design; I have been a little concerned about it 
since ; for I abhor the idol and idolatry as much as you 
can dq."— "Truly," said I, "you have put it off a 
little, as to the execution of it, but you have not 
put it all out of my thoughts ; and, I believe, I 
ehall do it still before t quit this place, though I 
were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction/'—

you how they served a poor Russian, who alR'ont>- 
ed them in their worship just as you did, and 
whom they took prisoiier, aider they had lamed 
him with an arrow, that he could not ruh away : 
they took him an(i stripped him staric nalo^, and 
set him upon the top of the idol inouster, avid stood 
all round him, and shot as many arrows into hlnl 
as would stick over bis whole body; and then 
they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in him 
as a sacrifice to the idol/'—*' And was this the 
same idol?" said I. "Ye§,*' feaid he, "the very 
same."—" Well," said I, "I Will tell ^ a story." 
So I related the story of our men at Mada^[ascai\ 
and how they burnt and sack^ the village ther^ 
and killed man, woman, and child, for their mavder- 
iug one of our men, just as it is related befi»re ; 
and whiea I had done, I added^ that I tboiight we 
ought to do so to this village. 

He listened Very attentively to the story; but 
when I talked of doing so to that village. Said he, 
^' You mistake ver^r mubh; it was tiot this v1liage» 
it was almost a hundred miles from this place;

J, " then that idol ought to be punished for it; and

In a woid> finding me eesolute, he liked the de- 
sigi^ and ■ told me^ I should not go alone, but he 
would go With «ie; but be would go first, and 
bring a stout fellow^ one of his countrymen, to go 
also with us; *'aqd one/' said he, "as famous for 
Jiis zeal as you can desire aoy one to be against 
.4uch detilith things as thesis.'' In a Word, lie 
brodght me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he 
^^Ikd Captain |tichardson$ and I gave him a full 
account of what I had seen, and also what I in- 
tended; and he told me readily, he would go with 
me, if it coHt him his life. So we agreed tb go, 
okily we three. I bad, indeed, proposed it to my 
|>artner, but he declined, it. He said, he was ready 
to assist me to the utmost, and tipon all occasions, 
for my defence ; but that this was an adventure 
^uite out of his way : so, I say, we resdved upon 
our work^ only we three, and my man-servant, and 
to put it in execution that night about midnighty 
with all the secrecy imaginable^ 

However^ upon second thoughts, we were wil- 
ling to delay it till the na^i night, because the ca- 
ravan being to set forward in the morning* we sup- 
posed the governor could not pretend to give them 
any satisfaction upon qs when we were out of |iis

power. The Scots merchimty aa steady in his ie« 
solution to enterprize it as bold io execating, 
brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, 
and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows,, and bad 
provided the same for h'unself and his countryivan, 
that the people, if they saw ui^ should not be able 
to determine who we were. 

AU the first night we spent in mixing up some 
combustible matter with aquavitae, gunpowder, 
and such other materials as we could get; and, 
having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about 
an hour after night we set out vpaa our ezpedi* 
tion. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at 
night, and found that the people had not the least 
jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night 
-was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough 
to see that the idol stood just in the same posture 
and place that it did before. The people seemed 
lo be all at their rest; only, that in the great hut 
or tent as we called it» where we saw the three 
, priests whom we mistook for butchers, we saw a 
light, and going up close to the door, we heard 
people talking, as if there were five or six of them; 
we concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to 
the idolj Xh^fie men would come out immediately 
and run up to the place to rescue it from the de- 
struction that we intended £br it; and what to do 



' yAxh theih we kbew fiot. ' Once we thiught df fciar- 
ryin'g it away, and'seMng fii^e to it at a' diiMtoce, 
but When we came to handle it we ""fbund it too 
balky forour carriage ; so we were at a loss again. 
The second Scotsman was for in^ttihg fire to the 
tent or hot, and knocking the creatures that were 
there on the head> when they came out; but I 
could ifiot'join with that; I was agkinst killing 
them, if it was possible to be avoidedl "Well then, 
said the Scots merchant, *' I will tell you what we 
will do; we will try to make them prisoners, tie 
tbeir hands, tind make them stand and see their 
idol destroyed/* 
' As it happened, we had twine or packthread 
''^" enough about us,' which We used to tie our fire- 
works togethi^r with ; so we resolved to attack these 
' people first, and with as little tioise a^ we could. 
The first thing wer did, we knocked at the door^ 

• ''when one of the priests coming to it, we immedi- 
'' *ate]y seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and 
"tied his hands behind bitn, and led him to the idol,

tS4 THB LIFE AND ADVENTIHIES 

we knocked again geody, and immediately out 
came two more« and we aertred them just in Uie 
same manner^ but were obliged to go all with them, 
and lay them down by the idol some distance liofti 
one another; when going back we found two morfe 
were come out to the door« and a third stood be^ 
hind them within the door. We seieed the twb, 
and immediately tied them« when the third step- 
ping back^ and crying out, my Scots merchant 
went in after him, and takingout a composition we 
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set 
fire to it, and threw it in among them : by that 
time the other Scotsman and my man taking charge 
of the two men already bound, and tied together 
also by the arm, led them away to the idol, and left 
them there, to see if their idol would relieve thera^ 
making haste back to us. 

When the fur«e we had thrown in had filled the 
hut with so much smoke that they were almost 
sufR>cated, we then threw in a small leather bag of 
another kind, which flamed like a e^indle, and fol* 
lowing it in, we found there weife but four people 
lefl, who, it seems, were two men and two women, 
and, as we supposed, had been about some of their 
diabol ic sacrifices. They appeared) i n short, fright- 
ed to death, at least so as to sit ttembliilg and stu- 
pid, and not able to speak neither, for the smoke^

saidf we brcMght them out of the hooBe^ or hut» 
fti$t({ foor^ indeedi we were not able to bear the 
smoke any miure than they were. When we had 
donq this> we carried them all together to the idol : 
when we oiiMite tbeve we fell to work with him; 
and.fir&t we daubed bim. all over, and hia robes al- 
soa with tar, and such other stuff as we bad, which 
was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we stopped 
bis eyes» and ears, and mouth full of gunpowder; 
theti we wrapped up a great piece of wUdfire in his 
bonnet; and then sticking all the combu^ibles we 
had brought with us upon him, we looked about 
to see if we could find any thing else to help to 
burn him; when my Scotsman remei^bered that 
by the tent, or hut, where theinen were, there lay 
a heap of dry forage, whetbeir straw or rushes I do 
|iot remember : away he and the other. Scotsman 
ran, and fetched their arms full of that When 
we bad dope this, we took all our. prisoaers, and 
bronght then^ hayiog untied their feet and un- 
gagged their mouthy and made them staad up, 
and set them just before thek monstrous idol, and 
then s^t fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or there- 
ah<H)its« till the pow4er in (he eyes, and mouth, and 
ears of the idol blew up, and, as we could perceive.

and accordingly the governor seat after us, an^ 
gave us a particular account how the thing was, 
intimating withal^ that if any in our caravan had 
done it, they should make their escape ; bat t^t 
whether they had done it, or no, we should make 
all the haste forward that was possible ; and that in 
the mean time he would keep them in play aj» 
long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. How^ 
ever, when it came to the caravan, there was no* 
body knew any thing of the matter; and, as for us 
that were guilty, we were the least of all suspected : 
none so much as asked us the question ; however 
the captain of the caravan, for the time, took the 
hint that the governor gave us, and we marched 
or travelled two days and two nrgbts without any 
considerable stop, and then we lay at a village calk 
ed Piothus ; nor did we ipake any long stop here, 
but hastened on towards Jarawena, another of the 
Gzar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expect- 
ed we should be safe ; but it is to be observed, that 
here we began, for two or three days march, to en- 
ter upon a vast nameless desart, of which I shall 
say pnore in its place ; and which if we had now 
been upon it, it is more than probable we ha^ beep 
all destroyed. It was the second day's mar<^h from 
Plo^hus, that by the clouds of dost behind us at ft 
^^at distance, some of our people began to be sen*

aible we were pursued ; we had entered the desert, 
and had passed by a great lake, called Schank^ 
Osier, whea we perceived a very great body of 
bone appear od the other side of the lake to the 
north, we trayelling West. We observed they went 
away west, as we did ; but had supposed we should 
have taken that side of the lake, whereas we yety 
happily took the south side : and in two days more 
we saw them not, for they, believing we were still 
before them, pushed on, till they came to the river 
Udda: this is a very great river when it passes far-, 
ther north, but when we came to it, we found it 
nanow and fordable. » 

The third day they either found their mistake, or 
had intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us 
towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to our 
great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our 
camp,- which was veiy convenient for the night; 
for as we were upon a desart, though but at the be- 
ginning of it, that was above five hundred miles 
over, we had no towns to Ijdge at, and, indeed, ex* 
pected none but the city of Jarawena, which we 
had yet two days march to; the desart, however, 
had some few woods in it on this side, and little 
rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda. It 
was in a narrow strait, between two small but very 
thick woods, that we pitched our little camp for 
that night, expectmg to be attacked in the nighty .

S99 THE LIFE AND ADTEMTUftES 



Nobody knew but ooneWes what we wem pur- 
medfor; bat as it was iiMal Smc tbe Mogol Tartais 
to go about in troops in that dcaart, so tlie caravan 
always fortify theiiiselTes every night against thoB^ 
as against annies of robbers; and it was therefeie 
no new thing to be porsoed. 

Bot we had this night, of all the nights of oar 
traveiSy a most adyantageous camp; for we lay be- 
tween two woods, with a little rivulet running just 
before oar front ; so that we conid not be swround* 
ed or attacked any way, but in our finont or rear : 
we took care also to make our fi:ont as strong as 
we could, by placing our packs, with our camels 
and horses, all in a line on the side (tf the river, and 
we felled some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encunped for the night; but 

the enemy was upon us before we had finished our 

situation : they did not come on us like thieves, as 

we expected, but sent three messengers to uit, to 

demand the men to be delivered to tbem, that had 

abused their priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi- 

Thaungu, that they might burn them with fire; 

and, upon this, they said^ they would go away, and 

do us no farther harm, otherwise they would bom 

us all with fire. Our men looked very blank at 

this message, and began to stare at one another, to 

see who looked with most guilt in their faces, bat^ 

nobodjf was the word^ nobocty did it The leader of

the caravan sent worcL he was weH assufed it wa« 
not done by any of our camp ; that we were peace* 
lible merchants, travelling on our business; that 
we. bad done no harm to theip^ or to any one else ; 
and therefore they must look farther for their en^<- 
mies!. who had injured tl^m, tor we wore not the 
people ; so desired them not to disturb us;' for, if 
they did, we should defend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisiied with this for 
an answer, and a great crowd of them came down 
in the morning, by break of day, to our camp; but» 
seeing us in such an advantageous situation, they 
durst c<MDe no farther than the brook in our front, 
where they stood, and shewed us such a number, 
as, indeed, terrified ua vory much ; for those that 
jipoke least of them, spoke of ten thousand. Here 
they stood, and looked at us awhile, and them set- 
ting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows 
among us ; but we were well enough fortified 6m 
that, for we were sheltered under our baggage; 
and I do not remember that one man of us wasf 
hurt 

Some tioM after this we saw them move a little 
to our right, and expected them on the rear, when 
a cunning felkiw, a Cossack, as they call them, of 
Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to 
the leader of the caravan, said to him, '^ I will send 
all these people away to Sibeilka.'" This was a city

four or fiye days journey at least to the souths and 
rather behind us. So be takes his bow and arrows 
and, getting on horseback, he rides away from oar 
rear directly, as it were, back to Nertzinskay ; after 
ibis, he takes a great circuit about, and comes to 
the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent ex- 
press to tell them a long story, that the people who 
had burnt their Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to 
Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called 
them; that is to say. Christians; and that they 
were resolved to bum the god Seal Isarg, belonging 
to the Tonguses. 

As thip fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly 
spoke their language, he counterfeited so well, that 
they all took it from him, and away they drove, in 
a most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems, 
was five days journey to the south; and in less than 
three hours they were entirely out of our sight, 
and we never heard any more of them, nor ever 
knew whether they went to that other place called 
Sibeilka or no. 

So we passed safely on to the city of Jarawena, 
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and 
there we rested five days, the caravan being ex- 
ceedingly fatigued with the last day's march, and 
with want of rest in the night 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which 
held us three-and-twenty days march. We fur- 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 893 

nbhed ourselves with some tents here, for the bet« 
ter accommodating ourselves in the night ; and the 
leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, 
or waggons, of the country, for carrymg our water 
and provisions ; and these carriages were our de» 
fence every night round our little camp ; so that 
had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been 
very numerous indeed, they would not have been 
ahle to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to want rest again 
after this long journey; for in this desert we saw 
neither house or tree, or scarce a bush; we saw, 
indeed, abundance of the sable-hunters, aa they cal- 
led them. These are all Tartars of the iffi^gul Tar- 
tary, of which this country is a part ; and they fre- 
quently attack small caravans ; but we saw no num- 
bers of them together. I was curious to see the 
sable-skins they catched ; but I could never speak 
with any of them : for they durst* toot come near 
us; neither durst we straggle from our company to 
go near them. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we 
found towns and castles settled by the czar of Mus- 
covy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to pro- 
tect the caravans, and defend the country against 
the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very 
dangerous travelling ; and his czarish majesty hM 



fH THE LIFE AMD ADYENlTCRES 

giTen such strict orders for the Well gaardiiig the 
<»raTahs iind merchants, that if thereare any Tar« 
tars heard of in the country, detachments of the 
garrison are ahvays sent to see travellers safe from 
station to station. 

And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I hs^sl 
an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the 
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him> of- 
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there 
was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought long before this^ that as we came 
nearer to £urope we ^lould find the country better 
l»eopled, and the people more civHioed ; but I found 
myself mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation 
43^ thti Tonguses to pass through ; where we saw 
4he same tokens of paganism and barbarity, or 
worse, than before; only as they were conquefed 
by the Muscovites, and entirely reduced, they were 
Bot so dangerous ; but for the rndeness of manners, 
idolatry, and polytheism, no people in the world 
ever went beyond them. They are Y^othed all in 
skins of beasts, and their houses are bnik of the 
aame. You know not a man from a woman, nei- 
ther by the niggedness of their countenances, or 
their clothes ; and in the winter, when the ground 
is covered with snow, they live under ground, in 
houses like vaults, which have ca'nties or caves go- 
ing from one to another. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* $95 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thawgu for 
a whole village, or country, these had idols m erery 
.hut and every cave; besides, they worship the 
jfttars, the sun, the water, the snow'; and, in a wocd, 
every thing thact they do not understand, aad they 
understand but very little ; so that almost every, 
element, every uncommon thing, sets them a^sacri- 
fidng. 

But I am no more to describe people than coun- 
tries, any farther Uian my own story comes to be 
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar 
to myself in all this country, which I reckon was, 
from the desert which I spoke of last, at least four 
huncked miles, half of it bei9g another desert, which 
took us up twelve days severe travelling, without 
jKNise, tree, or bush; but we were obliged again to 
carry our own provisions, as well water as bread. 
After we were out of this desert, sind had travelled 
two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city 
or station^ on the great river Janezay. This j*iver, 
they tc^d us^ parted Europe from Asia, though our 
map-ioateers, as I am told, do not agree to it ; how- 
ever, it is certainly the eastern boundary of tiie an- 
cient Siberia, which now makes a province only 
<if the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself equal in 
.bigness to the whole empire of Germany. 

And yet here I observed ignarance an^ paganism 
still prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. 



96 THE LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

All the country between the river Oby and the 
rirer Janezay is as entirely paganj and the people 
as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, 
as any nation> for aught I know, in Asia or America. 
I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite 
governors, whom I had opportunity to converse 
with, that the pagans are not much the wiser, or the 
nearer Christianity, for being under the Muscovite 
government : which they acknowledged was true 
enough, but, they said, it was none of their busi- 
ness; that if the czar expected to convert his Sibe- 
rian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should be 
done 'by sending clergymen among them, not sol- 
diers; and they added, with more sincerity than I 
. expected, that they found it was not so much the 
concern of their monarch to make the people 
Christians, as it was to make them subjects. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we cros- 
sed a wild uncultivated country ; I cannot say it is 
. a barbarous soil ; it is only barren of people, and 
wants good management; othei^irise k is in itself a 
most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. 
What inhabitants we found in .it are all pagans, 
except such as are sent among them from Russia; 
for this is the country, I. mean on both sides the 
river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals, that 
^re not put to death, are banishedl, and from 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 997 

.whence it ia next to impossible they should ever 
come away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular 
afiairsy till I came to Tobolski, the capital of Si- 
beria, where I continued some time on the follow- 
ing occasion :— ^ 

We had been now almost se^en months on our 
journey, and winter began to come on apace; 
whereupon my partner and I called a council about 
our particular a^arrs, in which We found it proper, 
considering that we were bound for England, and 
not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of our- 
selves. They told us of sledges and rein-deer to 
carry us over the snow in the winter-time ; and in- 
deed, they have such things^ as it would be incredi- 
ble to relate the particulars of, by which means the 
Russians travel more in the winter than they can 
in summer; because in these sledges they are able 
to run night and day : the snow being frozen, is one 
universal corering to nature, by which the hills, the 
vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth, and hard 
as a stone ; and they run upon the surface, without 
any regard to what. is underneath. 

But I had no occasion to push at a winter jour- 
ney of this kind ; I was bound to England, not to 
Moscow, and my route lay two ways : either I must 
go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, 
and then go off west for Narva, and the gulf of 



S98 THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

Finland, and so either by sea or land to JhatUa^ 
where I might possibly sell my China cai^o to good 
advantage ; or I roust leave the caravan at a little 
towti on the Dwioa» from virhence 1 had bot six days 
by water to Archangel, and from thence might be 
sure of shipping, either to England^ HoUand, or 
Hamburgh. 

Now to go any of these joumies in the winter 
would have been preposterous ; for as to Bantzic, 
the Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get 
passage; and to go by land in those countries, was 
far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars ; like- 
wise to Archangel, in October all the ships would 
be gone from thence, and even the merchants, who 
dwell there in summer, retire south to Moscow in 
the winter, when the ships ai« gone ; so that I 
should have nothing but extremity of cold to en- 
counter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie 
thete in an empty town all the winter: so that, 
upon the whole, I thought it much my better way 
to let the caravan go, and to make provision to win- 
ter where I was, viz. at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the 
latitude of sixty degrees, where I was sure of three 
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty 
of provisions, such as the country a£^rded, a waim 
house, with fuel enough, and excellent coaspaay; 
of all which I shall give a full account in ita place. 

I was now in a quite difierent climate from my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 999 

btloved island^ where I net er felt cold, exce|>t whea ' 
I had my ague ; on the contrary, I had much to do 
to l»ear my clothes on my back, and never made 
any fite but without doors, for my necessity, in 
dpessing my food, ^. Now I made me three 
good rests, with large robes or gowns over them 
to hang down to the feet, and button close to the 
wrists, and all these lined with furs, to make them 
sufficiently warn. 

As to a warm house, I nrast confess, I greatly 
dialike oar way in England, of making fires in eve- 
ry room in the house, in open chimnies, which 
when the fire was out, always kept the air in. the 
room cold as the climate. But taking an apartment 
in a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney 
to be built like a furnace, in the centre of six seve- 
ral rooms, like a stove; the funnel to carry the 
smoke went up one way, the door to come at the 
fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept 
equally warm, but no fire seen ; like as they heat 
the bagnios in England. 

By this means we had always the same climate 
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; 
and how cold soever it was without, it was always 
warm within ; and yet we saw no fire, nor were 
ever incommoded with any smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it 
should be possible to meet with good company hero

erly part of Europe, near the frozen ocean, and 
within but a yery few degrees of Noya Zembla. 

But this being the country where the state cri-

the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of 
Muscovy : Here were the famous prince GallOf-

some ladies.

Sr meana of my Scots merchant, whom, never*

with several of these gentlemen, and some of them 
of the first rank : and from these, in the long win- 
ter nights, in which I staid here, I received several 
agreeable visits. It was talking one night with a 
certain prince, one of the banished ministers of state 
belonging to the czar of Muscovy, that my talk of 
my particular case began. He had been telling 
me abundance of fine thhigs, of the grreatness, the 
magnificence, and dominions, and the absolute power 
of the emperor of the Russians. I interrupted hjm» 



son TH£ LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

and told him, I was a greater and more powerfal 
prince than ever the czar of Muscovy was^ though 
my dominions were not so large, or my people so 
many. The Russian grandee looked a little sur- 
prised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began 
to wonder what I meant. 

I told him his wonder would cease when I had 
explained myself. First, I told him, I had the ab- 
solute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my 
subjects : that notwithstanding my absolute power, 
I had not one person disafiected to my government, 
or to my person, in all my dominion^ He shook 
his head at that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid 
the czar of Muscovy. I told him, that all the lands 
in my kingdom were my own, and all my subjects 
were not only my tenants, but tenants at will ; that 
they would all fight for me to the last drop ; and 
that never tyrant, for such I acknowledged mysdf 
to be, was ever so universally beloved, and yet so 
horribly feared, by his subjects. 

After amuang them with these riddles in gOTem* 
ment for a while, .1 opened the case, and told them 
the story at large of my living in the island, and 
how I managed both myself and the people there 
that were under me, just as I have since minuted 
it down. They were exceedingly taken with' the 
story, and especially the prince, who told me with 
a sigh, that the true greatness of life was to be mas-

ter of oarselyes; that he would not have changed 
such a state of life as mine, to have been czar of 
Muscovy i and that be found more felicity in the 
retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than 
ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed 
in the court of his master the czar: that the height 
of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down 
to our circumstances, and to make a calm within^ 
under the weight of the greatest storm without* 
When he came first hither, he said, he used to tear 
the hair from his head, and the clothes from his 
back, as others had done before him; but a little 
time aad consideration had made him look into 
himself, as well as round himself, to things with* 
out: that he found the mind of man, if it was but 
once brought to reflect upon the state of universal 
life, and how little this world was concerned in its 
true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a fe- 
licity for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and suitable 
to its own best ends and desires, with but very lit- 
tle assistance from the world; that air to breathe 
in, food to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and li- 
berty for exercise, in order to health, completed, in 
his opinion, all that the world could do for us : and 
though the greatness, the authority, the riches, and 
the pleasures, which some eojoyed in the world, and 
which he had enjoyed his share of, had much in them 
that was agreeable to us, yet he observed^ that all 



90C THE UFB AND ADVENTURES 

Ukose things chiefly gratified the coaraest of our af^ 

fectioDs; such as oar ambition, onr particalar prtde^ 

our avarice, onr vanity, and onr sensuality; all which 

were, indeed, the mere product of the worst part of 

man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them 

the seeds of all manner of crimes ; but neither wero 

related to, or concerned with, any of those virtues 

that consthuted us wise men, or of those graces 

which distingaished us as Christians: that being 

now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he 

enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he 

said, he was at leisure to look upon the dark side 

of them, where he found all manner of deformity ; 

and was now convinced, that virtue only makes a 

man truly wise, rich, and great, and preserves him 

in the way to a superior happiness in a future state ; 

and in this, he said, they were more happy in their 

banishment, than all their enemies were, who had 

the full possession of all the wealth and power that 

they (the banished) had left behind diem. 

" Nor, Sir," said he, «* do I bring my mind to 
this politically, by the necessity of my circum* 
stances, which some call miserable; but if t know 
any thing of myself, I would not go back, no not 
though my master, the czar, shotlld call me, and 
ofier to reinstate me in all my former grandeur; I 
say, I would no more go back to it, than I believe

of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious 
state beyond life, would come back to the goal of 
flesh and blood it is now enclosed in, and leave 
Heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human 
affairs." 

He spake this with so much warmth in his tem- 
per, so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, 
which were apparent in his countenance, that it 
was evident it was the true sense of his soul ; and 
indeed there was no room to doubt his sincerity. 

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a 
monarch in my old station, of which I had given 
him an account, but that I thought he was not a 
monarch only, but a great conqueror; for that he 
that has got a victory over his own exorbitant de- 
sires, and has the absolute dominion over himself^ 
and whose reason entirely governs his will, is cer- 
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. . '' But, 
my Idrd,^' said I, " shall I take the liberty to ask 
you a question ?"— •" With all my heart,'* said he. 
" If the door of your liberty was opened,** said I, 
" would not you take hold of it to deliver yourself 
from this exile ?'* 

'' Hold,^* said he, '' your question is subtle, and 
requires some serious just distinctions to give it a 
sincere answer; and I'll give it you from the bot-i 
torn of my heart. Nothing that I know of in this 
world would move me to deliver myself from thQ

State of banishment, except these two: first, the 

enjoyment of my relations; and secondly, a little 
warmer climate. But I protest to you, that to go 
back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power, 
the hurry of a minister of state ; the wealth, the 
gaiety, and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a 
courtier ; if my master should send me word this 
moment, that he restores me to all he banished me 
from, I protest, if I know myself at all, I would not 
leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these fro- 
sen lakes, for the palace of Moscow/' 

" But, my lord,'' said I, ** perhaps you not only 
are banished from the pleasures of the court, and 
from the power, and authority, and wealth, you en- 
joyed before, but you may be absent too from some 
of the conveniences of life ; your estate, perhaps, 
confiscated, and your effects plundered; and the 
supplies left you here may not be suitable to the 
ordinary demands of life." 

«' Ay," said he, " that is, as you suppose me to 
be a lord, or a prince, &c. So indeed I am ; but 
you are now to consider me only as a man, a hu^ 
man creature, not at all distinguished from another; 
and so I can sutifer no want, unless I riiould be 
visited with sickness and distempers. However, to 
put the question out of dispute ; you see our man- 
ner; we are in this place five persons of rank; we 
live perfectly retired, as suited to a state of banish*

ment ; we have somethiDg rescued from the ship- 
wreck of our fortunes^ which keeps us from the 
mere necessity of hunting for our food; but the 
poor soldiers who are here, without that help, live 
in as much plenty as we. They go into the woods, 
and catch sables and foxes ; the labour of a month 
will maintain them a year; and as the way of liv- 
ing is not expensive, so it is not hard to get suf- 
ficient to ourselves: so that objection is out of 
doors." 

I have no room to give a full account of the 
most agreeable conversation I had with this truly 
great man ; in all which he shewed, that his mind 
was so inspired with a superior knowledge of things, 
so supported by religion, as well as by a vast share 
of wisdom, that bis contempt of the world was really 
as much as he had expressed, and that he was ai- 
rways the same to the last, zs will appear in the 
atory I am going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark dread- 
ful winter I thought it to be. The cold was so 
intense, that I could not sa much as look abroad 
without being wrapt in furs, and a mask of fur be- 
fore my face, orjrather a hood, with only a hole for 
breath, and two for sight. The little daylight we 
had, was, as we reckoned, for three months, not 
above five hours a day, or six at most ; only that 
snow lying on the ground continually, and the 



SOtt THE LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

the weather being clear> it was never quite dark. 
Our horses were kept (or rather starved) under 
ground ; and as for our servants (for we hired ser- 
vants here to look after our horses and ourselves) 
we had every now and then their fingers and toes 
to thaw> and take care of, lest they should mortify 
and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were wannj the houses 
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and 
the glass all double. Our food was chiefly the 
flesh of. deer, dried and cured in the season ; good 
bread enough,. but baked as biscuits ; dried fish of 
several sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of 
bufialoes, which is pretty good beef. All the stores 
of provision for the winter are laid up in the sum- 
mer, and well cured. Our drink was water mixed 
with aquavits instead of brandy ; and, for a treaty 
mead instead of wine ; which, however, they have 
excellent good. The hunters, who ventured abroad 
all weathers, frequently brought us in fresh veni- 
son, very fat and good ; and sometimes bear's fiesh» 
but we did not much care for the last. We had 
a good stock of tea, with which we treated our 
friendf as above; and, in a word, we lived very 
cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, and the days grown consi- 
derably longer, and the weather at least tolerable; 
sp other travellers began to prepare sledges to car* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S09 

ry them over the snow^ and to get things ready to 
be going ; but my measures being fixed, as I have 
saidy for Archangel^ and not for Muscovy or the 
Baltic, I made no motion, knowing very \«ell, that 
the ships from the south do not set out for that part 
of the world till May or June ; and that if I was 
there at the beginning of August, it would be as 
soon as any ships would be ready to go away ; and 
therefore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as 
others did ; in a word, I saw a great many people, 
nay, all the travellers, go away before me. It seems, 
every year they go from thence to Moscow for 
trade ; viz. to carry furs, and buy necessaries with 
them, which they bring back to furnish their shops; 
also others went on the same errand to Archangel; 
but then they also, being to come back again above 
eight hundred miles, went all out before me. 

In short, about the latter end of May I began to 
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing 
this, it occured to me, that seeing all these people 
were banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, 
and yet, when they came there, were at liberty to 
go whither they would ; why did they not then go 
away to any part of the world wherever they thought 
fit ? and I began to examine what should hinder 
them from making such an attempt. 

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon 
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who 



SIO THB LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

answered me thus: ** Consider, first,'' said hm, 
" the place where we are; and, secondly, the con- 
dition we are in; especially/' said he, " the gene- 
rality oC the people who are hanis^ied hither. We 
are surrounded/' said he, ** with stronger Uiings 
than bars and bolts : on the north side is an unna- 
▼igable ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat 
never swam; neither, if we had both, could we 
know whither to go with them. Every other way," 
said he, " we have above a thousand miles to pass 
through the czar's own dominions, and by vvvys 
utterly impassable, except by the roads made by the 
government, and through the towns garrisoned by 
its troops ; so that we could neitiier pass undisco- 
vered by the road, or subsist any other way ; so that 
it is in vain to attempt it." 

I was silenced indeed, at once, and found that 
they were in a prison, every jot as secure as if they 
had been locked up in the castle of Moscow ; how- 
ever, it came into my thoughts,- that I might cer- 
tainly be made an instrument to procure the escape 
of this excellent person, and that it was very easy 
for me to carry him away, there being no guard 
over him in the country ; and as I was not going 
to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went ia 
the nature of a caravan, by which I was not obli- 
ged to lie in the stationary towns in the desert, bat 
could encamp every night where I woidd, we might 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 1 

easily pass uninterrapted to Archangel^ where I 
could immediately secure him on board an Eng- 
lish or Dutch ship^ and carry him off safe along 
with me ; and as to his subsistence^ and other par- 
ticulars, that should be my care, till he should bet- 
ter supply himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked ear- 
nestly on me all the while I spoke ; nay, I could 
see in his very face, that what I said put his spirits 
into an exceeding ferment ; his colour frequently 
changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart flut^ 
tered, that it might be even perceived in his coun- 
tenance ; nor could he immediately answer me when 
I had done, and, as it were, expected what he would 
say to it ; and after he had paused a little, he em- 
braced me, and said, *' How unhappy are we ? un- 
guided creatures as we are, that even our greatest 
acts of friendship are made snares to us, and we 
are made tempters of one another ! My dear friend," 
said he, " your ofifer is so sincere, has such kindness 
in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated 
for my advantage, that I must have very little 
knowledge of t^ world, if I did not both wonder 
at it, and acknowledge the obligation I have upon 
me to you for it : but did you believe I was sin- 
cere in what I have so often said to you of my con- 
tempt of the world ? Did you believe I spoke my 
very soul to you, and that I had really maintained 



319 THE LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

that degree of felicity here, that had placed me 
above all that the world could give tne, or do for 
me ? Did you believe I was sincere, when I told yoa 
I would not go back, if I was recalled even to be all 
that once I was in the court, and with the fayour 
of the czar my master ? Did you believe me, my 
friend, to be an honest man, "or did you think me 
to be a boasting hypocrite }" Here he stopped, as 
if he would hear what I would say ; but, indeed^ I 
soon after perceived, that he stopped because his 
spirits were in motion ; his heart was full of strug*- 
gles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, as- 
tonished at the thing, as well as at the man, and I 
used some arguments with him to urge him to set 
himself free ; that he ought to look upon this as a 
door opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a 
summons by Providence, who has the care and 
good disposition of all events, to do himself good, 
and to render himself useful in the world. /_ 

He had by this time recovered himself. *' How 
do you know. Sir," said he, warmly, " but that, in- 
stead of a summons from Heaven, it may be a 
feint of another instrument, representing, in all 
the alluring colours to me, the show of felicity 
as a deliverance, which may in itself be my snare, 
and tend directly to my ruin? Here I am free 
from the temptation of returning to my former 
miserable greatness ; there I am not sure^ but that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31S 

all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and lux- 
ury, which I know remain in my nature, may re- 
vive and take root, and, in a word^ again over- 
whelm me ; and then the happy prisoner, whom 
you see now master of his soul's liberty, ^all be 
the miserable slave of his own senses, in the full 
possession of all personal liberty. Dear Sir, let 
me remain in this blessed confinement, banished 
from the crimes of life, rather than purchase a 
show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of 
my reason, and at the expense of the future hap- 
piness which now I have in my view, but shall 
then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I am but 
ilesh, a man, a mere man, have passions and afiec- 
tions as likely to possess and overthrow me as any 
man : O be not my friend and my tempter both 
together !** 

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, 
and stood silent, looking at him ; and, indeed, ad- 
mired what I saw. The struggle in his soul was 
so great, that, though the weather was extremely 
cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, and I 
found he wanted to give vent to his mind ; so I 
said a word or two, that I would leave him to con- 
sider of it, and wait on him again ; and then I 
withdrew to my own apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or 
near the door of the room, and I was going to 



Sl4 THE LIFE ANDADVENTURES 

open the door ; but he had opened ity and come 
in : *' My dear friend" said he, " you had almost 
ovenet me, hat I am recovered : do not take it ill 
that I do not close with your ofier; I assure yoa, 
it is not for want of a sense of the kindness of it 
in you ; and I come to make the most sincere ac- 
knowledgment of it to yon; but, I hope, I haye 
got the victory over myself." 

«'My lord/' said I, ^I hope you are fully sa- 
tisfied, that you did not resist the call of Heaven/'-^ 
*« Sir" said he. " if it had been from Heaven, the 
same power would have influenced me to accept 
it; but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is 
from Heaven that I decline it ; and I have an in- 
finite satisfaction in the parting, that you shall 
leave me an honest man still, though not a free 



man." 



I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make 
profession to him of my having no end in it, but a 
sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very 
passionately, and assured me, he was sensible of 
that, and should always acknowledge it : and with 
that he offered me a very fine present of sables, 
too much indeed for me to accept from a man in 
his circumstances; and I would have avoided them, 
but he would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lord- 
ship, with a small present of tea, two pieces of 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SIS 

China damask, and four little wedges of Japan 
gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces, or 
thereabouts; but were far short of the value of 
his sables, which indeed, when I came to England, 
I found worth near two hundred pounds. He ac- 
cepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and 
one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp 
upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he 
took for the rarity of it, but would not take any 
more ; and sent word by my servant, that he de- 
sired to speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what 
had passed between us, and hoped I would not 
move him any more in that afiair ; but that, since 
I made such a generous ofier to him, he asked me, 
if I had kindness enough to ofifer the same to 
another person that he would name to me, in whom he 
had a great share of concern. I told him, that I could 
not say I inclined to do so much for anyone but him- 
self, for whom I had a particular value, and should 
have been glad to have been the instrument of his 
deliverance : however, if he would, please to name 
the person to me, I would give him my answer, 
and hoped he would not be displeased with me, if 
he was with my answer. He told me, it was only 
his son, who, though I had not seen, yet was 
in the same condition with himself, and above two 



316 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

hundred miles from him^ on the other side the Oby 
but thaty if I consented, be would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. 
I made some ceremony in letting him understand 
that it was wholly on his account ; and that seeing 
I could not prevail on him, I would shew my re- 
pect to him by my concern for his son : but these 
things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent 
away the next day for his son, and in about twenty 
days he came back with the messenger, bringing 
six or seven horses loaded with very rich furs, and 
which, in the whole, amounted to a very great 
value. 

His servants brought the horses into the town, 
but left the young lord at a distance till night, when 
he came incognito into our apartment, and his 
father presented him to me; and, in short, we 
concerted there the manner of our travelling, and 
every thing proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables^ 
black fox- skins, fine em ins, and such other furs 
that are very rich ; I say, I had bought them in 
that city for exchange for some of the goods 
brought from China ; in particular, for the cloves 
and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part 
here : and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a 
much better price than I could have done at 
London ; and my partner, who was sensible of the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SIT 

proBty and whose business^ more particalarly than 
mine, was merchandise^ was mightily pleased with 
our stay, on account of the traffic we made here. 

It was in the beginning of June when I left this 
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the 
world ; and indeed, it is so far out of the road of 
commerce, that I know not how it should be much 
talked of. We were ^now come to a very small 
caravan, being only thirty-two horses and camels 
in all, and all of them passed for mine, though my 
new guest was proprieter of eleven of them. It 
was most natural also, that I should take more 
servants with me than I had before, and the young 
lord passed for my steward ; what great man I 
passed for myself I know not, neither did it con- 
cern me to enquire. We had here' the worst and 
the largest desert to pass over that we met with in ^ 
all the journey ; indeed I call it the worst, because' 
the way was very deep in some places, and very 
uneven in others ; the best we had to say for it was, 
that we thought we had no troops of Tartars and 
robbers to fear, and that they never came on this 
side the river Oby, or at least but very seldom; 
but we found it otherwise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Musco- 
vite servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was 
perfectly acquainted with the country ; and who 
led us by private roads, that we avoided coming 



818 THE LIFK AND ADVENTURES 

into the principal towns and cities open the great 
roadj ftuchasTumen, Soloy Kamaakoy, and several 
others; hecaose the Muscovite garrisons, which 
are kept there, are very curious and strict in their 
ohservation upon travellers, and searching lest any 
of the banished persons of note should make their 
escape that way into Muscovy ; but by this means 
as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole 
journey was a desart, and we were obliged to en- 
camp and lie in our tents, when we might have had 
good accommodation in the cities on the way : this 
the youDg lord was so sensible of, that he would 
not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several 
cities on the way ; but lay abroad himself, with 
his servant, in the woods, and met us always at 
the appointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the 
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary 
between Europe and Asia; and the first city on 
the European skie was called Soloy Kamaskoy, 
which is as much as to say, the gpreat city on the 
river Kama ; and here we thought to have seen 
some evident alteration in the people,^their manners, 
their habit, their religion, and their business; but 
we were mistaken ; for as we had a vast desert to 
pass, which by relation, is near seven hundred miles 
long in some places, but not above two hundred 
miles over where we passed it ; so, till we came

past that horrible place, we found very little differ- 
ence between that country, and the Mogul Tar* 
tary ; the people mostly Pagans, and little better 
than the Savages of America; their houses and 
towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly 
barbarous, except in the cities as above, and the 
villages near them ; where they are Christians, as 
they call themselves, of the Greek church ; but even 
these have their religion mingled with so many re- 
lics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in 
some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought indeed we must, 
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, es- 
caped, as before, have been plundered and robbed, 
and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves : of 
what country they were, whether the roving bands 
of the Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on 
the banks of the Oby, had ranged thus far; or 
whether they were the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am 
yet at a loss to know; but they were all on horse- 
back, carried bows and arrows, and were at first 
about five-and-forty in number. They came so 
near to us as within about two musket shot; 
and, asking no questions, they surrounded us with 
their horses, and looked very earnestly upon us 
twice. At length they placed themselves just in 
our way ; upon which we drew up in a little line 
before our camels;, being not above sjxteen men in 



390 TH£ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

all; and being drawn up thuB^ we halted^ and sent 
out the Siberian servant who attended his lord^ to 
see who they were: his master was the more 
willing to let him go« because he was not a little 
apprehensive that they were a Siberian troop sent 
out after him. The man came up near them with 
a flag of truce, and called to them;, but though he 
spoke several of their languages, or dialects of lan- 
guages rather, he could not understand a word they 
said ; however, after some signs to him not tooHne 
nearer to them at his peril, so he said he understood 
them to mean, ofieringto shoot at him if he advan* 
ced, the fellow came back no wiser than he went, 
only that by their dress, he ^id, he believed 
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the 
Circassian hordes; and that there must be more of 
them on the great desert, though he never heard that 
ever any of them were seen so far north before. 

This was small comfort to us; however, we had 
no remedy : there was on oor left hand, at about 
a quartev of a mile's distance, a little grove or 
clump of trees, which stood close together^ and very 
near the road ; I immediately resolved we should 
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as 
well as we could there ; for, first, I considered that 
the trees would in a great measure cover us from 
their arrows;. and in the next place, they could 

not come to charge us in a body : it wa^ indeed

my old Portaguese pilot who proposed it ; and who 
had this excellency attending hitn^ namely, that he 
was always readiest and most apt to direct and en- 
courage iis in cases of the most dango:. We ad- 
Taoced immediately with what speed we could, and 
gained that little wood, the Tartars^ or thieves, for 
we knew not what to call them, keeping their 
stand, and not attempting to hinder us. When we 
came thither* we found, to our great satisfaction, 
that it was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and, 
OB the other side, a great spring of water, which, 
running ^t in a little rill or brook, was a little 
farther joined by another of the like bigness : and 
was, in short, the head or source of a considerable 
river, called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees 
which grew about this spring, were not in all above 
two hundred, but' were very large, and stood pretty 
thick: so that as soQn as we got in,* we- saw our- 
selves perfectly safe fi;om the enemy, unless they 
alighted and attacked us on foot. 

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, 
with indefatigable application, cut down great arms 
of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite ofi^ 
from one tree to another; so that, jie niadea con- 
tinued fence almost round us. 

We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy 
some hours, without perceiving they made any 
o£fer to stir; when about two hours before night,

they came down direc^y upon as ; and, though we 
had not peroeiyed it, we foond they had been 
joined by tome more of the samct to that they 
were near fourscore horse, whereof however, we 
fancied some were wooien. They came on tEl tfaey 
were witbin half a shot of onr little wood, when 
we fired one musket without ball, and caiied to 
them in the Russian tongue, to know what they 
wanted, and bid them keep off; but, as if they 
knew nothing of what we said» they came on with 
a double liiry directly op to the wood side> not 
imagining we wero so barricaded, that they could 
not. break in. Our old pilot was our captain, as 
well as he had been pur engineer; and deaured of 
us, not to fire upon them till they came within 
pistol-shot, that we might be sure to kill ; and that, 
when we did fire, we should be sure to take good 
aim. We bade him gire the word of cemmand; 
which he delayed so long, that they were, some 
of them, within two pikes l^iigUi of us whtti ve 
fired. 

We aimed so true (or ProTideace directed our 
shot so sure,) that we kiUed fourteen <rf the« at 
the first ToUey, and wounded several others, as 
also several of their horses; for we had afi «f u& 
loaded our pieces with two or ^ree boUels apiece 
at least. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 323 

They were terribly surprised with our fire^ and 
retreated immediately about one hundred rods 
from us ; in which time we loaded our pieces again, 
and, seeing them keep that distance, we sallied 
out* and caught four or five of their horses, whose 
riders, we sopposeed, were killed ; and coming up 
to the dead, we could easily perceive they were 
Tartars, but knew not from what country, or how 
they came to make an excursion such an unusual 
length. 

About an hour after, they made a motion to 
attack us again, and rode round our little wood, 
to see where else they might break in ; but finding 
OS always ready to face them, they went o£P again, 
and we resolved not to stir from the place for that 
night 

We slept a little, you may be sure ; but spent 
the most part of the night in strengthening our 
situation, and barricading the entrances into the 
wood ; and, keeping a strict watch,' we waited fi>r 
daylight, and, when it came, it gave us a very 
unwelcome discovery indeed : for the enemyi who 
we thought were discouraged with the reception 
they had met with, were now increased to no less 
than three hundred, and had set up eleven or 
twelve huts and tents, as if they were resolved to 
besiege us : and this little camp they had pitched, 
was upon the open plain, at about three quarters 



384 THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of a mile from us. We were indeed surprised at 
this discovery ; and now« I confess, I gave myself 
over for lost, and all that I had. The loss of my 
effects did not lie so near me, (though they were 
very considerable,) as the thoughts of falling into 
the hands of such barbarians, at the latter end of 
my journey, after so many difficulties and hazards 
as I had gone through ; and even in sight of our 
port, where we expected safety and deliverance. 
As for my partner, he was raging : he declared, 
that to lose his goods would be bis ruin ; and he 
^ would rather die than be starved ; and he was for 
fighting to the last drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh shewed 

itself, was for fighting to the last also; and my old 

pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them 

all, in the situation we then were in : and thus we 

^nt the day in debates of what we should do ; 

but towards evening, we found that the number of 

our enemies still increased : perhaps, as theywere 

abroad in several parties for prey, the first had sent 

out scouts to call for help, and to acquaint them of 

their booty; and we did not know but by the 

morning they might still be a greater number ; so 

I began to enquire of those people we had brought 

horn Tobolski, if there were no other, or more pri* 

vate ways, by which we might avoid them in the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

nigh^> and perhaps either retreat to some town^ or 
get help to guard us over the desart. 

The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord^ 
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not 
fight, he would engage to can*}' us off in the night 
to a way that went north towards the river Petraz, 
by which he made no doubt but we might get away, 
and the Tartars never the wiser ; but he said, his 
lord had told him he would not return, but would 
rather choose to fight. I told him, he mistook 
his lord ; for that he was too wise a man to love 
fighting for the sake of it ; that I knew his lord 
was brave enough by what he had shewed already; 
but that his lord knew better than to desire to have 
seventeen or eighteen men fight five hundred, un- 
less an unavoidable necessity forced them to it ; 
and that if he thought it possible for us to escape 
in the night, we had nothing else to do but to 
attempt it. He answered, if his lord gave him 
such order, he would lose his life if he did not per- 
form it. We soon brought his lord to* give that 
order, though privately^ and we immediately pre- 
pared for the putting it in practice. 

' And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kind- 
led a fire in our little camp, which we kept burn- 
ing, and prepared so as to make it burn all nighty 
that the Tartars might conchide we were still there; 
bnt^ as soon as it was dark^ that is to say, so as we

aS6 THE LIPB AND ADVENTURES 

oooM we the stan^ (for our guide would not stir be* 
fore,) having all our horses and camels ready load- 
ed* we followed our new guide« who> I soon fo<ind> 
steered himself by the pole or north star, all the 
country being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter still ; not that it was quite dark 
all night, but th^ moon began to rise; so that, in 
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be: 
but by six o'clock next morning we were gotten 
near forty miles, though the truth i«, we almost 
spoiled our horses. Here we found a Russian vil- 
lage, named Kirmaainskoy, where we rested, and 
heavd nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. 
About two hours before night we set out again, and 
travelled till eight the next morning, though not 
quite so hastily as before ; and about $even o'clock 
we passed a little river, called Kirtfia, and came to 
a good large town inhabited by Russians, and very 
populous^ called Oaomys.^ There we heard, that 
several troops or hffrds of Kalmucks had been 
abroad upon the desarty but that we were now oom* 
pletely out of danger of them, which wais to our 
great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we 
were obliged to get some fresh horses, and haviiig 
need enough of rest, we staid five days; and my 
partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian, 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SSI 

wbo broughi: us hither, the value of ten pistoles for 
his conductiDg us. 

In five days more we came to Veussima, upon 
the river Witzogda, which running into the river 
Dwina, we were there very happily near the end 
of oar travels by land, that river being navigable 
in seven days passage to Archangel. FVom hence 
wecaaie to Lawrenskoy, where the river joMis» the 
third of Jnly; and provided ourselves with two 
h^SfSISLg&'hoiiXs, and a barge, for our convenience. 
We embarked the seventh, and arrived all safe at 
Archangel the eighteenth, having been a year, 
five months, and three days, on the journey, in- 
cluding our stay of eight months and odd days at 
TobolskL 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks 
ibr the arrival of the ships, and must have tarried 
longer, had not a Hamborgher come in above a 
month sooner than any of the English ships ; when, 
after some consideration, that the cityof Hambuigh 
mi^t happen to be as good a market for our goods 
as London, we all took fireigbt with him; and 
having put onr goods on board, it was most natural 
for me to put my steward on bond to take care of 
them ; by wiuch means my young lord had a suf- 
ficient Qf^ortunity to conceal himself, never com* 
ing on shore again in all the time we staid there; 
and this he did, that he might not be seen in the 



988 THE LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

city, where some of the Moscow merchants would 
certainly have seen and discovered him. 

We sailed fnnn Archangel the twentieth of 
August the same year; and, after no extraordinary 
bad Yoyage, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of 
September. Here my partner and I found a very 
good sale for our godds^ as well those of China, as 
the sables, &c. of Siberia ; and dividing the pro* 
dttce of our effects, my share amounted to 3475/. 
17«. StL notwithstanding so many losses we had sus- 
tained, and charges we had been at; only remem- 
bering that I had included, in this, about 600/. 
worth of diamonds^ which I had purchased at Ben- 
gal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and 
went up to the Elbe, in order to go to the court of 
Vienna, where he resolved to seek protection, and 
where he could correspond with those of his father's 
friends who were left alive. He did not part with- 
out all the testimonies he could give, of gratitude 
for the service I had done him, and his sense of 
my kindness to the prince his father. 

To conclude : having staid near four months in* 
Hamburgh, I came from thence over land to the 
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and ar- 
rived in London the tenth of January 1705, ha- 
ving been gone from England ten years and nine 
months.
