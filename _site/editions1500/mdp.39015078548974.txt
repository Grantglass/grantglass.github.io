PREFACE.
-º-
IF ever the story of any private man's adven-
tures in the world were worth making public,
and were acceptable when published, the Edi-
'tor of this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man’s life exceed all that
(he thinks) is to be found extant; the life of
one man being scarce capable of a greater wa-
riety.
The story is told with modesty, with seri-
ousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to which wise men always
*…
this example, and to justify and honour the
wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our
circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes this narrative to be a just
history of fact ; neither is there any appear-

aware there are many who, on account of the .
very singular preservations the Author met
with, will give it the name of romance; yet, "
in which ever of these lights it shall be viewed,
he imagines, that the improvement of it, as

the reader, will be the same; and as such, he
thinks, without farther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in the pub-
lication. * *
