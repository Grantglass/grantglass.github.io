■*■ has met with in the world, has yet been 
no other than is acknowledged to be due to 
the furprifing variety of the fubjed, and to 
the agreeable manner of the performance. 

All the endeavours of envious people to re- 
proach it with being a romance, to fearch it 
for errors in geography, inconfiftency in the 
relation, and contradidions in the faft, have 
proved abortive, and as impotent as mali-

IV PREFACE, 

The Second Part, if the Editor's opinion 
may pafs, is (contrary to the ufage of Second 
Parts) every way as entertaining as the Firfi ; 
contains as ftrange and furprifing incidents, 
and as great a variety of them; nor is the 
application lefs ferious or fuitable ; and doubt- 
lefs will, to the fober, as well as the ingenious 
Reader, be every way as profitable and di- 
verting; and this makes the abridging this 
Work as fcandalous, as it is knavifh and ridi- 
culous. Seeing, to fhorten the Book, that they 
may feem to reduce the value, they ftrip it of 
all thofe reflexions, as well religious as moral, 
which are not only the greateft beauties of the 
Work, but are calculated for the infinite ad- 
vantage of the Reader. 

By this, they leave the Work naked of its 
brighteft ornaments; and yet they would' (at 
the fame time they pretend that the Author 
has fupplied his ftory out of his invention) 
take from it the improvement, which alone 
recommends that invention to wife and good 
men. 

The injury thefe men do to the Propri- 
etors of Works, is a practice all honeft

nate in my thoughts, fliould be worn out, the volafife 
part be fully evacuated, or at leaft condenfed, and I 
might at 6 1 years of age have been a little inclined to 
ftay at home, and have done venturing life and for- 
tune any more. 

Nay farther, the common motive of foreign ad-' 

ventures was taken away in me; for I had no fortune 
to make, I had nothing to feek : If I had gained ten 
thoufand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had 
already fufficient for me, and for thofe I had to leave 
it to ; and that I bad was vifibly increafmg ; for 
having no great family, I could not fpend the income 
of what I had, unlefs I would fct up for an expenfive 
way of living, fuch as a great family, fervants, 
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I 
had no notion of, or inclination to ; fo that I had 
nothing indeed to do but to fit ftill, and fully enjoy 
what I had got, and fee it increafe daily upon my 
bands* 

Yet all thefe things had no efFeft upon me, or at 
leaft not enough to refift the ftrong inclination I 
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a 
chronical diftemper ; particularly the defire of feeing 
my new plantation in the ifland^ and the colony I left 
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it 
all night, and my imagination run upon it all day ; 
it was uppermoft in all my thoughts, and my fancy 
worked fo fteadily and ftrongly upon it, that I talked 
of it in my fleep; in fhort, nothing could remove it 
out of my mind; It even broke fo violently into all 
niy difcourfes, that it made my converfation tirefome; 
for I could talk of nothing elfe, all my difcourfe run 
into it, even to impertinence, and I faw it myfelf,

OP ROBINSON CRUSOE* 



1 have often heard perfons of good jiidgitietit fay, 
that all the ftir people make in the world about 
ghofts and apparitions^ is owing to the ftrength of 
imaginationj and the powerful operation of fancy 
in their minds ; that there is no flich thing as a fpirit 
appearing, or a ghoft walking, and the like; that 
peopIe^s poring affectionately upon the paft converfa- 
tion of their deceafed friends fo realifes it to them, 
that they are capable of fancying upon fome extra* 
ordinary circumftances that they fee them, talk to 
them, and are anfwered by them, when, in truth, 
there is nothing but fhadow and vapour in the thing j 
and they really know nothing of the tnatten 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether 
there are any fuch things as real apparitions, fpeftres, 
or walking of* people after they are dead, or whether 
there is any thing in the ftories they tell us of that 
kind, more than the produd of vapours, fick minds j 
and wandering fancies: But this I know, that my 
imagination worked up to fuch a height, and brought 
me into fuch excefs of vapours, or what elfe I may 
call it, that I adually fuppofed myfelf often-times 
upon the fpot, at my old caftle behind the trees, faw 
my old Spaniard^ Friday^ father, and the reprobate 
iailors whom I left upon the ifland; nay, I fancied I talk- 
ed with them, and looked at them fo fteadily, though 
I was broad awake, as at perfons juft before me ; and 
this I did till I often frightened myfelf with the images 
my fancy reprefented to me: one time in my fleep I 
had the villainy of the three pirate failors fo lively relat- 
ed to me by the firft Spaniard and Fryday\ father, that 
it was furprizing; they told me how they barbaroufly 
iittempted to murder all the Spaniards^ and that they

fet fire to the provifions they had laid up, on pur- 
pofe to diftrefs and ftarve them, things that I had 
never heard of, and that were yet all of them 
true in faft : but it was fo warm in my imagina- 

' tion, and fo realized to me, that to the hour I faw 
them, I could not be perfuaded but that it was or 
would be true ; alfo, how I refented it when the 
Spaniard comphintd to me, and how I brought them 
to jullice, tried them before me, and ordered them 
all three to be hanged : what there was really in this, 
fliall be feen in its place : for however, I came to form 
fuch things in my dream, and what fecret converfe 
of fpirits injedted it, yet there was, I fay, very much 
of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing 
literally and fpecifically true: but the general part 
was fo true, the bafe and villainous behaviour of thefe 
three hardened rogues was fuch, and had been fo 
much worfe than all I can defcribe, that the dream 
had too much fimilltude of the faft, and as I would 
aft'jrwards have puniflied them, feverely; fo if I had 
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and 
fhould have been juftifiable both by the laws of God 
and man. 

But to return to my ftory. In this kind of temper 
I had lived fome years ; I had no enjoyment of my 
life, no pleafant hours, no agreeable diyerfion but 
what had fomething or other of this in it, fo that 
my wife, who faw my tnind fo wholly bent upon it, 
told me very ferioufly one night, that fhe believed 

^ there was fome fecret powerful impulfe of Providence 
upon me, which had determined me to go thither 
again ; and that fhe found nothing hindred my going 
but my being engaged to a wife and children. She

told me, that it was true fhe could not think of part- 
ing with me ; but as fhe was aflTured, that if fhe was 
dead it would be the firfl: thing I would do ; fo, as 
it feemed to her that the thing was determined above, 
fhe would not be the only obftruclion: for if I 

thought fit, and refolved to go here fhe found 

me very intent upon her words, and that I looked 
very earneflly at her ; fo that it a little difordcred her, 
and fhe flopped. I afked her why fhe did not go on, 
and fay out what fhe was going to fay ? But I per- 
ceived her heart was too full, and fome tears flood in 
her eyes : Speak out my dear, faid I, are you willing 
I fhould go ? No, fays fhe, very affeftionately, I am far 
from willing : but if you are refolved to go, fays fhe, 
and rather than I will be the only hindrance, I will 
go with you ; for though I think it a prepofle- 
rous thing for one of your years, and in your condi- 
tion, yet if it mufl be, faid fhe again, weeping, I 
won't leave you ; for if it be of heaven, you mufl 
do it ; there is no refifling it ; and if heaven makes 
it your duty to go, he will alfo make it mine to go 
with you, or otherwife difpofe of me, that I may 
not obflrudl it. 

This affeftionate behaviour of my wife brought 
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to confider 
what I was doing ; I correfted my wandering fancy, 
and began to argue with myfelf fedately, what bufi- 
nefs I had, after threefcore years, and after fuch a 
life of tedious fufferings and difaflers, and clofed in 
fo happy and eafy a manner, I fay, what bufinefs 
had I to ruih into new hazards, and ^ut myfelf upon 
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run 
into f 

B 3 With 



6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

With thofe thoughts, I confidered my new engagci 
ment ; that I had a wife, one child born, and my 
wife then great with child of another j that I had 
all the world could give me, and had no need to feek 
hazards for gain ; that I was declining in years, and 
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained, 
than of feeking to increafe it ; that as to what my 
wife had faid, of its being an impulfe from heaven, 
and that it fhould be my duty to go, I had no notioA 
of that ; fo after many of thefe cogitations, I ftrug^ 
gled with the power of my imagination, reafoned my-^ 
felf out of it, as I believe people may always do in like 
cafes ^ if they will ; and, in a word, I conquered it; 
compofed myfelf with fuch arguments as occurred to 
my thoughts, and which my prefent condition fur* 
nifhed me plentifully with ; and particularly, as the 
mod effeftual method, I refolved to divert myfelf 
with other things, and to engage in fome bufmefs 
that might effeftually tie me up from any more 
excurfions of this kind ; for I found the thing return 
upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, 
or any thing of moment immediately before me. 

To this purpofe I bought a little farm in the coun- 
ty of Bedford^ and refolved to remove myfelf thither. 
I had a little convenient houfe upon it, and the land 
about it I found was capable of great improvement, 
and that it was many ways fuited to my inclination, 
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting 
and improving of land ; and particularly, being an 
inland country, I was removed from converfing 
fimong fhips, failors, and things relating to the re-f 
piote part gf the world, 

la 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. J 

In a word, I went down to my farm, fettled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, 
horfes, cows, flieep ; and fetting ferioufly to work, 
became in one half year a meer country gentleman; 
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my 
fervants, cultivating the ground, enclofing, planting, 
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the moft agreeable 
life that nature was capable of diredJing, or that a 
man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being 
retreated to. 

I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to 
pay, was limited by no articles ; I could pull up or 
cut down as I pleafed : what I planted was for my- 
felf, and what I improved, was for my family ; and 
having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had 
not the lead difcomfort in any part of ftiy life, as to this 
world. Now I thought indeed, that I enjoyed the 
middle ftate of life which my father fo earneftly re- 
commended to me, a kind of heavenly life, fome* 
thing like what is defcribed by the poet upon the 
fubjeft of a country life. 

Free from vices^ free from care^ 
Age has no pains^ and youth nofnare* 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow 
from unforefeen Providence unhinged me at once ; 
and not only made a breach upon me, inevitable and 
incurable, but drove me, by its confequence, upon 
a deep relapfe into the wandering difpofition ; which, 
as I may fay, being born in my very blood, foon re- 
covered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a 
violent diftemper, came on with an irrefiftible force 
lipon me j fo that nothing could make any more

imprcflion upon me. This blow was the lofs rif 
my wife. 

It is not my bufinefs here to write an elegy upon 
my wife,>to give a chai after of her particular virtues, 
and make my court to the fex by the flattery of a 
funeral fermon. She was, in a few words, the flay 
of all my affairs, the center of all my enterprizes, 
the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that 
happy compafs I was in, from the mofl extravagant 
and ruinous projed that fluttered in my head as 
above ; and did more to guide my rambling genius, 
than a mother's tears, a father's inflruftions, a friend'$ 
counfel, or all my own reafoning powers could do. 
I was happy in liflening to her tears, and in being 
moved by her entreaties, and to the lafl degree defo- 
late and diflocated in the world by the lofs of her. 

When flie was gone, the world looked aukwardly 
round me; I was as much a ftranger in it, in my 
thoughts, as I was in the Braftls when I went firfl 
on Ihore there ; and as much alone, except as to the 
afTiflance of fervants, as I was in my ifland. I knew 
neither what to do, or what not to do. I faw the 
world bufy round me, one part labouring for bread, 
and the other part fquandring in vile excefljbs or 
empty pleafures, equally miferable, becaufe the end 
they propofed ftill fled from them ; for the men of 
pleafure every day furfeited of their vice, and heaped 
up work for forrow and repentance; and the men 
of labour fpent their flrength in daily ftrugglings for 
breath to maintain the vital flrength they laboured 
with, fo living in a daily circulation of forrow, living 
but to work, and working but to live, as if daily 

bread 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

bread were the only end of a -wearifome life, and a 
wearifome life the only occafion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my 
kingdom, the ifland ; where I fufFered no more corn 
to grow, becaufe I did not want it ; and bred no 
more goats, becaufe I had no more ufe for them ; 
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew 
mildewed, and had fcarce the favour to be looked 
upon in 20 years. 

All thefe things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as reafon and religion had diftated 
to me, would have taught me to fearch farther than 
human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there 
was fomething which certainly was the reafon and 
end of life, fuperior to all thefe things, and which 
was either to be poJOTefled, or at lead hoped for, on 
this fide the grave. 

But my fage counfellor was gone; I was like a fhip 
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind: 
my thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my 
head was quite turned with the whimfies of foreign 
adventures; and all the pleafing innocent amufements 
of my farm, and my garden, my cattle, and my 
family, which before entirely poffeft me, were no- 
thing to me, had no relifh, and were like mufic to 
one that has no ear, or food to one that has no tafte: 
In a word, I refolved to leave off houfe-keeping, lett 
my farm, and return to London; and in a few 
months after I did fo. 

When I came to London, I was ftill as uneafy as 
before ; I had no relifli to the place, fto employ- 
ment in it, nothing to do but to faunter about like 
an idle perfon, of whom it may be faid, he is per- 
feftly ufelefs in God's creation and it is not one

lO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

farthing matter to the reft of his kind, whether he 
be dead or alive. This alfo was the thing which of all 
circumftances of life was the moft my averfion, who 
had been all my days ufed to an aftive life; and 
I would often fay to myfelf, Ajiate of idlenefs is the 
very dregs of life; and indeed I thought I was much 
more fuitably employed, when I was 26 days 
making me a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom as I have obferved before I had 
brought up to the fea, and had made him commander 
of a fhip, was come home from a fhort voyage to 
Bilboa, being the firft he had made ; he came 
to me, and told me, that fome merchants of his 
acquaintance had been propofing to him to go a 
voyage for them to the Eq/i Indies and to China j as 
private traders : and now uncle, fays he, if you will 
go to fea with me, Fll engage to land you upon your 
old habitation in the ifland, for we are to touch at 
the Brafds. 

Nothing can be a greater demonftration of a future 
ftate, and of the exiftence of an invifible world, than 
the concurrence of fecond caufes with the ideas of 
things which we form in our minds, perfectly re* 
ferved, and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my diftemper 
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his thoughts to fay, when 
that very morning before he came to me I had, in 
a great deal of confufion of thought, and revolving 
every part of my circumftances in my mind, come 
to this refolution, viz. That I would go to Lifion^^ 
and confult with my old fea-captain ; and fo, if it was 

, rational 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. II , 

Tafional and prafticable, I would go and fee the 
illand again, and fee what was become of my people 
there. I had pleafed myfelf alfo with the thoughts of 
peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from 
hence, getting a patent for the poffeffion, and I know 
not what ; when, in the middle of all this, in comes 
my nephew, as I have faid, with his project of carry- 
ing me thither, in his way to the Eaji Indies. 

I paufed a while at his words, and looking fteadily 
at him. What Devil^ faid I, fent you of this unlucky 
errand? My nephew ftartled, as if he had beea 
frighted at firft ; but perceiving I was not much dif- 
pleafed with the propofal, he recovered himfelf. I 
hope it may not be an unlucky propofal. Sir, fays he ; 
i dare fay you would be pleafed to fee your new co- 
lony there, where you once reigned with more felicity 
than moft of your brother monarchs in the world. 

In a word, the fcheme hit fo exaftly with my tem- 
per, that is to fay, with the prepoffeflion I was under, 
and of which I have faid fo much, that I told him, 
in few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I 
would go with him : but I told him, I would not 
promife to go any farther than my own ifland. Why 
Sir, fays he, you don't want to be left there again, 
I hope ? Why, faid I, can you not take me up again 
in your return ? he told me, it could not be poffible 
that the merchants would allow him to come that way 
with a loaden fhip of fuch value, it being a month's 
fail out of his way, and might be three or four: 
Befides, Sir, if I fhould mifcarry, faid he, and not 
return at ^11, then you would be juft reduced to 
the condition you were in before. 

This 



It LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a 
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed floop on 
board the fhip, which, being taken in pieces arid 
Ihipped on board the (hip, might, by the help of 
fome carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us, 
be fet up again in the ifland, and finifhed, fit to go 
to fea in a few days. 

I was not long refolving ; for indeed the importu- 
nities of my nephew joined in fo eifeftually with my 
inclination, that nothing could oppofe me : on the 
other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody con- 
cerned themfelves fo much for me, as to perfuade 
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend 
the widow, who earneftly ftruggled with mc to con- 
fider my years, my eafy circumftances, and the 
needlefs hazard of a long voyage ; and, above all, 
my young children : but it was all to no purpofe; I 
had an irrefiftible defire to the voyage ; and I told her 
I thought there was fomething fo uncommon in the 
impreffions I had upon my mind for the voyage, that 
it would be a kind of refilling Providence, if I fhould 
attempt to fl:ay at home ; after which flie ceafed her 
expoftulations, and joined with me, not only in 
making provifion for my voyage, but alfo in fettling 
my family affairs in my abfence, and providing for 
the education of my children. 

In order to this, I made my will, and fettled the 
eftate I had in fuch a manner for my children, and 
placed in fuch hands, that I was perfeftly eafy and 
fatisfied they would have juftice done them, what- 
ever might befal me ; and for their education, I left 
it wholly to my widow, with a fuflicient maintenence 
to'herfelf for her care : all which fiie richly deferveti; 

for 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I^ 

for no mother could have taken more €are In their 
education, or underftood it better ; and as fhe lived 
till 1 came home, I alfo lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to fail about the beginning 
of yanuary 1 694-5, and I with my man Friday went 
on board in the Downs the 8th, having befides that 
iloop which I mentioned above, a very confiderable 
•cargo of all kinds of neceffary things for my colony, 
which, if I did not find in good condition, I refolved 
to leave fo. 

Firft, I carried with me fome fervants, whom I pur- 
pofed to place there, as inhabitants, or at lead to fet 
on work there upon my own account, while I ftayed, 
and either to leave them there, or carry them for- 
ward, as they fhould appear willing; particularly, \ 
carried two carpenters, a fmith, and a very handy 
ingenious fellow who was a cooper by trade, but 
was alfo a general mechanick ; for he was dextrous 
at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind com, wa« 
a good turner, and a good pot maker ; he alfo made 
any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of 
wopd ; in a word, we called him our Jack of all 
trades. 

With thefe I carried a taylor^ who had offered 
himfelf to go paffenger to the Eaji Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards confented to flay on our new 
plantation, and proved a moft neceffary handy fellow 
as could be defired, in many other bufineffes befides 
that of this trade ; for, as I obferved formerly, necef-

might comfortably fupply them for feven years ; if I 
remember right, the materials which I carried for cloath-

fuch things as they could want for wearing, amount-

I carried alfo a hundred fpare arms, mulkets, and 
fuzees, befides fome pidols, a confiderable quantity 
of (hot of all (izes, three or four tons of lead, and 
two pieces of brafs cannon j and becaufe I knew not

I carried ah hundred barrels of powder, befides 
fwords, cutlaffes, and the iron part of fome pikes,

carry two fmall quarter-deck guns more than he 
wanted for his (hip, to leave behind, if there was 
occafion ; that when they came there^ we might build 
a fort, and man it againft all forts of enemies : and

of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain

and bad weather happened, on this firft fetting out, 
which made the voyage longer than I expedled it at 
firft ; and I, who had never made but one voyage, 
(viz.) my jirji voyage to Guinea^ in which I might be 
faid to come back again as the voyage was at firft 
defigned, began to think the fame ill fate ftill attended 
ifne; and that I was born to be never contented with 
being on fhore, and yet to be always unfortunate 
at fea. 

Contrary winds firft put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland^ where 
we lay wind-bound two and thirty days ; but we 
had this fatisfa£tion with the difafter, that provifions 
were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmoft plen- 
ty ; fo that while we lay here we never touched 
the fhip's ftores, but rather added to them ; here alfo 
I took feveral hogs, and two cows, with their calves, 
which I refolved, if I had a good paffage, to put on 
fliore in my ifland; but we found occafion to difpofe 
otherwife of them. 

We fet out the 5th of February from Ireland^ and 
had a very fair gale. of wind for fome days; as I re- 
member, it might be about the 20th of February in 
the evening late, when the mate having the watch, 
came into the round-houfe, and told us he faw a 
flafh of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and while he was 
telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boat- 
fwain heard another.^ This made us all run out upon 
the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing, 
but in a few minutes we faw a very great light, and 
found that there was fome veryterriblefireat a diftance; 
immediately we had recourfe to our reckonings, in 
which we all agreed that there could be no land

that way, in which the fire fhewed itfelf, no not fof 
500 leagues, for it appeard at W, N. W. upon this 
we concluded it muft be fome fhip on fire at fea ; and 
as by our hearing the noife of guns juft before, we 
concluded it could not be far off, we ftood direSly 
towards it, and were prefently fatisfied we Ihould 
difcover it, bfecaufe the farther we failed the greater 
the light appeared, tho* the weather being hazy we 
could not perceive any thing but the light for a 
while ; in about half an hour's failing, the wind being 
fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather 
clearing up a little, we could plainly difcern that it 
was a great fhip on fire in the middle of the fea. 

I was moft fenfibly touched with this difafter, 
though not at all acqiiiainted with the perfons engaged 
in it ; I prefently recollected my former circumftances, 
in what condition I was in when taken up by 
the Portugal Captain ; and how much more deplorable 
the circumftances of the poor creatures belonging to 
this fhip muft be if they had ho other fhip in company 
with them : upon this I immediately ordered, that 
five guns fhould be fired, one foon after another, 
that, if poffible, we might give notice to them 
that there was help for them at hand, and that they 
might endeavour to fave themfelves in their boat; 
for though we could fee the flame in the fhip, yet 
they, it being night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by fome time upon this, only driving as. 
the burning fhip drove, waiting for day light; when 
on a fudden, to our great terrof, though we had 
reafon to expeft it, the fhip blew ijp in the air, and 
immediately funk : this was terrible, and indeed an 
afHiaing fight, for the fake of the poor men, who, I 

concluded.

concluded mufl be either all deftroyed in the fliip, 
or be in the utmoft diftrefs in their boats in the mid- 
dle of the ocean, which, at prefent, by reafon it was 
dark, I could not fee : however to direft them as well 
as I could, I caufed lights to be hung out in all the 
parts of the (hip where we could, and which we had 
lanthoms for, and kept firing guns all the night 
long ; letting them know by this, that there was a 
Ihip not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning, we difcovered 
the (hip's boats, by the help of our perfpefl:ive-gla(res ; 
and found there were two of them, both thronged 
with people, and deep in the water : we perceived 
they rowed, the wind being againft them; that they 
faw our (hip, and did the utmoft to make us fee 
them. 

We immediately fpread bur ancient, to let them 
know we faw them ; and hung a waft out, as a fig- 
nal for them to come on board ; and then made more 
fail, ftanding direftly to them. In a little more than 
half an hour, we came up with them, and, in a 
word, took them all in, being no lefs than fixty- 
four men, women, and children ; for there were a 
great many paflTengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French mer- 
chant-(hip of 300 tons, homeward-bound from 
Rebeck, in the river of Canada. The mafter gave 
us a long account of the diftrefs of his (hip, how the 
fire began in the fteerage by the negligence of the 
fteerfman ; but, on his crying out for help, was, as 
every body thought, entirely put out : but they foon 
found that fome fparks of the firft fire had gotten 
into fome part of the (hip, fo difficult to come at.

that they could not eflFeftually quench it ; and after- 
wards getting in between the timbers, and within 
the cieling of the (hip, it proceeded into the hold, 
and maftered all the ikill and all the application 
they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into their 
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty 
large ; being their long boat, and a great fhallop, 
befides a fmall (kiff, which was of no great fcrvice to 
them, other than to get fome frefh water and provi- 
fions into her, after they had fecured themfelves from 
the fire* They had indeed fmall hope of their lives 
by getting into thefe boats at that diftance from toy 
land; only, as they faid well, that they were efcaped 
from the fire, and had a poffibility, that fome Ihip 
might happen to be at fea, and might take them in^ 
They had fails, oars, and a compafs ; and were pre- 
paring to make the beft of their way to Newfound- 
landy the wind blowing pretty fair ; for it blew an 
eafy gale at S. E. by E. They had as much provi- 
fions and water, as, with fparing it fo as to be next 
door to flarving, might fupportthem about 12 days; 
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con- 
trary winds, the captain faid, he hoped he might get 
to the banks of Newfoundland, and might perhaps 
take fome filh to fuftain them till they might go on 
fliqre. But there were fo many chances againft them 
in all thefe cafes ; fuch as llorms to overfet and foun- 
der them ; rains and cold to benumb and perifh their 
limbs ; contrary winds to keep them out and flarve 
them; that it mufl have been next to miraculous if 
they had efcaped. 

In the midft of their confultations, every one being 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the captain with tears:

in liis eyes told me, they were on a fudden furprifed 
•with the joy of hearing a gunfire, and after that 
four more ; thefe were the five guns which I caufed 
to be fired at firft feeing the light : this revived their 
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as above, 
I defigned it fliould, viz. that there was a fhip at 
hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe gtlns, that they took 
down their mafls and fails ; and the found coming 
from the windward, they refolved to lie by till 
morning. Some time after this, hearing no more 
guns, they fired three mufquets, one a confiderable 
while after another ; but thefe, the wind being con- 
trary, we never heard. 

Some time after that again, they were ftill more 
agreeably furprifed with feeing our lights, and hear- 
ing the guns, which, as I have faid, I caufed to be 
fired all the refl of the night ; this fet them to work 
with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at leaft 
that we might the fooner come up with them ; and 
at laft, to their inexpreffible joy, they found we faw

It is impoflible for me to exprefs the feveral geflures, 
the ftrange ecftafies, the variety of poftures, which 
thefe poor delivered people run into, to exprefs the 
joy of their fouls at fo unexpected a deliverance ; 
grief and fear are eafily defcribed; fighs, tears, 
groans, and a very few motions of head and hands, 
make up the fum of its variety : but an excefs of joy, 
a furprife of joy, has athoufand extravagancies in itf 
there were fome in tears, fome raging and tearing

tic ; fome ran about the (hip ftamping with their 
feet, others wringing their hands ; fome were 
dancing, feveral finging, fome laughing, more cry- 
ing ; many quite dumb, not able to fpeak a word ; 
others fick and vomiting, feveral fwooning, and 
ready to faint ; and a few were crofSng themfelves 
and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there might be 
many that were thankful afterwarci ; but the paflion 
was too ftrong for them at firft, and they were not 
able to mafter it ; they were thrown into ecftafies and 
a kind of frenzy, and fo there were but a very few 
who were compofed and ferious in their joy. 

Perhaps alfo the cafe may have fome addition to it, 
from the particula,r circumftance of the nation they 
belonged to ; I mean the French^ whofe temper is 
allowed to be more volatile, more.pafiionate, and 
more fprightly, and their fpirits more fluid, than of 
other nations. I am not philofopher to determine 
the caufe, but nothing I had ever feen before came 
up to it : the ecflafies poor Friday^ my trufty favage, 
was in, when he found his father in the boat, came 
the neareft to it ; and the furprife of the mafter, and 
his two companions, whom I delivered from the two 
villains that fet them on fhore in the ifland, came a 
little way towards it; but nothing was to compare 
to this, either that I faw in Friday^ or any where elfe 
in my life. 

It is farther obfervable, that thefe extravagancies 
d* d not (how themfelves in that diflferent manner I 
have mentioned, in diflferent perfons only : but all 
the variety would appear in a fhort fucceflion of mo- 
ments, in one and the fame perfon. A man that we

few this minute dumb, and, as it were, flupid and 
confounded, (hould the next minute be dancing and 
hallooing like an antick ; and the next moment a 
tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and 
llamping them under his feet like a madman ; a few 
minutes after that, we fhould have him all in tears, 
then fick, then fwooning ; and had not immediate 
help been had, would in a few moments more have 
been dead ; and thus it was, not with one or two, 
or ten or twenty, but with the greateft: part of them; 
and, if I remember right, our furgeon was obliged to 
let above thirty of them blood. 

There were two piiefts among them, one an old 
man, and the other a young man ; and that which 
was ftrangeft was, that the oldeft man was the 
worft. 

As foon as he fet his foot on board our fhip, and 
faw himfelf fafe, he dropped down ftone-dead, to all 
appearance ; not the leaft fign of life could be per- 
ceived in him ; our furgeon immediately applied pro- 
per remedies to recover him ; and was the only man 
in the (hip that believed he was not dead : and at 
length he opened a vein in his arm, having firft cha- 
fed and rubbed the part, fo as to warm it as much 
as poffible : upon this the blood, which only dropped 
at firft, flowed fomething freely ; in three minutes 
after the man opened his eyes ; and about a quarter 
of an hour after that he fpoke, grew better, and, 
in a little time, quite well ; after the blood was flop- 
ped, he walked about, told us he was perfeftly well, 
took a dram of cordial which the furgeon gave him, 
and was, what we called, come to himfelf; about a 
quarter of an hour after this, they came running

into the cabbin to the furgeon, who was bleeding a 
French woman that had fainted ; and told him, the 
prieft was gone ftark mad. It feems he had began 
to revolve the change of his circumftances in his 
mind, and this put him into an ecftacy of joy ; his 
fpirits whirled about fafter than th^ veffels could con- 
vey them ; the blood grew hot and feverifti ; and the 
man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever 
was in it ; the furgeon would not bleed him again in 
that condition, but gave him fomething to doze and 
put him to fleep, which, after fome time, operated 
upon him, and he waked next morning perfedtly 
compofed, and welL 

The younger prieft behaved himfelf with great com- 
mand of his paffion, and was really an example of a 
ferious well-governed mind ; at his firft coming on 
board the fliip, he threw himfelf flat on his face, 
proftrating himfelf in thankfulnefs for his deliverance; 
in which I unhappily and unfeafonably difturbed him, 
really thinking he had been in a fwoon; but he fpoke 
calmly; thanked me; told me, he was giving God 
thanks for his deliverance ; begged me to leave him 
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he 
would give me thanks alfo. 

I was heartily forry that I difturbed him ; and not 
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
alfo ; he continued in that pofture about three 
• minutes, or a little more, after I left him ; then came 
to me, as he had faid he would, and, with a great 
deal of ferioufnefs and afFeftion, but with tears in 
his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given 
him and fo many miferable creatures their lives ; 
I told him, I had no room to move him to thank 

God 



OF ROBIKSON CkUSOfi* H^ 

God for it, rather than me ; for I had feen, that he 
had done that already: but I added, that it was 
nothing but what reafon and humanity diftated to 
all men, and that we had as much reafon as he to 
give thanks to God, who had bleffed us fo far as to 
make us the inftruments of his mercy to fo many of 
his creatures. 

After this the young priefl applied himfelf to his 
country folks ; laboured to compofe them ; perfuaded 
intreated, argued, reafoned with them, and did his 
iitmoft to keep them within the exercife of their rea- 
fon ; and with fome he had fuccefs, though others 
were, for a time, out of all government of 
themfelves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as per- 
haps it may be ufeful to thofe into whofe hands it 
may fall, in the guiding themfelves in all the extrava- 
gancies of their paffions ; for if an excefs of joy can 
carry men out to fuch a length beyond the reach of 
their reafon, what will not the extravagancies of 
anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to? 
And indeed, here I faw reafon for keeping an ex- 
ceeding watch over our paffions of every kind, as 
well thofe of joy and fatisfaftion, as thofe of forrow 
and anger. 

We were fomething difordered by thefe extrava- 
gancies among our new guefts for the firft day j but 
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for 
them as well as our fhip would allow, and they had 
flept heartily, as moft of them did, being fatigued 
and frightened, they were quite another fort of peo- 
ple the next day. 

C 4 Nothing 



\ 



64 I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknow- 
ledgments for the kindnefs fliewn them was wanting ; 
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough 
to exceed that way. The captain, and one of the 
priefts, came to me the next day ; and, defiring to 
fpeak with me and my nephew, the commander, 
began to confult with us what fliould be done with 
them ; and firft they told us, that, as we had faved 
their lives, fo all they had was little enough for a 
return to us for the kindnefs received. The captain 
faid, they had faved fome money, and fome things 
of value in their boats, catched haftily out of the 
flames ; and if we would accept it, they were ordered 
to make an offer of it all to us ; they only defired to 
be fet on fhore fomewhere in our way, where, if 
poflible, they might get a paffage to France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at firft 
word, and to confider what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I over-ruled him in that part ; for I knew 
what it was to be fet on fhore in a ftrange country ; 
and if the Portugal captain that took me up at fea 
had ferved me fo, and took all I had for my delive- 
rance, I muft have ftarved, or have been as much a 
flave at the Brafils, as I had been at Barbary, the 
being fold to a Mahometan only excepted ; and per- 
haps a Portuguefe is not a much better mailer than a 
Turk, if not, in fome cafes, a much worfe. 

I therefore told the French captain, that we had 
taken them up in their diftrefs, it was true ; but that 
it was our duty to do fo, as wq were fellow-creatures, 
and as we would defire to be fo delivered, if we were 
in the like or any other extremity ; that we had done 
nothing for them, but wh^t we believed they would 

have 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

have done for us if we had been in their cafe, and 
they in our's ; but that we took them up to ferve them, 
not to plunder them ; and that it would be a moll bar- 
barous thing, to take that little from them which they 
had faved out of the fire, and then fet them on Ihore, 
and leave them ; that this would be firft to fave 
them from death, and then kill them ourfelves ; favc 
them from drowning, and then abandon them to 
ftarving; and therefore I would not let the leaft 
thing be taken from them : as to fetting them on 
Ihore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding 
difficulty to us, for that the fhip was bound to the 
EaJi'Indies ; and though we were driven out of our 
courfe to the weftward a very great way, which per- 
haps was dire<3:ed by heaven on purpofe for their de- 
liverance, yet it was impoffible for us wilfully to 
change our voyage on this particular account ; nor 
could my nephew, the captain, anfwer it to the 
freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to 
purfue his voyage by the Wciy o£ Bra/il ; and all i 
knew he could do for them was, to put ourfelves in 
the way of meeting with other fhips homeward- 
bound from the Pfeji-Indies^ and get them paffage, 
if poffible, to England or France. 

The firft part of the prppofal was fo generous and 
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it ; but 
they were in a great confternation, efpecially the paf- 
fengers, at the notion of being carried away to the 
Eajl-Indies : they then intreated me, that feeing I 
was driven fo far to the weftward before I met with 
them, I would at leaft keep on the fame courfe to the 
banks of Neufoundland^ where it was poffible I might 
meet with fome (hip or floop that they might hire to 
carry them back to Canada^ from whence they came. 

I though 



26 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I thought this was but a reafonable requeft on their 
part ; and therefore I inclined to agree tp it ; for in- 
deed I confidered, that to carry this whole company 
to the EaJi'Indies^ would not only be an intolerable 
feverity to the poor people, but would be ruining our 
whole voyage by devouring all our provifions \ fo I 
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an 
unforefeen accident made abfolutely neceffary to us ; 
and in which no one could fay we were to blame; 
for the laws of God and nature would have forbid, 
that we fliould refufe to take up two boats full of 
people in fuch a diftreffed condition ; and the nature 
of the thing as well refpeding ourfelves, as the poor 
people, obliged us to fee them on fhore fomewhere 
or other, for their deliverance ; fo I confented that 
we would carry them to Newfoundland^ if wind and 
weather would permit ; and, if not, that I would 
carry them to Martinico in the Weji-Indies. 

The wind continued frelh eafterly, but the wea- 
ther pretty good ; and as it had blowed continually 
in the points between N» E. and S. E. a long time, 
we miffed feveral opportunities of fending them to 
France ; for we met feveral fliips bound to Europe ^^ 
whereof two were French^ from St. Chrt/iopher* s ; 
but they had been fo long beating up againft the 
wind, that they durft take in no paffengers for fear 
of wanting provifions for the voyage, as well for 
themfelves as for thofe they fiiould take in ; fo we 
were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this, 
that we made the Banks of Newfoundland^ where, to 
(horten my ftory^ we put all our French people on 
board a bark, which they hired at fea there, to put 
them on fhore, and afterwards to carry them to 

France^

Trance^ if they could get provifions to viftual them- 
felves with : when, I fay, all the French went on 
fhore, I fliould remember, that the young prieft I 
fpoke of, hearing we were bound to the Eaji Indies^ 
defired to go the voyage with us, and to be fet on 
fliore on the coaft of Coromandel : I readily agreed to 
that ; for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very 
good reafon, as will appear afterwards ; alfo four of 
the feamen entered themfelves in our Ihip, and pro- 
ved very ufeful fellows. 

From hence we direded our courfe for the PFg/?- 
Indiesy (leering "away S. and ^. by E, for about 20 
days together, fometimes little or no wind at all, 
when we met with another fubjeft for our humanity 
to work upon, almoft as deplorable as that bfefore. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N, 
and the 19th day of March, 1684-5, when we efpied 
a fail, our courfe S. E. and by S. We foon perceived 
it was a large veffel, and that fhe bore up to us ; but 
could not at firft know what to make of her, till, after 
coming a little nearer, we found fhe had loft her 
main-top-maft, fore-maft, and bowfprit ; and pre- 
fently flie fires a gun as a fignal of diftrefs ; the wea- 
ther was pretty good, wind at N. N. W, a frefh gale, 
and we foon came to fpeak with her. 

We found her a fhip oi Brijiol bound home from 
Barbadoesy but had been blown out of the road at 
Barbadoes^ a few days before fhe was ready to fail, by 
a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate 
were both gone on fhore; fo that befide the terror of 
the ftorm, they were but in an indifferent cafe for 
good artifts to , bring the fhip home ; they had been 
already nine weeks at fea, and had met with another

terrible ftorm after the hurricane was over, which 
had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the 
weflward, and in which they had loft their mafts, as 
above ; they told us, they expefted to have feen the 
Bahama iflands, but were then driven away again to 
the fouth-eaft by a ftrong gale of wind at N. N. W. 
the fame that blew now, and having no fails to work 
the ftiip with, but a main-courfe, and a kind of 
fquare fail upon a jury fore-maft, which they had fet 
up, they could not lie near the wind, but were en- 
deavouring to ftand away for the Canaries, 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they 
were almoft ftarved for want of provifions, befides 
the fatigues they had undergone ; their bread and 
flefh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in 
the fhip, and had had none for eleven days ; the 
only relief they had, was, their water was not all 
fpent, and they had about half a barrel of flour left ; 
they had fugar enough ; fome fuccades or fweet-meats 
they had at firft, but they were devoiu*ed, and they 
had feven cafks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-fer- 
vant, on board, who were going paOengers, and 
thinking the ihip was. ready to fail, unhappily came 
on board the evening before the hurricane began; 
and, having no provifions of their own left, they 
were in a more deplorable condition than the reft j 
for the feamen, being reduced to fuch an extreme 
neceffity themfelves, had no compaffion, we may be 
fure, for the poor paflengers ; and they were indeed 
in a condition that their mifery is very hard to 
defcribe.

that they had three paffengers in the great cabbin, that 
they were in a deplorable condition j nay, fays he, I 
believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of 
them for above two days ; and I was afraid to en- 
quire after them, faid he, for I had nothing to relieve 
them with. 

We immediately applied ourfelves to give them what 
relief we could fpare ; and indeed I had fo far over- 
ruled things with my nephew, that I would have 
vifliualled them, though we had gone away to Ver^ 
ginia, or any part of the coaft of America^ to have 
fupplied ourfelves J but there was no neceffity for 
that. 

But now they were in a new danger ; for they were 
afraid of eating two much, even of that little we 
gave them ; the mate or commander brought fix men 
with him in his boat ; but thefe poor wretches looked 
like {keletons, and were fo weak, they could Jiardly 
fit to their oars : the mate himfelf was very ill, and 
half-ftarved ; for he declared he had referved nothing 
from the men, and went fhare and fhare alike with 
them in every bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat fparingly, but let meat be- 
fore ^him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be fick, and out of 
order ; fo he ftopt awhile, and our furgeon mixed 
him up fomething with fome broth, which he faid 
would be to him both food and phyfick j and after 

he

he had taken it, he grew better : in the mean tim^ 
I forgot not the men ; I ordered viftuals to be given 
them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than 
eat it ; they were fo exceeding hungry, that they 
were in a manner ravenous, and had no command 
of themfelves ; and two of them eat with fo much 
greedinefs, that they were in danger of their lives 
the next morning. 

The fight of thefe people's diftrefs was very moving 
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible 
profpefl: of at my firft coming on fhore in my ifland, 
where I had not the lead mouthful of food, or any 
hopes of procuring it; befides the hourly apprehen- 
fion I had of being made the food of other creatures. 
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me 
the miferable condition of the (hip's company, I 
could not put out of my thought the ftory he had 
told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabbin; 
(viz.) the mother, her fon, and the maid fervant, 
whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days; 
and whom he feemed to confefs they had wholly neg- 
lected, their own extremities being fo great; by 
which I underftood, that they had really given them 
no food at all ; and that therefore they muft be 
periflied, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor 
or deck of the cabbin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then cal- 
led captain, on board with his men to refrefh them, 
fo I alfo forgot not the ftarving crew that were left on 
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the 
fhip, and with my mate and twelve men to carry 
them a fack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef 
to boil. Our furgeon charged the men to caufe ther 

meat 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3I 

meat to be boiled while they flayed, and to keep 
guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's taking 
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it 
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a 
little at a time ; and by this caution he preferved the 
men, who would otherwife have killed themfelves 
with that very food that was given them on purpole 
to fave their lives. 

At the fame time, I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cabbin, and fee in what condition the poor 
paffengers were in, and, if they were alive, to com- 
fort them and give them what refrefhment was pro- 
per ; and the furgeon gave him a large pitcher with 
fome of the prepared broth which he had given the 
mate that was on board, and which he did not quef- 
tion would reftore them gradually. 

I was not fatisfied with this ; but, as I faid above, 
having a great mind to fee the fcene of mifery, which 
I knew the Ihip itfelf would prefent me with, in a 
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I 
took the captain of the fliip, as we now called him, 
with me, and went myfelf a little after in their 
boat. 

I found the poor men on board almoft in a tumult 
to get the viftuals out of the boiler before it was 
ready t but my mate obferved his order, and kept a 
good guard at the cock-room door ; and the man he 
placed there, after ufmg all poffible perfuafion to 
have patience, kept them off by force : however, he 
caufed fome bifcuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, 
and foftened them with the liquor of the meat, which 
they call brewis, and gave them every one one, to 
ftay their ftomachs, and told them it was for their 

own 



32 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

own fafety, that he was obliged to give them but 
little at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I 
not come on board, and their own commander and 
officers with me, and with good words, and fome 
threats alfo of giving them no more, I believe they 
would have broke into the cook-room by force, and 
tore the meat out of the furnace ; for words indeed 
are of a very fmall force to an hungry belly : however 
we pacified them, and fed them gradually and 
cautioufly for the firft time, and the next time gave 
them more, and at laft filled their bellies, and the 
men did well enough. 

But the mifery of the poor paffengers in the cabbin 
was of another nature, and far beyond the reft ; for 
as, firft, the fliip's company had fo little for them- 
felves, it was but too true, that they had at firft kept 
them very low, and at laft totally neglefted them ; 
fo that for fix or feven days, it might be, faid, they 
had really had no food at all, and for feveral days 
before, very little. 

The poor mother, who, as the firft mate reported, 
was a woman of good fenfe, and good breeding, had 
fpared all flie could get fb affeftionately for her fon, 
that at laft flie entirely funk under it : and when the 
mate of our fliip went in, fhe fet upon the floor or 
deck, with her back up againft the fides, between 
two chairs, which were laftied faft, and her head 
funk in between her fhoulders, like a corpfe, though 
not quite dead. My mate faid all he could to revjve 
and encourage her, and with a fpoon put fome broth 
into her mouth j ftie opened her lips, and lifted up 
one hand, but could not fpeak : yet fhe underftood 
what he faid, and made figns to him, intimating, 

that 



OJI^ ROBINSON CRUSOE* 3^ 

that it was too late for her ; but pointed to her child, 
as if ihe would have faid, they ihould take care of 
him. 

However the mate, who was exceedingly moved 
with the fight, endeavoured to get fome of the broth 
into her mouth ; and, as he faid, got two or three 
fpoonfuls down, though I queftion whether he could 
be fure of it or not : but it was too late, and flie 
died the fame night. 

The youth, who was preferved at the price of his 
moft affedionate mother's life, was not fo far gone; 
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one ftretched out, with 
hardly any life left in him ; he had a piece of an old 
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the reft of it ; 
however, being young, and having more ftrength 
than his mother, the mate got fomething down his 
throat, and he began fenfibly to revive, though, by 
giving him fome time after but two or three fpoon- 
fuls extraordinary, he was very fick, and brought 
it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid ; fhe lay all 
along upon the deck hard by her miftrefs, and juft 
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and 
ftruggled for life : her limbs were diftorted, one of her 
hands was clafped round the frame of one chair, and 
Ihe griped it fo hard, that we could not eafily make 
her let it go ; her other arm lay over her head, and 
her feet lay both together, fet faft againft the frame 
of the cabin-table ; in fhort, fhe lay juft like one in 
the laft agonies of death ; and yet ftie was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only ftarved with 
hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, 
but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken^

hearted for her miflrefs, whom fhe faw dying two 
or three days before, and whom fhe loved moft 
tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for 
when our furgeon, who was a man of very great 
knowledge and experience, and with great appKca- 
tion recovered her as to life, he had her upon his 
hand as to her fenfes, for flie was little lefs than 
diftradted for a confiderable time after ; as fhall ap- 
pear prefently. 

Whoever fhall read thefe memorandums, muft be 
defired to confider, that vifits at fea are not like a 
journey into the country, where fometimes people 
flay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our bufin^fs 
was to relieve this diflreffed fhip's crew, but not lie 
by for them ; and though they were willing to fleer 
the fame courfe with us for fome days, yet we could 
carry no fail to keep pace with a fhip that had no 
mafts: however, as their captain begged of us to 
help hini to fet up a main top-maft, and a kind of 
top-mafl to his jury fore-mafl, we did, as it were, 
lie by him for three or four days, and then having 
given him five barrels of beef and pork, two hogfheads 
ofbifcuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what 
other things we could fpare ; and taking three cafks 
of fugar and fome rum, and fome pieces of eight of 
them for fatisfaftion, we left them, taking on board 
with us, at their own earnefl requefl, the youth, and 
the maid, and all their goods. 

The young lad was about feventeen years of agCi 
a pretty, well-bred, modefl, and fenfible youth ^ 
greatly dejefted with the lofs of his mother, and, as 
it feems, had loft his father but a few months before 

at 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOEi* 35 

ttt Barbadoes. He begged of the furgeon to fpeak to 
me, to take him out of the fhip ; for he faid, the 
cruel fellows had murdered his mother; and indeed 
fo they had, that is to fay, paflively ; for they might 
have fpared a fmall fuftenance to the poor helplefs 
widow, that might have preferved her life, though 
It had been juft to keep her alive. But hunger knows 
no friend, no relation, no juftice, no right ; and 
therefore is remorfelefs, and capable of no com- 
paflion. 

The furgeon told hin^ how far we were going, and 
how it would carry him away from all his friends, 
, and put him perhaps in as bad circumftances, almoft, 
as we found them in ; that is to fay^ ftarving in the 
World. He faid he mattered not whither he went, 
if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that 
he was among : that the captain (by which he meant 
me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had 
faved his life, and he was fure would not hurt him ; 
and as for the maid, he was fure, if Ihe came to 
herfelf, (he would be very thankful for it, let us 
carry them whither we would. The furgeon repre- 
fented the cafe fo afFeftionately to me, that I yielded, 
and we took them both on board with all their goods, 
except eleven hogfheads of fugar, which could not 
be removed, or come at; and as the youth had a 
bill of lading for them, I made his commander fign 
a writing, obliging him to go, as foon as he came to 
Brijiol^ to one Mr. Rogers^ a merchant there, to 
whom the youth faid he was related, and to deli- 
ver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods 
he had belonging to the deceafed widow ; which I 
fuppofe was not done^ for I could never learn that

the fhip came to Brijlol; but was, as is moft prota* 
ble, loft at fea, being in fo difabled a condition, and 
fo far from any land, that I am of opinion, the firft 
ftorm (he met with afterwards Ihe might founder in 
the fea; for flie was leaky, and had damage in her 
hold when I met with her» 

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and 
had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather,, 
tho' at firft the winds had been contrary. I fhall 
trouble nobody with the little incidents of wind, 
weather, currents, &c. on the reft of our voyage y 
but, fhortening my ftory for the fake of what is to 
follow, fhall obferve, that I came to my old habitation, 
the ifland, on the loth of April, 1695^ It was with 
no fmall difficulty that I found the place ; for as I 
came to it, and went from it before, on the fouth 
and eaft fide of the ifland, as coming from the Brqfils, 
fo now coming in between the main and the ifland, 
and having no chart for the coaft, nor any land- 
mark, I did not know it when I faw it, or know 
whether 1 faw it or no. 

We bjsat about a great while, and went on %)re 
on feveral iflands in the mouth of the great river 
Oroomque, but none for my purpofe; only this I 
learned by my coafting the fliore, that I was under 
one great miftake before, viz. that the continent 
which I thought I faw from the ifland I lived in^ 
was really no continent, but a long ifland, or rather 
a ridge of iflands reaching from one to the other fide 
of the extended mouth of that great river \ and that 
the favages v/ho came to my ifland, were not pro- 
perly thofe which we call Caribecs^ but iflanders, and 
other Barbarians of the fame kind., who inhabited 
fomething nearer to our fide than the reft.. 



OF ROBmSON CKUSOE. 37 

In fhort, I vifited feveral of the iflands to no pur- 
pofe ; fome I found were inhabited, and fome were 
not. On one of them I found fome Spaniards^ and 
thought they had lived there; but fpeaking with 
them, found they had a floop lay in a fmall creek 
hard by, and that they came thither to make fait, 
and catch fome pearl-mufcles, if they could; but 
they belonged to the IJle de Trinidad^ which lay far- 
ther north, in the latitude of i o and 1 1 degrees. 

Thus coafting from one ifland to another, fome- 
times with the fhip, fometimes with the Frenchman^^ 
jQiallop (which we had found a convenient boat, and 
therefore kept her with their very good will), at 
length I came fair on the fouth-fide of my ifland, and 
\ prefently knew the very countenance of the place ; 
io I brought the fhip fafe to an anchor, broadfide 
with the little creek whefe was my old habitation. 

As foon as I faw the place, I called for Friday^ 
and afked him, if he knew where he was ? He looked 
about a little, and prefently clapping his hands, cri- 
ed, O yes, O there, O yes, O there ! pointing to 
our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering 
like a mad fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him 
from jumping into the fea, to fwim afliore to the 
place. 

Well, Friday^ faid I, do you think we fliall find 
any body here^ or no ? and what do you think, fhall 
we fee your father ? The fellow flood mute as a flock 
a good while ; but when I named his father, the 
poor affedionate creature looked dejected; and I 
could f(Se the tears run down his face very plentifully. 
What is the matter Friday'^ faid I ? are you troubled 
becaufe you may fee ybur father ? No, no, fays he, 

D 3 fhaking 



38 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fhaking his head, no fee him more, no ever more 
fee again. Why fo, fatd I, Friday? how do you 
know that ? O no, O no, fays Friday^ he long ago 
die; long ago, he much old man. Well, well, faid 
I, Friday^ you don't know: but fliall we fee any 
one elfe then : the fellow, it feems, had better eyes 
than I, and he points juft to the hill above my old 
houfe ; and tho' we lay half a league o T, he cries out, 
Me fee ! me fee ! yes, yes, me fee much man there, 
and there, and there, I lookec^, but I could fee no- 
body, no, not with a perfpedive glafs ; which was, 
I fuppofe, becaufe I could not hit the place ; for the 
fellow was right, as I found upon enquiry the next 
day, and there were five or fix men altogether ftood 
to look at thvi Ihip, not knovv'ing what to thinly 
of us. 

As foon as Friday had told me he faw people, I 
caufed the EngliJJo ancient to be fpread, and fired thr^e 
guns, to give them notice we were friends ; and 
;ibout half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a 
fmoke rife from the fide of the creek ; fo. I imme- 
diately ordered a boat out, taking Friday \jith mtf 
and, hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce, I 
went direfl:ly on flio^'e, taking with me the young 
friar I mentioi eJ, to whom I had told the whole 
ftory of my living there, and the manner of it, and 
every particular, both of myfelf, and thofe that I 
left there ; and who was on that account extremely 
defirous to go with me. We had befides about fix- 
teen men very well armed, if we had found any new 
gueft there which we did not know of 5 but we had 
no need of weapons. 

As we went on ftiore upon the tide of flood, near 
high water, we rowed direftly into the creek j and 

the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39- 

the firft man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard 
whofe life I had faved, and whom I knew by his face 
perfeaiy well ; as to his habit, I fhall defcribe it 
afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on fliore at firft 
but myfelf ; but there was no keeping Friday in the 
boat : for the afFedionate creature had fpied his 
father at a diftance, a good way off of the Spaniards^ 
where indeed I faw nothing of him ; and if they had 
not let him go on fliore, he would have jumped into 
the fea. He was no fooner on fhore, but he flew 
away to his father like an arrow out of a bow. It 
would have made any man fhed tears, in fpite of the 
firmefl refolution, to have feen the firft tranfports of 
tiiis poor fellow's joy, v/hen he came to his father j* 
how he embraced him, kiffed him, ftroaked his face, 
took him up in his arms, fet him down upon a tree, 
and lay down by him ; then ftood and looked at him 
as any one would look at a ftrange pidure, for a 
quarter of an hour together ; then lay down upon 
the ground, and ftroaked his legs, and kiffed them, 
and then got up again, and flared at him ; one would 
have thought the fellow bewitched : but it would 
have made a dog laugh to fee how the next day his 
paflion run out another way: in the morning he 
walked along the fhore, to and-again, with his father, 
feveral hours, always leading him by the hand, as if 
he had been a lady ; and every now-and-then would 
come to fetch fomething or other for him from the 
boat, either a lump of fugar, or a dram, a bifcuit, or 
fomething or other that was good. In. the afternoon his 
frolics ran another way, for then he would fet the old 
man down upon the ground,, and dance about him, 
and made a thoufand antic poflures and geftures ; and 

D 4 all 



40 l-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

all the while he did this, he would be talking to him,, 
and telling him one ftory or another of his travels, 
and of what had happened to him abroad, to divert 
him. In fhort, if the fame filial affeftion was to be 
found in chriftians to their parents, in our parts of 
the world, one would be tempted to fay, there hard- 
ly would have been any need of the fifth commands 
ment. 

But this is a digrefSon ; I return to my landings 
It would be endlefs to take notice of all the ceremo- 
nies and civilities that the Spaniards received me with* 
The firft Spaniard^ whom, as I faid, I knew very well 
was he whofe life I faved, he came towards the boat, 
attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce alfo ; 
and he did not only not know me at firft, but he had 
no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that waa 
come, till I fpoke to him. : Seignor, faid I, in Portu-^ 
guefe^ do you not know me ? at which he fpoke not 
a word ; but giving his mufquet to the man that was. 
with him, threw his arms abroad, and faying fome- 
thing in Spanijh^ that I did not perfedly hear, came 
forward, and embraced me, telling me, he was inex- 
cufable not to know that face again that he had 
once feen, as of an angel from Heaven fent to favQ 
his life : he faid abundance of very handfome things, 
as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how ; and 
then beckoning to the perfon that attended him, bade 
him go and call out his comrades. He then alked 
me, if I would walk to my old habitation, where 
he would give me poffeflion of my own houfe 
again, and where I fhould fee there had been but 
mean improvements ; fp I walked along with him y 
but, alas ! I could no more find the place again, than 

if

if I had never been there ; for they had planted fo 
many trees, and placed them in fuch a pofture, fp 
thick and clofe to one another, in teii years time 
they were grown fo big, that, in fhort, the place was 
inacceffible, except by fuch windings and blind ways, 
as they themfelves only who made them could find. 

I alked. them, what put them upon all thefe forti* 
fications ? He told me, I would fay there was need 
enough of it, v/hen they had given an account how 
they had pafled their time fince their arriving in the 
ifland, efpecially after they had the misfortune to find 
that I was gone : he told me he could not but have 
fome fatisfaftion in my good fortune, when he heard 
that I was gone in a good fhip, and to my fatisfadion ; 
and that he had oftentimes a ftrong perfuanon, that 
one time or other he (hould fee me again: but no- 
thing that ever befel him in his life, he faid, was fo 
furprifing and affliding to him at firft, as the difap- ' 
pointment he was under when he came tack to the 
Jiland, and found I was not there. 

As to the three Barbarians (fo he called them) that 
were left behind, and of whom he faid he had a long 
ftory to tell me j the Spaniards all thought themfelvesi 
much better among the favages, only that their 
number was fo fmall. And, fays he, had they been 
ftrong enough, we had been all long ago in purga- 
tory ; and with that he croffed himfelf upon the 
breaft. But Sir, fays he, I hope you will not be 
difpleafed, when I fliaU tell you how, forced by 
necefllty, we were obliged, for our own prefervatlon, 
to difarm them, and making them our fubjefl:s, who 
would not be content with being moderately our 
matters, but would be our murderers. I anfwered, I

was heartily afraid of it when I left tliein there ; and 
nothing troubled me at my parting from the ifland, 
but that they were not come back, that I might have 
put them in pofleffion of every thing firft, and left the 
other in a ftate of fubjedion, as they defer ved : but 
if they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and 
fhould be very far from finding any fault with it; 
for I knev\r they were a parcel of refractory ungo- 
vernable villains, and were fit for any manner of 
jnifchief. 

While I was faying this, came the man whom he 
had'fent back, and with him eleven men more : in 
the drefs they were in, it was impoffible to guefs what 
nation they were of; but he made all clear both to 
them and to me. Firfl: he turned to me, and pointing 
to them, faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the gentlemen 
who owe their lives to you ; and then turning to 
them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I 
was ; upon which they all came up one by one, not 
as if they had been failors, and ordinary fellows, and 
I the like, but really, as if they had been ambaffa- 
dors or noblemen^ and I a monarch, or a great con- 
queror : their behaviour was to the laft degree 
obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly 
majeftic gravity, which very well became them ; and 
in fliort, they had fo much more manners than I, 
that I fcarce knew how' to receive their civilities, 
much lefs how to return them in kind. 

The hiftory of their coming to, and condufl in 
the ifland, after my going away, is fo remarkable, 
and has fo many incidents, which the former part of 
my relation will help to underftarid, and which will, 
in moft of the particulars, refer to that account I hav?

silready given, that I cannot but commit them with 
great delight to the reading of thofe that come after 
me. 

I fhall no longer trouble the ftory with a relation 
in the fir ft perfon, which will put me to the expence 
cf ten thoufand" faid Fs, and faid he's, and he told 
me's, and I told him's, and the like ; but I fliall 
colleQ: the fadls hiftorically , as near as I can gather 
them out of my mqmory from what they related to 
me, and from what I met with in my conyerfing with 
them, and with the place. 

In order to do this fuccinftly, and as intelligibly as 
I can, I muft go back to the circumftance in which 
I left the ifland, and which the perfons were in, of 
whom I am to fpeak. At firft, it is neceffary to re- 
peat, that I had fent away Friday^ father and the 
SpaniarLi^ the two whofe lives I had refcued from the 
lavages ; I fay, I had fent them away in a large canoe 
to the main, as 1 then thought it, to fetch over 
the Spaniard^ ^ companions whom he had left behind 
him, in order to fave them from the like calamity 
that he had been in ; and in order to fuccour 
them for the prefent, and that, if poffible, we might 
together find fome way for our deliverance after- 
ward. 

When I fent them away, I had no vifible appear- 
ance of, or the leaft room to hope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before ; 
much lefs had I any foreknowledge of what after hap- 
pened, I mean of an Englijh fhip coming on fliore 
there to fetch them off; and it could not but be a 
very great furprife to them, when they came back, 
not only to find that I was gone, but to find three 

ftrangers 



44 ^^^^ AND ADVENT D RES 

ftrangers left on the fpot, poffeffed of all that I had 
left behind me, which would otherwife have been 
their own. 

The firft thing, however, which I enquired into, 
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own 
part : and I defired he would give me a particular 
account of his voyage back to his countrymen with 
the boat, when I fent him to fetch them over. He 
Xold me there was little variety in that part ; for no^ 
thing remarkable happened to them on the way, they 
having very calm weather, and a fmooth fea ; for his 
countrymen, it could not be doubted, he faid, but 
that they were overjoyed to fee him (it feems he 
was the principal man among them, the captain of 
the veffel they had been fhipwrecked in, having been 
dead fome time) : they were, he faid, the more fur- 
prifed to fee him, becaufe they knew that he was fal- 
len into the hands of favages, who, they were fatisfied, 
would devour him, as they did all the reft of their 
prifoners; that when he told them theftoryof the 
deliverance, and in what manner he was fur^ifhed 
for carrying them away, it was like a dream to them : 
and their aftonifhment, they faid, was fomething like 
that of yo/ep/ys brethren, when he told them who he 
was, and told them the ftory of his exaltation in 
Pharaob's court : but when he fhewed them the arms, 
the powder, the ball, and the provifions that he 
brought them for their journey or voyage, they were 
reftored to themfelves, took a juft fliare of the joy of 
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come 
s^way with him. 

rfheir firft bufinefs was to get canoed ; and in this 
they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the

lionell part of It, but to trefpafs upon their friendly 
fevages, and to borrow two large canoes or periagua's, 
on pretence of going out a-filhing, or for pleafure. 

In thefe they came away the next morning ; it 
feems they wanted no time to get themfelves ready, 
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi- 
fions, or any thing in the world, but what they had 
on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they ufed 
to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks abfent, and in that 
time, unlucldly for them, I had the occafion oflFered 
for my efcape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
to get off from the ifland ; leaving three of the moft 
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, difagreeable villains 
behind me, that any man could defire to meet with, 
to the poor Spaniards grtzt grief diid difappointment, 
you may be fure. 

The only juft thing the rogues did, was, that when, 
the Spaniards came on fhore, they gave my letter to 
them, and gave them provifions, and other relief, as 
I had ordered them to do ; alfo they gave them the 
long paper of direftions, which I had left with them, 
containing the particular methods which I took for 
managing every p^rt of my life there ; the way how I 
baked my bread, bred'up my tame goats, and plant- 
ed my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, 
and, in a word, every thing I did ; all this being 
written down, they gave to the Spaniards^ two of 
whom underftood Englijh well enough ; nor did they 
refufe to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing 
elfe, for they agreed very well for fome time ; they 
gave them an equal admiffion into the houfe, or cave, 
and they began to live very fociably j and the head

46 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Spaniard J who had feen pretty much of my method J 
and Friday^ % father together, managed all their affairs, 
for, as for the Engliflomen^ they did nothing but ram- 
ble about the ifland, (hoot parrots, and catch tortoifes, 
and when they came home at night, the Spaniards 
provided their fuppers for them. 

The Spaniards would hkvebeen fatisfted with this, 
would the other but have left them alone ; which, 
however, they could not find in their hearts to do 
long ; but, like the dog in the manger, they would 
not eat themfelves, and wT5uld not let others eat 
neither: the differences, neverthelefs, were at firft 
but trivial, and fuch as are not worth relating ; but 
at laft it broke out into open war, and it began with 
all the rudenefs and infolence that can be imagined, 
without reafon, without provocation, contrary to 
nature, and indeed to cpmmon fenfe ; and though, 
it is true, the firft relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themfelves, whom I may call the accufers, 
yet when I came to examine the fellows, they could 
not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, 
I muft fupply a defeft in my former relation; and 
this was, that I forgot to fet down among the reft, 
that, juft as we were weighing the anchor to fet fail, 
there happened a little quarrel on board our ftiip, 
which I was afraid once would turn to a fecond mu- 
tiny ; nor was it appeafed till the captain, roufing 
up his courage, and taking us all to his afliftance, 
parted them by force, and making two of the moft 
refraftory fellows prifoners, he laid them in irons ; 
and as they had been aftive in the former diforders, 
and let fall fome ugly dangerous words the fecond

time, he threatened to cajrry them in irons to Eng* 
land^ and have them hanged there for mutiny, and 
running away with the fhip. 

This, it feems, though the captain did not intend 
to do, it frighted fome other men in the fhip ; and 
fome of them had put it in the heads ,of the reft, that 
the captain only gave them good words for the pre- 
fent, till they ftiould come to fome Efiglijlo port ; and 
that then they fliould be all put into a gaol, and tried 
for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it ; upon which it was defired, that I, who 
ftill pafled for a great man among them, fhould go 
down with the mate, and fatisfy the men, and tell 
them, that they might be affured, if they behaved' 
well the reft of the voyage, all they had done for the 
time paft fhould be pardoned. So I went, and after 
pafEng my honour's word to them, they appeared 
eafy, and the more fo, when I caufed the two men, 
who were in irons, to be releafed and forgiven. 
. But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for 
that night, the wind alfo falling calm ; next morning 
we found, that our two men who had been laid in 
irons, had ftole each of them a mufket, and fome 
other weapons ; what powder or fhot they had, we 
knew not ; and had taken the fhip's pinnace, which 
was not yet haled up, and run away with her to their 
companions in roguery on fhore. 

As foon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat 
on fhore, with twelve men and the mate, and away 
they went to feek the rogues; but they could neither 
find them,' nor any of the reft; for they all fled into 
the woods, w.hen they faw the boat coming on fhore. 

The 



48 LIFE And adventure^ 

The mate was once refolved, in juftice to theif 
roguery, to have deftroyed their plantations, burnt 
all their houfehold-ftuff and furniture, and left them 
to fhift without it ; but having no order, he let all 
alone, left every thing as they found it, and bringing 
the pinnace away, came on board without them. 

Thefe two men made their number five j but the 
other three villains were fo much wickeder than 
thefe, that after they had been two or three days 
together, they turned their two new-comers out of 
doors to fhift for themfelves, and would have nothing 
to do with them ; nor could they, for a good while, 
be perfuaded to give them any food ; as for the Spa- 
niardsy they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came firft on fliore, the bufi- 
nefs began to go forward ; the Spaniards would have 
perfuaded the three Englijh brutes to have taken in 
their two countrymen again, that, as they faid, they 
might be all one family ; but they would not hear of 
it : fo the two poor fellows lived by themfelves, and 
finding nothing but induftry and application would 
make them live comfortable, they pitched their tents 
on the north fhore of the ifland, but a little more to 
the weft, to be out of the danger of the favages, who 
always landed on the eaft parts of the ifland. 

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and 
the other to lay up their magazines and ftores in ; 
and the Spaniards having given them fome corn for 
feed, and efpecially fohie of the peas which I had left 
them, they dug and planted, and inclofed, after the 
pattern I had fet for them all, and began to live pretty 
well ; their firft crop of corn was on the ground, 
and though it was but a little bit of. land which 

they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 49 

they had dug up at firft, having had but a little time, 
yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them 
with bread or other eatables ; and one of the fellows, 
being the cook's mate of the fhip, was very ready at 
making foup, puddings, and fuch other preparations^ 
as the rice and the milk, and fuch little fleih as they 
got, furnifhed him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving pofture, 
when the three unnatural rogues, their own country- 
men too, in mere humour, and to infult them, came 
and bullied them, and told them the ifland was 
theirs ; that the governor, meaning me, had given 
them poffeflion of it, and nobody elfe had any right 
to it J and, damn them, they fhould build no houfes 
upon their ground, unlefs they would pay them rent 
for them. 

The two men thought they had jefted at firfl ; and 
afked them to come and fit down, and fee what fine 
houfes they were that they had built, and tell them 
what rent they demanded : and one of them merrily 
told them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped 
if they built tenements upon the land, and made im- 
provements, they would, according to the cuftom of 
all landlords, grant them a long leafe ; and bid them 
go fetch a fcrivener to draw the writings. One of 
the three, damning and raging, told them, they 
fliould fee they were not in jeft ; and going to a little 
place at a diftance, where the honeft men had made / 
a fire to drefs their viduals, he takes a fire-brand, 
and claps it to the outfide of their hut, and very 
fairly fet it on fire j and it would have been all burnt 
down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not 
run to the fellgw, thruft him away, and trod the fire

out With his feet, and that not without fome difficult 
ty too. 

The fellow was in fuch a rage at the honeft man's 
thrufting him away, that he turned upon him with 
a pole he had in his hand ; and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, 
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, fee- 
ing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, 
and immediately they came both out with their muf- 
kets ; and the man that was firft ftruck at with the 
pole, knocked the fellow down, who began the 
quarrel, with the flock of his mufquet, and that 
before the other two could come to help him ; and 
then feeing the reft come at them, they ftood toge. 
ther, and prefenting the other ends of their pieces to 
them, bade them ftand oflF. ^ 

, The others had fire-arms with them too ; but one 
of the two honeft men, bolder than his comrade, and 
made defperate by his danger, told them, if they 
offered to move hand or foot, they were all dead itien j 
and boldly commanded them to lay down their armsr 
They did not indeed lay down their arms ; but, fee- 
ing him refolute, it brought them to a parley, and, 
they confented to take their wounded man with them, 
and be gone ; and indeed, it feems the fellow was 
wounded fufEciently with the blovy ; however, they 
t^e much in the wrong, fince they had the advan- 
t^e, that they did not difarm them effectually, as 
piey might have done, and have gone immediately 
to the Spaniards^ and given them an account how 
the rogues had treated them ; for the three villains 
lludied nothing but rev.enge, and every day gave 

them fome intimation that they did fo^

But not to crowd this part with an account of the 
leffer part of their rogueries, fuch as treading down, 
their corn, fhooting three young kids, and a fhe^ 
^oat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame 
for their ftore ; and, in a word, plaguing them night 
and day in this manner, it forced the two men to 
fuch a defperation, that they refolved to fight them 
all three the firft time they had a fair opportunity^ 
In order to this they refolved to go to the caftle, as 
they called it, that was my old dwelling, where the 
three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at 
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the 
Spaniards fhould ftand by to fee fair play. So they 
got up in the morning before day, and came to the 
place, and called the Englijhmen by their names, teU 
ling a Spaniard that anfwered, that they wanted to 
fpeak with them. 

It happened that the day before two of the Spa^ 
niards^ having been in the woods, had feen one of. 
the two Englijhmen^ whom, for diftindion, I call the 
honeft men ; and he had made a fad complaint to 
the Spaniards^ of the barbarous ufage they had met 
•with from their three countrymen, and how they had 
ruined their plantation, and deftroyed their corn, 
that they had laboured fo hard to bring forward, and 
killed the milch-goat, and their three kids, which 
was all they had provided for their fuftenance ; and^ 
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards^ 
did not affift them again, they fhould be ftarved*; 
When the Spaniards came home at night, and they 
were all at fupper, he took the freedom to reprove 
the three Englijhmen^ though in gentle and mannerly 
terms, and alked them, how they could be fo cruel,

they being harmlefs inoffenfive fellows, and that they 
were putting thenifelves in a way to fubfift by their 
labour, and that it had coft them a great deal of pains 
to bring things to fuch perfeftion as they had ? 

One of the EngliJJomen returned very brifldy. What 
had they to do there ? That they came on fhore with- 
out leave, and that they fhould not plant or build 
upon the ifland ; it was none of their ground. Why, 
fays the Spaniard^ very calmly. Seignior higlefe^ they 
muft not ftarve. The Englijhman replied, like a true 
rough-hewn tarpaulin, they might ftarve and be damn- 
ed, they fhould not plant nor build in that place. 
But what muft they do then. Seignior ? fays the Spa- 
niard. Another of the brutes, returned, Do ! d — n 
them, they fhould be fervants, and work for them. 
But how can you expeft that of them ? they are 
not bought with your money ; you have no right to 
make them fervants. The E^iglijhman anfwered. The 
ifland was theirs, the governor had given it to them, 
and no man had any thing to do there but themfelves; 
^nd with that fwore by his Maker, that he would go 
"and burn all their new huts j they fhould build none 
upon their land. 

Why Seignior, fays the Spaniard^ by the fame 
rule, we muft be your fervants too. Ay, fays the 
bold dog, and fo you fhall too, before we have done 
with you, mixing two or three G — d d — mme's in 
the proper intervals of his fpeech. The Spaniard 
only fmiled at that, and made him no anfwer. How- 
ever, this little difcourfe had heated them ; and 
ftarting up, one fays to the other, I think it was h«

their caftle, I will warrant you ; they fliall plant no 
colony in our dominions. 

Upon this they were all trooping away, with 
every man a gun, a piftol, and a fword, and mut- 
tered fome infolent things among themfelves, of 
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when op- 
portunity offered ; but the Spaniards^ it feems, did 
not fo perfeftly underftand them as to know all the 
particulars ; only that, in generaf, they threatened 
them hard for taking the two Englijhmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they beftowed their 
time that evening, the Spaniards faid they did not 
know ; but it feems they wandered about the country 
part of the night ; and then lying down in the place 
which I ufed to call my bower, they were weary, and 
overflept themfelves. The cafe was this : they had 
lefolved to flay till midnight, and fo to take the 
poor men when they were aflcep ; and they acknow- 
ledged it afterwards, intending to fet fire to their 
huts while they were in them, and either burn them 
in them, or murder them as they came out : and, 
as malice feldom fleeps very found, it was very ftrange 
they fhould not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two men had alfo a defign upon 
them, as I have faid, tho' a much fairer one than 
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and 
very luckily for them all, that they were up and 
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came 
to their huts. 

When they came thither and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who it feems was the forwardeft man, called 
out to his comrades. Ha ! Jack, here's the neft ; but 
d — n them, the birds are flown : they mufed a tvhile 

E 3 to

to think what fhould be the occafion of their being 
gone abroad fo foon, and fuggefted prefently, that 
the Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and with 
that they (hook hands, and fwore to one , another* 
that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As 
foon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell 
to work with the poor men's habitation ; they did 
not fet fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down 
both their houfes, and pulled them fo limb from limb 
that they left not the lead flick {landing, or fcarce 
any fign on the ground where they flood ; they tore 
all their little colleded houfehold-fluflf in pieces, and 
threw every thing about in fuch a manner, that the 
poor men found, afterwards, fome of their things 
a mile off from their habitation. 

When they had done this, they pulled up all the 
young trees which the poor men had planted ; pulled 
up the inclofure they had made to fecure their catde 
and their corn ; and, in a word, fa.cked and plun- 
dered every thing, as completely as a herd of Tai^tar^ 
would have done. 

The two men were at this jundlure gone to find 
them out, and had refolved to fight them wherever 
t^^ey had been, tho' they were but tv/o to three : fo 
that, had they met, there certainly would have been 
bloodfhed among them ; for they were all very flout, 
refolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them 
afunder, than they themfelves could do to meet : for, 
?is they had dogged one another, when the three were 
gotie thither, the two were here; and afterwards, 
when the two went back to find them, the three were 
cpm^ to the old habitation again j we fliall fee their

differing conduft prefently. When the three came 
tack, like furious creatures, flufhed with the rage 
which the work they had been about put them into, 
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what 
they had done, by way of feoff and bravado ; and 
one of them ftepping up to one of the Spaiiiards, as 
if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold 
of his hat, as it was upon his head, and giving it a 
twirl about, fleering in his face, fays he to him. And 
you. Seignior yack Spaniard, fhall have the fame 
fauce, if you do not mend your manners. The Spa^ 
mard who, though quite a civil man, was as brave 
as a man could defire to be, and withal a ftrong 
well-made man, looked fteadily at him for a good 
while ; and then, having no weapon in his hand, 
ftept gravely up to him, and with one blow of his 
fift, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a 
pole-axe, at which one of the rogues, infolent as the 
firft, fired his piftol at the Spaniard immediately; 
he miffed his body indeed, for the bullets went 
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip 
of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood 
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he 
really was, and that put him into fome heat, for be- 
fore he a£ted all in a perfeQ: calm ^ but now re- 
folving to go through with his work, he (looped and 
took the fellow's mufquet whom he had knocked 
down, and was jufl going to ihoot the man who had 
fired at him ; when the reft of the Spaniards, being 
in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to 
flioot, they ftept in, fecured the other two, and took 
their arms from them. 

E 4 When 



56 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

When they were thus difarmed, and found they 
had made all the Spoftiards their enemies, as well as 
their own countrymen, they began to cool; and 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have had 
their arms again ; but the Spaniards^ confidering the 
feud that was between them and the other two Englijh* 
Tuen^ and that it would be the beft method they could 
take to keep them from one another, told them they 
would do them no harm ; and if they would live 
peaceably they would be very willing to afEft and 
affociate with them, as they did before; but that 
they could not think of giving them their arms 
again, while they appeared fo refolved to do mif- 
chief with them to their own countrymen, and had 
even threatened them all to make them their 
fervants. 

The rogues were now more capable to hear rea- 
fon than to aft reafon ; but being refufed their arms, 
they went raving away, and raging like madmen, 
threatening what they would do, though they had 
no fire-arms : but the Spaniards defpifing their threat- 
ening, told them they fliould take care how they 
offered any injury to their plantation or cattle ; for 
if they did, they would fhoot them, as they would 
do ravenous beads, wherever they found them ; and 
if they fell into their hands alive, they would cer- 
tainly be hanged. However, this was far from cool- 
ing them ; but away they went, fwearing and raging 
like furies of hell. As foon as they were gone, came 
back the two men in paffion and rage enough alfo, 
though of another kind ; for, having been at their 
plantation, and finding it all demolifhed and deftroy* 
ed, as above, it will eafily be fuppofed they had pro- 
vocation 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 57 

Vocation enough ; they could fcarce have room to 
tell their tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell 
them theirs ; and it was ftrange enough to find, that 
three men Ihould thus bully nineteen, and receive no 
punilhment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpecially 
having thus difarmed them, made light of their 
threatenings ; but the two Englijhmen refolved to have 
their remedy againfl them, what pains foever it cofl 
to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interpofed here too, and told 
them, that they were already difarmed : they could 
not confent that they (the two) fliould purfue them 
with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them: but, faid the 
grave Spaniard^ who was their governor, we will 
endeavour to make them do you juftice, if you will 
leave it to us, for, as there is no doubt but they will 
come to us again when their paffion is over, being not 
able to fubfift without our afliftance, we promife you 
to make no peace with them, without having a full 
fatisfaftion for you ; and upon this condition we hope 
you will promife to ufe no- violence with them, other 
than in your defence. 

The two Englijhmen yielded to this very awkwardly, 
and with great relufliance ; but the Spaniards pro- 
tefted, they did it only to keep them from bloodfhed, 
and to make all eafy at laft ; for, faid they, we are 
not fo many of us ; here is room enough for us all, 
and it is great pity we fliould not be all good friends. 
At length they did confent, and waited for the iffue 
of the thing, living for fome days with the Spaniards ; 
for their own habitation was deftroyed. 

In 



58 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In about five days rime the three vagrants, tireJ 
with wandering, and almoft ftarved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while, 
came back to the grove ; and finding my Spaniard j 
who, as I have faid, was the governor, and two 
more with him, walking by the fide of the creek ; 
they came up in a very fubmiffive humble manner, 
and begged to be received again into the family. The 
Spaniards ufed them civilly, but told them, they had 
aded fo unnaturally by their countrymen, and fo 
very grofsly by them (the SpatiiardsJ^ that they could 
not come to any conclufion without confulting the 
twa EngUJJjmcn^ and the reft; but however they 
would go to them, and difcourfe about it, and they 
fnould know in half an hour. It may be guefled 
that they were very hard put to it ; for it feems, as 
they were to wait this half-hour for an anfwer, they 
begged he would fend them out fome bread in the 
mean time ; which he did, and fent them at the fame 
time a large piece of goat's flefh, and a broiled par- 
rot; which they eat very heartily, for they were 
hungry enough. 

After half an hour's confultation they w^ere called 
in, and a long debate had , about them, their two 
countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their 
labour, and a defign to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now ; 
upon the whole, the Spaniards afted the moderators 
between them; and as they had obliged the two 
Lnglifomen not to hurt the three, while they were 
naked and unarmed, fo they now obliged the three 
to go and rebuild their fellows two huts, one to be 

of

of the fame dimenfions, and the other larger than 
they were before ; alfo to fence their ground again, 
where they had pulled up the fences, plant trees in 
the room of thofe pulled up, dig up the land again 
for planting corn, where they had fpoiled it ; and, 
in a word, to reftore every thing in the fame ftate as 
they found it, as near as they could ; for entirely it 
could not be, the feafon for the corn, and the growth 
of the trees and hedges, not being poffible to be 
recovered. 

Well, they all fubmitted to this ; and as they 
had plenty of provifions given them all the while, 
they grew very orderly, and the whole fociety began 
to live pleafantly and agreeably together again ; only 
that thefe three fellows could never be perfuaded to 
work ; I mean, not for themfelves, except now and 
then a little, juft as they pleafed ; however, the Sj>a' 
niards told them plainly, that if they would but live 
fociably and friendly together, and ftudy in the whole 
the good of the plantation, they would be content to 
work for them, and let them walk about and be as 
idle as they pleafed; and thus having lived pretty 
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards gave 
them their arms again, and gave them liberty to go 
abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had thefe arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures be- 
gan to be as infolent and troublefome as before ; but 
however, an accident happened prefently upon this, 
which endangered the fafety of them all ; they were 
obliged to lay by all private refentments, and look 
tp the prefervation'of their lives.

as poffible, nor did ever any that had feen me, 
efcape to tell any one elfe, except it were the three 
favages in our laft encounter, who jumped into the 
boat, of whom I mentioned that I v/as afraid they 
fliould go home, and bring more help. 

Whether it was the confequence of the efcape of 
thofe men, that fo great a number came now to- 
gether; 01 whether they came ignorantly, and by 
accident, on their ufual bloody errand, the Spaniards 
could not it feems underfland : but whatever it was, 
it had been their bulinefs, either to have concealed 
themfelves, and not have feen them at all; much 
lefs to have let the favages have feen, that there were 
any inhabitants in the place ; but to have fallen upon 
them fo effeftually, as that hot a man of them fliould 
have efcaped, uhich could only have been by getting 
in between them and their boats ; but this prefence 
of mind was wanting to them, uhich was the ruin of 
their tranquillity, for a great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor, and 
the man with him, furprifed with this fight, ran back 
immediately, and raifed their fellows, giving them 
an account of the imminent danger they were all in; 
and they again as readily took the alarm, but it was 
impofEble to perfuade them to flay clofe within where 

they

they were, but that they muft all run out to fee how 
things flood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had opportunity enough, for fome hours, to 
view them by the light of three fires they Had made 
at fome diftance from one another ; what they were 
doing they knew not, and what to do themfelves they 
knew not ; for, firft, the enemy were too many ; 
and, fcGondly, they did not keep together, but were 
divided into feveral parties, and were on fhore in 
feveral places. 

The Spaniards were in no fmall conftemation at 
this fight J and as they found that the fellows ran 
ftraggling all over the fhore, they made no doubt, 
but, firfl or laft, fome of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon fome other place, where 
they would fee the tokens of inhabitants ; and they ^ 
were in great perplexity alfo for fear of their flock of 
goats, which would have been little lefs than flarving 
them, if they fhould have been deftroyed ; fo the 
firfl thing they refolved upon, was to difpatch three 
men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniards and 
one EngUjIoman^ to drive all the goats away to the 
great valley where the cave was, and, if need were, 
to drive them into the very cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the favages altogether in 
one body, and at a diflance from their canoes, they 
refolved, if there had been an hundred of them, to 
have attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, 
for there were fome of them two miles off from the 
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
different nations. 

After 



64 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

After having mufed a great while on the eourfe 
they Ihould take, and beaten their brains in confi- 
dering their prefent circumftances, they refolved at 
laft, while it was dark, to fend the old favage (JRr/- 
daf^ father) out, as a fpy, to learn, if poffible, fome- 
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and 
what they intended to do, and the like; the old 
man readily undertook it, and, ftripping himfelf 
quite naked, as mod of the fayages were, away he 
went : after he had been gone an hour or two, he 
brings word, that he had been among them undifco- 
vered, that he found they were two parties, and of 
two feveral nations, who had war with one another 
and had had a great battle in their own country, and 
that both fides having had feveral prifoners taken in 
the fight, they were by mere chance landed in the 
fame ifland, for the devouring their prifoners, and 
making merry ; but their coming fo by chance to 
the fame place, had fpoiled all their mirth ; that they 
were in a great rage at one another, and were fo near, 
that he believed they would fight again as foon as 
day-light began to appear ; but he did not perceive 
that they had any notion of any body's being on the 
ifland but themfelves. He had hardly made an end 
of telling the ftory, when they could perceive, by 
the unufual noife they made, that the two little 
armies were engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday^ father ufed all the arguments he could to 
perfuade our people to lie clofe, and not be feen j he 
told them, their fafety confifted in it, and that they 
had nothing to do but to lie ftill, and the favages 
would kill one another to their hands, and the reft

would go away; and it was fo to a tittle. But It 
was impoffible to prevail, efpecially upon the Eng- 
lijhmen ; their curiofity was fo importunate upon 
their prudentials, that they mufl run out and fee the 
battle: however, they ufcd fome caution, viz. they 
did not go openly juft by their own dwelling, but 
went farther into the woods, and placed themfelves 
to advantage, where they might fecurely fee them 
manage the fight, and, as they thought, not to be 
feen by themj but it feems the favages did' fee 
them, as we fliall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Englijhmen^ one of them faid, he could perceive, 
that fome of them were men of great bravery, of 
invincible fpirits, and of great policy in guiding the 
fight. The battle, they faid, held two hours, before 
they could guefs which party would be beaten ; but 
then that party which was neareft our people's habita- 
tion began to appear weakeft, and after fome time 
more, fome of them began to fly j and this put our 
men again into a great confternation, left any pf 
thofe that fled fliould run into the grove, before their 
dwelling, for flielter, and thereby involuntarily dif- 
cover the place j and that by confequence the pur- 
fuers fhould do the like in fearch for them. Upon 
this they refolved, that they would ftand armed with- 
in the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they 
fhould fally out over the wall, and kill them ; fo 
that, if poflible, not one Ihould return to give an 
account of it ; they ordered alfo, that it fliould be 
done with their fwords, or by knocking them down

enough ; planted, fowed, reaped, and began to be 
all naturalized to the country; but fome time after 
this, they fell all into fuch fimple meafures again as 
brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prifoners, as I had obferved } 
and thefe three being lufty ftout young fellows, they 
made them fervants, and taught them to work 
for them; and, as flaves, they did well enough; 
but they did not take their meafures with them 
as I did by my man Friday ^ viz. to begia with them 
upon the principle of having faved their lives, and 
then inftruded them in the rational principles of 
life, much lefs of religion, civilizing and reducing 
them by kind ufage, and affedionate arguings; 
but, as they gave them their food every day, fa 
they gave them their work too, and kept them fully 
employed in drudgery enough; but they failed in 
this by it, that they never had them to aflift them 
and fight for them, as I had my man Friday^ wha 
was as true to me as the very flefli upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part : Being all now 
good friends (for common danger, as I faid above, 
had effedually reconciled them), they began to con^ 
fider their general circumftances ; and the firll thing 
that came under their confideration was, whether, 
feeing the favages particularly haunted that fide of the 
ifland, and that there were more remote and retired 
parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, and 
manifeftly to their advantage, they fliould not rather 
remove their habitation, and plant in fame more 
proper place for their fafety, and efpecially for the 
fecurity of their cattle and corn. 

Upon 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived, 
that they fhould not remove their habitation ; be- 
caufe that fome time or other they thought they 
might hear from their governor again, ;neaning 
me : and if I ftiould fend any one to feek them, I 
would be fure to dire£t them on that fide, where, if 
they fliould find the place demolifhed, they would 
conclude the favages had killed us all, and we were 
gone, and fo our fupply would go away too. 

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the valley where my cave was, 
where the land was as proper to both, and where 
indeed there was land enough : however, upon fe- 
cond thoughts, they altered one part of that refolu- 
tion too, and refolved only to remove part of their* 
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there ; 
and fo, if one part was deftroyed, the other might 
be faved: and one piece of prudence they ufed, 
which it was very well they did ; viz. That they 
never trufted thefe three favages, which they had 
taken prifoners, with knowing any thing of the 
plantation they had made in that valley, or of any 
cattle they had there ; much lefs of the cave there, 
which they kept in cafe of neceflity, as a fafe retreat; 
and thither they carried alfo the two barrels of pow- 
der which I had left them at my coming away. 

But, however, they refolved not to change their 
habitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully 
I covered it firft with a wall and fortification, and 
then with a grove of trees ; fo, feeing their fafety 
confided entirely in their being concealed, of which 
they were now fully convinced, they fet to work to 
cover and conceal the place yet more effeftually than 

F 3 before ••

brfore : to this purpofe, as I had planted trees (of 
rather thrufl in flakes, which in time all grew to be 
trees) for fome good diftance before the entrance 
into my apartment, they went on in the fame man-» 
ner, and filled up the reft of that whole fpace of 
ground, from the trees I had fet, quite down to the 
fide of the creek, where, as I faid, I landed my 
floats, and even into the very ouze where the tide 
flowed, not fo much as leaving any place to land, or 
anyfign that there had been any landing thereabout: 
thefe ftakes alfo, being of a wood very forward to 
grow, as I had noted formerly, they took care to 
have generally very much larger and taller than thofq 
which I had planted, and placed them fo very thick 
and clofe, that when they had been three or four 
years grown, there was no pier<:ing with the eye any 
confiderable way into the plantation : as for that part 
which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick; 
as a man's thigh ; and among them they placed fo 
many other fhort ones, and fo thick, that, in a word, 
it ftood like a palifado a quarter of a mile thick, and 
it was next to impoflible to penetrate it, but with a 
little army, to cut it all down ; for a little dog coul4 
hardly get between the trees, they ftood fo clofe. 

But this was not all ; for they did the fame by 
all the ground to the right hand, and to the left, 
and round even to the top of the hill ; leaving no 
way, not fo much as for themfelves to come out, 
but by the ladder placed up to the fide of the hill, 
and then lifted up, and placed again from the firfl; 
ftage up to the top ; which ladder^ when it was taken 
down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to 
;iflift it, could come at th?m. 

This 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, "JX 

This was excellently well contrived : nor was it 
lefs than what they after waMs found occafion for; 
which ferved to convince me, that as human pru- 
dence has authority of Providence to juftify it, fo 
it has, doubtlefs, the direftidn of Providence to fet 
it to work ; and, would we liften carefully to the 
voice of it, I am fully perfuaded we might prevent 
many of the difafters which our lives are now, by 
our own negligence, fubjeSed to, But this by the 
way. 

I return to the ftory : they lived two years after 
this in perfed retirement, and had no more vifits 
from the favages ; they had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them in a great con- 
fternation; for, feme of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the weft fide, or rather end of 
the ifland, which, by the way, was that - end where 
I never went, for fear of being difcovered, they were 
furprifed with feeing above twenty canoes of Indians 
juft coming on fliore, 

They made the beft of their way home, in hurry 
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades, 
they kept clofe all that day and the next, going 
out only at night, to make obfervation : but they 
had the good luck to be miftaken; for wherever 
the favages went, they did not land at that time 
on the ifland, but purfued fome other defign. 

And now they had another broil with the three 
jL7igliJhmen ; one of which, a moft turbulent fellow, 
being in a rage at one of the three flaves, which I 
mentioned they had taken, becaufe the fellow had 
jipt done fomething right which he bid him do, an<J

72 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

feemed a little untradlable in his fhewing him, drew 
a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he bore it by 
his fide, and fell upon him, the poor favage, not to 
correal him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards^ 
who was by, feeing him give the fellow a barbarous 
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, 
but ftruck into his fhoulder, fo that he thought he 
had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and 
intreating him not to murder the poor man, clapt 
in between him and the favage, to prevent the 
mifchief. 

The fellow, being enraged the more at this, ftruck 
at the S/^/z/^^r^ with his hatchet, and fwore he would 
ferve him as he intended to ferve the favage ; which 
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and 
with a fhovel, which he had in his hand (for they 
were working in the field about the corn-land,) 
knocked the brute down : another of the Englijhmen^ 
running at the fame time to help his comrade, 
knocked the Spaniard down; and then two Spaniards 
more came to help their man, and a third Eng/ijhman 
fell upon them. They had none of them any fire- 
arms, or any other weapon^ but hatchets and other 
tools,, except the third Englijhman; he had one of 
my old rufly cutlaffes, with which he made at the 
laft Spaniards^ and wounded them both : this fray 
fet the whole family in an uproar, and more help 
coming in, they took the three Englijhvten prifoners. 
The next queftion was. What fhould be done with 
them ? They had been fo often mutinous, and were 
fo furious, fo defperate, and fo idle withal, that they 
knew 'not what courfe to take with them, for they

were mifchlevous to the higheft degree, and valued 
not what hurt they did any man ; fo that, in fliort, 
it was not fafe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor, told them in fo 
many words, that if they had beeil his own country, 
men, he would have hanged them all ; for all laws, 
and all governors, were to preferve fociety; and 
thofe who were dangerous to the fociety ought to be 
expelled out of it; but as they were Engltjhmen^ 
and that it was to the generous kindnefs of an Eng-' 
lijhman that they all owed their prefervation and de- 
liverance, he would ufe them with all pofTible lenity, 
and would leave them to the judgment of the other 
two Englijlvnen^ who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honeft EngUjlomen flood up, and 
faid, they defired it might not be left to them : for, 
fays he, I am fure we ought to fentence them to the 
gallows ; and with that gives an account how Will 
Atkins^ one of the three, had propofed to have all 
the fiYt-Englijlomen join together, and murder all the 
Spaniards^ when they were in their fleep. 

When the Spanijh governor heard this, he calls to 
Wilt Atkins : How, Seignior Atkins^ fays he. Will 
you murder us all ? What have you to fay to that ? 
That hardened villain was fo far from denying it, 
that he faid it was true, and G — d d — mn him they 
would do it ftill before they had done with them. 
Well, but Seignior Atkins^ faid the Spaniard^ What 
have we done to you that you will kill us ? And 
what would you get by killing us ? And what muft 
we do to prevent your killing us ? Muft we kill you, 
or will you kill us ? Why will you put us to the ne- 

ceflit/ 



74 ^^FE AND ADVENTURES 

ceffity of this, Seignior Atkins? fays the Spaniard 
very calmly, and fmiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a rage at the Sfaniard^s 
making a jeft of it, that, had he not been held by 
three ifien, and withal had no weapons with him, it 
was thought he would have attempted to have killed 
the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This hare-brained carriage obliged them to confi* 
der fcrioufly what was to be done. The two Englijh- 
men and the Spaniard^ who faved the poor favage, 
were of the opinion. That they fhould hang one of 
the three for an example to the reft j and that par-r 
ticularly it ftiould be he that had twice attempted to 
commit murder with his hatchet ; and indeed there 
was fome reafon to believe he had done it, for the 
poor favage was in fuch a miferable condition with 
the wound he had received, that it w^as thought he 
could not live. 

But the governor Spaniard ftill faid ; No, it was 
• an Englijhman that had faved all their lives, and he 
would never confent fo put an EngUJJwmn to death, 
though he had murdered half of them; nay, he faid, 
if he had been killed himfelf by an Englijhman^ and 
had time left to fpeak, it fliould be, that they iliould 
pardon him. 

This was fo pofitively infifted on by the governor 
Spaniard^ that there was no gainfayihg it ; and, as 
merciful counfels are moft apt to prevail, w^here they 
are fo earneftly prcffed;, fo they all came into it ; "but 
then it was to be confidered, what fliould be done 
to keep them from the mifchief they defigned ; for 
all agreed, governor and all, that means were to be

tiled for preferving the fociety from danger : After a 
long debate it was agreed, firft. That they fhould be 
difarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, or 
powder, or fhot, or fword, or any weapon, and 
fliould be turned out of the fociety, and left to live 
where they would, and how they could, by them* 
felves ; but that none of the reft, either Spaniards or 
Englijh^ fhould converfe with them, fpeak with them, 
or have any thing to do with them ; that they fhould 
be forbid to come within a certain diftance of the 
place where the reft dwelt ; and that if they offered 
to commit any diforder, fo as to fpoil, burn, kill, or 
deftroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, 
or cattle belonging to the fociety, that they fhould 
die without mercy, and would fhoot them wherever 
they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, mufing 
upon the fentence, confidered a little upon it ; and, 
turning to the two honcH Englijhmen^' faid. Hold; you 
muft reflect, that it will be long ere they can raifc 
corn and cattle of their own, and they muft not ftarve j 
we muft therefore allow them provifions. So he cau- 
fed to be ^dded. That they fhould have a proportion 
pf corn given them to laft them eight months, and for 
feed to fov/, by which time they might be fuppofed 
to raife fome of their own j that they fhould have 
fix milch-goats, four he-goats, and fix kids given 
them, as well for prefent fubfiftence, as for a ftore ; 
^nd that they fhould have tools given them for their 
work in the field ; fuch as, fix hatchets, an axe, a 
f^w, and the like : But they fliould have none of 
thefe tools or provifions, unlefs they would fwear 

folemnly 



y6 XIFE AND ADVENTURES 

folemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englijhmen. 

Thus they difmiffed them the fociety, and turned 
them out to fliift for themfelves. They went away 
fullen and refraftory, as neither contented to go 
away, or to flay ; but, as there was no remedy, they 
went, pretending to go and choofe a place where they 
(hould fettle themfelves, to plant and live by them- 
felves ; and fome provifions were given, but no wea- 
pons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for 
fome victuals, and gave the governor an account 
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them- 
felves out an habitation or plantation ; it was a very 
convenient place indeed, on the remoteft part of the 
ifland, N. E. much about the place where I provi- 
dentially landed in my firft voyage, when I was dri- 
ven out to fea, the Lord alone • knows whither, in 
my foolifh attempt to furround the ifland. 

Here they built themfelves two handfome huts, 
and contrived them in a manner like my firft habita- 
tion, being clofe under the fide of a hill, having 
fome trees growing already to the three fides of it ; 
fo that by planting others, it would be very eafily 
covered from the fight, unlefs narrowly fearched 
for ; they defired fome dry goat fldns for beds and 
covering, which were given them ; and upon their 
giving their words that they would not difturb the 
reft, or injure any of their plantations, they gave 
them hatchets, and what other tools they could 
fpare; fome peafe,. barley, and rice, for fowing, 
and, in a word, any thing they wanted but arms and 
ammunition. 

They 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

They lived in this feparate condition about fix 
months, and had got in their firft harveft, though 
the quantity was but fmall, the parcel of land they 
had planted being but Kttle ; for indeed, having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
work upon their hands ; and when they came to 
make boards, and pots, and fuch things, they were 
quite out of their element, and could make nothing 
of it ; and when the rainy feafon came on, for want 
of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their ^ 
gredn dry, and it was in great danger of fpoiling : 
and this humbled them much ; fo they came and beg- 
ged the Spaniards to help them, which they very 
readily did; and in four days worked a gieat hole 
in the fide of the hill for them, big enough to fecure 
their corn, and other things from the rain ; but it 
was but a poor place at beft, compared to mine ; and* 
efpecially as mine w^as then ; for the Spaniards liad 
greatly enlarged it, and made feveral new apartments 
in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this feparation, 
a new froliok took thefe rogues, which, together 
with the former villainy they had committed, brought 
mifchief enough upon them, and had very near been 
the ruin of the whole colony : the three new affociates 
began, it feems, to be weary of the laborious life 
^hey led, and that without hope of bettering their 
circumftances ; and a whim took them, that they 
would make a voyage to the continent from whence 
the favages came, and would try if they could not 
feize upon forae prifoners among the natives there 
and bring them home, fo as to make them do the 
laborious part of tRe work for them* 

The 



7? LIFE AND ADV£NtUR£S 

The projeft was not fo prepofterous, if they had gon4 
no farther ; but they did nothing, and propofed no- 
thing, but had either mifchief in the defign, or mif- 
chief in the event : and, if I may give my opinion, 
they feemed to be under a blaft from Heaven ; for if 
we will not allow a vifible curfe to purfue vifible 
crimes, how fhall we reconcile the events of things 
with divine juftice ? It was certainly an apparent ven- 
geance on their crime of mutiny and piracy, that 
brought them to the ftate they were in ; and, as they 
Ihewed not the leaft remorfe for the crime, but added 
new villainies to it, fuch as, particularly, that piece 
of monftrous cruelty of wounding a poor flave, be- 
caufe he did not, or perhaps could not, underftand to 
do what he was direfted ; and to wound him in fuch 
a manner, as, no queftion, made him a cripple all his 
life, and in a place where no furgeon or medicine 
could be had for his cure : and, what was ftill worfe, 
the murderous intent ; or, to do juftice to the crime, 
the intentional murder, for fuch to be fure it was, 
as was afterwards the formed defign they all laid, to 
murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their 
fleep. 

JBut I leave obferving, and return to the ftory : 
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 
morning, and, in very humble terms, defired to be 
j^dmitted to fpeak Vvith them: the Spaniards very 
readily heard what they had to fay, which was this : 
that they were tired of living in the manner they did ; 
that they were not handy enough to make the necef- 
faries they wanted ; and that, having no help, they 
found they fhould be ftarved ; but if the Spaniards 
Iv^ould give them leave to take one of the canoes which 

they 



thgy cime over in, and give them arms and ammuni* 
tion, proportioned for their defence, they would go 
over to the main, and feek their fortune, and fo deli-* 
ver them from the trouble of lupplying them with 
any other provifions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them ; 
but yet very honeftly reprefented to them the certain 
deftru^kion they \vere running into ; told them, 
they had fuffered fuch hardfliips upon that very fpot, 
that they could, without any fpirit of prophecy, tell 
them, that they would be ftarved or murdered j and 
bade them confider of it. 

The men replied audacioufly, they fhould be ftar- 
ved if they ftayed here, for they could not work, and 
would not work; and they could but be ftarved 
abroad ; and if they were murdered, there was an 
end of them, they had no wives or children to cry 
alter them ; and, in fliort, infifted importunately upon 
their demand, declaring that they would go, whether 
they would give them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindnefs, 
that if they were refolved to go, they fliould not go 
like naked men, and be in no condition to defend 
themfelves; and that though they could ill fpare 
their fire-arms, having not enough for themfelves, 
yet they would let them have two mufquets, a piftol, 
and a cutlafs, and each man a hatchet, which they 
thought fufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer ; and having 
baked them bread enough to ferve them a month, 
and given them as, much goat's flefli as they could 
eat while It was fweet, and a great bafket full of dried * 
grapes, a pot full of frefti water, and a young kid

alive to kill, they boldly fet out in a canoe for a 
voyage over the fea, where it was at lead forty miles 
broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have 
very well carried 15 or 20 men; and therefore was 
rather too big for them to manage ; but as they had 
a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, they did 
well enough : they had made a maft of a long pole, 
and a fail of four large goat-{kins dried, whi^ch.they 
had fowed or laced together; and away they went 
merrily enough : the Spaniards called after them, 
Bon Veajo ; and no man ever thought of feeing them 
any more* 

The Spaniards would often fay to one another, and 
the two honed Englijhnien who remained behind, how 
quietly and comfortably they lived, now thofe three 
turbulent fellows were gone ; as for their ever coming 
again, that was the remoteft thing from their thoughts 
could be imagined ; when, behold, after twenty 
two days abfence, one of the Englljlomen being 
abroad upon his planting-work, fees three ft range 
, men coming towards him at a diftance^ two of them 
with guns upon their Ihoulders. 

Away runs the EngUJloman^ as if he was bewitched, 
and became frighted and amazed, to the governor 
Spaniard^ and tells him they were all undone, for 
there were ftrangers landed upon the ifland, he could 
not tell who : the Spaniard paufing a while, fays to 
him. How do you mean, you cannot tell who ? They 
are favages to be fure. No, no, fays the Englijh?7iany 
they are men in clothes, v/ith arms : Nay then, fays 
the Spaniard^ why are you concerned ? If they are 
not favages, they muft be friends ; for there is no 

Chriftian 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 8 1 

Chriftian nation upon earth, but will do us good ra- 
ther than harm. 

While they were debating thus, came the three 
Englijhmen^ and, (landing without the wood which 
was new planted, hallooed to them ; they prefently 
knew their voices, and fo all the wonder of that 
kind ceafed. But now the admiration was turned 
upon another queftion, viz. What could be the mat- 
ter, and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in ; 
and enquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing ? They gave them a full account 
of their voyage in a few words, viz. That they 
reached the land in two days, or.fomething lefs ; but 
finding the people alarmed at their coming, and pre- 
paring with bows and , arrows to fight them, they 
durft not go on fhore, but failed on to the northward 
fix or feven hours, till they came to a great opening, 
by which they perceived that the land they faw from 
our ifland was not the main, but an ifland : that 
entering that opening of the fea, they faw another 
ifland on the right hand north, and feveral more 
weft ; and being refolved to land fomewhere, they 
put over to one of the iflands which lay weft, and 
went boldly on fliore y that they found the people 
were courteous and friendly to them, and they gave 
them feveral roots, and fome dried fifli, and ap- 
peared very fociable ; and the women, as well as 
the men, were very forward to fupply them with 
any thing they could get for them to eat, and 
brought it to them a great way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and enquired, as 
well as they could of them by figns, what nations 

Vol. II. G were 



82 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

were this way, and that way ; and were told of fe- 
veral fierce and terrible people, that lived almoft 
every way ; who, as they made known by figns to 
them, ufed to eat men ; but as for theinfelves, they 
faid, that they never eat men or women, except 
only fuch as they took in the wars ; and then they 
owned, that they made a great feaft, and eat their 
prifoners. 

The Englifhmen enquired, when they had a feaft 
of that kind ; and they told them two moons ago, 
pointing to the moon, and then to two fingers ; and 
that their great king had two hundred prifoners now, 
which he had taken in his war ; and they were 
feeding them to make them fat for the next feaft. 
The Englifhmen feemed mighty defirous to fee thofe 
prifoners; but the others miftaking them, thought 
they were defirous to have fome of them to carry 
away for their own eating. So they beckoned to 
them, pointing to the fetting of the fun, and then 
to the rifing ; which was to fignify, that the next 
morning, at fun-rifing, they would bring fome for 
them; and accordingly, the next morning, they 
brought down five women, and eleven men; and 
gave them to the EngUJlomeir^ to carry with them 
on their voyage, juft as we would bring fo many 
cows and oxen down to a fea-port town, to vidual 
a fliip. 

As brutifli and barbarous as thefe fellows were 
at home, their ftomachs turned at this fight, and 
they did not know what to do ; to refufe the pri- 
foners would have been the higheft affront to the 
favage gentry that offered them ; and what to do 
with them they knew not : however, upon fome de- 
bate. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE# 8 J 

bate, they refolved to accept of them ; and, m re- 
turn, they gave the favages that brought them one 
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix or 
feven of their bullets, which, though they did not 
underftand, they feemed extremely pleafed with : 
and then, tying the poor creatures hands behind 
them, they (the people) dragged the prifoners into 
the boat for our men. 

The Englijhmen were obliged to come away as 
foon as they had them, or elfe they that gave them 
this noble prefent, would certainly have expefted 
that they fhould have gone to work with them, have 
killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. 

But, having taken their leave with all the refpe£t 
and thanks that could well pafs between people, where, 
on either fide, they underllood not one word they 
could fay, they put oflf with their boat, and came 
back towards the firft ifland, where, when they ar- 
rived, they fet eight of their prifoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occafion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have fome 
communication with their prifoners, but it was im- 
poffible to make them underftand any thing ; no- 
thing they could fay to them, or give them, or do 
for them, but was looked upon as going about to 
murder them : they firft of all unbound them ; but 
the poor creatures fcreamed at that, efpecially the 
women, as if they had juft felt the knife at their 
throats ; for they immediately concluded they were 
unbound on purpofe to be killed. 

G2 If 



84 LIfE A>^0 ADVENTURES 

If they gave them any thing to eat, It was the 
fame thing ; then they concluded it was for fear they 
fliould fink in flefh, and fo not be fat enough to kill : 
if they looked at one of them more particularly, 
the party prefently concluded, it was to fee whether 
he or flie was fatteft and fitted to kill firfl: ; nay, 
after they had brought them quite over, and began 
to ufe them kindly, and treat them well, ft:ill they 
expefted every day to make a dinner or fupper for 
their new mafl:ers. 

When the three wanderers had given this unac- 
countable hifl:ory or jqurnal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard alked them, where their new family was ? 
And being told that they had brought them on fhore, 
and put them into one of their huts, and were come 
to beg fome viftuals for them ; they (the Spaniards) 
and the other two Englijhmen^ that is to fay, the 
whole colony, refolved to go all down to the place, 
and fee them, and did fo, and Friday^ father vsith 
them. 

When they came into the hut, there they fat all 
bound : for when they had brought them on fhore, 
they bound their hands, that they might not ^ take 
the boat and make their efcape ; there, I fay, they 
fat, all of them fl:ark.naked : firfl:, there were three 
men, lufl:y, comely fellows, well fhaped, ftrait and 
fair limbs, about 30 or 35 years of age, and five 
women, whereof two might be from 30 to 40, two 
more not above 24 or 25, and the fifth, a tall, comely 
maiden, about 16 or 17 : the women were well, fa- 
voured agreeable perfons, both in fhape and features, 
only tawny; and two of them, had they been per-

fed white, would have paffed for handfome women, 
even in London itfelf, having very pleafant agreeable 
countenances, and of a very modeft behaviour, efpe- 
cially when they came afterv/ards to be clothed, and 
drefled, as they called it, though that drefs was very 
indifferent, it muft be confeffed j of which here- 
after. 

The light, you may be fare, was fpmething un- 
couth to our Spaniards^ who were (to give them a 
juft charader) men of the bed behaviour, of the mofl 
calm, fedate tempers, and perfeft good-humour that 
ever I met with ; and, in particular, of the mod 
modefty, as will prefently appear: I fay the fight 
was very uncouth, to fee three naked men, and five 
naked women, all together bound, and in the moft 
miferable circumftances that human nature could be 
fuppofed to be, viz. to be expeding every moment 
to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked 
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed 
for a dainty. 

The firft thing they did was to caufe the old Indian, 
Friday^s father, tp go in, and fee firft if he knew 
any of them ; and then, if he underftood any of 
their fpeech : as foon as the old man came in, he 
looked ferioufly at them, but knew none of them j 
neither could any of them underftand a word he 
faid, or a fign he could make, except one of the 
women. 

However, this was enough to anfwer the end, 
which was to fatisfjr them, that the men into vhofe 
hands they were fallen, were Chriftians ; that they 
abhorred eating of men or women, and that they 
might be fure they would not be killed ; as foon a$ 

G 3 they 



86 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

they were affured of this, they difcovered fuch 
a joy, and by fuch awkward and feveral ways, as is 
hard to defcribe j for it feems they were of feveral 
nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid, 
in the next place, to afk them if they were willing 
to be fervants, and to work for the men who had 
brought them away, to fave their lives ? At which 
they all fell a dancing ; and prefently one fell to 
taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay 
next, to carry on their fhoulders, to intimate, that 
they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having women 
among them, would prefently be attended with fome 
inconveniency, and might occafion fome ftrife, and 
perhaps blood, afked the three men, what they in- 
tended to do with thefe women, and how they in- 
tended to ufe them, whether as fervants, or as wo- 
men ? One of the EngUJhmen anfwered very boldly 
and readily, that they would ufe them as both. To 
which the governor faid, I am not going to reftrain 
you from it ; you are your own mafters as to. that : 
but this I think is but juft, for avoiding diforders and 
quarrels among you, and I defire it of you for that 
reafon only, viz. that you will all engage, that if 
any of you take any of thefe women, as a woman, 
or wife, he Ihall take but one ; and that, having 
taken one, none elfe Ihould touch herj for though 
we cannot mairy any of you, yet it is but reafonable, 
that while you (lay here, the woman any of you 
takes fhould be maintained by the man that takes 
her, and fhould be his wife ; I mean fays he,Vhile 
he continues here j and that none elfe fhould have 

any 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOJS* 87 

any thing to do with her. All this appeared fo juft, 
that everyone agreed to it without any difficulty. 

Then the EngUjhmen afked the Spaniards^ if they 
deligned to take any of them ? But every one an- 
fwered, No : fome of them faid they had wives 
in Spain ; and the others did not like women 
that were not Chriftians ; and altogether declared, 
that they would not touch one of them ; which was 
an inftance of fuch virtue, as I have not met with 
in all my travels ; on the other hand, to be fhort, 
the five Englijkmen took them every one a wife ; 
that is to fay, a temporary wife ; and fo they fet 
up a new form of living; for the Spaniards and 
Fridays father lived in my old habitation, which 
they had enlarged exceedingly within ; the three 
fervants, which they had taken in the late battle of 
the favages, lived with them ; ^d thefe carried on 
the main part of the colony, fupplying all the reft 
with food, and affifting them in any thing as they 
could, or as they found neceffity required. 

But the wonder of this ftory was, how five fuch 
refradory, ilUmatched fellows fhould agree about 
thefe women, and that two of them fliould not 
pitch upon the fame woman, efpecially feeing two 
or three of them were, without comparifon, more 
agreeable than the others : but they took a good 
way enough to prevent quarrelling among them* 
felves : for they fet the five women by themfelves 
in one of their huts, and they went all into the 
other 'hut, and drew lots among them who fhould 
choofe firft. 

" He that drew to choofe firft, went away by him- 
felf to the hut, where the poor naked creatures. were, 

G 4 and 



50 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted 
about their huts, that when you came to the place 
nothing was to be feen but a wood ; and though 
they had their plantation twice demoliflied, once by 
their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as 
Ihall be fhewn in its place ; yet they had reftored all 
again, and every thing was flourifliing and thriving 
about them : they had grapes planted in order, and 
managed like a vineyard, though they had them- 
felyes never feen any thing of that kind : and by 
their good ordering their vines, their grapes were 
as good again as any of the others. They had alfo 
formed themfelves a retreat in the thickeft part of 
the woods, where, though there was not a natural 
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with in- 
ceffant labour of their hands, and where, when the 
mifchief which followed happened, they fecured 
their wives and children, fo as they could never be 
found ; they having, by flicking innumerable ftakes 
and poles of the wood, which, as I faid, grew fo 
eafily, made a grove impaffable, except in one place, 
where they climbed up to get over the outfide part, 
and then went in by ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I juftly call them, 
though they were much civilized by their new fet- 
tlement, compared to what they were before, and 
were not fo quarrelfome, having not the fame oppor- 
tunity, yet one of the certain companions of a pro- 
fligate mind never left them, and that was their idle- 
nefs : It is true, they planted corn, and made fences; 
but Solomon's words were never better verified than 
in them : " I went by the vineyard of the flothful, 
*^ and it was overgrown with thorns j'' for when 

the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9X 

the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could 
not fee it in fome places for weeds ; the hedge had 
feveral gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten 
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there 
a dead bufh was crammed in, to Hop them out for 
the prefent, but it was only (hutting the ftable door 
after the fteed was ftolen ; whereas, when they 
looked on the colony of the other two, there was 
the very face of induftry and fuccefs upon all they 
did ; there was not a weed to be feen in all their 
corn, or a gap in any of their hedges ; and they, on 
the other hand, verified Solomon's words in another 
place : " The diligent hand maketh rich ;" for 
every thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty 
within and without ; they had more tame cattle than 
the others, more utenfils and neceffaries within doors, 
and yet more pleafure and diverfion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors ; and having learned the 
Englijh ways of drefling and cooking from one of 
the other Englijhmen^ who, as I faid, was a cook's 
mate on board the fhip, they dreffed their hufbands 
visuals very nicely ; whereas the other could not be 
brought to underftand it ; but then the hufband, 
who, as I faid, had been cook's mate, did it him- 
felf; but, as for the hufbands of the three wives, 
they loitered about, fetched turtles eggs, and caught 
fifli and birds : in a word, any thing but labour ; 
and they fared accordingly. The diligent lived well 
and comfortably ; and the flothful lived hard and 
beggarly ; and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it is 
all over the world. 



But 



9^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

But now I come to a fcene different from all that 
had happened before, either to them or me j and the 
origin of the ftory was this : 

Early one morning there came on fhore five or 
fix canoes of Indians y or favages, call them which 
you pleafe ; and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their 
Haves ; but that part was now fo familiar to the 
Spaniards^ and to our men too, that they did not 
concern themfelves about it, as I did ; but, having 
been made fenfible by their experience, that their 
only bufinefs was to lie concealed, and that, if 
they were not feen by any of the favages, they would 
go off again quietly, when their bufmefs was done, 
having as yet not the lead notion of there being 
any inhabitants in the ifland j I fay, having been 
made fenfible of this, they had nothing to do but to 
give notice to all the three plantations' to keep with- 
in doors, and not to fliew themfelves ; only placing a 
fcout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats 
went off to fea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a dif^ 
after fpolled all thefe meafures, and made it known 
among the favages, that there were inhabitants 
there; which was, in the end, the defolation of 
almoft the whole colony. After the canoes with 
the favages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped 
abroad again, and fome of them had the curiofity 
to go to the place where they had been, to fee what 
they had been doing. Here, to their great furprife, 
they found three favages left behind, and lying faft 
afleep upon the ground ; it was fuppofed they had 
either been fo gorged with their inhuman feaft, that, 

like 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

like beafts, they were afleep, and would not ftir when 
the others went, or they were wandered into the 
woods, and did not come back in time to be taken 
in. 

The Spaniards were greatly furprifed at this fight, 
and perfeaiy at a lofs what do ; the Spaniard go- 
vernor, as it happened, was with them, and his ad- 
vice was alked ; but he profeffed he knew not what 
to do ; as for flaves, they had enough already ; and 
as to killing them, they were none of them inclined 
to that ; the Spaniard governor told me they could 
not think of fliedding innocent blood ; for as to 
them, the poor creatures had done no wrong, in- 
vaded none of their property ; and they thought 
they had no juft quarrel againft them to take away 
their lives. 

And here I muft, in juftice to thefe Spaniards^ 
obferve, that let all the accounts of Spanijh cruelty 
in Mexico and Feru be what they will, I never met 
with feventeen men, of any nation whatfoever, in any 
foreign country, who were fo univerfally modeft, tem- 
perate, virtuous, fo very good-humoured, and fo 
courteous, as thefe Spaniards \ and, as to cruelty, 
they had nothing of it in their very nature ; no in- 
humanity, no barbarity, no outrageous paffions, and 
yet all of them men of great courage and fpirit. 

Their temper and calmnefs had appeared in their 
bearing the infufFerable ufage of the three Englijh- 
men ; and their juftice and humanity appeared now 
in the qafe of the favages, as above : after fome con- 
fultation, they refolved upon this, that they would 
lie ftill awhile longer, till, if poffible, thefe three 
men might be gone j but then the governor Spa^ 

niard 



94 Lir*^ AND ADVENTURES 

niard recolhdied, that the three favages had no boat; 
and that, if they were left to rove about the ifland, 
they would certainly difcover that there were inha- 
bitants in it, and fo they fhould be undone that 
way. 

Upon this they went back again, and there lay 
the fellows fall afleep ftill; fo they refclved to 
awaken them, and take them prifoners ; and they did 
fo : the poor fellows were ftrangely frighted when 
they were feized upon and bound, and afraid, like 
the women, that they fhould be murdered and eaten ; 
for, it feems, thofe people think all the world do 
as they do, eating men's flefli ; but they were foon 
made eafy as to that ; and away they carried them. 

It was very happy for them, that they did not 
carry them home to their caftle ; I mean to my pa- 
lace under the hill j but they carried^ them firft to 
the bower, where was the chief of their country 
work ; fuch as the keeping the goats, the planting 
the corn, &c. and afterwards they carried them to 
the habitation of the two EngUJhinen. 

Here they were fet to. work, though it was not 
much they had for them to do : and whether it was 
by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought 
the fellows could not mend themfelves, I know not, 
but one of them ran away ; and, taking into the 
woods, they could never hear of him more. 

They had good reafon to believe he got home 
again foon after in fome other boats or canoes of 
favages, who came on fliore three or four weeks af- 
terwards, and who, carrying on their revels as ufual, 
went off again in two days time : this thought ter- 
rified them exceedingly J for they concluded, and 

that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

that not without good caufe indeed, that if this fel- 
low got fafe home among his comrades, he would 
certainly give them an account that there were peo- 
ple in the ifland, as alfo how weak and few they were ; 
for this favage, as I obferved before, had never beeu 
told, as it was very happy he had not, how many 
they were, or where they lived, nor had he ever feen 
or heard the fire of any of their guns, much lefs 
had they Ihewn him any other of their retired 
places, fuch as the cave in the valley, or the new 
retreat which the two EngUjhmen had made, and 
the like. 

The firft teftimony they had, that this fellow had 
given intelligence of them was, that about two 
months after this, fix canoes of favages, with about 
feven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing 
along the north-fide of the ifland, where they never 
ufed to come before, and landed about an hour after 
fun-rife, at a convenient place, about a mile from 
the habitation of the two EngUjhmen^ where ' this 
efcaped man had been kept : as the Spaniard go- 
vernor faid, had they been all there, the damage 
would not have been fo much, for not a man of 
them would have efcaped : but the cafe differed now 
very much; for two- men to fifty were too much 
odds : the two men had the happinefs to difcover 
them about a league off, fo that it was above an hour 
before they landed ; and as they landed about a mile 
from their huts, it was fome time before they could 
come at them. Now having great reafon to believe 
that they were betrayed, the firfl thing they did was 
to bind the flaves which were left, and caufe two of 
the three men, whom they brought with the women, 

who, 



J 



95 LIFE AND ADVENTtTRffS 

who, It feems, proved very faithful to them, to lead 
them with their two wives, and whatever. they couWi 
carry away with them, to their retired place in the- 
woods, which I have fpoken of ^bove, and there to 
bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard 
farther.. 

In the next place, feeing the favages were all 
come on Ihore, and that they bent their courfe di- 
redly that way, they opened the fences where their 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out, leav- 
ing their goats to ftraggle into the wood, whither 
they pleafed,' that the favages might think they were 
all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with them 
was too cunning for that, and gave them an ac- 
count of it all ; for they went direftly to the place. 

When the poor frighted men had fecured their 
wives and goods, they fent the other flave they had 
of the three, who came with the women, and who 
was at their place by accident, away to the Spa-- 
niards with all fpeed, . to give them the alarm, and 
defire fpeedy help ; and in the mean time they took 
their arms, and. what ammunition they had, and 
retreated towards the place in the wood where their 
wives were fent, keeping at a diftance ; yet fo that 
they might fee, if poffible, which way the favages 
took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a rifing 
ground, they could fee the little army of their ene- 
mies come on direftly to their habitation, and in a 
moment more could fee all their huts and houfehold. 
ftuif flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortification ; for they had a very great lofs, and 
to them irretrievable, at lead for fome time. They

kept their ftation for awhile, till they found the fa- 
vages, like wild beafts, fpread themfelves all over the 
place, rummaging every way, and every place they 
could think of, in fearch for prey ; and, in particu. 
lar, for the people, of whom it plainly appeared they 
had intelligence. 

The two Englifhmen feeing this, thinking them- 
felves not fecure where they flood, as it was likely 
fome of the wild people might come that way, fo 
they might come too many together, thought it pro- 
per to make another retreat about half a mile far- 
ther, believing, as it afterwards happened, that the 
farther they (trolled, the fewer would be together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very 
thick grown part of the woods, and where an old 
trunk of a tree flood, which was hollow, and vaflly 
hrge ; and in this tree they both took their fli^nding, 
refolving'to fee what might offer* 

They had not flood there long, but two of the 
favages appeared running direftly that way, as if 
they had already notice where they flood, and were 
coming up to attack them ; and a little way farther 
they efpied three more coming after them, and five 
more beyond them, all coming the fame way ; be- 
fides which, they faw feven or eight more at a dif- 
tance, running another way ; for, in a word, they 
ran every way, like fportfmen heating for their 
game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whe- 
ther they fhould fland, and keep their poflure, or 
fly ; but after a very fhort debate with themfelves, 
they confidered, that if the favages ranged the coun- 
try thus, before help came, they might, perhaps, 

Vol. IL H find 



98 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

find out their retreat in the woods, and then all 
would be loft ; fo they refolved to ftand them there ; 
and if there were too many to deal with, then they 
would get to the top of the tree, from whence they 
doubted not to defend themfelves, fire excepted, as 
long as their ammunition lafted, though all the fa- 
vages that were landed, which were near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having refolved upon this, they next confidered 
whether they fhould fire at the two firft, or wait for 
the three, and fo take the middle party ; by which 
the two and the five that followed would be fepa- 
rated ; at length they refolved to let the two firft 
pafs by, unlefs they fhould fpy them in the tree, and 
come to attack them. The two firft favages alfo 
confirmed them in this refolution, by turning a little 
from them towards another part of the wood ; but 
the three, and the five after them, came forwards 
direftly to the tree, as if they had known the Eng. 
liflimen were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftraight towards them, they 
refolved to take them in a line as they came ; and 
as they refolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps 
the firft fhot might hit them all three; to which 
purpofe, the man who was to fire, put three or 
four bullets into his piece, and having a fair loop- 
hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he 
took a fure aim, without being feen, waiting till they 
were within about thirty yards of the tree, fo that 
he could not niifs. 

While they were thus waiting, and the favages 
came on, they plainly faw, that one of the three 
was the run-av/ay favage that had efcaped from 

them,

them, and they both knew him diftindtly, and re- 
folved, that, if poflible, he fhould not efcape, though 
they fhould both fire j fo the other flood ready with 
his piece, that if he did not drop at the firfl fhot, he 
fhould be fure to have a fecond. 

But the firfl was too good a markfman to mifs his 
aim; for, as the favages kept near one another, a: 
little behind in a line, in a word, he fired, and hit 
two of them direftly : the foremofl was killed out- 
right, being fhot in the head ; the fecond, which 
was the run-away Indian,^ was fhot through the 
body, and fell, but was not quite dead ; and the 
third had a little fcratch in the fhoulder, perhaps by 
the fame ball that went through the body of the fe- 
cond ; and being dreadfully frighted, though not 
much hurt, fat down upon the ground, fcreaming 
and yelling in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frighted with the 
noife than fenfible^of their danger, flood flill at 
firfl ; for the woods made the found a thoufand times 
bigger than it really was j the echoes rattling from 
one fide to another, and the fowls rifing from all 
parts, fcreaming and making, every fort, a feveral 
kind of noife, according to their kind, jufl as it was 
when I fired the firfl gun that, perhaps, was ever 
fhot off in that place fince it was an ifland^ 

However, all being filent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on unconcerned, 
till they came to that place where their companions 
lay, in a condition miferable enough ; and here th^ 
poor ignorant creatures, not fenfible that they wera 
within reach of the fame mifchief, flood all of a 
huddle over the wounded man, talking, and, gs may 

H2 be 



loo .LIFE AND ADVJENTURES 

be fuppofeJ, enquiring of him how he came to he 
hurt J and who, *tis very rational to believe, told 
them that a flafh of fire firft, and immediately after 
that^ thunder from their gods, had killed thofe two, 
and wounded him : This, I fay, is rational ; for no- 
thing is more certain than that, as they faw no man 
near them, fo they had never heard a gun in all their 
lives, or fo much as heard of a gun ; neither knew 
they any thing of killing or wounding at a diftance, 
with fire and bullets ; if they had, one might rea- 
fonably believe, that they would not have flood 
fo unconcerned, in viewing the fate of their fel- 
lows, without feme apprehenfion of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confefTed to me, 
It grieved them to be obliged to kill fo many poor 
creatures, who at the fame time bad no notion of 
their danger; yet, having them all thus in their 
power, and the firfl having loaded his piece again, 
refolved to let fly both together among them ; and 
fmgling out by agreement which to aim at, they fhot 
together, and killed, or very much wounded, four 
of them ; the fifth, frighted even to death, though 
not hurt^ fell with the refl ; fo that our men, feeing 
them all fall together, thought they bad killed them 
all. 

The belief that the favages were all killed, made 
our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns again, which was a 
wrong ftep; and they were under fonie furprife, 
when they came tb the place, and found no Fefs than 
four of the men alive, and of them, two very little 
hurt, and one not at all : this obliged them to fall 
upon them with the flocks of their mufquets ; and 

firft.

firfl:, they made fure of the run away favage, that 
had been the caufe of all the mifchief ; and of ano- 
ther that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of 
their pain ; then the man that was not hurt at all 
came and kneeled down to them, with his two hands 
held up, and made piteous moan to them by gef- 
tures and figns, for his life ; but could not fay one 
word to them that they could underftand. 

However, they fignified to him to fit down at the 
foot of a tree thereby ; and one of the Englijhmeny 
with a piece of rope-twine, which he had by great 
chance in his pocket, tied his feet faft together, and 
his hands behind him, and there they left him ; and, 
with what fpeed they could, made after the other 
two which were gone before, fearing they, or any 
more of them, fhould find the way to their covered 
place in the woods, where their wives, and the few 
goods they had left lay : they came once in fight of 
the two men, but it was at a great diftance ; how- 
ever, they had the fatisfaftion to fee them crofs over 
a valley, towards the fea, the quite contrary way 
from that which led to their retreat, which they were 
afraid of ; and, being fatisfied with that, they went 
back to the tree where they left their prifoner, who 
as they fuppofed, was delivered by his comrades ; for 
he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with 
which they had bound him, lay jufl: at the foot of 
the tree. 

They were now in as great a concern as before, 
jiot knowing what courfe to take, or how near the 
enemy might be, or in what numbers ; fo they re- 
folved to go away to the place where their wives 
were;, to fee if all was well there, and to make them

eafy, who were in fright enough to be fure; for 
though the favages were their own country folks, yet 
they were moft terribly afraid of them, and perhaps 
the more, for the knowledge they ha(J of them. 

When they came thither, they found the favages 
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but 
had not found it ; for indeed, it was inacceffible, by 
the trees {landing fo thick, as before, unlefs the per- 
fons feeking it had been direfted by thof(? that knew 
it, which thefe were not; they found, therefore, 
every thing very fafe, only the women in a terrible 
fright V while they were here, they had the comfort 
of feven of the Spaniards coming to their affiftance ; 
the other ten, with their fervants, and old Friday^ 
I mean Fridayh father, were gone in a body to de- 
fend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were 
kept there, in cafe the favages fhould have roved 
over to that fide of the country ; but they did not 
fpread fo far. With the feven Spaniards came one of 
the favages, who, as I faid, were their prifoners for- 
merly, and with them alfo came the favage whom 
the Englijhmen had left bound hand and foot at 'the 
tree ; for it feems they came that way, faw the 
flaughter of the feven men, and unbound the eighth, 
and brought him along with them, where, however, 
they were obliged to bind him again, as they had 
done the two others, who were left when the third 
ran away. 

The prifoners began now to. be .a burden to them ; 
and they were fb afraid of their efcaping, that they 
thought they were under an abfolute neceffity to 
kill them for their own prefervation : however, the 
Spaniard governor would not confent -to it j but or- 
dered, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I03 

dered, that they fhould be fent out of the way to 
my old cave in the valley, and^ be kept there, with 
two Spaniards to guard them, and give them food : 
which was done ; and they were bound there hand 
and foot for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englijhmen 
were fo encouraged, that they could not fatisfy 
themfelves to flay any longer there ; but taking five 
of the Spaniards^ and themfelves, with four muf. 
quets and a piftol among them, and two ftout quar- 
ter ftaves, away they went in queft of the favages ; 
and firft, they came to the tree where the mefi lay 
that had been killed ; but it was eafy to fee, that 
fome more of the favages had been there ; for they 
attempted to carry their dead men away, and had 
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it 
over ; from thence they advanced to the firft rifing 
ground, where they had ftood and feen their camp 
deftroyed, and where they had the mortificationftill 
to fee fome of the fmoke ; but neither could they 
here fee any of the favages: they then refolved, 
though with all poffible caution, to go forward to- 
wards their ruined plantation: but a little before 
they came thither, coming in fight of the fea fhore, 
they faw plainly the favages all embarking again in 
their canoes, in order to be gone. 

They feemed forry at firft that ihere was no way 
to come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but 
upon the whole, were very well fatisfied to be rid of 
them. 

The poor Englijhmen being now twice ruined, and 
all their improvements deftroyed, the reft all agreed 

H4 to 



104 tiFE AND ADVENTURED 

to come and help them to rebuild, and to aflift them 
wth needful fupplies. Their three countrymen, 
who were not yet noted for having the lead inclinaT 
tion to do any thing good, yet, as foon as they heard 
of it (for they, living remote, knew nothing till all 
was over) came and offered their help and affiftance, 
and did very friendly work for feveral days, to reftore 
their habitations, and make neceffaries for them ; an4 
thus, in a little time, they were fet upon their legs 
again. 

About two days after this, they had the farther fa- 
tisfaSion of feeing three of the favages canoes come 
driving on fliore, and, at fome diftance from them, 
with two drowned men ; by which they had reafon 
to believe, that they had met with a ftdrm at fea, and 
had over-fet fome of them ; for it blew very hard 
the night after they went off. 

However, as fome might mifcarry, fo on the 
* other hand, enough of them efcaped to inform the 
reft, as well of what they had done, as of what hap-» 
pened to them; and to whet them on to another en-, 
terprife of the fame tiature, which they, it feems, 
refolved to attempt, with fufficient force to carry all 
before them ; for, except what the firft man had told 
them of inhabitants, they could fay little to it of 
their own knowledge ; for they never faw one man, 
and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they 
had no other witnefs to confirm it to them. 

It was five or fix months after this, before they 
heard any more of the favages, in which time our 
men were in hopes they had not forgot their former 
bad luck, or had given over the hopes of better ; 
when, on a fudden, they were invaded with a moft 

formi- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I05 

formidable fleet, of no lefs than twenty-eight canoes^ 
full of favages, armed with bows and arrows, great 
clubs, wooden fwords, and fuch like engines of 
war ; and they brought fuch numbers with them, 
that, in fhort, it put all our people into the utmoft 
confternatlon. 

As they came on fliore in the evening, and at the 
cailermoft fide of the ifland, our men had that night 
to confult and confider what to do ; and, in the firft 
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed 
was their only fafety before, and would much more 
be fo now, while the number of their ejiemies wass 
fo great, they therefore refolved, firft of all, to take 
down the huts which were built for the two Englijh- 
pieuj and drive away their goats to the old cave ; 
becaufe they fuppofed the lavages would go diredly 
thither, as foon as.it was day, to play the old game 
over again, though they did not now land within 
two leagues of it. 

In the next place, they drove away all the flock of 
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which 
belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in fliort, left as 
little appearance of inhabitants any where as poflSble j 
and the next morning early they pofted themfelves 
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men, 
waiting for their coming. As they guefled, fo it 
happened ; thefe new invaders, leaving their canoes 
at the eaft end of the ifland, came ranging along the 
fliore, direftly towards the place, to the number of 
two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could 
judge. Our army was but fmall indeed; but, that

To their flaves they did not give either mufquet 
or fufil, but they had every one an halbert, or a long 
ftaflF, like a quarter ftafF, with a great fpike of iron 
faflened into each end of it, and by his fide a hatchet ; 
alfo every one of bur men had hatchets. Two of 
the women could not be prevailed upon, but they 
would come into the fight ; and they had bows and 
arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the fa- 
vages, when the firft adion happened, which I have 

fpoken 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I07 

fpoken of, where the Indians fought with one ano« - 
ther, and the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor, whom I have defcrlbed 
fo often, commanded the whole ; and William Atkinsy 
who, though a dreadful fellow for wickednefs, was a 
mod daring bold fellow, commanded under him. 
The favages came forward like lions, and our men, 
which was the worft of their fate, had no advan- 
tage in their fituation ; only that Will Atkinsy who 
now proved a mod ufeful fellow, with fix men, was 
planted juft behind a fmall thicket of buflies, as an 
advanced guard, with orders to let the firft of them 
pafs by, and then fire into the middle of them ; and, 
as foon as he had fired, to tnake his retreat, as nim- 
bly as he could, round a part of the wood, and fo 
come in behind the Spaniards where they flood, 
having a thicket of trees all before them. 

When the favages came on, they ran ftraggling 
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of or- 
der ; and Will Atkins let about fifty of them pafs by 
him ; then, feeing the reft come in a very thick 
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having 
loaded their mufquets with fix or feven bullets a- 
piece, about as big as large piftol bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded, they knew not j but 
the confternation and furprife was inexpreffible among 
the favages, who were frighted to the laft degree, to 
hear fuch a dreadful noife, and fee their men killed, 
and others hurt, but fee nobody that did it ; when 
in the middle of their fright, William Atkins ^ and 
his other three, let fly again among the thickeft of 
them ; and in lefs than a minute, the firft three, 
being loaded again, gave them a third volley. 

Had 



I08 LIFJE AND ADVENTURES 

Had William Atiins and his men retired immedi^ 
ately, as foon as they had fired, as they were or- 
dered to do ; or had the reft of the body been at 
hand, to have poured in their (hot continually, the 
favages had been efFeftually routed ; for the terror 
that was among them came principally from this ; 
iHz, That they were killed by the Gods with thun- 
der and lightning, and could fee nobody that hurt 
them ; but William Atkins, flaying to load again, 
difcovered the cheat ; fome of the favages, who were 
at a didance, fpying them, came upon them behind ; 
and though Atkins and his men fired at themalfo,, 
two or three times, and killed above twenty, retir* 
ing as fafl as they could, yet they wounded Atkins 
himfelf, and killed one of his fellow EngliJIymcn with 
their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, 
and one of the Indian flaves who came with 'the wo- 
men ; this flave was a moft gallant fellow, and fought 
moft defperately, killing five of them with his own 
hand, having no weapon but one of the arme4 
ftaves, and an hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound-^ 
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rifing 
ground in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing 
three voUies upon them, retreated alfo ; for their 
number was fo great, and they were fo defperate, 
that though above fifty of them were killed, and 
more than fo many wounded, yet they came on in 
the teeth of our men, fearlefs of danger, and fhot 
their arrows like a cloud \ and it was obferved, that 
their wounded men, who were not quite difabled, 
were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought 
like madmen. 

When 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE# log 

When out men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englijhnui}!^ that were killed, behind them ; 
and the favages, when they came up to them, killed 
them over again in a wretched manner, breaking 
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs, and 
wooden fwords, like true favages : But, finding our 
men were gone, they did not feem inclined to purfue 
them, but drew themfelves up in a kind of a ring, 
which is, it feems, their cuftom ; and fhouted twice, 
in token of their vidtory ; after which, they had the 
mortification to fee feveral of their wounded men 
fall, dying with the mere lofs of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together, upon a rifing ground, Atkiyisr, 
though he was wounded, would have had him march- 
ed, and charged them again all together at once ; but 
the Spaniard replied. Seignior Atkins^ you fee how 
their wounded men fight ; let them alone till morn- 
ing ; all thefe wounded men will be ftifF and fore 
with their wounds, and faint with the lofs of blood j 
and fo we fliall have the fewer to engage. 

The advice was good ; but Will Atkins replied 
merrily. That's true. Seignior^ and fo Ihall I too ; 
and that's the reafon I would go on, while I am 
warm. Well, Seignior Atkins^ fays the Spaniard^ 
you have behaved gallantly, and done your part ; wc 
will fight for you, if you cannot come on ; but I 
think it bed to ftay till morning : fo they waited. 

But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they 
found the favages in great diforder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noife 
among them where they lay, they afterwards refolved 
to fall upon them in the night, efpecially if they 

, could 



no LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

could come to give them but one volley before they 
were difcovered. This they had a fair opportunity 
to do ; for one of the two Englijhmeny in whofe 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them round 
between the woods and the fea-fide, weftward, and 
turning fliort fouth, they came fo near where the 
thickeft of them lay, that before they were feen or 
heard, eight of them fired in among them, and did 
dreadful execution upon them; in half a minute 
more eight others fired after them, pouring in their 
fmall (hot in fuch a quantity, that abundance were 
killed and wounded ; and all this while they were 
not able to fee who hurt them, or which way to 

The Spaniards charged again, with the utmoft ex- 
pedition, and then divided themfelves into three 
bodies, and refolved to fall in among them all toge- 
ther : they had in each body eight perfons ; that is 
to fay, twenty.four, whereof were twenty-two men, 
and the two women, who, by the way, fought def- 
perately. 

: They divided the fire-arms equally in each party> 
and fo of thehalberts and ftaves. They would have 
had the women keep back ; but they faid, they were 
refolved to die with their hufbands. Having thus 
formed their little army, they marched out from 
among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the 
enemy, fhouting and hallooing as loud as they could; 
the favages flood all together, but were in the utmoft 
confufion, hearing the npife of our men fhouting 
from three quarters together; they would have 
jFought if they had feen us ; and, as foon as we 
came near enough to be feen, fome arrows were 

(hot. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

(hot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not 
dangeroufly. But our men gave them no time; 
but, running up to them, fired among them three 
ways, and then fell in with the but-ends of their 
mufquets, their fwords, armed ftayes, and hatchets ; 
and laid about them fo well, that, in a word, they 
fet up a difmal fcreaming and howling, flying to fave 
their lives which way foever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution ; and 
killed, or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about 
180 of them; the reft, being frighted out of their 
wits, fcoured through the woods, and over the 
hills, with all the fpeed that fear and nimble feeW 
could help them to do ; and as we did not trouble 
ourfelves much to purfue them, they got all together 
to the fea-fide, where they landed, and where their 
canoes lay. But their difafter was not at an end 
yet ; for it blew a terrible ftorm of wind that even- 
ing from the fea-ward j fo that it was impoflible for 
them to put off ; nay, the ftorm continuing all night, 
when the tide came up, their canoes were moft of 
them driven by the furge of the fea fohigh upon the 
fliore, that it required infinite toil to get them off; 
and fome of them were even daflied to pieces againft 
the beach, or againft one another. 

Our men, though glad of their vidory, yet got 
little reft that night ; but having refreflied themfelves 
as well as they could, they refolved to march to that 
part of the ifland where the favages were fled, and 
fee what pofture they were in. This neceflarily led 
them over the place where the fight had been, and 
where they found feveral of the poor creatures not 
quite dead, and yet paft i'ecovering life ; a fight dif- 

agreeable 



112 LIFE AKD ADVENtURElJ 

agreeable enough to generous minds ; for a truly 
great man, though obliged by the law of battle to 
deftroy his enemy, takes no delight in his mifery. 

However, there was no need to give any order irt 
this cafe ; for their own favages, who were their fer- 
vants, difpatched thofe poor creatures with their 
hatchets* 

At length they came in view of the place where 
the more miferable remains of the favages' army lay, 
where there appeared about loo ftill ; their pofture 
was generally fitting upon the ground, with their 
knees up towards their moiith, and the head put be- 
tween the hands, leaning down upon the knees. 

When our men came within two mufquet ihot of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two mufquets 
to be fired without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, 
that by their countenance he might know what to ex-r 
pefl:, viz. Whether they wer^ ftill in heart to fight, 
or were fo heartily beaten, as to be difpirited and dif« 
couraged, and fo he might manage accordingly. 

This ftratagem took ; for, as foon as the favages 
heard the firft gun, and faw the flalh of the fecond, 
they ftarted up upon their feet in the greateft con- 
Iternation imaginable ; and, as our men advanced 
fwiftly towards them, they all ran fcreaming and 
yawling away, with a kind of an howling noife, 
which our men did not underftand, and had never 
heard before j and thus they ran up the hills into the 
country. 

At firft, our men had much rather the weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to fea ; but 
they did not then confider, that this might probably 
have been the occafion of their coming again in fuch 

multi-

multitudes as not to be refifted; or, at leaft, to 
come fo many and fo often, as would quite defol ate 
the ifland, and ftarve them: Will Atkins thereforey 
who^ notwithftanding his wound, kept always with 
them, proved the beft counfellor in this cafe : his 
advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and 
clap in between them and their boats, and fo deprive 
them of the capacity of ever returning any more to 
plague the ifland. 

They confulted long about this, and fpme were 
agaiiift it, for fear of making the wretches fly into 
the woods, and live there defperate ; and fo they 
flioald have them to hunt like wild beafts^, be afraid 
to ftir about their bufinefs, and have their plantation 
continually riSed, all their tame goats deftroyed, 
and, in fliort, be reduced to a life of continual 
. diftrcfs, 

WHl Atkins told them, they had better have to do 
xsrith ioo men, than with 100 nations ; that as they 
muft deftroy their boats, fo they muft deftroy the 
men -J or be all of them deftroyed themfelves. In a 
"word, he Ihewed them the neceflity of it fo plainly, 
that they all came into it j fo they went to work im» 
mediately with the boats, and, getting fome dry . 
wood together from a dead tree, they tried to fet 
fome of them on fire; but they were fo wet^ that 
they would fcarce burn. However, the fire fp burned 
the upper part, that it foon made them unfit for 
fwimming in thcNfea as boats. When the Indians faw 
what they were about, fome of them came running 
out of the woods ; and coming as near as they could 
to our men, kneeled down and cried, 0^, 0^, Wa- 
Vol. II. I ramokoa^ 



114 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ramokoa^ and fome other words of their language, 
which none of the others underftood any thing of; 
but as they made pitiful geftures, and ftrange noifes, 
it was eafy to underftand they begged to have their 
boats fpared, and that they would be gone, , and ne- 
ver return thither again. 

But our men were now fatisfied, that they had no 
way to preferve themfelves, or to fave their colony, 
but eflfedlually to prevent any of thefe people from 
ever going home again ; depending upon this, that 
if ever fo much as one of them got back into their 
country to tell the ftory, the colony was undone ; fo 
that, letting them know that they {hould not have 
any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and 
deftroyed them every one that the ftorm had not de- 
ftroyed before ; at the fight of which, the favages 
raifed a hideous cry in the woods, which our people 
heard plain enough ; after which they ran about the 
ifland like diftrafted men ; fo that, in a word, our 
men did not really know at firft what to do with 
them. 

Nor did the Spaniards y with all their prudence, 
confider that while they made thofe people thus def- 
perate, they ought to have kept good guard at the 
fame time upon their plantations ; for though it is 
true they had driven away their cattle, and the i«- 
dians did not find their main retreat, I mean my old 
caftle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley ; yet 
they found out my plantation, at the "bower, and 
pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and plant- 
ing about it J trod all the corn under foot ; tore up 
the vines and grapes, being juft then almoft ripe ; 
and did oui men an ineftimable damage,^ though',

to themfelves, liot one farthing's worth of fer- 
vice. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all 
occafions, yet they were in no condition to purfue 
them, or hunt them up and down ; for as they were 
two nimble of foot for our men when they found 
them fingle, fo our men durft not go about fingle, 
for fear of being furrounded with their numbers ; 
the bed was, they had no weapons ; for though they 
had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any mate- 
rials to make any, nor had they any edged tool or 
weapon among them. 

The extremity and diftrefs they were reduced to 
was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the fame 
time our men were alfo brought to very hard cir- 
cumftances by them ; for though their retreats were 
preferved, yet their provifion was deftroyed, and 
their harveft fpoiled ; and what to do, or which way 
to turn themfelves, they knew not ; the only refuge 
they had now was, the (lock of cattle they had in the 
valley by the cave, and fome little corn which grew 
there. The three Englijhmen^ William Atkins and 
his comrades, were now reduced to two, one of 
them being killed by an arrowj which ftruck him 
on the fide of his head, juft under the temples, fo 
that he never fpoke more ; and it was very remark- 
able, that this was the fame barbarous fellow who 
f ut the poor favage flave with his hatchet, and who 
afterwards intended to have murdered the Spa* 
niards. 

I looked upon their cafe to have been worfe at this 
time than mine was at any time after I firft difco- 
vered the grains of barley and rice, and got into the

method of planting and raifing my corn, and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may fay, an 
hundred wolves upon the ifland, which would de- 
vour every thing they could come at, yet could be 
very hardly come at themfelves. 

The firft thing they concluded, when they faw 
what their circumftances were, was, that they would, 
if poflible, drive them up to tHe farther part of the 
ifland, fouth-eaft, that if any more favages came on 
fhore, they might not find one another } then, that 
they would daily hunt and harrafs them, and kill is 
many of them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced their number ; and if they could at laft tame 
them, and bring them to any thing, they would 
give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and 
live upon their daily labour. 

In order to this, they followed them, and fo ter- 
rified them with their guns, that in a few days, if 
any of them fired a gun at an Indian^ if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for fear ; and fa 
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of 
fight farther and farther, till at laft our men follow- 
ing them, and every day almoft killing and Nvound- 
ing fome of them, they kept up in the woods and 
hollow places fo much, that it reduced them to the 
utmoft mifery for want of food ; and many were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any 
hurt, but merely ftarved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their heart? 
relent, and pity moved them ; efpecially the Spaniard 
governor, who was the moft gentleman-like, gene- 
rous minded man that eve» I met with in my life ; 
and he propofed, if poflible, to take one of them

alive, and bring him to underftand what they meant, 
fo far as to be able to zQt as interpreter, and to go 
among them, and fee if they might be brought to 
fome conditions, that might be depended upon, to 
fave their lives, and do us no fpoil. 

It was fonne time before any of them could be 
taken; but being weak, and half-ftarved, one of 
them was at laft furprifed, and made a prifoner ; he 
was fullen at firft, and would neither eat nor drink ; 
but finding himfelf kindly ufed, and vLftuals given 
him, and no violence offered him, he at laft: grew 
tradable, and came to himfelf. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked of- 
ten with him, and told him how kind the others 
would be to them all ; that they would not only fave 
their lives, but would give them a part of -the ifland 
to live in, provided they would give fatisfaftion ; 
that they {hould keep in their own bounds, and not 
come beyond them, to injure or prejudice others ; 
and that they fhould have corn given them, to plant 
and make it grow for their bread, and fome bread 
given them for their prefent fubfiftence ; and old 
Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the reft of 
his countrymen, and hear what they faid to it ; af- 
furing them, that if they did not agree immediately 
they fhould all be deftroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re- 
duced in number to about thirty-feven, clofed with 
the propofal at the firft offer, and begged to have 
fome food given them ; upon which twelve Spaniards 
and two Englijhjnen^ well armed, and three Indian 
fiaves, and old Friday^ marched to the place where 
they were j the three' ^ Indian flaves earned them a

large quantity, of bread, and fome rice boiled up to 
cakes, and dried in the fun, and three live goats ; 
and they were ordered to go to the fide of an hill, 
where they fat down, eat the proviRons very thank- 
fully, and were the moft faithful fellows to their 
words that could be thought of; for, except when 
they came to beg victuals and direftions, they never 
came out of their bounds ; and there they lived when 
I came to the ifland, and I went to fee them. 

They had taught them both to plant corn, make 
bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they want- 
ed nothing but wives, and they foon would have 
been a nation : they were confined to a neck of land, 
furrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying 
plain towards the fea before them, on the fouth-eaft 
corner of the ifland ; they had land enough, and it 
was very good and fruitful ; for they had a piece of 
land about a mile and a lialf broad, and three or 
four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden fpades, 
fuch as I made for myfelf ; and gave among them 
twelve hatchets, and three or four knives ; and there 
they lived the moft fubjeded innocent creatures that 
were ever heard of. ' 

After this the colony enjoyed a perfeft tranquillity, 
with refpefl: to the favages, till I came to re-vifit them, 
which was in about two years ; not but that now 
and then fome canoes of favages came on fhorefor 
their triumphal, unnatural feafts ; but as they were 
of feveral nations, and, perhaps, had never heard 
of thofe that came before, or the reafon of it, they 
did not make any fearch or enquiry after their country- 
men}

men ; andjf they had, it would have been very hard 
for them to have fourid them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full accourit of all 
that happened to them, to my return, at leaft, that 
was worth notice. The Indians, or favages, were 
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently , 
went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death, 
any of the Indians coming to them, becaufe they 
would not have their fettlement betrayed again. 

One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they 
taught the favages to make wicker-work, or bafkets ; 
but they foon out-^did their mafter.s j for they made 
abundance of moft ingenious things in wicker-work ; 
particularly, all forts of bafkets, fieves, bird cages, 
cup-boards, &c. as alfo chairs to fit on, ftools, beds, 
couches, and abundance of other things, being very 
ingenious at fuch work, when they were once put in 
the way of it. .. 

My coming was a particular relief to thefe people, 
becaufe we furnifhed them with knives, fciffars, fpades, . 
fliovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which 
they could want. 

With the help of thefe tools they were fo very 
handy, that they came, at laft, to build up their huts, 
or houfes, very handfomely ; raddling, or working 
it up like baiket-work all the way round, which was 
a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
very odd; but was an exceeding good fence, as well 
againfl heat, as againft all forts of vermin ; and our 
men were fo taken with it, that they got the wild fa- 
vages to come and do the like for them ; fo that when 
I came to fee the two Englijh?nen\ colonies, they 
looked, at a diflance, as if they lived all like bees in 
I 4 a hive J 



120 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

a hive ; and as for Will AtkiiiSj who was now be- 
come a very induftrious, neceflary, and fober fellow, 
he had made himfelf fuch a tent of bafket-work, as 
I believe was never feen. It was 1 20 paces round on 
the outfide, as I meafured by my fteps ; the walls 
were as clofe worked as a baflvet, in pannels or 
fquares, thirty-two in number, and very ftrong, (land- 
ing about feven feet high : in the middle was ano- 
ther not above 22 paces round, but built ftronger, 
being eight fquare in its form, and in the eight cor- 
ners flood eight very ftrong pofts, round the top of 
which he laid ftrong pieces, joined together with 
wooden pins, from which he raifed a pyramid before 
the roof of eight rafters, very handfome, I affure 
you, and joined together very well, though he had 
no nails, and only a few iron fpikes, which he had 
made himfelf too, out of the old iron that I had left 
there ; and, indeed, this fellov/ fhewed abundance 
of ingenuity in feveral things which he had no know- 
ledge of; he made himfelf a forge, with a pair of 
wooden bellows to blow the fire ; he made himfelf 
charcoal for his work, and he fo'rmed out of one of 
the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer up- 
on ; in this manner he made many things, but efpe- 
cially hooks, ftaples and fpikes, bolts and hinges. 
But to return to the houfe ; after he pitched the roof 
of his innermoft tent, he worked it up between the 
rafters with bafket-work. To firm, and thatched that 
over again fo ingenioufly with rice ftraw, and over 
that a large leaf of a tree, which covered .the top, 
that hk houfe was as dry as if it had been tiled or 
Hated. Indeed he owned that the favages made the 
bafliet-work for him. 

The 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all 
round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay 
from the 32 angles to the top pofts of the inner 
houfe. Toeing about twenty feet dillant ; fo that there 
was a fpace like a walk within the outer wicker- wall, 
and without the inner, near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the fanle 
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided into fix 
apartments, for that he had fix rooms on a floor, 
and out of every one of thefe there was a door ; firft, 
into ' the entry, or coming into the main tent ; and 
another door into the fpace or walk that was round 
it ; fo that this walk was alfo divided into fix equal 
parts, which ferved not only for a retreat, but to 
ftore up any neceflaries which the family had occafion 
for. Thefe fix fpaces not taking up the whole cir- 
cumference, what other apartments the outer circle 
had, were thus ordered : as foon as you were in at 
the door of the outer circle, you had a (hort paflage 
ftraight before you to the door of the inner houfe ; but 
on either fide was a wicker partition, and a door in 
it, by which you went, firft, into a large room or 
ftore-houfe, 20 feet wide, and about 30 feet long, 
and through that into another not quite fo long : fo 
that in the outer circle were ten handfome rooms, 
fix of which were only to be come at through the 
apartments- of the inner tent, and ferved as clofets or 
retired rooms to the refpcftive chambers of the inner 
circle ; and four large warehoufes or barns, or what 
you pleafe to ball them, which went in through one 
another, two on either hand of the paflage that led 
through the outer door to the inner tent. 

Such 



122 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Such a piece of baflvct-work, I believe, was never 
feen in the world ; nor an houfe or tent fo neatly 
contrived, much lefs fo built : in this great bee-hive 
lived the three families ; that is to fay, Will Atkins, 
and his companions ; the third was killed, but his 
wife remained with three children ; for (he was, it 
feems, big with child when he died ; and the other 
two were not at all backward to give the widow her 
full fhare of every thing, I mean, as to their corn, 
milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or 
found a turtle on the fliore; fo that they all lived well 
enough, though it was true, they were not fo induf- 
trious as the other two, as has been obferved -already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that, 
as for religion, I don't know that there was any 
thing of that kind among them ; they pretty often, 
indeed, put one another in mind, that there was a 
God, by the very common method of feamen, viz. 
fwearing by his name ; nor were their poor, igno^ 
rant favage wives much the better for having been 
married to Chrijiians, as we muft call them ; for as 
they knew very little of God themfelves, fo they 
were utterly incapable of entering into any difcourfe 
with their wives about a God, or to talk any thing 
to them concerning religion. 

The utmoft of all the improvement which I can fay 
the wives had made from them, was, that they had 
taught them to fpeak EngUjh pretty well ; and all the 
children they had, which were near twenty in all, 
were taught to fpeak EngUJh too, from their firft 
learning to fpeak, though they at firft fpoke it 
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There 
were none of thofe children above fix years old 
when I came thither j for it was not much above 

feveu 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 12^ 

feven years that they had fetched thefe five favage 
ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for 
they had all children, more or lefs : I think the cook's 
mate's wife was big of her fixth child ; and the mo- 
thers were all a good fort of well governed, quiet, labo- 
rious women, modeft and decent, helpful to one an-, 
other, mighty obfervant and fubjeft to their mafters, 
I cannot call them hufbands ; and wanted nothing 
but to be well inftrufted in the Chrijiian religion, 
and to be legally married ; both which were happily 
brought about afterwards by my means, or, at leaft, 
by the confequence of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five runagade Eng^ ' 
lijhmen^ I muft fay fomething of the Spaniards j who 
were the main body of the family j and in whofe 
ftory there are fome incidents alfo remarkable 
enough. 

I had a great many difcourfes with them about 
their circumftances, when they were among the fa- 
vages : they told me readily, that they had no in- 
ftances to give of their application or ingenuity in 
that country ; that they were a poor, miferable, de- 
jected handful of people ; that if means had been put 
into their hands, they had yet fo abandoned them- 
felves to defpair, and fo funk under the weight of 
their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but 
flarving. One of them, a grave and' very fenfible 
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the 
wrong ; that it was not the part of wife men to give 
up themfelves to their mifery, but always to take hold 
of the helps which reafon offered, as well for prefent 
fupport, as for future deliverance j he told me, that 

^ricf 



114 ^I^E AND ADVENTURES 

grief was the moft fenfelefs, infignificant paffion in 
the world ; for that it regarded only things paft, 
which were generally impoffible to be recalled or to 
be remedied, but had no view to things to come, 
and had no fhare in any thing that looked like deli- 
verance, but rather added to the afflidion than pro- 
pofed a remedy ; and upon this, he repeated a Spa- 
nijh proverb ; which, though I cannot repeat in juft 
the fame words that he fpoke it, yet I remember I 
made it into an EngliJI^ prpverb of my own, thus : 
In trouble to be troubled^ 
Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He then ran on in remarks upon all the little Im- 
provements I had made in my folitude ; my unwea- 
ried application, as he called it, and how I had made 
a condition, which, in its circumftances, was at firft 
much worfe than their's, a thoufand times more 
happy than their's was, even now, when they were 
altogether : he told me, it was remarkable, that 
Englijhmen had a greater prefence of mind, in their 
diftrefs, than any people that ever he met with j that 
their unhappy nation, and tl\e Portuguefe^ were the 
worfl men in the world to ftruggle with misfortunes j 
for that their firft ftep in dangers, after common 
efforts are over, was always to defpair, lie down un- 
der it and die,^ without roufing their thoughts up to 
proper remedies for efcape. 

I told him, their cafe and mine differed exceed- 
ingly ; that they were caft upon the fhore without 
neceffaries, without fupply of food, or of prefent 
fuftenance, till they could provide it : that it is true, I 
had this difadvantage and difcomfoit, that I was 
alone ; but then the fupplies I had providentially 

thrown 



OF ROBINSO>r CRUSOE. \2§ 

thrown into my hands, by the unexpeded driving of 
the Ihip on fhore, was fuch a help as would have en- 
couraged any creature in the world to have applied 
himfelf as I had done : Seignior » fays the Spaniard^ 
had we poor Spaniards been in your cafe, we fliould 
never have gotten half thofe things out of the fhip 
as you did : ^nay, fays he, we fhould never have found 
means to have gotten a raft to carry them, or to 
have gotten a raft on fhore without boat or fail ; and 
how much lefs Ihould we have done, faid he, if any 
of us had been alone ! Well, I defired him to abate 
his compliment, and go on with the hiftory of 
their coming on fhore, where they landed : he told 
me, they unhappily landed at a place where there 
were people without provifions j whereas, had they had 
the common fenfe to have put off to fea again, and 
gone to another ifland a little farther, they had found 
provifions, though without people ; there being an 
ifland that way, as they had been told, where there 
were provifions, though no people \ that is to fay, 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been 
there, and filled the ifland with goats and hogs at 
feveral times ; where they have bred in fuch multi- 
tudes, and where turtle and fea fowls were in fuch 
plenty, that they could have been in no want of 
flefh, though they had found no bread; whereas 
here they were only fuflained with a few roots and 
herbs, which they underflood not, and which had 
no fubflance in them, and which the inhabitants gave 
them fparingly enough, and who could treat them 
no better, unlefs they would turn canibals, and eat 
men's flefh, which was the great dainty of the 
country. 

They 



125 LltE AND ADVENTURES 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
ftrove to civilize the favages they were with, and to 
teach them rational cuftoms in the ordinary way of 
living J but in vain : and how they retorted it upon 
them, as unjuft, that they, who came thither for 
affiftance and fupport, (hould attempt to fet up for 
inftrufltors of thofe that gave them bread ; intimat- 
ing, it feems, that none fhould fet up for the in- 
flruftors of others, but thofe who could live without 
them. 

They gave me difmal accounts of the extremities 
they were driven to ; how fometimes they were ma- 
ny days without any food at all ; the ifland they were 
upon being inhabited by a fort of favages that lived 
more indolent, and, for that reafon, were lefs fup- 
plied with the neceffaries of life, than they had rea- 
fon to believe others were in the fame part of the 
world; and yet they found that thefe favages were 
lef& ravenous and voracious, than thofe who had 
better fupplies of food. 

Alfo they added, that they could not but fee with 
what demonftrations of wifdom and goodnefs, the 
governing Providence of God direfts the event of 
things in the world ; which, they faid, appeared in 
their circumflances ; for if, preffed by the hardfhips 
they were under, and the bariennefs of the country 
where they were, they had fearched after a better 
place to live in, they had then been out of the way 
of the relief that happened to them by my means. 

Then they gave me an account, how the favages^ 
whom they lived among, expefted them to go out 
with them into their wars ; and it was true, that, as 
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the 

difafter

difaftet to lofe their ammunition, they fliould not 
have been ferdceable only to their friends, but have 
made themfelves terrible both to friends and enemies ; 
but being without powder and (hot, and in a con- 
dition, that they could not in reafon deny to go out 
with their landlords to their wars ; when they came 
in the field of battle, they were in a worfe condition 
than the favages themfelves ; for they neither had 
bows nor arrows, nor could they ufe thofe the fa- 
vages gave them ; fo that they could do nothing but 
ftand ftill, and be wounded with arrows, till they 
came up to the teeth of their enemy ; and then, in- 
deed, the three halberts they had were of ufe to 
them ; and they would often drive a whole little 
army before them, with thofe halberts and fliarpened 
fticks put into the muzzles of their mulkets : but 
that for all this, they were fometimes furrounded 
with multitudes, and in great danger from their ar- 
rows ; till at laft they found the way to make them- 
felves large targets of wood, which they covered 
with fkins of wild beafts, whofe names they knew 
not ; and thefe covered them from the arrows of the 
favages ; that, notwithftanding thefe, they were 
fometimes in great danger, and were once five of 
them knocked down together, with the clubs of the 
favages, which was the time when one of them was 
taken prifoner, that is to fay, the Spaniard whom I 
had relieved : That at .firft they thought he had been 
killed, but when afterwards they heard he was taken 
prifoner, they were under the greateft grief imagi- 
nable, and would willingly have all ventured their 
lives to have refcued him. 

Th^y 



128 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

They told me, that when they were fo knocked 
down, the reft of their company refcued them, and 
ftood over them fighting, till they were come to them- 
felves, all but he who they thought had been dead ; 
and then they made their way with their halberts and 
pieces, ftanding clofe together in a line, through a 
body of above a thoufand favages, beating down all 
that came in their way, got the viftory over their 
enemies, but to their great forrow, becaufe it was 
with the lofs of their friend ; whom the other party, 
finding him alive, carried off with fome others, as 
I gave an account in my former. 

They defcribed moft affedionately, how they were 
furprifed with joy at the return of their friend and 
companion in mifery, who they thought had been de- 
voured by wild beafts of the worft of kind, viz. by 
wild men ; and, yet how more and more they were 
furprifed with the account he gave them of his er- 
rand, and that there was a Chrijiian in a place near, 
much more one that was able, and had humanity 
enough to contribute to their deliverance. 

They defcribed how they were aftonifhed at the 
fight of the relief I fent them, and at the appear- 
ance of loaves of bread, things they had not feen 
fmce their coming to that miferable place ; how often 
they crofled it, and bleffed it as bread fent from 
Heaven ; and what a reviving cordial it was to their 
fpirits to tafte it ; as alfo, of the other things .1 had 
fent for their fupply. And, after all, they would 
have told me fomething of the joy they were in at 
the fight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to 
the perfon and place, from whence all thefe new 
comforts came j but they told me, it was impoffible 

to 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOS. Il^ 

to €xprefs it by words ; for their exceffive joy driv- 
ing them to unbecoming extravagancies, they had 
no way to defcribe them, but by telling me, that 
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give 
vent to their paffion, fuitable to the fenfe that was 
upon them ; that in fome it worked one way, and 
in fome s^nother ; and that fome of them, through a 
furprife of joy, would burft out into tears ; others be 
half mad, ?ind others immediately faint. This dif- 
courfe extremely affedled me, and called to my mind 
Frida/s extacy, when he met his father, and the 
poor people's extacy, when I took them up at fea, 
after their fliip was on fire ; the mate of the fhip's 
joy, when he found himfelf delivered in the place 
where he expefted to perifh ; and my own joy, when 
after twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good 
Ihip ready to carry me to my own country : All 
thefe things made me more fenfible of the relatio^i % 
of thefe poor men, and more affeSed with it. 

Having thus given a view of the ftate of 
as I found them, I muft relate the heads of wh^^]^^ 
did for thefe people, and the condition in whi^i^ 
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, tbat-vf 
they would be troubled no more with the favages ; 9^;* 
that, if they were, they would be able to cut theq; ' 
off, if they were twice as many as before ; fo th^tt 
they had no concern about that. Then I entered » 
into a ferious difcourfe with the Spaniard^ whom I 
called governor, about their flay in the ifland ; for^ 
as I was not come»to carry any of them off,, fo it 
would not be juft to carry off fome, and leave others, 
who perhaps would be unwilling to ftay if their 
ftrength was diminifhed.

On the other hand, I told them, I came to efta- 
blifh them there, not to remove them; and then 
I let them know, that I had brought with me re- 
lief of fundry kinds for them : That I had been 
at a great charge to fupply them with all things ne- 
ceffary, as well for their convenience, as their de- 
fence ; and that I had fuch particular perfons with 
me, as well to increafe and recruit their number, as 
by the particular neceflary employments which they 
were bred to, being artificers, to affift them in thofe 
things, in which, at prefent, they were to feek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; 
and before I delivered to them the ftores I had 
brought, I afked them, one by one, if they had en* 
tirely forgot and buried the firll animofities that had 
been among them, and could (hake hands with one 
another, and engage in a ftrid friendfhip, and union 
of intereft, fo that there might be no more n;iifun- 
derfttndings or jealoufies. 

William Atkins^ with abundance of franknefs and 
gbod-humour, faid, They had met with affliftions 
enough to make them ail fober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends : That, for his part, he 
would live and die with them ; and was fo far from 
difigning any thing againft the Spaniardsy that, he 
owned, they had done nothing to him but what his 
own bad humour made neceffary, and what he would 
have done, and, perhaps, much worfe, in thdr cafe ; 
and that he would a(k them pardon, if I defired it, 
for the foolifli and brutifh things he had done to 
them ; and was very willing and defirous of living 
on terms of entire friendfliip and union with them; 
and would do anything that lay in his power to con- 
vince 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

vince them of it : and as for going to England^ 
he cared not if he did not go thither thefe twenty- 
years. 

The Spaniards faid, they had, indeed, at firft, 
difarmed and excluded William Atkins^ and his two 
countrymen, for their ill conduft, as they had let 
me know : And they appealed to me, for the ne. 
ceffity they were under to do fo ; h\\t.i\i3X William 
Atkins had behaved himfelf fo bravely in the great 
fight they had with the favages, and on feveral occa- 
fions fince, and had (hewed himfelf fo faithful to, 
and concerned for the general interefl: of them all, 
that they had forgotten all that was paft, and thought 
he merited as much to be trufted with arms, and 
fupplied with neceflaries, as any of them ; and that 
they had teftified their fatisfaftion in him, by com- 
mitting the command to him, next to the governor 
himfelf; and as they had an entire confidence in 
him, and all his countrymen, fo they acknowledged, 
they had merited that confidence, by all the methods 
that honeft men could merit to be valued and trufted : 
and they moft heartily embraced the occafion of 
giving me this affurance, that they would never have 
any intereft feparate from one another. 

Upon thefe frank and open declarations of frietfd- 
fliip, we appointed the next day to dine all together; 
and indeed, we made a fplendid feaft : I caufed the 
Ihip's cook and his mate to come on fhore, and drefs 
our dinner ; and the old cook's mate we had on 
Ihore, affifted. We brought on fhore fix pieces of 
good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the 
Ihip's provifion, with our punch bowl, and mate-

rials to fill it ; and, in particular, I gave them ten 
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of Englijb 
beer ; things that neither the Spaniards j or the 
Englijhmeny had tafted for many years ; and which, 
it may be fuppofed^ they were exceeding glad 
of. 

The Spaniards added to our feafl: five whole kids, 
which the cooks roafted ; and three of them were 
fent, covered up clofe, on board our fhip to the fea- 
men, that they might feaft on frefli meat from on 
ihore, as we did with their fait meat from on 
board. 

After this feaft, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods^ wherein, 
that there might be no difpute about dividing, I 
fhewed them that there was fufficient for them all ; 
and defired, that they might all take an equal quan- 
tity of the goods that were for wearing ; that is to 
fay, equal when made up. As firft, I diftributed 
linen fufficient to make every one of them four 
ihirts; and, at the Spaniard's requeft, afterwards 
made them up fix ; thefe were exceeding comforta- 
ble to them, having been what, as I may fay, they 
had long fince forgot the ufe of, or what it was to 
wear them. 

I allotted the thin Englijh fluffs, which I mentioned 
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock, 
which I judged fitteft for the heat of the feafon, cool 
and loofe ; and ordered, that whenever they de* 
cayed, they fhould make more, as they thought 
fit : The like for pumps, flioes, ftockings, and 
hats, &^^. 

I cannot 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I33 

I cannot exprefs what pleafure, what fatisfadion, 
fat upon the countenances of all thefe poor men^ 
when they faw the care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had fumiflied them : they told me, I was 
a father to them ; and that, having fuch a corref- 
pondent as I was, in fo remote a part of the world, 
it would make them forget that they were leit in a 
defolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged 
to me, not to leave the place without my con- 
fent. 

Then I prefented to them the people I had brought 
with me ; particularly the taylor, the fmithi and the 
two carpenters, all of them mod neceffary people ; 
but above alj, my general artificer, than whom they 
could not name any thing that was more needful to 
them ; and the taylor, to fhew his .concern for them, 
went to work immediately, and with my leave, made 
them every one a fhirt the firft thing he did ; and, 
which was ftill more, he taught the women not only 
how to fow and flitch, and ufe the needle, but made 
them affift to make the fhirts for their hulbands^ and 
for all the reft. 

As for tl>e carpenters, I fcarce need mention how 
ufeful they were, for they took in pieces all my clumr 
fy, unhandy .things, and made them clever, cpnver 
nient tables, ftools, bedfteads, cupboards, lockers, 
flielves, and every thing they wanted of that kind. » 

But, to let them fee ,how nature made artificers a)L 
firft, I carried the carpenters to fee William Jtkim'^ 
balket-houfe, as I called it ; and they both owned, 
they never faw an inftance of fuch natural ingenuity 
Jbefore j nor any thing fo regular, and fo handily

built, at lead of its kind : and one of them, when 
he faw it, after mufing a good while, turning about 
tome, I am fure, fays he, that man has no need of 
us ; you need do nothing but give him tools. 

Then I brought them out all my (lore of tools, 
and gave every man a digging fpade, a fhovel, and 
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs ; and, to 
every feparate place, a pick-axe, a crow, a broad-axe, 
^nd a faw ; always appointing, that as often as any 
were broken, or worn out, they fliould be fupplied, 
without grudging, out of the general ftores that I left 
behind. 

Nails, ftaples, hinges, hammers, chifTels, knives, 
fciifars, and all forts of tools and iron- work, they 
had without tale, as they required ; for no man 
«vould care to take more than they wanted ; and he 
mud be a fool that would vv afte or fpoil them, on any 
account whatever : And for the ufe of the fmith, I 
left two jtons of unwrought iron for a fupply. 

My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought 
them, was fuch even to profufion, that they could 
not but rejoice at thenl ; for now they could march 
as I ufed to do, with a mufket upon each fhoulder, 
if there was occafion ; and were able to fight looo 
favages, if they had but fome little advantages of 
fituation; which alfo they could not mifs of, if they 
had occafion^ 

' I carried on fliore with me the young man whofe 
mother was ftarved to death, and the maid alfo ; fhe 
was a fober, well-educated, religious young woman, 
and behaved fo inbffenfively, that every one gave her a 
good word :^ She had, indeed, an unhappy life with 
us,' there being no woman in the Ihip but herfelf ;

but {he bore it with patience. After a while, feeing 
things fo well ordered, and in fo fine a way of thriv- 
ing upon my ifland, and confidering that they had 
neither bulinefs or acquaintaBce in the Eajl Indies^ 
or reafon for taking fo long a voyage; I fay, con- 
fidering all this, both of them came to me, andde- 
fired I would give them leave to remain on the 
ifland, and be entered among my family, as they 
called it. 

I agreed to it readily ; and they had a little plot 
of ground allotted to them^ w here they had three 
tents or houfes fet up, furrounded with a baflcet- 
work, palifaded Uke Atkins" %^ and adjoining to his 
plantation ; their tents xvere contrived fo, that they 
had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, and a 
middle tent, like a great ftore-houfe, to lay all their 
goods in, and to eat and drink in: And now the 
other two Englijhmen moved their habitation to the 
fame place ; and fo^ the ifland was divided into three 
colonies, and no more ; viz. The Spaniards^ with 
old Friday^ and the firfl fervants, at my old habita- 
tion under the hill, which was, in a word, the ca- 
pital city, and where they had fo enlarged and ex- 
tended their works, as well under as on the out-fide 
of the hill, that they livedo though perfeftly conceal- 
ed, yet full at large. Never was there fuch a little 
city in a wood, and fo hid, I believe, in any part of 
the world : For, I verily believe, looo men might 
have ranged the ifland a month, and^ if they had 
not known there was fuch a thing, and looked on 
purpofe for it, they would not have found it ; for 
the trees flood fo thick, and fo clofe, and .grew fo 
fafl matted into one another, that nothing but cutting

I tcld hirri, his carriage \;^a5 fc modell, that I could 
not but achnoTvIedge it ; that it was true, we were 
fuch peopk as they call heredcs ; but that he was 
not the firit Caihoiic that I hsd converfed with, widi- 
out falling into any inconvenienclcs, or carrying the 
queftions to any height in debate ; that he (hould not 
find himfelf the worfe ufed for being of a diflferent 
opinion from us ; and if we did not converfc with- 
out any diCike on either fide, upon that fcore, it 
would be his fault, not ours. 

He replied. That he thought our converfation 
might be eafily feparated from difputes ; that it was 
not his bufinefs to cap principles with every man he 
difcourfed with ; and that he rather defired me to 
converfe with him as a gentleman^ than as a religieux ; 
that if I would give him leave, at any time, to dif- 
courfe upon religious fubjefts, he would readily 
comply with it ; and that then he did not doubt but 
I would allow him alfo to defend his own opinions, 
as well as he could : but that, without my leave, he 
would not break in upon me with any fuch thing. 
. He told me farther, that he would not ceafe'^to do 
all that became him in his office, as a prieft, as well 
as a private Chriftian, to procure the goods of the 
fliip, and the fafety of all that was in her ; and 
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and

he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all occafions. In 
this manner we converfed ; and, as he was of a moft 
obliging gentleman-like behaviour, fo he was, if I 
may be allowed to fay fo, a man of good fenfe, 
and, as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a moft diverting account of his life, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it; of 
many adventures which had befallen him in the few 
years that he had been abroad in the world, and par- 
ticularly this was very remarkable ; viz. That during 
the voyage he was now engaged in, he had the mis- 
fortune to be five times fhipped and unlhipped, and 
never to go to the place whither any of the Ihips he 
was in Were at firft defigned : That his firft intent 
was, to have gone to Martinico ; and that he went 
on board a fhip bound thither at St. Makes ; but 
being forced into Lijbon in bad weather, the fliip 
received fome damage, by running aground in the 
mouth of the river Tagusy and was obliged to un- 
load her cargo there : That finding 2i Portuguefe fhip 
there, bound to the Madeiras^ and ready to fail, and 
fuppofing he fhould eafily meet with a veffel there 
bound to Martinico^ he went on board, in order to 
fail to the Madeiras ; but the matter of the Poriu^ 
guefe Ihip, being but an indifferent mariner, had 
been out in his reckoning, and they drove to iv^/; 
where, however, he happened to find a very good 
market for his cargo, which was corn ; and there- 
fore refolded not to go to the Madeiras^ but to load 
fait at the IJle of May^ to go away to Newfoundland : 
He had no remedy in the exigence, but to go with 
.the Ihip J and had a pretty good voyage as far as the 

Banks ^ 



140 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Banks J (fo they call the place where they catch the 
fifti) where meeting with a French fhip bound from 
France to ^ebec^ in the river of Canada^ and from 
thence to MartinicOj to carry provifions, he thought 
he fhould have an opportunity to complete his firft 
defign : But when he came to ^ebec^ the mafter of 
the (hip died, and the fhip proceeded no farther : So 
the next voyage he (hipped himfelf for France^ in the 
fliip that was burnt, when we took them up at fea, 
and then fhipped them with us for the Ea/i Indie^y 
as I have already faid. Thus he had ' been difap- 
pointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one 
voyage, befides what I (hall have occafion to men- 
tion farther of the fame perfon. 

But I fhall not make digreffions into other men's 
(lories, which have no relation to my own. I return 
to what concerns our affair in the ifland : He came 
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the 
while we were upon the ifland ; and it happened to 
be juft when I was going to vifit the Englijhmen^^ co^ 
lony, at the fartheft part of the ifland ; I fay, he 
came to me, and told me, with a very grave coun- 
tenance, that he had, for two or three days, defired 
an opportunity of fome difcourfe with me, which, 
he hoped, would not be difpleafing to me, becaufe 
he thought it might, in fome meafure, correfpond 
with my general defign, which was the profperity 
of my new colony ; and, perhaps, might put it, at 
leafl:, more than he yet thought it was, in the way 
of GoD^s bleffing. 

I looked a little furprized at the lafl part of his 
difcourfe ; and turning a little (hort. How, Sir, faid 
J, can it be faid, that we are not in the way of God*s 

blefling, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* I4I 

bleffing, after fuch vifible affiftances, and wonderful 
deliverances, as we have feen here, and of which I 
have given you a large account ? 

If you had pleafed. Sir, faid he, (with a world 
of modefty, and yet with great readinefs) to have 
heard me, you would have, found no room to have 
been difpleafed, much lefs to think fo hard of me 
that I fhould fuggeft, that you have not had won- 
derful affiftances and deliverances : And, I hope, on 
your behalf, that you arc in the way of God's 
bleffing, and your defign is exceeding good, and will 
profper. But^ Sir, faid he, though it were more fo, 
than is even poffible to you, yet there maybe fome 
among you that are not equally right in their adions: 
And you know, that in the ftory of Ifrael^ one 
Achan^ in the camp, removed God's bleffing from 
them, and turned his hand fo againft them, that 
thirty-fix of them, though not concerned in the 
crime, were the objefts of divine vengeance, and 
bore the weight of that punifliment. 

I was fenfibly touched with this difcourfe ; and 
told him his inference was fo juft, and the whole 
defign feemed fo fincere, and was really fo religious 
in its own nature, that I was very forry I had inter- 
rupted him ; and begged him to go on : And, in the 
mean time, becaufe it feemed, that what we had both 
to fay, might take up fome time, I told him I was 
going to the Englijhman^ plantation, and aflced him 
to go with me, and we might difcourfe of it by the 
way : He told me, he would more willingly wait on 
me thither, becaufe there, partly, the thing was 
afted, which he <lefired to fpeak to me about : So 

we 



142 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we walked on, and I preffed him to be free and 
plain with me, in what he had to fay. 

Why then. Sir, fays he, be pleafed to give me 
leave to lay down a few propofitions, as the founda- 
tion of what I have to fay, that we may not differ In 
the general principles, though we may be of fome 
differing opinions in the praftice of particulars. Firft, 
Sir, though we differ in fome of the doftrinal articles 
of religion, and it is very unhappy that it is fo, ef- 
pecially in the cafe before us, as I fhall fhew after- 
wards ; yet, there are fome general principles in 
which we both agree; viz. Firft, that there is a 
God; and that this God, having given us fonve dated 
general rules for our fervice and obedience, we ought 
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either 
by neglefting to do what he has commanded, or by 
doing what he has exprefsly forbidden ; and let our 
different religions be what they will, this general 
principle is readily owned by us all ; That the blef- 
fing of God does not ordinarily follow a prefumptu- 
ous finning againfl his command ; and every good 
Chriflan will be affedionately concerned to prevent 
any that are under his care, living in a total neglefl: 
of God and his commands. It is not your men be- 
ing Proteflants, whatever my opinion may be of 
fuch, that difcharges me from being concerned for 
their fouls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before 
me, that they fhould live in as little diflance from, 
and enmity with their Maker as poffible ; efpecially 
. if you give me leave to meddle fo far in your cir. 
cuit. 

I could 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ' I43 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told 
him I granted all he had faid j and thanked him, 
that he would fo far concern himfelf for us ; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of what he 
had obferved, that, like ^ojlma^ (to tak^ his own 
parable) I might put away the accurfed thing from 
us. 

Why then, Sir, fays he, I will take the liberty 
you give me ; and there are three things, which, if 
I am right, muft (land in the way of God's bleffing 
upon your endeavours here, and which I fhould re- 
joice, for your fake, and their own, to fee removed. 
And, Sir, fays he, -I promife myfelf that you will 
fully agree with me in them all, as foon as I name 
them ; efpecially, vbecaufe I ftiall convince you, that 
every one of them may, with great eafe, and very 
much to your fatisfaftion, be remedied. 

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, 
but went on. Firft, Sir, fays he, you have here four 
EngUjhmen^ who have fetched women from among 
the favages, and have taken them as their wives, and 
have had many children by them all, and yet are not 
married to them after any dated legal manher, as 
tKe laws of God and man require ; and therefore 
are yet, in the fenfe of both, no lefs than adulterers, 
and living in adultery. To this, Sir, fays he, I 
know you will objed, that there was no clergyman, 
or priefl of any kind, or of any profeffion, to per- 
form the ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or paper, 
to write down a contraQ: of marriage, and have it 
figned between them. And I know alfo. Sir, what 
Jthe 5/^«/^r^ governor has told you ; Lmean, of the 

agreement 



J 



144 ^IPB AND ADVENTURES 

agreement that he obliged them to make when they 
took thefe women, viz. That they fhould chufe them 
out by confent, and keep feparately to them; 
which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no 
agreement with the women as wives, but only an 
agreement among themfelves, to keep them from 
quarrelling. , _ 

But, Sir, the effenee of the facrament of matri- 
mony (fo he called it, being a Roman) confifts not 
only in the mutual confent of the parties to take one 
another as man and wife, buj; in the formal and legal 
obligation that, there is in the contraft, to compel the 
man and woman, at all times, to own and acknow- 
ledge each other; obliging the man to abftain from 
all other women, to engage in no other contraft 
while thefe fubfift ; and on all occafions, as ability 
allows, to provide honeftly for them, and their chil- 
dren ; and to oblige the women to the fame, or like 
conditions, mutatis mutandis , on their fide. 

Now, Sir, fays he, thefe men may, when they 
pleafe, or when occafion prefents, abandon thefe 
women, difown their children, leave them to perifh, 
and take other women, and marry them whilfl: thefe 
are living. And here he added, with lome warmth, 
How, Sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty ? 
And hoAv Ihall a bleffing fucceed your endeavours in 
this place, however good in themfelves, and however 
fincere in your defign, while thefe men, who at pre- 
fent are your fubjefts, under your abfolute govern- 
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in 
open adultery ? 

I confefs, I was. ftruck at the thing itfelf, but 
much more with the convincing arguments he fup- 

ported 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I45 

ported It with : for it was certainly true, that though 
they had no clergyman on the fpot, yet a formal con- 
trad on both fides, made before witneffes, and con- 
firmed by any token, which they had all agreed to 
be bound by, though it had been but the breaking a 
ftick between them, engaging the men to own thefe 
women for their wives upon all occafions, and never 
to abandon them or their children, and the womea 
to the fame with their hufbands, had been an effec- 
tual lawful marriage in the fight of God j and it 
was a great neglefl: that it was not done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young 
prieft, by telling him, that all that part was done 
when I was not here ; and they had lived fo many 
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was 
pafl remedy ; they could do nothing in it now. 

Sir, fays he, afking your pardon for fuch freedom, 
you are right in this ; that it being done in your ab- 
fence, you could not be charged with that part of the 
crime. But I befeech you, flatter not yourfelf, that 
you are not therefore under an obligation to do your 
uttermoft now to put an end to it : How can you 
think, but that, let the time paft lie on whom it will, 
all the guift, for the future, will lie entirely upon 
you ? Becaufe it is certainly in your power now to 
put an end to it; and in nobody^s power but your's. 

I was fo dull ftill,' that I did not take him right ; 
but I imagined, that, by putting an end to it, he 
meant, that I fhould part them, and not fuffer then^ 
to live together any longer ; and I faid to him, I 
could not do that by any means, for that it would 
put the whole ifland in confufion. He feemed fur- 

VoL, II. L prifed 



14^ LIFE AND ADVENTURfiS 

prifed that I fliould fo far miftake him. No, Sir, 
. fays he, I do not mean that you fhould feparate them, 
but legally and efFedually marry them now : And, 
Sir, as my way of marrying may not be fo eafy to 
reconcile them to, though it will be as effeftual, even 
by your own laws ; fo your way may be as well be- 
fore God, and as valid among men ; I mean, by a 
written contraft, figned by both man and woman, 
and by all the witneffes prefent ; which all the laws 
of Europe would decree to be valid. 

I was amazed to fee fo much true piety, and fo 
much fincerity of zeal, befides the unuflial impar- 
tiality in his difcourfe, as to his own party or church, 
and fuch a true warmth for the preferving people 
that he had no knowledge of, or relation to; I fay, 
for preferving them from tranfgreffing the laws of 
God ; the like of which, I had, indeed, not met 
with any where. But recolleOiing what he had faid 
of marrying them by a written contraft, which I 
knew would ftand too, I returned it back upon him, 
and told him, I granted all that he had faid to be 
juft, and, on his part, very kind ; that I would dif- 
courfe with the men upon the point now, when I 
came to them. And I knew no reafon why they 
Ihould fcruple to let him marry them all j which I 
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic 
and valid in England^ as if they were married by one 
of our own clergymen. What was ^afterwafds done 
in this matter, I fhall fpeak of by itfelf. 

I then preffed him to tell me, what was the fecond 

complaint which he had to make ; aicknowledging, 

f hat I was very much his debtor for the firft ; and 

I thanked 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1^47 

thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would 
ufe the fame freedom and plainnefs in the fecond ; 
and hoped I would take it as well : and this was, 
that notwithftanding thefe Englijh fubjefts of mine, 
as he called them, had lived with thefe women for 
almoft feven years, and had taught them to fpeak 
Englijh^ and even to read it ; and that they were, 
as he perceived, women of tolerable underftanding, 
and capable of inftruftion ; yet they had not to this 
hour taught them any thing of the Chriftian religion ; 
no, not fo much as to know that there was a God, 
or a worfhip, or in what manner God was to be 
ferved ; or that their own idolatry, and worlhipping 
they knew not who, was falfe and abfurd. 

This, he faid, was an unaccoimtable negled, and 
what God would certainly call them to an account 
for ; and, perhaps, at laft take the work out of their 
hands. He fpoke this very afFedlionately and warm- 
ly. I am perfuaded, fays he, had thofe men lived 
in the favage country, whence their wives came, the 
favages would have taken more pains to have brought 
them to be idolators, and to worfliip the devil, than 
any of thefe men, fo far as I can fee, has taken with 
them, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, 
Now, Sir, faid he, though I do not acknowledge 
your religion, or you mine, yet we fliould be all glad 
to fee the devil's fervants, and the fubjefts of his

into the bofom of the true church, than they are 
now, in the public profeflion of idolatry, and devil- 

worfhip. 

I could hold no longer ; 1 took him in my arms, 
and embraced him with an excefs of paffion : How 
far, faid I to him, have I been from underftanding 
the moll effential part of a Chriftian, viz. to love 
the intereft of the Chriftian church, and the good of 
other men's fouls ! I fcarce have known what belongs 
to being a Chriftian. O, Sir, do not fay fo, replied 
he ; this thing is not your fault. No, faid I, but 
why did I never lay it to heart as well as you ? It is 
not too late yet, faid he ; be not too forward to con- 
demn yourfelf. But what can be done now ? faid I j 
you fee I am going away. Will you give me leave, 
faid he, to talk with thefe poor men about it ? Yes, 
with all my heart, faid I ; and I will oblige them to 
give heed to what you fay too. As to that, faid he, we 
muft leave them to the mercy of Chrift ; but it is 
our bufinefs to aflift them, encourage them, and in- 
ftrufl: them ; and, if you will give me leave, and 
God his blefling, I do not doubt but the poor ig- 
norant fouls fhall be brought home into the great 
circle of Chriftianity, if not into the particular faith 
that we all embrace ; and that even while you ftay 
here. Upon this I faid, I fhall not. only give you 
leave, but give you a thoufand thanks for it. What 
followed on this account I fhall mention alfo again 
in its place. 

I now preffed him for the third article in which we 

were to blame : Why really, fays he, it is of the 

' fame nature, and I will proceed (afking your leave) 

4 with 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

vith the fame plainnefs as before : Jt is about your poor 
favages yonder, who are (as I may fay) your conquered 
fubjeds. It is a maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be re- 
ceived among all Chriftians, of what church, or pre- 
tended church foever, viz. that Chriftian knowledge 
ought to be propagated by all poffible means, and on 
all poffible occafions. It is on this principle that our 
church fends miffionaries into Perfta^ Indian and China; 
and that our clergy, even of the fuperior fort, wil- 
lingly engage in the moft hazardous voyages, and 
the moft dangerous refidence, among murderers and 
barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true 
God, and to bring them over to embrace the Chrif- 
tian faith. Now, Sir, you have an opportunity here, 
to have fix or feven-and-thirty poor favages brought 
over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, their 
Maker arid Redeemer, that I wonder how you 
can pafs by fuch an occafion of doing good ; which 
is really worth the expence of a man^s whole life. 

I was now ftruck dumb indeed, and had not one 
word to fay: I had here a fpirit of true Chriftian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- 
cular principles be of what kind foever : As for me, 
I had notfo much as entertained a thought of this in 
my heart before ; and, I believe, ftiould not have 
thought of it ; for I looked upon thefe favages a^ 
flaves, and people, whom, had we any work for 
them to do, we would have ufed as fuch, or would 
have been glad to have tranfported them to any other 
part of the world ; for our bufinefs was to get rid 
of them ; and we would all have been fatisfied, if 
they had been fent to any country, fo they had ne- 
ver feeu their own. But, to the cafe : I fay, I was 
L 3 confounded 



1^0 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

confounded at his difcourfe, and knew not what aft 
fwer to make him. He looked earneftly at me, feeing 
me in fome diforder : Sir, faid he, I fliall be very 
forry, if what I have faid gives you any offence. 
No, no, faid I, I am offended with nobody but my- 
felf ; but I am perfedlly confounded, not only to 
think that I fhould never take any notice of this be- 
fore, but with reflefting what notice I am able to 
take of it now. You know, Sir, faid I, what cir- 
cumftances I am in ; I am bound to the Eajl Indies^ 
in a fhip freighted by. merchants, and to whom it 
would be an infufferable piece of injuftice to detain 
their fhip here, the men lying all this while at vic- 
tuals and wages upon the owner's account : it is 
true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and 
if I (lay more, I muft pay 3I. fterling per diem de- 
murrage ; nor can I flay upon demurrage above 
eight days more; and I have been here thirteen 
days already : So that I am perfeftly unable to engage 
•in this work, unlefs I would fuffer myfelf to be left 
behind here again ; in which cafe, if this fingle fhip 
Ihould mifcarry in any part of her voyage, I fhould 
be jufl in the fame condition that I was left in here 
at firfl ; and from which I have been fo wonderfully 
delivered. 

He owned the cafe was very hard upon me as to 
my voyage ; but laid it home upon my confcience, 
whether the bleffing of faving'feven-and-thirty fouls, 
was not worth my venturing all I had in the world 
for ? I was not fo fenfible of that as he was : and I 
returned upon him thus : Why, Sir, , it is a valuable 
thing indeed, to be an inftrument in God^^s hand, to 

convert 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. l^X 

convert feven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of 
Chrift ; but as you are an ecclefiaftic, and are given 
over to that work, fo that it feems naturally to fall 
into the way^of your profeflion, how is it then, that 
you do not rather offer yourfelf to undertake it, than 
prefs me to it ? 

Upon this he faced about, juft before me, as he 
walked along, and, putting me to a full flop, made 
me a very low bow : I mod heartily thank God, and 
you. Sir, fays he, for giving me fo evident a call to 
fo bleffed a work ; and if you think yourfelf dif- 
charged from it, and defire me to undertake it, I 
will moft readily do it, and think it a happy reward 
for all the hazards and difficulties of fuch a 
broken, difappointed vopge as I have met with, 
that I have dropped at laft into fo glorious a 
work. 

I difcovered a kind of rapture in his face, while 
he fpoke this to me j his eyes fparkled like fire, his 
face glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he 
had been falling into fits : in a word, he was fired 
with the joy of being embarked in fuch a work. I 
paufed a confiderable while before I could tell what 
to fay to him j for I was really furprifed to find a 
man of fuch fihcerity and zeal, and carried out in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profeffion only, but even of any profeffion whatfo- 
ever : but, after I had confidered it a while, I afked 
him ferioufly, if he was in earned, and that he would 
venture on the fingle confideration of an attempt on 
thofe poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted ifland 
for, perhaps, his life ; and at laft, might not know 
L 4 whether 



152 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

whether he ffiould be able to do them any good or 
not ? 

He turned fhort upon me, and afked me, what I 
called a venture ? Pray, Sir, faid he, what do you 
think I confented to go in your fhip to the Eajl In^ 
dies for ? Nay, faid I, that I know not, unlefs it was 
to preach to the Indians. Doubtlefs it was, faid he ; 
and do you think, if I can convert thefe feven-and- 
thirty men to the faith of Chrift, it is not worth 
my time, though I fhould never be fetched off the 
ifland again ? Nay, is it not infinitely of more worth 
to favc fo many fouls, than my life is, or the life of 
twenty more of the fame profeflion ? Yes, Sir, fays 
he, I would give Chrift and the Bleffed Virgin thanks 
all my days, if I ciould be made the leaft happy in- 
Jlrument of faving the fouls of thefe poor men, 
though I was never to fet my foot off this ifland, or 
fee my native country any more ; But fince you will 
honour me, fays he, with putting me into this work, 
(for which I will pray for you all the days of my life) 
I have one humble petition to you, faid he, befides. 
What is that? faid I. Why, fays he, it is, that 
you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my 
interpreter to them, and to aflift me ; for, without 
fome help, I cannot fpeak to them, or they to me. 

I was fenfibly troubled at his requefting Friday^ 
becaufe I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reafons : He had been the conipanion 
of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
fmcerely affeftionate to the laft degree ; and I had 
refolved to do fomething confiderable for him, if he 
out-lived me, as it was probable he would : then I 
knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be a Proteftant, 

it 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I55 

It would quite confound him, to bring him to em- 
brace another profeflion ; and he would never, while 
his eyes were open, believe that his old mafter was 
an heretic, :>nd would be damned ; and this might 
in the end ruin the poor fellow^s principles, and fo 
turn him back again to his firft idolatry. 

However, a fudden thought relieved me in this 
ilrait, and it was this : I told him, I could not fay 
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account 
whatever ; though a work, that to him was of more 
value than his life, ought to me to be of much more 
value than the keeping or parting with a fervant. 
But, on the other hand, I was perfuaded, that 
Friday would by no means confent to part with me ; 
and then to force him to it, without his confent^ 
would be manifeft injuftice ; becaufe I had promifed 
I would never put him away ; and he had promifed 
and engaged to me that he would never leave me, 
unlefs I put him away. 

He feemed very much concerned at it ; for he had 
no rational accefs to thefe poor people, feeing he did 
not underftand one word of their language, nor 
they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I 
told him, Friday^ father had learned Spanijh^ which 
I found he alfo underftood ; and he fhould ferve him 
for aix interpreter : fo he was much better fatisfied, 
and nothing could perfuade him but he would flay 
to endeavour to convert them ; but Providence gave 
another and very happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the firft part of his objedibns. 
When we came to the Englijhmen^ I fent for them 
all together j and after fome accounts given them of 

what 



154 i^IFE AKD ADVENTURES 

what I had done for them, viz. what neceffary thingi 
I had provided for them, and how they were diftri- 
buted, which they were fenfible of, and very thank- 
ful for ; I began to talk to them of the fcandaloua life 
they led, and gave them a full account of the notice 
the clergyman had already taken 6f it; and, ar- 
guing how unchriftian and irreligious a life it was, I 
firft afked them, if they were married men or bache- 
lors ? Th«y foon explained their condition to me, 
and fliewed me that two of them were widowers, and 
the other three were fmgle men or bachelors : I a(ked 
them, with what confcience they could take thefe 
women, and lie with them, as they had done, call 
them their wives, and have fo many children by them, 
and not be married lawfully to them ? 

They all gave me the anfwer that I expefted, viz. 
that there was nobody to marry them ; that they 
agreed before the governor to keep them as their 
wives ; and to keep them, and own them, as their 
wives J and they thought, as things flood with them, 
they were as legally married as if they had been 
married by a parlbn, and with all the formalities in 
the world. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in 
the fight of God, and were bound in confcience to 
keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of men 
being otherwife, they yiiight pretend they were not 
married, and fo defert the poor women and children 
hereafter ; and that their wives, being poor defolate 
women, friendlefs and moneylefs, would have no way 
to help themfelves : I therefore told them, that unlefs 
I was affured of their honefl intent, I could do no- 
thing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi. t^g 

thing for them ; but would take eare, that what I 
did Ihould be for the women and children^- without 
them ; and that unlefs they would give fome affur- 
ances that they would marry the women, I could 
not think it was convenient they Ihould continue to- 
gether as man and wife ; for that it was both fcan- 
dalous to men, and ofFenfive to God, who they could 
not think would blefs them, if they went on thus. 

AH this paffed as I expeded ; and they tpld me, 
efpecially Will Atkins^ who feemed now to fpeak for 
the reft, that they loved their wives as well as if they 
had been born in their own native country, and 
would not leave them upon any account whatever ; 
and they did verily believe their wives were as vir- 
tuous and as modeft, and did, to the utmoft of their 
fkill, as much for them, and for their children, as 
any women could poifibly do ; and they would not 
part with them on any account : And Will Atkins^ 
for his own particular, added, if any man would 
take him away, and offer to carry him home to 
England^ and to make him captain of the beft man 
of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if 
he might not carry his wife and children with him ; 
and if there was a clergyman in the fhip, he would 
be married to her now, with all his heart. 

This was juft as I would have it ; the prieft was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off: 
So, to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman 
with me, and, if he was fincere, I would have him 
married the next morning ; and bade him confider 
of it, and talk with the reft : He faid, as for him- 

felf. 



156 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

felf, he need not confider of it at all ; for he was very 
ready to do it, and was glad I had a minifter with 
me ; and he believed they would be all willing alfo. 
1 then told him, that my friend, the minifter, was 
a Frenchman, and could not fpeak Englijh ; but that 
I would a£k the clerk between them. He never fo 
much as alked me whether he was a Papift or Pro- 
teftant ; which was indeed what I was afraid of. 
But, I fay, they never enquired about it. So we 
parted : I went back to my clergyman ; and Will 
Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I de- 
fired the French gentleman not to fay any thing to 
them, till the bufmefs was thorough ripe ; and I 
told him what anfwer the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came 
to me, and told me, they had been confidering what 
I had faid ; that they were very glad to hear I had 
a clergyman in my company ; and they were very 
willing to give me. the fatisfaftion I defired, and to 
be formally married as foon as I pleafed ; for they 
were far from defiring to part from their wives ; and 
that they meant nothing but what was very honeft, 
when they chofe them : fo I appointed them to meet 
me the next morning ; and that, in the mean time, 
they fhould let their wives know the meaning of the 
marriage law ; and that it was not only to prevent 
any fcandal, but alfo to oblige them, that they 
fhould not forfake them, whatever might happen. 

The women were eafily made fenfible of the mean- 
ing of the thing, and were very well fatisfied with 
it, as, indeed, they had reafon to be ; fo they failed 
not to attend all together, at my apartment, the 

next 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I57 

next morning, where I brought out my clergyman : 
and though he had not on a minifter's gown, after 
the manner of England^ or the habit of a prieft, 
after the manner of France ; yet having a black 
veft, fomething likjC a caflbck, with a fafli round it, 
he did not look very unlike a mihifter j and as for 
his language, I was interpreter. 

But the ferioufnefs of his behavioiir to them, and 
the fcruples he made of marrying the women, be- 
caufe they were not baptized, and profeffed Chrif- 
tians, gave them an exceeding reverence for his 
perfon ; and there was no need after that to enquire 
whether he was a clergyman or no. 

Indeed I was afraid his fcriiple would have been 
carried fo far, as that he would not have married 
them at all: nay, notwithftanding all I Was able to 
fay to him, he refitted me, though modeftly, yet 
very fteadily ; and at laft, refufed abfolutely to 
marry them, unlefs he had firft talked with the men, 
and the women too ; and though at firft I was a little 
backward to it, yet at laft I agreed to it with a 
good will, perceiving the fincerity of his defign. 

When he came to them, he let them know that 
I had acquainted him with their circumftances, and 
.wdth the prefent defign ; that he was very willing to 
perform that part of his funftion, and marry them, 
as I had defired ; but that, before he could do it, he 
muft take the liberty to talk with them ; he told 
them, that in the fight of all different men, and in 
the fenfe of the laws of fociety, they had lived all 
this while in an open adultery ; and that it was true, 
that nothing but the confenting to marry, or effec- 
tually 



158 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tually feparating them from one another now, could 
put an end to it ; but there was a difficulty in it too, 
with refpeft to the laws of Chriftian matrimony, 
which he was not fully fatisfied about, viz. That of 
marrying one that is a profeffed Chriftian, to a fa- 
\age, an idolater and an heathen, one that is not 
baptized ; and yet that he did not fee, that there 
was time left for it, to endeavour to perfuade the 
women to be baptized, or to profefs the name of 
Chrift, whom they had, he doubted, heard no- 
thing of, and without which they could not be 
baptized. 

He told me, he . doubted they were bjit indifferent 
Chriftians theitifelves ; that they had but little know- 
ledge of God, or his ways ; and therefore he could 
not expeQ:, that they had faid much to their wives on 
that head yet; but that unlefs they would pro- 
mife him to ufe their endeavours with their wives, 
to perfuade them to become Chriftians, and would 
as well as they could inftruQ: them in the knowledge 
and belief of God that made them, and to worfhip 
Jefus Chrift that redeemed them, he could not marry 
them J for he would have no hand in joining Chrif- 
tians with favages ; nor was it confiftent with the 
principles of the Chriftian religion j and was, indeed, 
exprefsly forbidden in God's' law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I deli- 
vered it very faithfully to them, from his mouth, as 
near his own words as I could, only fometimes adding 
fomethingof my own, to convince them how juft it 
wa^, and how I was of his mind : And I always very 
faithfully diftinguiih^d between what I faid from 
- xnyfelf. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 159 

tnyfelf, and what were the clergyman's words. They 
told me, it was very true what the gentleman had 
faid, that they were but very indifferent Chriftians 
themfelves, and that they had never talked to their 
wives about religion : Lord, Sir, fays Will Atkins^ 
how Ihould we teach them religion ? Why, we know 
nothing' ourfelves ; and befides, Sir, faid he, fhould 
we go to talk to them of God, and Jefus Chrift, and 
heaven and hell, it would be to make them laugh at 
us, and alk us, what we believe ourfelves ? And if 
we fhould tell them, we believe all the things that • 
we fpeak of to them, fuch as of good people going 
to heaven, and wicked people to the devil, they 
would alk us, where we intended to go ourfelves, 
who believe all this, and yet are fuch wicked fel- 
lows,^ as we indeed are: Why, Sir, faid Will^ 'tis 
enough to give them a furfeit of religion, at firfl: 
hearing : folks muft have fome religion themfelves^ 
before they pretend to teach other people. — Will 
Atkins J faid I to him, though I am afraid what you 
fay has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell 
your wife, that flie is in the wrong ? that there is a 
<jod, and a religion better than her own ; that her 
gods are idols ; that they can neither hear nor fpeak; 
that there is a great Being that made all things, and 
that can deftroy all that he has made ; that he re- 
wards the good, and punifhes the bad ; * that we are 
to be judged by him, at laft, for all we do here : you 
are not fo ignorant, but even nature itfelf will teach 
you, that all this is true ; and I am fatisfied you know 
it all to be true, and believe it yourfelf. 

That's 



l6o X.IF£ AND ADVENTURES 

That's true. Sir, faid Atkins ; but vnxh what face 
can I fay any thing to my wife of all this, when Ihe 
will tell me immediately, it cannot be true ? 

Not true! faid I, — ^what do you mean by that? 
Why, Sir, faid he, (he will tell me it cannot be true, 
that this God (I (hall tell her of) can be juft, or can 
punifh or reward, fmce I am not pimifhed, and fent 
to the devil, that have been fuch a wicked crea- 
ture as (he knows I have been, even to her, and to 
every body elfe ; and that I (hould be fuffered to 
live, that have been always adting fo contrary to what 
I muft tell her is good, and to what I ought to 
have done. 

Why truly, Atkins, faid I, I am afraid thou fpeakeft 
too much truth : and with that I let the clergyman 
know what Atkins had faid ; for he was impatient to 
know : O ! faid the prieft, tell him there is one 
thing will make him the bell minifter in the world 
to his wife, and that is repentance ; for none teach 
repentance like true penitents : He wants nothing 
but to repent, and then he will be fo much the bet- 
ter qualified to inftrud his wife j he will thfen be 
able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and 
that he is the juft rewarder of good and evil ; but 
that he is a merciful Being, and, with infinite good- 
nefs and long fuflfering, forbears to punilh thofe that 
offend ; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the 
death of a finner, but rather that he Ihould return 
and live ; that he often fuffcrs wicked men to go on 
a longtime, and even referves damnation to the ge- 
neral day of retribution : that it is a clear evidence 
of God, and of a future (late, that righteous men 

receive 



OJ? ROBIKSON CRUSOE. l6t 

ireceive not their reward, or wicked men their pu- 
nifhment, till they come into another world ; and 
this will lead him to teach his wife the doftrine of 
the refurre£tion, and of the laft judgment : let him 
but repent for himfelf, he will be an excellent preacher 
of repentance to his wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins^ who looked very fe- 
rious all the while, and who, we could eafily per- 
ceive, was more than ordinarily affefted with it: 
when being eager, and hardly fuffering me to make 
an end — I knew, all this, mafter, fays he, and a 
great deal more ; but I han't the impudence to talk 
thus to my wife : when God, and my own con* 
fcience knows, and my wife will be an undeniable 
evidence againft me, that I have lived as if I had 
never heard of God, or a future ftate, or any thing 
about it J and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and 
with that he fetched a deep figh ; and I could fee 
^that tears flood in his eyes) *tis paft all that with me. 
it! Atkins y faid I: What doft thou mean by 
!^ I know well enough what I mean. Sir, fays 
he ; J^ean 'tis too late ; and that is too true. 

I tolckmy clergyman word for word what he faid : 
the poo^ealous prieft (I muft call him fo ; for be 
his opinio^ what it will, he had certainly a mdft 
Angular af^^dion for the good of other men's fouls ; 
and it wouI| be hard to think he had not the like for 
his own ; I my, this zealous, affeftionate man) could 
not refrain ^ars alfo : But recovering himfelf, he 
faid to me, |\{k him but one queftion : Is he eafy 
that it is toJlate, or is he troubled, and wifhes it 
were not fo| I put the queftion hirly to Atkins ; 

Vol. II. f M and

and he anfwered with a great deal of paffion,- How 
could any man be eafy in a condition that certainly 
muft end in eternal deftrudion ? That he was far 
from being eafy ; but that, on the contrary, he be- 
lieved it would one time or the other ruin him. 

What do you mean by that ? faid I. Why, he 
faid, ha believed he fhould, one time or another, 
cut his own throat, to put an end to the terror 
of it. 

The clergyman fhook hi» head, with a great con- 
cern in his face, when I told him all this ; but, 
turning quick to me. upon ^ it, faid, If that be his 
cafe^ you may affure him it is not too late ; Chrift 
will give him repentance : But pray, fays he, ex- 
plain this to him. That as no man is faved but by 
Chrift, and the merit of his paffion, procuring di- 
vine mercy for him:, how can it be too late for any 
man to receive mercy I Does be think he is able to 
fin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray 
tell him. There may be a time when provoked mercy 
will no longer ftrive, and when God may refufe to 
bear ; but that *tis never too late for men to afk 
mercy ;. and we that are Chriil's fervants are com- 
manded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of 
Jefus Chrift, to all thofe that fincerely jrepent : fo 
that 'tis never too late to repent.^ 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard xioe with great 
earneftnefs j but it feemed as if he turned off the 
difcourfe to the reft; for he faid to me, he would 
go and have fome talk with his wife : fo he went out 
awhile, and we talked to the reft. I perceived they 
were all ftupidly ignorant, as to nxatters of religion; 

much 



bF kOBINSON CRtlSO^* 163 

ihiich as I was when I went rambling away from 
my father : and yet that there were none of them 
backward to hear what had been faid ; and all of 
them ferioufly promifed, that they would talk with 
their wives about it, and do their endeavour to 
perfuade them to turn Chriftians. 

The clergyman fmiled upon me, when 1 reported 
what anfwer they gave, but faid nothing a good while j 
but, at laft, {baking his head. We that are Chrift's 
fervants, fays he, can go nd farther than to exhort 
and inftru£t ; and when men comply, fubmit to the 
reproof, and promife what we aflc, *tis all we can dc ; 
we are bound to accept their good words ; but, be- 
lieve me. Sir, faid he, whatever you may have knov/n 
of the life of that man you call William Atkins y I 
believe he is the only fmcere convert among them ; I 
take that man to be a true penitent ; I won't defpair 
of the reft j but that man is perfedly ftruck with 
the fenfe of his paft life ; and I doubt not, but when 
he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will 
talk himfelf effeftually into it; for attempting to 
teach others is fometimes the beft way of teaching 
ourfelves. I knew a man, added he, who, having 
nothing but a fummary notion of religion himfelf-, 
and being wicked and profligate, to the laft degree, 
in his life, made a thorough reformation in himfelf, 
by labouring to convert a Jew : And if that poor ^/. 
kins begins but once to talk ferioufly of Jefus Chrift 
to his wife, my life for it, he talks himfelf into a 
thorough convert, makes himfelf a penitent : and 
who knows what may follow ?

embrace Chriftianity, he married the other three 
couple ; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet 
come in. After' this, my clergyman, waiting a while, 
was curious to know where Atkins was gone ; and, 
turning to me, fays he, I intreat you. Sir, let u» 
walk out of your labyrinth here, and look ; I dare 
fay we Ihall find this poor man fome where or other, 
talking ferioufly with his wife, and teaching her al- 
ready fomething of religion. I began to be of the 
fame mind j fo we went out together ; and I carried 
him a way which none knew but myfelf, and where 
the trees were fo thick fet, as that it was not eafy to 
fee through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to 
fee in, than to fee out ; when coming to the edge of 
the wood, I faw Atkins j and his tawny favage wife, 
fitting under the (hade of a bufli, very eager in dif* 
courfe : I ftoppped fhort, till my clergyman came up 
to me ; and then, having fhewed him where they 
were, we flood and looked very fteadily at them a 
good while. 

We obferved him very earneft with her, pointiag 
up to the fun, and to every quarter of the heavens ; 
then down to the earth, then out to the fea, then to 
himfelf, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
Now, fays my clergyman, you fee my words are 
made good ; the man preaches to her ; mark himj 
now he is telling her that our God has made him, 
and her, and the heavens, the earth, the fea, the 
woods, the trees, &c. I believe he is, faid L* Im- 
mediately we perceived Will Atkins ftart up upon his 
feet, fall down upon his knees,and liftupbothhishands; 
we fuppofed he faid fomething, but we could not 
hear him : it was too far off for that : he did not 

continue

continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and fits 
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We 
perceived theii the woman very attentive ; but whe- 
ther (he faid any thing or no, we could not tell. 
While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could 
feie the tears run plentifully down my clergyman's 
cheeks ; and I could hardly forbear myfelf ; but it 
was a great affliftion to us both, that we were not 
near enough to hear any tiling that paffed between 
them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for 
fear of difturbing them : fo we refolved to fee an end 
of this piece of ftill converfation ; and it fpoke loud 
.enough to us, without the help of voice. He fat 
4own again, as I have faid, clofe by her, and talked 
again earneftly to her ; and two or three times we 
could fee him embrace her paffionately ; another time 
we faw him take out his handkerchief, and wipe her 
eyes, and then kifs her again, with a kind of tranf- 
port very unufual ; and after feveral of thefe things, 
we faw him on a fudden jump up again, and lend 
her his hand to help her up ; when immediately lead- 
ing her by the hand a ftep or two, they both kneeled 
down together, and continued fo about two mi- 
nutes. 

My friend could bear It no longer, but cries out 
aloud, St. Paul^ St. Paul ! behold he prayeth !-— 
I was afraid Atkins would hear him ; therefore I in- 
treated him to withhold himfelf awhile, that we 
might fee an end of the fcene, which to me, I muft 
confefs, was the moft aflfeifting, and yet the mofl 
agreeable, that ever I faw in my life. Well, h^ 
ftrove with himfelf, and contained himfelf for a

while, but was in fuch raptures of joy to think that 
the poor heatheiii woman was become a Chriflian^ 
that he was not able to contain himfelf ; he wept 
feveral times: then throwing up his hands, and 
crofSng his breaft, faid over feveral things ejacula- 
tory, and by way of giving God thanks for fo mir 
raculous a teftimony of the fuccefs of our endea-? 
vours: fome he fpoke foftly, and I could not well 
hear J others audibly ; fome in Latin^ fome in French ; 
then t\yo or three times the tears of joy would inter- 
rupt him, that he could not fpeak at all. But I 
begged that he would compofe himfelf, and let u^ 
more narrowly and fully obferve what was before us, 
which he did for a time, and the fcene was not end- 
ed there yet ; for, after the poor man and his wife 
were rifen again from their knees', we obferved he 
flood talking ftill eagerly to her j and we obferved 
by her motion that fhe was greatly afFefted with what 
he faid, by her frequent lifting up her hands, laying 
her hj^nd to her breaft, and fuch other poftures, a<? 
iifually exprefs the greateft ferioufnefs and attention : 
This continued about half a quarter of an hour, and 
then they walked away too ; fo that we could fee 
no more of them in that fituation. 

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman : 
and firft, I told him, I was glad to fee the particu- 
lars we had both been witneffes to ; that though I 
was hard enough of belief in fuch cafes, yet that I 
began to think it was all very fmcere here, both in 
the man and his wife, however ignorant they botl) 
might be ; and I hoped fuch a beginning would have 
yet a more happy end : and who knows, faid I,

ample, work upon fonie of the others ? Some of 
them ! faid he, turning quick upon me, ay, upon 
all of them : depend upon it, if thofe two favages 
(for he has been but little better^ as you relate it) 
Ihould embrace Jefus Chrift, they wijil never leave 
till they work upon all the reft ; for 'true religion is 
naturally communicative j and he that is once made 
a Chriftian will never leave a pagan behind him, if 
he can help it. I owned it was a moft Chriftian 
principle to think fo, and a teftimony of a true zeal, 
as well as a generous heart in him. But, my friend, 
faid I, will you give me liberty to ftart one difficulty 
here ? I cannot tell how to objeft the leaft thing 
againft that affedionate concern which you fliew fpr 
the turning the poor people from their paganifin to 
the Chriftian religion ; but how does this comfort 
you, while thefe people are^ in your account, out 
of the pale of the Catholic church, without which, 
you believe, there is no falvation .; fo that you efteem 
thefe but heretics ftill ; and, for pther reafons, as ef- 
^ftually loft as the pagans themfelves ? 

To this he anfwered with abundance of candour 
^nd Chriftian charity^ thus ; Sir, I am ^ Catholic of 
the Roman church, and a prieft of the order of St. 
Benedi^^ and I embrace all the principles of the Ro^ 
► man faith : But yet, if you will believe me, and this 
J do not Ipeak in compliment to you, or in refpeft 
to my circumftances, ^nd your civilities ; I fay, ne- 
verthelefs, I do not look upon you, who call yourfelves 
reformed, without fome charity : I dare not fay^ 
tho' I know it is our opinion in general ; yet I dare 
Aiot fay, that you cannot be faved ; I will by no means 
limit the mercy of Chrift, fo fsir .<is to think that he 

M 4 .cannot 



1 68 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

cannot receive you into the bofom of his church, ill 
a manner, to us, imperceivable, and which, it is 
impoffible for us to know ; and I hope you have the 
fame charity for us : I pray daily for your being all 
reftored to Chrift's church, by whatfoever methods 
he, who is all wife, is pleafed to direO:. In the 
mean time, fure, you will allow it to confift with 
me, as a Romany to diftinguifh far between a Pro, 
teftant and a Pagan : between him that calls on Jefus 
Chrift, though in a way which I do not think is ac« 
cording to the true faith j and a favage, a barbarian, 
that knows no Goo, no Chrift, no Redeemer at all: 
And if you are not within the pale of the Catholic 
church, we hope you are nearer being reftored to 
it, than thofe that know nothing at all of God, or 
his church. I rejoice, therefore, when I fee this poor 
man, who, you fay, has been a profligate, and al- 
moft a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jefus 
Chrift, as we fuppofe he did, though not fully en- 
lightened ; believing that God, from whom every 
fuch work proceeds, will fenfibly touch his heart, 
and bring him to the further knowledge of the truth 
in his own time: and if God (hall influence this 
poor man to convert and inftrufl: the ignorant fa- 
' vage his wife, I can never believe that he fhall be 
caft away himfelf : and have I not reafon then to 
rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge 
of Chrift, though they may not be brought quite 
home into the bofom of the Catholic church, juft at 
the time when I may defire it ; leaving it to the 
goodnefs of Chrift to perfefl: his work in his own 
time, and his own way? Certainly I would rejoice, 
if all the favages in America were brought, like this

poor woman, to pray to God, though they were to 
be all Proteftants at firft, rather than they fhould con-^ 
tinue pagans and heathens ; firmly believing, that 
he who had beftowed that firft light upon them, 
would farther illuminate them with a beam of his 
heavenly grace, and bring them into the pale of his 
ichurch, when he fliould fee good. 
. I was aftoniflied at the fmcerity and temper of this 
truly pious Papift, as much as I was oppreffed by the 
power of his reafoning : and itprefently occurred to 
my thoughts, that if fuch a temper was univerfal, 
we might be all Catholic Chriftians, whatever 
church or particular profeffion we joined to, or 
joined in ; that a fpirit of charity would foon work 
us all up into right principles; and, in a word, as 
he thought that the like charity would make us all 
Catholics, fo I told him, I believed, had all the 
members of his church the like moderation, they 
would foon be all Proteftants: And there we left 
that part, for we never difputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way; and, 
taking him by the hand. My friend, faid I, I wifh 
all the qlergy of the Roman church were bleiTed with 
fuch moderation, and an equal ftiare of your cha- 
rity : I am entirely of your opinion ; but I muft 
tell you, that if you fliould preach fuch doftrine 
in Spain or Italy^ they would put you into the in- 
quifition. 

It may be fo, faid he ; I know not what they might' 
do in Spain and Italy ; but I will not fay they would 
be the better Chriftians for that feverity ; for I 
am fure there is no herefy in too much charity.

fjO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Well, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, 
our bufmefs there was over : fo we went back oui" 
own way ; and when we came back, we found thent 
waiting to be called in. Obferving this, I aiked 
my clergyman if we fhould difcover to him that 
we had feen him under the bulh, or no ; and it was 
his opinion we fliould not ; but that we fliould talk 
to him firft, and hear what he would fay to us : fo 
we called him in alone, nobody being in the place 
but ourfelves ; and I began with him thus : 

Will Atkins^ faid I, prithee what education had 
you ? What was your father ? 

W. A. A better man, than ever I fliall be. Sir, 
my father was a clergyman. 

R. C. What education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would have taught me well. Sir ; but 
I defpifed all education, inftrudlion, or corredlion, 
like a beaft as I was. 

R. C. It is true, Solomon fays '^ hie that defpifeth 
** reproof is brutifli.** 

W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutifli indeed ; I mur- 
dered my father : for God's fake, Sir, talk no more 
about that. Sir ; I murdered my poor father. 

Prieji. Ha ? a murderer ! 

[Here the prleft ftarted (fcr I interpreted every word 
as he fpoke it) and looked pale : It feems he believed 
that Will had really killed his own father.] 

R. C. No, no. Sir, I do not underftand him fo. 
Will Atkins i explain yourfelf : you did not kill your 
father, did you, with your own hands ? 

W. A^ No, Sir ; I did not cut his throat ; but I 
cut the thread of all his comforts, ^nd ftiortened 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, I7I 

his days ; I broke his heart by the moft ungrate* 
ful, unnatural return, for the moft tender, aflfedion-* 
ate treatment that ever father gave, or child could 
receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not afk you about your father, to 
extort this confeffion ; I pray God give you repent- 
ance for it, and forgive you that, and all your other 
fins : but I alked you, becaufe I fee that though yo^ 
have not much learning, yet you are not fo ignorant 
^s fome are, in things that are good ; that you have 
known more of religion a great deal than you have 
praftifed, 

W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the con*, 
feflion that I make about my father, confcience does; 
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives, 
4the fins againft our indulgent parents are certainly 
the firft that touch us ; the wounds they make lie 
4eepeft ; and the weight they leave will lie heavieft 
upon the mind of all the fins we can commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and fenfible for me, 
Atkins ; I cannot bear it. 

W. A. Tou bear it, mafter ! I dare fay you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins ; every fhore, every hill, nay, 
I may fay, every tree in this ifland, is witnefs to the 
^nguilh of my fqul, for my ingratitude,^ and bafe 
lafage of a good tender father ; a father much like 
your's, by your defcription ; and I murdered my 
father as well as you, Wili Atkins ; but think, for 
all that, my repentance is fhort of your's too, by a 
great deal, 

[I would have faid more, if I could have reftrained my 
paflions •, but I thought thig ppor man's repentance

was fo much finccrcr than mine ; that I was going t» 
leave oflF the difcourfc, and rctirfe, for I was fur- 
prifcd with what he faid ; and thought that inftead 
of my going about to teach and inftruft him, the 
man was made a teacher and inftruftor to me, in a 
moft furprifing and unexpefted manner.3 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who 
was greatly afFeded with it, and faid to me. Did I 
not fay. Sir, that when this man was converted,' he 
would preach to us all ? I tell you. Sir, if this one 
man be made a true penitent, here will be no need 
of me ; he will make Chriftians of all in the ifland. 
But having a little compofed myfelf, I renewed my 
difcourfe with Will Atkins. 

But, Willy faid I, how comes the feinfe of this 
matter to touch you juft now ? 

W. A. Sir, you have fet me about a work that 
bas ftruck a dart through my very foul ; I have been 
talking about God and religion to my wife, in order, 
^ you direded me, to make a Chriftian of her ; and 
Ihe has preached fuch a fermon to me as I fhall never 
forget while I live. 

R. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached 
to you : but when you were moving religious argu- 
ments to her, confcience has flimg them back upon 
you. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, with fuch a force as is not to 
be refifted. 

R. C. Pray, Will^ let us know what paffed be- 
tween you and your wife j for I know fomething of 
it already. ^. 

W. A. Sir, it is impoffible to give you a full ac- 
count of it : I am too full to hold it, and yet have 

no 



t)F ROBINSON CRUSOE. IJ^j 

!M) tongue to exprefs it : but let her have faid what 
fhe will, and though I cannot give you an account 
of it, this I can tell you of it, that I refolve to 
amend and reform my life. 

R. C But tell us fome of it. How did you be- 
gin, Will? For this has been an extraordinary cafe, 
that is certain j fhe has preached a fermon, indeed, 
if fhe has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I firfl told her the nature of our 
laws about marriage, and what the reafons were that 
men and women were obliged to enter into fuch 
compads, as it was neither in the power of one or 
other to break ; that otherwife, order and juftice 
could not be maintained, and men would run from 
their wives, and abandon their children, mix con- 
fufedly with one another, and neither families be 
kept entire, or inheritances be fettled by a legal de- 
fcent. 

R. C You talk like a civilian, WilU Could you 
make her underftand what you meant by inheri- 
tante and families ? They know no fuch thing 
among the favages, but marry any how, without 
any regard to relation, confanguinity, or family ; 
brother and fifler, nay, as I have been told, even 
the father and daughter, and the fon and the mo* 
ther. 

W. A. I believe. Sir, you are mifinformed ;— » 
my wife aflures me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it. Perhaps, for any further relations, they 
may not be fo exaft as we are ; but fhe tells me they 
never touch one another in the neaa: relations you 
ipeak of, 

R. C. Well^ 



t74 ^1^2 AND Adventure^ 

jR. C. Well, what did fhe fay to what you told 
her? • 

W. A. She faid flie liked it very well ; and it was 
much better than in her country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 

W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. \ 
alked her. If fhe would be married to me our way ? 
She afked me. What way that was ? I told her mar- 
riage W2[s appointed of God ; and here we had a 
ftrange talk together indeed, as ever man and wife 
had, I believe. 

[N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wife, 
as I took it down in writing, juft: after he told it me, 
was as follows : 

Wife. Appointed by your God ! Why, have you 
a God in your country ? 

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country ? 

Wife. No your God in my country ; my country 
have the great old Benamuckee God. 

W. A. ChiM, I am very unfit to Ihew you who 
God is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven 
and the earth, the fea, and all that in them is. 

Wife. No makee de earth ; no you God makec 
de earth ; no make my country. 

[W, A. laughed a little at her expreffion of God not 
making her country.] 

Wife. No laugh : Why laugh me ? This no ting 
to laugh. 

[He was juftly reproved by his wife; for (he w^s more

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 
' W. A. That's true indeed; but J have been a

without God in the world, myfelf. 

Wife. What have you de great God in your coun- 
try, you no know him? No fay O to him ? No do 
good ting for him ? That no impofTiblef 

W. A. It is too true though, for all that : we live 
as if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no 
power on earth. 

Wife. But why God let you do fo ? Why he no 
makee you good live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault.

will : why he no makee kill whenyou.no ferve him? 
No fay O to him' ? No be good mans ? 

W. A. That is true ; ,he might flrike me dead, 
and I ought to expeft it ; for I have been a wicked 
wretch, that is true : but God is merciful, and does 
not deal with us as we deferve. 

Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for 
that too? 

' W. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God for 
his mercy, any more than I have feared God for his 
power. 

Wife.

no makee kill you, though you makee him much

fT. jf. What ! will my wicked life hinder yoir 
from believing in God! What a dreadful creature

Eves of Chriftians hinder the converfion of heathens! 

Wife. How me tink you have great much God up 
there, (^Jhe points up to heaven^) and yet no do we|I,

W. A. He is merciful ; that is all we can fay for

Wi A. Yes, yes, my dear ; he is infinitely good,

W. A. Poor creature, he muft teach thee, I can-

[The poor fellow was in fuch an agony at her defiring 
him to make her know God, and her wifliing to

W. A. No, we do not hear him fpeak ; but he 
has revealed himfelf many ways to us. 

[Here he was at a great lofs to make her underftand 
that God had revealed himfelf to us by his wordj

W. A. God has fpoken to fome good men in for-

God has infpired good men, by his Spirit 5 and they 
hiave written all his laws down in a book. 

Wife. Me no uniierftand that ; where is book ? 

W. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this 
book ; but I hope I fhall, one time or other, get it 
for you to read it. 

[Here he embraced her with great afFeftion 5 but with 
inexpreffible grief, that he had not a bible.] 

Wife. But how you makee me know, that God 
teachee them to write that book ? 

W. A. By the fame rule that we know him to be 
God. 

Wife. What rule ; what way you know ?

Jbe left alone, and never be taught to know this God

told her wicked menr Aould be after deaih.'J^r: . 

This was a ftrange account, and very iafff^ting: to 
us both, but particularly the young clergyiriaia, : he 
was indeed wonderfully fiarprifed with it y but imider 
the greateft afflidion imaginable, that he could not 
talk to her ; that he ceuld nat fpeak Englijh to make 
her underftand him; and as flie fpoke but very 
broken Englijh^ he could not underftand her. How- 
ever, he turned himfelf to me, and told me, that 
he believed there muft be more to do with this wo- 
man than to marry her ; I did not underftand him 
at firft ; but at length he esLplained himfelf; viz* 
That fhe ought to be baptized. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, ajid was for 
going about it prefently : No, no ; hold. Sir, faid 
he, though I would have her baptized by all means, 
yet I muft obferve, that Will Jtkinsj her hufl^and, has 
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be 
willing to embrace a religious life ; and has given 
her juft ideas of the being of a God, of his. power, 
juflice, and mercy ; yet Tdefire to know of him, if 
he has faid any thing to her of Jefus Chrift, and of 
the falvation of finners ; of the nature of faith in 
him ; and the redemption by him ; of the holy Spi- 
rit, the xefurreftion, the laft judgment, and a fu- 
ture ftate. 

I called Will Atkins again, an4 alked him ; but the 
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us,

own confcience fo reproached him with his horrid, 
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehenfions, 
that her knowledge of him fhould leflen the attention 
(he fhould give to thofe things, and make her ratha: 
contemn religion, than receive it : but he was af- 
fured, he faid, that her mind was fo difpofed to re- 
ceive due impreffions of all thofe things, that if I 
would but difcourfe with her, fhe would make it 
appear to my fatisfadion, that my labour would not 
be loft upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myfelf 
as interpreter, between my religious prieft and the 
woman, I entreated hinl to begin with her : but fure 
fuch a fermon was never preached by a popifh prieft 
in thefe latter ages of the world ; and, as I told him, 
I thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all 
the fmcerity of a Chriftian, without the errors of a 
Roman Catholic ; and that I took him to be fuch a 
clergyman as the Roman bifliops were, before the 
church of Rome afTumed fpiritual fovereignty over 
the confciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to em- 
brace the knowledge of Chrift, and of redemption 
by him, not with wonder and aftonifhment only, as 
ihe did the firft notions of a God, but with joy and 
faith, with an affedlion, and a furprifing degree of 
underftanding, fcarce to be imagined, much lefs to 
be expreffed ; and at her own requeft flie was bap» 
tized. 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I en- 
treated him, that he would perform that ofEce'with 
fome caution, that the man might not perceive he 
\vas of the Roman church, if poflible j becaufe of 

other 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

Other ill confequences which might attend a difference 
among us in that very religion which we were in- 
ftrufting the other in. He told me, that as he had 
no confecrated chapel, nor proper things for the 
office, I fliould fee he would do it in a manner, that 
I fhould not know by it that he was a Roman Ca- 
tholic myfelf, if I had not known it before : and 
fo IiQ did ; for faying only fome words over to him- 
felf in L^3://«, which I could not underftand, he poured 
a whole difh full of water upon the woman's head, 
pronouncing in French very loud, Mary ; which was 
the name her hufband defired me to give her, for I 
was her god-father, / baptize thee in the name of 
the Father^ and of the Son^ and of the Holy Ghojl ; 
fo that none could know, any thing by it, what reli- 
gion he was of: he gave-thq beiledi£kion afterwards 
in Latin ; but either Will Atki)fs did not know but it 
was in French^ or elfe did, not take notice of it at 
that time. 

As foon as this was over, he married them; and 
after the marriage was over, he turned himfelf to 
Will Atkins^ and in a very affeftionate manner ex- 
horted him not only to perfevere in that good difpo- 
fition he was in, but to fiipport the conviftions that 
were upon him, by a refolution to reform his life : 
told him, it was in vain to fay he repented, if he 
did not forfal^e his crimes ; reprefented to him, how 
God had honoured him v/ith being the inftrument 
of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Chrif- 
tian religion ; and that he fliould be careful he did 
not diflionour the grace of God ; and that, if he 
did, he would fee the heathen a better Chriftian thaln

himfelf ; the favage converted, and the inftrument 
caft away ! 

He faid a great many good things to them both, 
and then recommended them, in a few words, to 
God's goodnefs ; gave them the benedi£lion again, 
I repeating every thing to them in Englijh : And thus 
ended the ceremony. I think it was the moft plea? 
fant, agreeable day to me, that ever I paffed in my 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts 
hung continually upon the converfion of the 37 fa- 
vages ? and fain he would have ftaid upon the ifland 
to have undertaken it : but I convinced him, Firft, 
that his undertaking was imprafticable in itfelf ; and 
fecondly, that, perhaps, I could put it into a way of 
being done, in his abfe|ice, to his fatisfaftion ; of 
which by and by. 

Having thus brought the affair of the ifland to a 
narrow compafs, I was preparing to go on board the 
fliip, when the young man, whom I had taken out 
of the famiflied fliip's company, came to me, and 
told me, he underftood I had a clergyman with me, 
and that I had caufed the Englijhmen to be married to 
the favages, whom they called wives j that he had a 
match too, which he defired might be finifhed before 
I went, between two Chriftians ; which . he hoped 
would not be difagreeable to me. 

I knew this muft be the young woman who was 
his mother's fervant, for there was no other Chriftian 
woman on the ifland j fo I began - to perfuade him 
not to do any thing of that kind raflily, or becaufe 
he found himfelf in this folitary circumfliance : I re- 
prefented, that he had fonie confiderable fubftance in 

the

the world, and good friends, as I underftood by him* 
felf, and by his maid alfo ; that the maid was not only 
poor, and a fervant, but was unequal to him, fhe 
being twenty-fix or twenty-feven years old, and he 
not above fev^nteen or eighteen; that he might very 
probably, with my affiftance, make a remove from 
this wildernefs, and come into his own country again; 
and that then it would be a thoufand to one but he, 
would repent his choice; and the diflike of that cir- 
cumftance might be difadvantageous to both. I was 
going to fay more, but he interrupted me, fmiling^; 
and told me, with a great deal of modefty, that I 
piiftook in my gueffes ; , that he had nothing of 
that kind in his thoughts, his prefent circum- 
ftances being melancholy and difconfolate enough ; 
jind he was very glad to hear, that I had fome 
thoughts of putting them in a way to fee their 
own country again ; and that nothing fhould have 
fet him upon flaying there, but that the voyage I 
"jvas going was fo exceeding long and hazardous, and 
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his 
friends ; that he had nothing to defire of me, but 
that I would fettle him in fome little property in the 
ifland where he was ; give him a fervant or two, and 
fome few neceffaries, and he would fettle himfelf 
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if 
ever I returned to England^ I would redeem him, 
qjid hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I 
came to England ; that he would give me fome letters 
to his friends in London^ to let them know how good 
I had been to him, and what part of the world, and 
what circumftances I had left him in ; and he pro- 
xnifed me^ that whenever I redeemed him j the plan- 
tation,

tation, and all the improvements he had made upon 
it, let the value be what it would, fhould be wholly 
mine. 

His difcourfe was very prettily delivered, confi- 
deiing his youth ; and was the more agreeable to 
me, becaufe he told me pofitively the match was not 
for himfelf. I gave him all pofnble affurances, that 
if I lived to come fafe to England^ I would deliver 
his letters, and do his bufmefs effeftually ; and that 
he inight depend I would never forget the circum- 
ftances I left him in ; but ftill I was impatient to 
know who was the perfon to be married : Upon 
which he told me it was my jack of all Trades, and 
his maid Sufan. 

I was moft agreeably furprifed when he named 
the match ; for indeed I had thought it very fuita- 
ble. The charafter of that man I have given al- 
ready ; and as for the maid, fhe was a very honed, 
modeft, fober, and religious young woman ; had a 
very good fhare of fenfe ; was agreeable enough in 
her perfon ; fpoke very handfomely, and to the pur- 
pofe ; always with decency and good manners, and 
not backward to fpeak when any thing required it, 
or impertinently forward to fpeak when it was not 
her bufinefs; very handy and houfewifely in any 
thing that was before her ; an excellent manager, 
and fit indeed to have been governefs to the whole 
ifland ; fhe knew very well how to behave herfelf to 
all kind of folks {he had about her, and to better, if 
fhe had found any there. 

The match being propofed in this manner, we 
married them the fame day ; and, as I was father 
at the altar, as I may fay, and gave her away, fo I 

gave 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I87 

gave her a portion ; for I appointed her and her huf- 
band a handfome large fpace of ground for their 
plantation ; and, indeed, this match, and the pro- 
pofal the young gentleman made to me, to give him 
a fmall property in the ifland, put me upon parcel- 
ling it out among them, that they might not quarre^ 
afterwards about their fituation. 

This fharing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins^ who, indeed, was now grov/n a moft fober, 
grave, managing fellow ; perfectly reformed, exceed- 
ing pious and religious ; and, as far as I may be al- 
lowed to fpeak pofitively in fuch a cafe, I verily be- 
lieve, was a true lincere penitent. 

He divided things fo juftly, and fo much to every 
one's fatisfaftion, that they only defired one general 
writing under my hand for the whole ; which I caufed 
to be drawn up, and figned and fealed to them, fet- 
ting out the bounds and fituation of every man's 
plantation, and teffifying, that I gave them thereby, 
feverally, a right to the whole pofTeffion and inhe- 
ritance of the refpedlive plantations or farms, with 
their improvements, to them and their heirs; re- 
ferving all the reft of the ifland as my own property, 
and a certain rent for every particular plantation, 
after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in 
my name, came to demand it, producing an attefted 
copy of the fame writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I 
told them, I was not capable of giving them better 
rules than they were able to give themfelves ; only 
made them promife me, to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another : And fo I prepared 
to leave them.

viour Jefus Chrift ; and they likewife promifed m, 
that they would never have any differences or dif- 
putes, one with another, about religion. 

When I came to Will Atkinses houfe (I may call it 
fo ; for fuch a houfe, or fuch a piece of bafket-work, 
I believe was not (landing in the world again !) I fay, 
when I came thither, I found the young woman I 
have mentioned above, and William Atkins's wife, 
were become intimates ; and this prudent, religious 
young woman, had perfeded the work Will Atkins 
had begun ; and though it was not above four days 
after what I have related, yet the new-baptized fa- 
vage woman was made fuch a Chriftian, as I have 
feldoni heatd of any like her, in all my obfervation 
or converfation in the world. 

It came, next into my mind, in the morning, be- 
fore I went to them, that among all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, I had not left a 
bible 'y in which I fliewed myfelf lefs conlidering for 
them, than my good friend the widow was for me, 
when ibe fent me the cargo of lool. from Lijbon^ 
where fhe packed up three bibles and a prayer-book* 
However, the good woman's charity had a greater 
extent than ever {he imagined ; for they were re- 
ferved for the comfort and inftruclion of thofe that 
made much better ufe of them than I had done. 

I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when 
I came to Willia?n Atkinses tent, or houfe, I found the 
young woman, and Atkins's baptized wife, had been 
difcourfing of religion together ; f for William Atkins 
told it me, with a greal deal of joy.) I afked, if they 
were together now ? And he faid yes ; fo I went 
into the houfe, and he with me, and we found them 

together, 

4 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. igi 

together, very earneft in difcourfe : O, Sir, fays Wil^ 
Uatn Atkins^ when God has finners to reconcile 
to himfelf, and aliens to bring home, he ne- 
ver wants a meffenger : My wife has got a new 
inftruftor ; I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapa- 
ble of that work; that young woman has been Tent 
hither from Heaven ; fhe is enough to convert a 
whole ifland of favages. The young woman blufhed, 
and rofe up to go away, but I defired her to fit ftill ; 
I told her flie had a good work upon her hands, and 
I hoped God would blefs her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any book among them, though I did not afk ; 
but I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my 
bible ; Here, faid I to Atkins^ I have brought you 
an affiftant, that, perhaps, you had not before. The 
man was fo confounded, that he was not able to 
fpeak for fome time ; but recovering himfelf, he 
takes it with both* hands, and, turning to his wife. 
Here, my dear, fays he, did not I tell you, our 
God, though he lives above, could hear what we 
faid ? Here is the book I prayed for, when you and 
I kneeled down under the bufh ; now God has heard 
us and fent it. When he had faid thus, the man 
fell into fucK tranfports of a paffionate joy, that be- 
tween the jdy of having it, and giving God thanks 
for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that 
was crying. 

The woman was furprized, and was like to have 
run into a miftake, that none of us were aware of; 
for fhe firmly believed God had fent the book upon 
her hufband's petition : It is true, that providentially 
it was fo, and might be taken fo in a confequent 

fenfe ; 



tgi LIFE AND ADVENTURED 

fenfe ; but I believed it would have been no difficult 
matter, at that time, to have perfuaded the poor 
woman to have believed, that an exprefs meflenger 
came from heaven, on purpofe to bring that indivi- 
dual book ; but it was too ferious a matter to fuffer 
any delufion to take place : So I turned to the 
young woman, and told her, we did not defire to 
hnpofe upon the new convert, in her firfl and more 
ignorant underftanding of things ; and begged her 
to explain to her, that God may be very properly 
faid to anfwer our petitions, when in the courfe of 
his Providence, fuch things are, in a particular 
manner, brought to pafs, as we petitioned for ; but * 
we do not expeft returns from Heaven, in a miracu- 
lous and particular manner j and that it is our mercy 
it is not fo. 

This the young woman did afterwards effedually ; 
fo that there was, I affure you, no prieftcraft ufed 
here ; and I fliould have thought it one of the moft 
unjuftifiable frauds in the world, to have had it fo : 
but the furprize of joy upon Will Atkins ^ is really 
not to be expreffed ; and there, we may be fure, was 
no delufion. Sure no man was ever more thankful 
in the world for any thing of its kind, than he was 
for this bible ; and I believe, never any man was 
glad of a bible from a better principle ; and though 
he had been a moft profligate creature, defperate, 
headftrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a 
great degree ; yet this man is a ftanding rule to us 
all, for the well inftrufting children ; viz. That pa- 
rents fhould never give over to teach and inftruft, or 
ever defpair of the fuccefs of their endeavours, let 
th® children be ever fo obftinate, refraftory, or, to 

appear- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I93 

appearance, infenfible of inftruftion ; for if ever 
God in his Providence touches the confciences of 
fuch, the force of their education returns upon them, 
and the early inftruftron of parents is not loft, 
though it may have been many years laid afleep j 
but, fome time or other, they may find the benefit 
of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man. However igno- 
rant he was, or diverted of religion and Chriftian 
knowledge, he found he had fome to do with now more 
ignorant than himfelf; and that the leaft part of the 
inftruftion of his good father, that could now come 
to his mind, was of ufe to him. 

Among the reft it occurred to him, he faid, how 
his father ufed to infift much upon the inexpreflible 
value of the bible ; the privilege and blefling of it 
to nations, families, and perfons ; but he never en- 
tertained the leaft notion o(the worth of it till now ; 
when, being to talk to heathens, favages, and bar- 
barians, he wanted the help of the written oracle for 
his afliftance. 

The young woman was very glad of it alfo, for 
the prefent occafion, though fhe had one ; and fo 
had the youth on board our ftiip, among the goods 
which were not yet brought on fliore. And now, 
having faid fo many things of this young woman, I 
cannot omit telling one ftory more of her and my- 
felf, which has fomething in it very informing r^nd 
remarkable. 

I have related to what extremity the poor young 
woman was reduced j how her miftrefs was 
ftarved to death, and did die, on board that un- 
happy ftiip we met at fea ; and how the whole fhip's 

Vol. II. O company 



194 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

company being reduced to the lafl extremity, the 
gentlewoman, and her fon, and this maid, were firft 
hardly ufed, as to provifions j and, at laft, totally 
neglefted and ftarved j that is to fay, brought to 
the lafl extremity of hunger,. 

One day, being difcourfing with her upon the ex- 
tremities they fuffered, I afked her, if fhe could de- 
fcribe, by what Ihe felt, what it wastoftarve, and 
how it appeared? She told me, Ihe believed flie 
could ; and fhe told her tale very diftinftly thus : 

Firft, Sir, faid' fhe, we had for fome days fared 
exceeding hard, and fulFered very great hunger ; but 
now, at lafl, we were wholly without food of any 
kind, except fugar,^ and a little wine, and a little 
water. The firft day after I had received no food 
at all, I found myfelf, towards evening, firft empty 
and fickifh at my ftomach ; and nearer night, migh- 
tily inclined to yawning, and fleepy ; I laid down 
on a couch in the great cabin, to fleep ; and flept 
about three hours-, and awaked a little refrefhed^ 
having taken a glafs of wine when I lay down : after 
bejng about three hours awake, it being: about five 
o'clock in the morning, I found myfelf empty, and 
my ftomach fickifh again, and lai(^ down again ; but 
could not fleep at all, being very faint and ill : and 
thus I continued all the fecond day, with a ftrange 
variety ; firft hungry, then fick again, with reachings 
to vomit : the fecond' night, being obliged to go to 
bed again, without any food more than a draught of 
fair water, and being afleep, I dreamed I was at 
Barbadoes^ and that the market was mightily ftocked 
with provifions ; that I bought fome for my miftrefs, 
and went and dined very heartily* 

2 I thought 



OF kOBINSON CRUSOE. I95 

I thought my ftomach was full after this, as it 
would have been after, or at, a good dinner ; but 
when I waked, I was exceedingly ftink in my fpirits 
to find myfelf in the extremity of famine : the lad 
glafs of wine we had, I drank, and put fugar into 
k, becaufe of its having fome fpirit to fupply ndu- 
rifliment ; but there being no fubftance in the fto- 
mach for the digefting ofBce to work upon, I found 
the only effefl: of the wine was, to raife difagreeable 
fumes from the ftomach into the head; and I lay, 
as they told me, ftupid and fenfelefs, as one drunk, 
for fome time. 

The third day in the morning, after a night of 
ftrange and confufed inconfiftent dreams, and rather 
dozing than fleepingj I awaked, ravenous and fu- 
rious with hunger ; and I queftion, had not my un- 
derftanding returned, and conquered it ; I fay, I 
queftion whether, if I had been a mother, and had 
had a little child with me, its life would have been 
fafe or no. 

This lafted about three hours ; during which time 
I was twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam^ 
as my young mafter told me, arid as he can now in- 
form you. 

In one of thefe fits of lunacy, or diftraftion, whe- 
ther by the motion of the fhip, or fome flip of my 
foot, I know not j I fell down, and ftruck my face 
againft the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mif- 
trefs lay ; and with the blow the blood guflied out 
of my nofe ; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little 
bafon, I fat down and bled into it a great deal ; and 
as the blood ran from me, I came to myfelf; and the 

O 2 violence 



196 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

violence of the flame, or the fever I was in, abated, 
and fo did the ravenous part of the hunger. 

Then I grew fick, and reached to vomit, but could 
not ; for I had nothing in my ftomach to bring up : 
after I had bled fome time, I fwooned, and they all 
believed I was dead ; but I came to myfelf foon af- 
ter, and then had a moft dreadful pain in my fto- 
mach, not to be defcribed ; not like the cholic, but a 
gnawing eager pain for food ; and, towards night, 
it went off with a kind of earneft wifhing or longing 
for food ; fomething like, as I fuppofe, the long- 
ing of a woman with child. I took another draught 
of water, with fugar in it, but my ftomach loathed 
the fugar, and brought it all up again : Then 1 took 
a draught of water, without fugar, and that ftayed 
with me ; and I laid me down upon the bed, pray- 
ing moft heartily, that it would pleafe God to take 
me away ; and compofing my mind in hopes of it, I 
ilumbered awhile j and then waking, thought my- 
felf dying, being light with vapours from an empty 
ftomach : I recommended my foul to God, and ear- 
neftly wifhed that fomebody would throw me into 
the fea. 

All this while my miftrefs lay by me, juft, as I 
thought, expiring ; but bore it with much more pa- 
tience than I, and gave the laft bit of bread flie had 
to her child, my young mafter, who would not have 
taken it, but fhe obliged him to eat it j and, I believe, 
it faved his life. 

Towards the morning, I flept again ; and firft, 
when I awaked, I fell into a violent paflion of cry- 
ing ; and after that, had a fecond fit of violent hun- 
ger, fo that I got up ravenous, and in a moft dread-

ful condition : Had my miftrefs been dead, as much 
as I loved her, I am certain I fhould have eaten a 
piece of her flefli with as much relifli, and as uncon- 
cerned, as ever I did the flefh of any creature ap- 
pointed for food ; and once or twice I was going to 
bite my own arm. At laft, I faw the bafon, in 
which was the blood I had bled at my nofe the day 
before ; I ran to it, and fwallowed it with fuch haftej^ 
and fuch a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered 
nobody had taken it before, and afraid it fliould be 
taken from me now. 

Though after it was down the thoughts of it filled 
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger j 
and I drank a draught of fair water, and was compofed 
and refrefhed for fome hours after it. This was the 
fourth day ; and thus I held it till towards night, 
when, within the compafs of three hours, I had all 
thefe feveral circumftances over again, one after ano- 
ther ; viz* fick, fleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the 
ftomach, then ravenous again, then fick again, then 
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and fo 
every quarter of an hour ; and my ftrength wafted 
exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no 
comfort, but in the hope that I fhould die before 
morning. 

All this night I had no fleep, but the hunger was 
now turned into a difeafe ; and I had a terrible cho- 
lic and griping ; wind, inftead of food, having found 
its way into the bowels ; and in this condition I lay 
till morning, when I was furprized a little with 
the cries and lamentations of my young mafter, who 
called out to me, that his mother was dead. 1 lifted

myfelf up a little, for I had not ftrength to rife, but 
found fhe was not dead, though {he was able to give 
very little figns of life. 

1 had then fuch convulfions in my ftomaeh, for 
want of fome fuftenance, that I cannot defcribe them; 
with fuch frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that 
nothing but the tortures of death can imitate ; and 
this condition I was in, when I heard the feameii 
above cry out, A fail ! a fail ! and halloo and jump 
about as if they were diftrafted. 

I was not able to get off from the bed, and my 
miftrefs much lefs ; and my mafter was fo lick, that 
I thought he had been expiring ; fo we could not 
open the cabin door, or get any account what it 
was that occafioned fuch a combuftion ; nor had we 
any converfation with the fliip's company for two 
days, they having told us they had not a mouthful 
of any thing to eat in the fliip ; and they told us 
afterwards, they thought we had been dead. 

It was this dreadful condition we were in when 
you were fent to fave our lives ; and how you found 
us. Sir, you know as well as I, and better too. 

This was her own relation, and is fuch a diftincl: 
account of ftarving to death, as, Iconfefs, I never 
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : 
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, 
becaufe the youth gave me an account of a good part 
of it ; though I mud own, not fo diftind, and fo 
feelingly as his maid ; and the rather, becaufe, it 
feems, his mother fed him at the price of her oun 
life: but the poor maid, though her conftiturion 
being ftronger than that of her miftrefs, who was in

years, and a weakly woman too, fhe might ftruggk 
harder with it ; I fay, the poor maid might be fup- 
pofed to feel the extremity fomething fooner than 
lier miftrefs, who might be allowed to keep the lafl: 
bits fomething longer than fhe parted with any to 
Telieve the maid. No queftion, as the cafe is here 
•related, if our fhip, or fome other, had not fo provi- 
dentially met them, a few days more would have 
ended all their lives, unlefs they had prevented it by 
eating one another ; and even that, as their cafe 
flood, would have fcrved them but a little while, 
they being 500 leagues from any land, or any poffi- 
bility of relief, other than in the miraculous manner 
it happened. — But this is by the way ; I return to my 
:difpofition of things among the people. 

And firft, it is to be obferved here, that for many 
reafons, I did not think fit to let them know any 
thing of the floop I had framed, and which I thought of 
fetting up among them ; for I found, at leaft at my 
firft coming, fuch feeds of divifion among them? 
that I faw it plainly, had I fet up the floop, and left 
it among them, they would, upon very light difguft, 
have feparated, and gone away from one another ; 
or perhaps have turned pirates, and fo made the 
ifland a den of thieves, Inftead of a plantation of fo- 
ber and religious people, as I intended it to be ; nor 
did I leave the two pieces of brafs cannon that I had 
on board, or the two quarter deck guns, that my 
nephew took extraordinary, for the fame reafon : I 
thought they had enough to qualify them for a de- 
fenfive war, againft any that fhould invade them ; but 
I was not to fet them up for an offenfive war, or to 

4 encourage 



aOO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which, 
in the end, would only bring ruin and deftruftion 
upon themfelves and all their undertakings : I re- 
ferved the floop, therefore, and the guns, for their 
fervice another way, as I fhall obferve in its place. 

I have now done with the ifland : I left them all 
in good circumftances, and in a flourilhing condi- 
tion, and went on board my fhip again the fifth day 
of Mayy having been five-and-twenty days among 
them ; and, as they were all refolved to flay upon 
the ifland till I came to remove them, I promifed to 
fend fome further relief from the Brafils^ if I could 
poflibly find an opportunity ; and particularly I pro- 
mifed to fend them fome cattle ; fuch as fheep, hogs, 
and cows ; for as to the two cows and calves which 
I brought from England^ we had been obliged,. by 
the length of our voyage, to kill them at fea, for 
want of hay to feed them. 

The jiext day, giving them a falute of five guns 
at parting, we fet fail, and arrived at the bay of All 
Saints^ in the Brajils^ in about twenty-two days; 
meeting nothing remarkable in our paflage but this. 
That about three days after we failed, being becalmed, 
and the current fetting ftrong to the N. N. E. run- 
ning, as it were, into a bay or gulph, on the land- 
fide, we were driven fomething out of our courfe j 
and once or twice our men cried Land, to the weft- 
ward ; but whether it was the continent, or iflands, 
we could not tell by any means. 

But the third day, towards evening, the fea fmooth 
and the weather calm, we faw the fea, as it were, 
covered, towards the land, with fomething very 

black, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2or 

black, not being able to difcover what it was ; but, 
after fome time, our chief mate going up the main 
fhrouds a little way, and looking at them with a per- 
fpeftive, cried out, it was an army. I could not 
imagine what he meant by an army, and fpoke a little 
haftily, calling the fellow a fool, or fome fuch word ; 
Nay, Sir, fays he, don't be angry, for it is an army, 
and a fleet too ; for I believe there are a thoufand 
canoes, and you may fee them paddle along, and 
they are coming towards us too apace, and full of 
men. 

I was a little furprifed then, indeed, and fo was 
my nephew the captain ; for he had heard fuch ter- 
rible (lories of them in the ifland, and having never 
been in thofe feas before, that he could not tell what 
to think of it, but faid two or three times, we fhould 
all be. devoured. I muft confefs, confidering we 
were becalmed, and the current fet ftrong towards the 
fliore, I liked it the worfe ; however, I bade him not 
be afraid, but bring the fliip' to an anchor, as foon 
as we came fo near as to know that we muft engage 
them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us ; fo I gave orders to come to an an- ' 
chor, and furl all our fails. As for the favages, 
I told them they had nothing to fear from thetn but 
fire ; and therefore they fhould get their boats out, 
and faften them, one clofe by the head, and the other 
by the ftern, and man them both well, and wait the 
iffue in that pofture : this I did, that the men in the 
boats might be ready, with fheet and buckets, to put 

out 



•203 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

out any fire thefe favages might endeavour to fix upon 
the outfide of the fhip. 

In this pofture we lay by for them, and in a Kttle 
while they came up with us^ but never was fuch a 
horrid fight ff^en by Chriftians : My mate was much 
jniftaken in his calculation of their number, I mean 
of a thoufand canoes ; the mod we could make of 
them when they came up, bein^ about 126; and a 
great many of them too ; for fome of them had fif- 
teen orfeventeen men in them, fome more, and the 
ieafl fix or feven. 

When they came nearer to us, they feemed to be 
ftruck with wonder and aftonifhment, as at a fight 
which they had, doubtlefs, never feeh before; nor 
could they, at firft, as we afterwards underftood,' 
know what to make of us. They came boldly up 
however, very near to us, and feemed to go about 
to row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats, not to let them come too near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement with 
^em, without our defigning it ; for five or fix of 
their large canoes came fo near our long»boat, that 
our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep 
back ; which they underftood very well, and went 
back ; but at their retreat about 500 arrows came on 
board us from thofe boats ; and one of our men in 
the long-boat was very much wounded. ' 

However, I called to them not to fire by any means ; 
but we handed down fome deal boards into the boat, 
and the carpenter prefently let up a kind of a fence, 
like wafte boards, to cover them from the arrows of 
the favages, if they fhould (hoot again. 

About 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2Q^ 

About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a 
body aftern of us, and pretty near, fo near that we 
could eafily difcern what they were, though we could 
not tell their defign. I eafily found they were fome 
of my old friends, the fame fort of favages that I 
had be^n ufed to. engage with ; and in a little time 
more they rowed f^ewhat farther out to fea, till 
ihey came direftly troadfide with us, and then rowed 
down ftraight upon us, till they came fo near, 
that they could hear us fpeak : Upon this, I ordered 
all my men to keep clofe, left they Ihould fhoot any 
more arrows, and make all oiir guns ready; but 
being fo near as to be within hearing, I made Friday 
go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them 
in his language,' to know what they meant; which 
accordingly he did : whether they underftood him 
or not, that I know not ; but, as foon as he had 
called to them, fix of them, who were in the fore- 
moft, or nigheft boat to us, turned their canoes from 
]us ; and, (looping down, fliewed us their naked 
backfires ; juft as if, in Englijh^ (faving your pre? 

fence) they had bid us kifs . Whether 

this was a defiance or challenge, we know not ; or 
'^Vhether it was done in mere contempt, or a fignal 
to the reft ; but immediately Friday cried out. They 
were going to flioot ; and unhappily for him (poor 
fellow) they let fly about 300 of their arrows ; and, 
to my inexpreffible grief, killed poor Friday^ no other 
man. being in their fight. The poor fellow was (hot 
with no lefs than three arrows, and about three more 
fell very nigh him ; fuch unlucky markfmen they 
were ! 

I was 



204 J^II'E AND ADVENTURES 

I was fo enraged with the lofs of my old fervant, 
the companion of all my forrows and folitudes, that 
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with 
fmall Ihot, and four with great ; and gave them fuch . 
a broadfide as they had never had in their lives be- 
fore, to be fure. 

They were not above half a cable's length off 
when we fired ; and our gunners took their aim fo 
well, that three or four of their canoes were over- 
fet, as we had reafon to believe, by one Ihot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backfides 
to us, gave us no great offence ; neither did I know 
for certain whether that, which would pafs for the 
greateft contempt among us, might be underftood fo 
by them or not j therefore in return, I had only re- 
folved to have fired four or five guns with powder 
only, which I knew would fright them fufficiently : 
but when they fliot at us direftly with all the fury they 
were capable of, and efpecially as they had killed my 
poor Friday y whom I fo entirely loved and valued, 
and who, indeed, fo well deferved it ; I not only had 
been juftified before God and man, but would have 
been very glad, if I could; to have overfet every 
canoe there, and drowned every one of them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, or how 
many we wounded, at this broadfide ; but fure fuch 
a fright and hurry never was feen among fuch a 
multitude : there were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes fplit, and overfet, in all ; and the men all fet 
a fwimming ; the reft, frighted out of their wits, 
fcoured away as faft as they could, taking but little 
care to fave thofe whofe boats were fplit or fpoiled 
with our fhot : fo I fuppofe that they were many of

them loft ; and our men took up one poor fellow 
fwimming for his life, above an hour after they were 
all gone. 

. Our fmall (hot from our cannon muft needs kill 
and wound a great many ; but, in fhort, we never 
knew any thing how it went with them ; for they 
fled fo faft, that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we 
could not fee above three or four ftraggling canoes ; 
nor did we ever fee the reft any more ; for a breeze 
of wind fpringing up the fame evening, we weighed 
and fet fail for the Brajils. 

We had a prifoner indeed, but the creature was 
fo fullen, that he would neither eat or fpeak ; and 
we all fancied he would ftarve himfelf to death ; but 
I took a way to cure him ; for I made them take 
him, and turn him into the long-boat, and make him 
believe they would tofs him into the fea again, and 
fo leave him where they foimd him, if he would not 
fpeak : nor would that do, but they really did throw 
him into the fea, and came away from him ; and then 
he followed them, for he fwam like a cork, and 
called to them in his tongue, though they knew not 
one word of what he faid. However, at laft, they 
took him in again, and then he began to be more 
tradable j nor did I ever defign they ftiould drown 
him. 

We were now under fail again ; but I was the moft 
difconfolate creature alive, for want of my man 
Friday J and would have been very glad to have gone 
back to the ifland, to have taken one of the reft 
from thence for ray occafion, but it could not be ; 
fo we went on. We had one prifoner, as I have faid ; 
and it was a long while before we could make him

106 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

underftand any thing ; but, in time, our men taught 
him fome Englijh^ and he began to be a little trada- 
ble : Afterwards we enquired what country he came 
from, but could make nothing of what he faid ; for 
his fpeech was fo odd, all gutturals, and fpoken m 
the throat, in fuch an hollow and odd manner, that 
we could never form a word from him ; and we were 
all of opinion that they niight fpeak that language 
as well, if they were gagged, as otherwife ; nor 
could we perceive that they had any occafion either 
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate ; but formed their 
words juft as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an 
open throat : He told us, however, fome time after, 
when we had taught him to fpeak a little EngUjhi 
that they were going, with their kings, to fight a 
great battle. When he faid kings y we alked him, 
how many kings ? He faid, there were five nation, 
(we could not make him underftand the plural s.) 
and that they all joined to go againft two nation. 
We afked him. What made them come up to us ? 
He faid. To makee te great wonder look — Where it 
is to be obferved, that all thofe natives, as alfo thofe 
of Africa^ when they learn Englijby they ajtways add 
two ^'s at the end of the words where we ufe one, 
and place the accent upon the laft of them ; as 
makee J takee^ and the likej and we could not break 
them of it ; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave 
it off, thought at laft he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
muft take my laft leave of him ; poor honeft Friday! 
We buried him with all decency and folenmity pofli- 
ble, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him 
into the fea ; and I caufed them to fire eleven guns

for him t and fo ended the life of the moft grateful, 
faithful, honeft, and moft aflfeftionate fervant that 
ever man had. 

We now went away with a fair wind for Brajil^ 
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the 
latitude of five degrees fouth of the line, being the 
north-eaftermoft land of all that part of AmericL 
We kept on S. by E. in fight of the fliore four days, 
when we made the Cape S/. Augujiine^ and in three 
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints^ 
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came 
both my good and evil fate. 

Never did a Ihip come to this part that had lefs 
bufmefs than I had \ and yet it was with great diffi- 
culty that we were admitted to hold the leaft corref- 
pondence on fliore. Not my partner himfelf, who 
was alive, and made a great figure among them, 
not my two merchant truftees, nor the fame of my 
wonderful prefervation in the ifland, could obtain 
me that favour : but my partner, remembering that 
I had given five hundred moidores to the prior of 
the monaftery of the Augujlines^ and three hundred 
and feventy-two to the poor, went to the monaftery, 
and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the go* 
vernor, and beg leave for me prefently, with the 
captain, and one more, befides eight feamen, to come 
on fliore, and no more ; and this upon condition • 
abfolutely capitulated for, that we fliould not offer 
to land any goods out of the ftiip, or to carry any 
perfon away without licence. 

They were fo ftrifl: with us, as to landing any 
goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got 
on fliore three bales of Englijh goods, fuch as fine 

broad 



208 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

broad cloths, ftufFs, and fome linen, which I had 
brought for a prefent to my partner. 

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, 
though (like me) he came from little at firft ; and 
though he knew not that I had the leaft defign of 
giving him any thing, he fent me on board a pre- 
fent of frefh provifions, wine, and fweetmeats, worth 
above thirty moidores, including fome tobacco, and 
three or four fine medals in gold. But I was even 
with him in my prefent, which, as I haye faid, con- 
fifted of fine broad cloth, Englijh ftuifs, lace, and fine 
Hollands. Alfo, I delivered him about the value of 
I col. fterling, in the fame goods, for other ufes; 
and I obliged him to fet up the floop which. I had 
brought with me from England^ as I have faid, for 
the ufe, of my colony, in order to fend the refrefh- 
ments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly he got hands, and finiftied the floop 
in a very few days, for flie was already framed ; and 
I gave the mafter of her fuch inftruftions as he could 
not mifs the place ; nor did he mifs it, as I had an 
account from my partner afterwards. I got him 
foon loaded with the fmall cargo I had fent them ; 
and one of our feamen, that had been on fhore with 
me there, offered to go with the floop, and fettle 
there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard^ to 
allot him a fufficlent quantity of laiid for a planta- 
tion ; and giving him fome clothes, and tools for his 
planting work, which he faid he underftood, having 
been an old planter in Maryland^ and a buccaneer 
into the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he de- 
fired J and, as an addition, I gave him the favage 

which

"which we had taken prifoner of war, to be his flave^ 
and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him his 
Ihare of every thing he wanted, with the reft. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old part- 
ner told me, there was a certain very honeft fellow, 
a Braftl planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the difpleafure of the church : I know not what 
the matter is with him, fays he, but, on my con- 
fcience, I think he is an heretic in his heart ; and he 
bas been obliged to conceal himfelf for fear of the 
inquifition ; that he would be very glad of fuch an 
opportunity to make his efcape, with his wife and 
two daughters ; and if I would let them go to the 
ifland, and allot them a plantation, he would give 
them a fmall ftock to begin with ; for the officers 
of the inquifition had feized all his effefts and eftate, 
and he had nothing left but a little houfhold ftufF, 
and two flaves ; and, adds he, though I hate his 
principles, yet I would not have him fall into their 
hands, for he will alfuredly be burnt alive if he 
does. 

I granted this prefently, and joined my Engli/h-^ 
man with them ; and we concealed the man, and his 
wife and daughters, on board our fhip, till the floop 
put out to go to fea ; and then (having put all theif 
goods on board the floop fome time before) we put 
them onboard the floop, after flie was got out of^thebay. 

Our feaman was mightily pleafed with this new 
partner; and their ftock, indeed, was much alike 
rich in tools, and in preparations, for a farm ; but 
nothing to begin with, but as above* However, they 
carried over with them (which was worth all the reft) 
fome materials for planting fugar canes, with fome

plants of canes ; which he (I mean the Portugal 
man) underftood very well. 

Among the reft of the fupplies fent my tenants 
in the ifland, I fent them, by this floop, three milch 
cows and five calves, about twenty-two bogs among 
them, three fows big with pig, two mares, and a 
ftone-horfe. 

For my Spaniards^ according to my promife, I 
engaged three Portugal women to go ; and recom- 
mended it to them to marry them, and ufe them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I 
remembered that the poor perfecuted man had two 
daughters, and there were but five of the Spaniards 
that wanted ;' the reft had wives of their own, the' 
in another country- 
All this cargo arrived fafe, and as you may cafily 
fuppofe, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who 
were now (with this addition) between fixty and fe- 
venty people, befides little children ; of which there 
were a great many : I found letters at London from 
them all, by way of Lijbon, when I came back to Eng- 
land^ being fent back to the Brajtls by this Hoop ; of 
which I fliall take fome notice in its place. 

I have now done with my ifland, and all manner 
of difcourfe about it j and whoever reads the reft 
of my memorandums, would do well to turn bis 
thoughts entirely from it, and expefl: to read only of 
the follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, ' 
much lefs by thofe of other men, to beware of the like j 
not cooled by almoft forty years mifery and difap- 
pointments ; not fatisfied with profperity beyond 
expeftation ; not made cautious by affUftion and dif- 
trefs beyond imitation. 

I had

I had no more bufinefs to go to theEq^ Indies, than 
a man at full liberty, and having committed no 
crime, has to go to the turn-key at Newgate, and 
defire him to lock him up among the prifoners there, 
and ftarve him. Had I taken a fmall veffel from 
England, and went difedlly to the ifland ; had I 
loaded her, as I did the other veffel, with all the ne- 
ceflkries for the plantation, and for my people; took 
a patent from the government here, to have fecured 
my property, in fubjeSion only to that of England, 
which, to be fure, I might have obtained ; had I 
carried over cannon and ammunition, fervants, and 
people to plant, and, taking poffeffion of the place, 
fortified and ftrengthened it in the name of England, 
andincreafed it with people, as I might eafilyhave done j 
had I then fettled myfelf there, and fent the fliip back, 
loaded with good rice, as I might alfo have done in 
fix months time, and ordered my friends to have 
fitted her out again for our fupply ; had I done this, 
and flayed there myfelf, I had, at leaft, aded like a 
man of common fenfe ; but I was poffeffed with 
a wandering fpirit, fcorned all advantages, pleafed 
myfelf with being the patron of thefe people I had 
placed there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty 
majeftic way, like an old patriarchal monarch ; pro- 
viding for them, as if I had been father of the whole 
family, as well as of the plantation : but I never fo 
much as pretended to plant in the name of any go- 
vernnient or natiqn, or to acknowledge any prince, 
or to call my people fubjeds to any one nation more

But I was gone a wild-goofe chafe indeed ; and 
they who will have any more of me, muft be content to

I fay this with refpefl: to the impetuous defire I 
had from a youth, to wander into the world ; and 
how evident it now was, that this principle was pre- 
ferred in me for my punifhment. How it ^ came on,

of it, it is eafy to give you hiftorically, and with its 
utmoft variety of particulars. But the fecret ends

P 3 From 



214 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

From the BrafiU vjz made dlredly away over the 
Atlantic fea, to the Cape de Bonne Efperance^ or, as 
we call it, the Cape of Good Hope ; and had a tole- 
rable good voyage, our courfe generally fouth-eaft ; 
now and then a ftorm, and fome contrary winds. 
But my difafters at fea were at an end ; my future 
rubs and crofs events were to befal me on fhore ; that 
it might appear, the land was as well prepared to be 
our fcourge as the fea, when Heaven, who direfts 
the circumftances of things, pleafes to appoint it to 
be fo. 

Our (hip was on a trading voyage, and had a fu- 
per-cargo on board, who was to diredt all her mo- 
tions, after (he arrived at the Cape ; only being li- 
mitted to a certain number of days for ftay, by char- 
ter-party, at the feveral ports fhe was to go to : this 
was none of x^^ bufmefs, neither did I meddle with 
it at all ; my nephew, the captain, and the fuper- 
cargo, adjufting all thofe things between them as 
they thought fit. 

We made no ftay at the Cape^ longer than was 
needful to take in frefli water, but made the beft of 
our way for the coaft of Coromande ; we were 
indeed informed that a French man of war of 
fifty guns, and two large merchant fhips, were gone 
for the Indies ; and, as I knew we were at war with 
France^ I had fome apprehenfions of them ; but they 
went their own way, and we heard no more of 
them. 

1 fhall not pefter my account, or the reader, with 
defcriptions of places, journals of our voyages, va- 
riations of the compafs, latitudes, meridian diftances, 
trade winds, fituation of ports, and the like ; fuch 

as 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

as almoft all the hiftories of long navigation are full 
of, and which make the reading tirefome enough ; 
and are perfeftly unprofitable to all that read, ex- 
cept only to thofe who are to go to thofe places 
themfelves. 

It is enough to name the ports and places which 
we touched at j and what occurred to us upon our 
paffing from one to another. We touched firft at 
the ifland of Madagafcar^ where, though the peo- 
ple are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, 
very well armed with lances and bows, which they 
ufe with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very 
well with them awhile ; they treated us very civilly ; 
and for fome trifles which we gave them, fuch as 
knives, fciffars, &c. they brought us eleven good fat 
bullocks, middling in fize, but very good in flefh ; 
which we took in, partly for frefli provifions for our 
prefent fpending, and the reft to fait for the Ihip's 
ufe. 

We were obliged to ftay here for fome time, after 
we had furniflied ourfelves with provifions; and I, 
that was always too curious to look into every nook 
of the world wherever I came, was for going on fhore 
as often as I could. It was on the eaft fide of the 
ifland that we went on fliore one evening ; and the 
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came 
thronging about us, and ftood gazing at us at a dis- 
tance J as we had traded freely with them, and had 
been kindly ufed, we thought ourfelves in no dan- 
ger : but when we faw the people, we cut three 
boughs out of a tree, and ftuck them up at a diftance 
from us, which, it feems, is a mark in the country, 
not only of truce and friendfliip, but when it is ac- 

P 4 cepted. 



2l6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

cepted, the other fide fet up three poles, or bought, 
alfo ; which is a fignal that they accept the truce too j 
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that 
you are not to pafs beyond their three poles towards 
them, nor they come paft your three poles or boughs 
towards you ; fo that you are perfeftly fecure within 
the three poles ; and all the fpace between your poles 
and their*s, is allowed like a market, for free con- 
verfe, traffick, and commerce. When you go thi- 
ther, you muft not carry your weapons with you; 
and if they come into that fpace, they fiick up their 
javelins and launces, all at the firft poles, and come 
on unarmed ; but if any violence is oftered them, 
and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the 
poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then the 
truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on fhore, 
that a greater number of their people came dawn 
than ufual, but was all very friendly and civil. They 
brought with them feveral kinds of provifions, for 
which we fatisfied them with fuch toys as v/e had ; 
their v/omen alfo brought us milk and roots, and 
feveral things very acceptable to us, and all was 
quiet ; and we made us a little tent, or hut, of fome 
boughs of trees, and lay on ftiore all that night. 

I know not what was the occafion, but I was not 
fo well fatisfied to lie on fhore as the reft ; and the 
boat lying at an anchor about a ftone's caft from the 
land, with two men in her to take care of her, I 
made one of them come on fhore ; and getting fome 
boughs of trees to cover us alfo in the boat, I fpread 
the fail on the bottom of the boat, and Uy on board, 
2 under 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

nnder the cover of the branches of the trees, all 
night. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of 
our men make a terrible noife oh the fhore, calling 
out for GoD*s fake to bring the boat in, and come and 
help them, for they were all like to be murdered ; 
at the fame time I heard the firing of five mufquets, 
which was the number of the guns they had, and 
that three times over ; for, it feems, the natives here 
were not fo eafily frighted with guns as the favages 
were in America^ where I had to do with them. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; 
but roufing immediately from fleep with the noife, I 
caufed the boat to be thruft in, and refolved, with 
three fufils we had on board, to land and aflift our 
men. 

We got the boat foon to the fhore ; but our men 
were in too much hafte ; for, being come to the 
fhore, they plunged into the water, to get to the 
boat with all the expedition they could, being pur- 
fued by between three and four hundred men. Our 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had 
fufils with them ; the refl, indeed, had piftols and 
fwords, but they were of fmall ufe to them. 

We took up feven of our men, and with difficulty 
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; 
^nd that which was flill worfe, was, that while we 
flood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on fhore ; for they 
poured their arrows in upon us fo thick, that we 
were fain to barricade the fide of the boat up with 
the benches, and two or three loofe boards, which, 

to 



XI 8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to our great fatisfaftion, we had, by mere accident, 
or providence rather, in the boat. 

And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it fecms^ 
fuch exaft markfmen, that if they could have fcen 
but the leaft part of any of us, they would have 
been fure of us : we had, by the light of the moon, 
a little fight of them, as they flood pelting us from 
the fliore with darts and arrows; and, having got 
ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley; and 
we could bear by the cries of fome of them, that we 
had wounded feveral ; however they ftood thus in 
battle array on the fhore till break of day, which 
we fuppofe was, that they might fee the better to 
take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to wei^h our anchor, or fet up our fail, becaufe wc 
muft iieeds ftand up in the boat, and they were as 
fure to hit us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree with 
fmall fhot : we made fignals of diflrefs to the fliip, 
which though fhe rode a league off, yet my nephew, 
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glaffes per- 
ceiving the pofture we lay in, and that we fired to* 
wards the fliore, pretty well underftood us ; and> 
weighing anchor with all fpeed, he ftood as near the 
fiiore as he durft with the fliip, and then fent another 
boat, with ten hands in her, to affift us ; but we 
called to them not to come too near, telling them 
what condition we were in : however, they ftood in 
nearer to us ; and one of the men, taking the end 
of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our boat be^ 
tween him and the enemy, fo that they could not 
perfedly fee him, fwam on board us, and made the line 
faft to the boat j upon which we flipt. our little cable, 
I and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 2I9 

and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out 
of the reach of the arrows ; we all the while lying 
clofe behind the barricade we had made. 

As foon as we were got from between the fhip and 
the Ihore, that (he could lay her fide to the fliore, w^ 
ran along juft by theni, and we poured in a broad-? 
fide among them, loaded with pieces of iron and 
lead, fmall bullets, and fuch fluff, befides the great 
Ihot, which- made a terrible havock among them. 

When we were got on board, and out of danger, 
we had time to examine into the occafion of this 
fray ; and, indeed, our fupercargo, who hcd been 
often in thofe parts, put me upon it ; for he faid he 
was fure the inhabitants would not have touched us 
after we had made a truce, if we had not doie fome- 
thing to provoke them to it : At lepgth it c;ime out, 
viz. That an old woman, who had come :o fell us 
forae milk, had brought it within our poles, with a 
young woman with her, who alfo brought fome 
roots or herbs ; and while the old woman ^whether 
ihe was mother to the young woman or no, they 
could not tell) was felling us the milk, one of our 
men offered fome rudenefs to the wench that was 
with her ; at which the old woman made a great 
noife. However, thp feaman would not quit his 
prize, but carried her out of the old woman's fight, 
among the trees, it being almoft dark ; the old wo- 
man went away without her ; and^ as we fuppofe, 
made an outcry among the people fhe came from ; 
who, upon notice, raifed this great army upon us in 
three or four hours ; 'and it was great odds but we 
had been all deftroyed. 

One 



220 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was 
thrown at him, juft at the beginning of the attack, 
as he fallied out of the tent we had made ; the reft 
came off free, all but the fellow who was the occafion 
of all the mifchief, who paid dear enough for his 
black miftrefs, for we could not hear what became 
of him a great while. We lay upon the fhore two 
days after, though the wind prefented, and made fig- 
nals for him ; made our boat fail up fhore, and down 
fliore, feveral leagues, but in vain ; fo we were 
obliged to give him over ; and if he alone had fuf- 
fered for it, the lofs had been the lefs. 

I cou d not fatisfy myfelf, however, without ven- 
turing oil fhore once more, to try if I could learn any 
thing of him or them ; it was the third night after the 
aftlon, that I had a great mind to learn, if I could 
by any means, what mifchief we had done, and how 
the game flood on the Indian fide : I was careful to 
do it in :he dark, left we fhould be attacked again ; 
but I ought indeed to have been fure, that the men 
I went with had been under my command, before I 
engaged in a thing fo hazardous and mifchievous^ 
as I was brought into it without my knowledge or 
defire. 

We took twenty ftout fellows with us as any in 
the fhip, befides the fupercargo and myfelf ; and we 
landed two hours before midnight, at the fame place 
where the Indians ftood drawn up the evening befc^e : 
I landed here, becaufe my defign, as I have faid, was 
chiefly to fee if they had quitted the field, and if they 
had left any marks behind them, or of the mifchief 
we had done them ; and I thought, if we could fur- 

prife 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 221 

pirife one or two of them, perhaps we might get our 
man again, by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noife, and divided our 
men into two companies, whereof the boatfvyain com- 
manded one, and I the other : We neither could hear 
nor fee any body ftir when we landed ; fo we marched 
up, one body at a diftance from the other, to the 
field of battle : At firft we could fee nothing, it be- 
ing very dark j but by and by, our boatfwain, that 
led the firft party, ftumbled and fell over a dead bo- 
dy : This made them halt there awhile ; for knowing 
by the circumftances, that they were at the place 
where the Indians had ftood, they waited for my 
coming up : Here we concluded to halt till the moon 
began to rife, which we knew would be in lefs than 
an hour ; and then we could eafily difcern the havock 
we had made among them : We told two-and-thirty 
bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite 
dead. Some had an arm, and fome a leg, fhot off; 
and one his head : Thofe that were wounded, we 
fuppofed they had carried away. 

"VJhen we had made, as I thought, a full difcovery 
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for 
going on board again ; but the boatfwain and his 
party often fent me word, that they were refolved to 
make a vifit to the Indian town, where thefe dogs, 
as they called them, dwelt ; and defired me to go 
slong with them ; and if they could find them, as 
they ftill fancied they fhould, they did not doubt, 
they faid, getting a good booty j and it might be, 
they might find Thomas Jeffrys there : that was the 
^nan^s name we had loft. 

Had 



^24 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Had they fent to alk my leave to go, I knew well 
enough what anfwer to have given them ; for I would 
have commanded them inftantly on board, knowing 
it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a 
fiiip, and a fliip^s loadirlg in our charge, and a voyage 
to make, which depended very m^bch upon the lives 
of the men j but as they fent me word they were 
refolved to go, and only afked me and my com- 
pany to go along wi^h them, I pofitively refufed it, 
and rofe up (for I was fitting on the ground) in or- 
der to go to the boat. One or two of the men began 
to importune me to go j and, when I ftill refufed 
pofitively, began to grumble, and fay they were not 
under my command, and they would go. Come, 
jfacky fays one of the men, will you go with me ? 
I will go for one. Jack faid he would; and ano* 
ther followed, and then another ; and, in a word, 
they all left me but one, whom, with much difficulty 
too, I perfuaded to flay : fo the fupercargo and I, 
with one man, went back to the boat, ^vhere, I told 
them, we would ftay for them, and take care to take 
in as many of them as fhould be left ; for I told 
them, it was a mad thing they were going about, 
and fuppofed moft of them would run the fate of 
TAomas Jeffrys. 

They told me, like feamen, theyM warrant it they 
would come off again ; and they would take care, 
&c. So away they went. I intreated them to coa- 
fider the ftiip, and the voyage ; that their lives were 
not their ownj and that they were intrufted with 
the voyage, in fome meafure ; that if they mifcar- 
ried, the fliip might be loft for want of their help ; 

and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 223 

and that they could not anfwer it to GoD and man. 
I faid a great deal more to them on that head, but I 
might as well have talked to the main-maft of the 
fliip ; they were mad upon their journey ; only they 
gave me good words, and begged I would not be 
angry ; faid they would be very cautious, and they 
did not doubt but they would be back again in 
about an hour, at fartheft ; for the Indian town, they 
laid, was not above half a mile off; though they 
found it above two miles before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above ; and though 
the attempt was defperate, and fuch as none but mad- 
men would have gone about, yet, to give them their 
due, they went about it warily, as well as boldly. 
They were gallantly armed, that is true ; for they 
had every man a fufil or mufquet, a bayonet, and 
every man a piftol ; fome of them had broad cut- 
laffes, fome of them hangers ; and the boatfwain, 
and two more, had pole-axes : befides all which, they 
had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder 
fellows, and better provided, never went about any 
wicked work in the world. 

When they went out, their chief defign was 
plunder ; and they were in mighty hopes of finding 
gold there ; but a circumftance, which none of them 
were aware of, fet them on fire with revenge, and 
made devils of them all : When they came to the 
few Indian houfes, which they thought had been the 
town, which were not above half a mile off, they 
were under a great difappointment ; for there were 
not above twelve or thirteen houfes ; and where the 
town was, or how big, they knew not : They con- 

fulted 



a24 LI^E AND ADVENTURER 

fulted therefore what to do, and were fome time be^ 
fore they could refolve : for if they fell upon thefe, 
they muft cut all their throats ; and it was ten to 
one but fome of them might efcape, it being in the 
night, though the moon was up ; and if one efcaped, 
he would run away, and raife all the town, fo they 
Ihould have a whole army upon them. Again, on 
the other hand, if they went away, and left thofe 
untouched (for the people were all afleep) they could 
not tell which way to look for the town. 

However, the lafl wa« the beft advice 5 fo they re- 
folved to leave thofe houfes, and look for the town as 
well as they could : They went on a little way, and 
found a cow tied to a tree : this they prefently con- 
cluded would be a good guide to them ; for they 
faid the cov/ certainly belonged to the town before 
them, or the town behind them ; and if they untied 
her, they -fliould fee which way fhe went : if flie went 
back, they had nothing tc fay to her ; but if fhe 
went forward, they had nothing to do but to fol- 
low her ; fo they cut the cord, which was made of 
twifled flags, and the cow went on before them : In 
a word, the cow led them direftly to the town, which, 
as they reported, confifted of above 200 houfes, or 
huts ; and in fome of thefe. they found feveral fa- 
milies living together. 

Here they found all filent ; as profoundly fecure, 
as fleep and a coijaitry that had never feen an enemy 
of that kind, could make them. Upon this they 
called another council, to confider what they had to 
do ; and, in a word, they refolved to divide theni- 
felves into three bodies, and to fet three houfes on 

fire 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE* 225 

fire in three parts of the town ; and as the men came 
out, to feize them, and bind them j if any refilled, 
they need not be alked what to do then ; and fo to 
fearch the reft of the houfes for plunder ; but re- 
folved to march filently firft through the town, and 
fee what dimenfions it was of, and confider if they 
might venture upon it, or no. 

They did fo, and defperately refolved that they 
would venture upon them ; but while they were ani- 
tnating one another to the work, three of them, that 
were a little before the reft, called out aloud, and 
told them they had found Thovias Jeffrys ; they all 
ran up to the place, and fo it was indeed, for there 
they found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by one 
arm, and his throat cut : There was an Indian houfe 
juft by the tree, where they found fixteen or feven- 
teen of the principal Indians yV/ho had been con- 
cerned in the fray with us before, and two or three 
of them wounded with our fhot ; and our men found 
they were awake, and talking one to another in that 
houfe, but knew not their number. 

The fight of their poor mangled comrade fo en* 
raged them, as before, that they fwore to one ano- 
ther they would be revenged, and that not an Indian 
who came into their hands fliould have quarter ; and 
to work they went immediately; and yet not fo madly 
as by the rage and fury they were in might be expefiked. 
Their firft care was to get fomething that would foon 
take fire ; but after a little fearch, they found that 
would be to no purpofe, for moft of the houfes were 
low, and thatched with flags or rufhes, of which the 
country is full j fo they prefently made fome wild 

Vol. II. C^ fire. 



226 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in the 
palms of their hands j and, in a quarter of an hour, 
they fet the towrt on fire in four or five places ; and 
particularly that houfc where the Indians were not 
gone to bed. As Joon as the fire began t& blaze, 
the poor frighted creatures began to rufh out to fave 
their lives ; but met with their fate in the attempt, 
and efpecially at the door, where they drove them 
back, the boatfwain himfelf killing one or two with 
his pole-axe ; the houfe being large, and many in it, 
lie did not care to go in, but called for an hand gre- 
nado, and threw it among theiti, which, at firft, 
frighted them ; but when it burft, made fuch havock 
among them, that they cried out in a hideous 
manner. 

In fhort, moft of the Indians who were in the open 
part of the houfe, were killed or hurt with the gre- 
nado, except two or three more, who preffed to the 
door, which the boatfwain and two more kept with 
the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dif- 
patched all who came that way. But there was ano- 
ther apartment in the houfe, where the prince, or 
king, or whatfoever he was, and feveral others, were; 
anfi they kept in, till the houfe, which was by this 
time all of a light flam^, fell in upon them, and they 
were fmothered, or burnt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, becaufe they 
would not waken the people fafter than they could 
mafter them j but the fire began to waken them 
fad enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a 
little together in bodies ; for the fire grew fo raging, 
all the houfes being made of light combuftible ftuff, 
that they could hardly bear the fl:reet between them ; 

and

and their bufinefs was to follow the fire for the furer 
* Execution : As faft as the fire either forced the peo- 
ple out of thofe houfes which were burnings or 
frighted them out of others, our people were ready 
at their doors to knock them on the head, flill calling 
and hallooing to one another to remember Thomas 
Jeffrys. 

While this was doiiig, I mufl coftfefs I was Very 
uneafy, and efpecially, wheA I faw the flames of the 
town, which, it being night, feemed to be jufl by 
me. 

My nephew> the captain, who wag roufed by his 
men too, feeing fuch a fire, was very uneafy, not 
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I 
was in ; efpecially hearing the guns too ; for by this 
time they began to ufe their fire-arms : A thoufand 
thoughts oppfcffed his mind concerning me and the 
fupercargo, what fhould become of us : and at laft, 
though he could ill fpare any more men, yet, not 
jknowirtg what exigence we might be in, he takes 
another boat, and with thirteen men and himfelf 
comes on ihore to me. 

He was furprifed to fee me and the fupercargo in 
the boat, with. no more than two men, for one had 
been left to keep the boat ; and though he was glad 
that we were well ; yet he was in the fame impa- 
tience with us to know what was doing 5 for the noife 
continued, and the flame increafed : I confefs it was 
hext to an impoffibility for any men in the world to 
reftrain their curiolity of knowing what had happen- 
ed. Or their concern for the fafety of the men. In a 
word, the captain told me, he would go and help his

I did before with the men, the fatety of the fhip, and 
the danger of the voyage, the intereft x>{ the owners 
and merchants, &c. and told him I would go, and the 
two men, and only fee if we could, at a diftance, 
karn what was like to be the event, and come back 
and tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to 
talk to the reft before ; he would go, he faid, and 
he only wifhed he had left but ten men in the Ihip ; 
for he could not think of having his men loft for 
want of help : he had rather, he faid, lofe the fhip, 
the voyage, and his life, and all : And fo away 
went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ftay behind now, than 
I was to perfuade them not to go before ; lb, in 
Ihort, the captain ordered two men to row back the 
pinnace, and fetch ^welve men more from the fhip, 
leaving the long-boat at an anchor ; and that when 
they-came back, fix men fhould keep the two boats, 
and fix more come after us ; fo that he left only fix* 
teen men in the fhip ; for the whole fhip's company 
confifted of 6^ men, whereof two were loft i'a the firft 
quarrel which brought this mifchief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be fure we 
felt little of the ground we trod on ; and being 
guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went di- 
reftly to the place of the flame. If the noife of the 
guns were furprifing to us before, the cries of the poor 
people were now quite of another nature, and fill d us 
with horror. I muft confefs I never was at the facking 
of a city, or at the takijig of a town by ftorm ; I have 

heard

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2Xg 

heard of Oliver Cromwell tdking Drogheda, in Ireland^ 
and killing man, woman, and child ; and I had read of 
Count Tilly, facking the city of Magdebourg^ and 
cutting the throats of 22000 of both fexes ; but I 
never had an idea of the thing itfelf before ; nor is 
it poflible to defcribe it, or the horror which was up- 
on our minds at hearing it. 

However we went on, and, at length, came to the 
town, though there was no entering the ft;-eets of it 
for the fire. The firft objedk we met with was the 
ruins of a hut or houfe, or rather the aihes of it, 
for the houfe was confumed ; and juft before it, 
plain now to be feen by the light of the fire, lay four 
men and three women killed ; and, as we thought, 
one or two more lay in the heap among the fire. In 
fhort, thefe were fuch inftances of a rage altogether 
barbarous, and of a fury fomething beyond what 
was human, that we thought it impoflible our men 
could be guilty of it ; or, if they were the authors 
of it, we thought that every one of them ought to 
be put to the word of deaths : But this was not all ; 
we faw the fire increafed forward, and the cry went 
on juft as the fire went on, fo that we were in the 
utmoft confufion. We advanced a little way far- 
ther; and beheld, to our aftonifliment, three women 
naked, crying in a moft dreadful manner, and flying 
as if they had, indeed, had wings, and after them 
fixteen qr feventeen men, natives, in the fame terror 
and confternation, with three of our Englijh hntcYitrs^ 
(for I can call them no better) in the rear ; who, 
when they could not overtake them, fired in among 
them, arid one that was killed by their Ihot, fell 
down in our fight j when the reft faw us, believing

them, as well as thofe that purfued them, theyfet

and two of them fell down as if already dead with 
the fright. 

My very foul fhrunk within me, and my blood 
rj^n chill in my veins when I faw this ; and I believe, 
had the three Englijh failors that purfued them come 
on, I had made our men kill them all. However, 
we took fome ways to let the poor flying creatures 
know that we would not hurt them ; and immedi- 
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with 
their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentations to 
us to fave them, which we let them know we would 
do ; whereupon they kept all together in a huddle, 
clofe behind us, for protedion. I left my men drawn 
up together, and charged them to hurt nobody, but, 
if poffible, to get at fome of our people, and fee 
what devil it was poflefTed them, and what they in- 
tended to do ; and, in a word, to command them 
off; alTuring them, that if they ftaid till day-light, 
they would have a hundred thoufand men about their 
cars ; I fay, I left them, and went among thofe Ayr 
ing people, taking only two of our men with me : 
and there was, indeed, a piteous fpedacle among 
them : Some of them had their feet terribly burnt 
with trampling and running through the fire ; others 
their hands burnt ; one of the women had fallen 
down in the fire, and was almoft burnt to death be.

men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our 
men purfuing ; and another was fhot through the

T would fain have learned what the occafion of all 
this was, but I could not underftand one word they 
faid, ;though by figns I perceived that fome of them 
knew not what was the occafion themfelves. I was 
fo terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt, 
that I could not ftay there, but went back to my 
own njien : I told them myxefolution, and commands 
ed them to follow me, when in the very moment 
came four of our men, with the boatfwain at their 
head, running over the heaps of bodies they had 
killed, all covered with blood and duft, as if they 
wanted more people to mafTacre ; when our men 
hallooed to them a.8 Ipud as they could halloo ; and, 
with much ado, one of them made them hear; 
fo that they knew who we were^ and came up to 

As foon as the boatfwajin faw us, he fet up a hal. 
Ipo, like a fhout of triumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come ; and without bearing to 
hear me, CJaptain, fays he, noble captain, I am glad 
you are come ; we have not half done yet : Vilr 
Jains ! hell-hound dogs !• I will kill as many of them 
as poor Tom has hairs upon his head. We have 
fworn to fpare none of them ; we will root out the 
very name of them from the earth : and thus he ran 
on, out of breath too with adion, and would i^ot 
give us leave to fpeak a word. 

At laft, raifing my voice that I might filence him 
a little : Barbarous dog ! faid I, what are you doing ? 
I won't have one creature touched more, upon pain 
of death. I charge you, upon your life, to flop 
your hands, and ftand ftill here, or you are a dead 
man this minute, 

q.4 Why, 



232 JL1F£ AND ADVENTURES 

Why, Sir, fays he, do you know what you do, 
or what they have done ? If you want a reafon for 
what we have done, come hither ; and with that he 
Ihewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree, with 
his throat cut. 

I confefs I was urged then myfelf, and at ano- 
ther time fhould have been forward enough ; but I 
thought they h*id carried their rage too far, and 
thought of JacoF^ words to his fons Simeon and Levi^ 
^^ Curfed be their rniger^ for it was fierce ; and their 
*V wrath J for it wai cruelJ"^ But I had now a new 
tafk upon my hands ; for when the men I carried 
with me faw the fight, as I had done, I had as much 
to do to reffrain them, as I ftiould have had with the 
others ; nay, my nephew himfelf fell in with them, 
and told me, in their hearing, that he was only con- 
cerned for fear of the men being overpowered ; for, 
as to the people, he thought not one of them ought 
to live ; for they had all glutted themfelves with the 
murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be 
ufed like murderers : upon thefe words, away ran 
eight of my men with the boatfwain and his crew, 
to complete their bloody work : and I, feeing it quite 
out of my power to reftrain them, came away pen- 
five and fad ; for I could not bear the fight, much 
lefs the horrible noife and cries of the poor wretches 
that fell into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the fuper- 
cargo and two men, and with thefe I walked back to 
the boats. It was a very great piece of folly in me, 
I confefs, to venture back as it were alone ; for as 
it began now to be almoft day, and the alarm had 
rua over the country, there flood about forty men, 

4 armed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

armed with lances and bows, at the little place where 
the twelve or thirteen houfes ftood, mentioned be- 
fore; but by accident I miffed the place, and eame 
direftly to the fea-fide ; and by that time I got to 
the fea-fide, it was broad day : immediately I took 
the pinnace, and went aboard, and fent her back to 
iiflift the men in what might happen. 

I obferved, that about the time I came to the boat- 
fide, the fire was pretty well out, and the noife abated; 
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I 
heard a volley of our men's fire arms, and faw a 
great fmoke ; this, as I underftood afterwards, was 
our men falling upon the forty men, who, as I faid, 
ftood at the few houfes on the way ; of whom they 
killed fixteen or feventeeii, and fet all thofe houfes 
on fire, but did not meddle with the women or 
children. 

By that time the men got to the fhore again with 
the pinnace, our men began to appear ; they came 
dropping in, fome and fome ; not in two bodies, and 
in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, fliraggling 
here and there in fuch manner, that a fmall force 
of refolute men might have cut them all off* 

But the dread of them was upon the whole coun«- 
try : The people were amazed and furprifed, and fo 
frighted, that, I believe, an hundred of them would 
have fled at the fight of but five of our men. Nor 
in all this terrible aftion was there a man who made 
any confiderable defence ; they were fo furprized be- 
tween the terror of the fire, and the fudden attack 
of our men in the dark, that they knew not which 
way to turn themfelves ; for if they fled one way, 
they were met by one party j if back again, by ano- 
ther J

ther ; fo that they were every where knocked down. 
Nor did any of our men receive the leaft hurt, ex- 
cept one who ftrained his foot, and another had one 
of his hands very much burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain> 
and, indeed, with ail the men, in my mind, but with 
him in particular ; as well for his afting fo out of 
his duty, as commander of the fhip, and having the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting, 
rather than cooling, the rage of his men, in fo bloody 
and cruel an enterprife : My nephew anfwered me 
very refpeftfully ; but told ftie that when he faw the 
body of the poor feaman, whom they had murdered in 
fuch a cruel and barbarous manner, he was not matter 
of himfelf, neither could he govern his paffion ; he 
owned, he fhould not have done fo, as he was comman- 
der of the fhip; but, as he was a man, and nature moved 
him, he could not bear it. As for the reft of the 
men, they were not fubjeft to me at all ; and they 
knew it well enough, fo they took no notice of my 
diflike. 

The next day we fet fail ; fo we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they killed; feme faid one thing, fome 
another : But, according to the beft of their ac-^ 
counts put all together, they hailed, or dciilroyed, 
about 1 50 people, men, women, and children, and 
left not a houfe flanding in the town. 

As for the poor fellow Thomas Jeffrys^ as he was 
quite dead, for his throat was fo cut that his head 
was half off, it would do him no fervice to bring 
him away ; fo they left him where they found him, 

<xily 



OF Robinson crusoe^ 2^^ 

only took him down from the tree where he was 
hanged by one hand. 

However juft our men thought this aftion to be, I 
was againft them in it ; and I always, after that time, 
told them God would blaft the voyage ; for I looked 
upon the blood they fhed that night to be murder in 
them : for though it is true that they killed Thomas 
y^ffrys, yet it was as true that Jeffrys was the aggreflbr, 
had broken the truce, and had violated or debauched 
^ young woman of their's, who came. to our camp 
innocently, and on the faith of their capitulation. 
• The boatfwain defended this quarrel when we were 
afterwards on board. He faid, it was true that we 
feemed to break the truce, but really had not ; and 
that the war was begun the night before by the na- 
tives themfelves, who had fhot at us, and killed one 
of our men without any jufl provocation ; fo that, 
as we were'in a capacity to fight them, we might alfo 
be in a capacity to do ourfelves juftice upon them in 
an extraordinary manner ; that though the poor 
man had taken liberty with a wench, he ought not to 
have been murdered, and that in fuch a villainous 
manner ; and that they did nothing but what was 
juft, and that the laws of God allowed to be done to 
murderers. 

One would think this fliould have been enough 
to have warned us againft going on fliore among 
heathens and barbarians ; but it is impoflible to 
make mankind wife, but at their own experience ; 
and their experience feems to be always of moft ufe 
to them, when it is deareft bought. 

We were now boimd to the gulph of Perfia, and 
from thence to the coaft of Coromandely only to touch 

at

at Surat; but the chief of the fupercargo's defign 
lay at the bay of Bengal^ where, if he miffed of the 
bufmcfs outward-bound, he was to go up to Chinay 
and return to the coaft as he came home. 

The firft difafter that befel us was in the gulph of 
Perjia^ where five of our men, venturing on fliore on 
the Arabian fide of the gulph, were furrounded by 
tht Arabs y and either all killed, or carried away into 
flavery ; the reft of the boat's crew were not able to 
refcue them, and had but juft time to get off their 
boat : I began to upbraid them with the juft retribu- 
tion of Heaven in this cafe ; but the boatfwain very 
warmly told me, he thought I went farther in my 
cenfures than I could fhew any warrant for in fcrip- 
ture, and referred to the thirteenth of St. Luke^ ver. 4. 
where our Saviour intimates, that thofe men, on 
whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not finners 
above all the Galileans ; but that which, indeed, put 
me to filence in this cafe, was, that none of thefe 
five men, who were now loft, were of the number of 
thofe who went on fliore to the maffacre of Madagaf- 
car (fo I always called it, though our men could not 
bear the word majfacre with any patience) : and, in- 
deed, this laft circumftance, as I have faid, put me 
to filence for the prefent. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this fubjefl: 
had worfe confequences than I expedted; and the 
boatfwain, who had been the head of the attempt, 
came up boldly to me one time, and told me, he 
found that I continually brought that affair upon the 
ftage J that I made unjuft refledions upon it, and had 

ufed 



d> 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

ufed the men very ill on that account, and himfelf in 
particular ; that as I was but a paffenger, and had no 
command in the fliip, or concern in the voyage, they 
were not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know 
but I might have fome ill defign in my head, and, 
perhaps, call them to an account for it, when they 
came to England ; and that therefore, unlefs I would 
refolve to have done with it, and alfo not to concern 
myfelf farther with him, or any of his affairs, he 
would leave the fhip ; for he did not think it was fafe 
to fail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and 
then told him, that I did confefs I had all along op- 
pofed the maffacre of Madagafcar^ for fuch I would 
always call it j and that I had on all occafions fpoken 
fny mind freely about it, though not more upon him 
than any of the reft ; that as to my having no com- 
mand in the fhip, that was true, nor did I exercife 
any authority, only took the liberty of fpeaking my 
j:^ind in things which publickly concerned us all j as 



toT what concern I had in the voyage, that was none 
of \his bufmefs ; I was a confiderable owner of the 
{hip, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to 
fpeak, even farther than I had yet done, and would 
not be accountable to him, or any one elfe ; and be- 
gan to be a little warm with him : he made but little 
reply to me at that time, and I thought that affair had 
been over. We were at this time in the road to BeU" 
gal; and, being willing to fee the place, I went on 
fhore with the fupercargo, in the fbip's boat, to di- 
vert myfelf; and towards evening was preparing to 
go on board, when one of the men came to me, and 

told

told me, he would not have me trouble myfelf to 
come down to the boat, for they had orders not to 
carry me on board. Any one may guefs what a fur-» 
prife I was in at fo infolent a meffage ; and I alked the 
man, who bade him deliver that errand to me ? He 
told me the cockfwain. I faid no more to the fel- 
low, but bid him let them know he had delivered 
his meffage, and that I had given him no anfwer 
to it. 

I immediately went, and 'found out the fupercargOj 
and told him the (lory, adding, what I prefently fore-' 
faw, mz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in 
the ihip ; and intreated hini to go immediately oir 
board the Ihip iju an Indian boat^ and acquaint the 
capiain of it : but I might have fpared this intelli- 
gence, for, before I had fpoken to him on fhore, the 
matter was effeded on board: the boatfwain, the 
gunner, the carpenter, and in a word, all the inferior 
officers, as foon as I was gone off in the boat, cani^ 
up to the quarter-deck^ and defired to fpeak v/ith tl\a 
captain; and there the boatfwain, making a lo^g 
harangue (for the fellow talked very well), and re^ 
peating all he had faid to me, told the captain in a 
few words, that as I was now gone peaceably -on 
Ihore, they were loth to ufe any violence with me ; 
which, if I had not gone on fhore, they would other- 
wife have done, to oblige me to have gone. They 
therefore thought fit to tell him, that as they (hipped 
themfelves to ferve in the (hip under his command, 
they would perform it faithfully : but if I would not 
quit the (hip, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they 
would ^11 leave the (hip, and fail no farther with him : 
and at that word ALL, he turned his face about 

towards 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 239 

towards the main-maft, which was, it feems, the fig, 
nal agreed on between them ; at which all the fea- 
men being got together, they cried out, ©ne and 
ALL, One and ALL ! 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of fpirit, and 
of great prefence of mind, and though he .was fur- 
prifed, you may be fure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly he would confider of the matter ; but 
that he could do nothing in it till he had fpoken to 
me about it : he ufed foj^ ^Yguments with them, to 
Ihew them the unreafonablenefs and injuftice of the 
thing ; but it was all in vain ; they fwore, and fliook 
hands round, before his face, that they would go all 
on fhore, unlefs he would engage to them not to fufFer 
me to come on board the fhip. 

This was an hard article upon him, who knew his 
obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ; fo he began to talk cavalierly to them j 
told them that I was a very confiderable owner of the 
fhip, and that in juftice he could not put me out of 
my own houfe ; that this was next door to ferving 
me as the famous pirate Kid had done, who made 
the mutiny in the Ihip, fet the captain on fhore in an 
uninhabited ifland, and ran away with the fhip ; that 
let them go into what fhip they would, if ever they 
came' to England zgdin^ it would coft them dear; that 
the fhip was mine, and that he would not put me out 
of it ; and that he would rather lofe the fhip, and 
the voyage too, than difoblige me fo much ; fo they 
might do as they pleafed. However, he would go on 
ihore, and talk with me there ; and invited the boat. 
fwain to go with hirn, and perhaps they might ac- 
commodate the matter with me. 

2 But 



240 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

But they all rejefted the propofal j and faid, they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither 
onboard, or on Ihore ; and if I came on board, they 
would go on fhore. Well, faid the captain, if you 
are all of this mind, let me go on fhore, and talk with 
him : fo away he came to me with this account, a 
little after the meffage had been brought to me from 
the cockfwain. 

I was very glad to fee my nephew, I muft confefs ; 
for I was not without apprehenfions that they would 
confine him by violence, fet fail, and run away with 
the fliip ; and then I had been ftript naked, in a remote 
country, and nothing to help myfelf : in fhort, I had 
been in a worfe cafe than when I was all alone in the 
ifland. 

But they had not come to that length, it feems, to 
my great fatisfaftion ; and when my nephew told me 
what they had faid to him, and how they had fwom, 
and fhook hands, that they would one and all leave 
the fhip, if I was fuffered to come on board, I told 
him, he fhould not be concerned at it at all, for I 
would flay on fhore : I only defired he would take 
care and fend me all my neceffary things on fhore, 
and leave me a fufEcient fum of money, and I would 
find my way to England as well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew ; but 
there was no way to help it^ but to comply with it. 
So in fhort, he went on board the fhip again, and fa- 
tisfied the men, that his uncle had yielded to their 
importunity, and had fent for his goods from on 
board the fliip. So the matter was over in a very few 
hours : the men returned to their duty, and I begun 
to confider what courfe I fliould fleer. 

I was 



0^ ROBINSON CRUSOE. 24 1 

I was now alone in the remoteft part of the world^ 
as I think I may call it ; for I was near three thou- 
fand leagues, by fea, farther off from England than 
I was at my ifland ; only, it is true, I might travel 
here by land, over the Great Mogul^s country to 
Suraty might go from thence to Baflbra by fea, up 
the gulph of Perjia^ and from thence might take the 
way of the caravans, over the deferts of Arabia to 
Aleppo and Scanderoon ; and from thence by fea again 
to Italy ^ and fo over land into France ; and this, put 
together, might be, at leaft, a full diameter of the 
globe ; but, if it were to be meafured, I fuppofe it 
would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait 
for fome Englijh fhips, which were coming to Bengal^ 
from Achin^ on the ifland of Sumatra^ and get paf- 
fage on board them for England : but as I came 
hither without any concern with the Englijh Eaji- 
India Company, fo it would be difBcult to go from 
hence without their licence, unlefs with great favour 
of the captains of the fhips, or of the company's fac- 
tors J and to both I was an utter ftranger. 

Here I had the particular pleafiire, fpeaking by 
contrarieties, to fee the fhip fet fail without me ; a 
treatment, I think, a man in my circumftances fcarce 
ever met with, except from pirates running away with 
a fhip, and fetting thofe that would not agree with 
their villainy on fhore : indeed, this was the next 
door to it, both ways. However, my nephew left 
me two fervants, or rather, one companion, and one 
fervant : the firft was clerk to the purfer, whom he 
engaged to go with me j and the other was his own 
fervant. I took me alfo a good lodging in the houfe 

Vol. II. R of 



242 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of an Englijh woman, where feveral merchants lodged, 
fome French^ two Italians^ or rather "Jews^ and one 
EngUj}oman. Here I was handfomely enough enter- 
tained ; and, that I might not be faid to run raflily 
upon any thing, I ftayed here above nine months, 
confidering what courfe to take, and how to manage 
myfelf. I had fome Englijb goods with me of value, 
and a confiderable fum of money ; my nephew fur- 
nifhing me with a thoufand pieces of eight, and a 
letter of credit for more, if I had occafion, that I 
might not be ftraitened, whatever might happen. 

I quickly difpofed of my goods, and to advan- 
tage too ; and, as I originally intended, I bought 
here fome very good diamonds, which, of all other 
things, was the moft proper for me, in my circum- 
ftances, becaufe I might always carry my whole eftate 
about me. 

After a long ftay here, and many propofals- made 
for my return to England^ but none falling to my 
niind, the Englijh merchant, who lodged with me, 
and with whom I had contradled an intimate ac- 
quaintance, came to me one morning : Country- 
man, fays he, I have a projed to communicate to you, 
which, as it fuits with my thoughts, may, for aught 
I know, fuit with your's alfo, when you fhall have 
thoroughly confidered it.

I by my own choice, in a part of the world very re- 
mote from our own country ; but it is in a country 
where, by us who underftand trade and bufmefs, a 
great deal of money is to be got: if you will put a

I liked this propofal very well ; and the more, be- 
caufe it feemed to be expreffed with fo much good 
will, and in fo friendly a manner. I will not fay, 
but that I might, by my loofe and unhinged cir- 
cumftances, be the fitter to embrace a propofal for 
trade, and, indeed, for any thing elfe ; or other- 
wife, trade was none of my element : however, I 
might, perhaps, fay, with fome truth, that if trade 
was not my element, rambling was ; and no propo- 
fal for feeing any part of the world, which I had 
never feen before, could poflibly come amifs to 
me. 

It was, however, fome time before we could get a 
Ihip to our mind ; and when we got a veffel, it was 
not eafy to get Englijh failors ; that is to fay, fo many 
as were neceffary to govern the voyage, and manage 
the failors which we fhould pick up there. After 
fome time we got a mate, a boatfwain, and a gunner, 
Englijh ; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguefe^ 
foremaft men ; with thefe, we found we could do 
well enough, having Indian feamen, fuch as they are, 
to make up. 

There are fo many travellers who have written the 
hiflory of their voyages and travels this way, that it 
would be but very little diverfion to any body, to 

R 2 give 



244 ^IFE AND ADVENTURE3 

give a long account of the places we went to, and the 
people v^ho inhabit there : thofe things I leave to 
others, and refer the reader to thofe journals and 
travels of Englijhmen^ many of which, I find, are 
publifhed, and more promifed every day. It is 
enough for me to tell you, that we made the voyage 
to AchiUj in the ifland of Sumatra^ firft ; and from 
thence to Siam^ where we e;^changed fome of our 
wares for opium, and for fome arrack ; the firft, a 
commodity which bears a great price among the 
Chinefe^ and which, at that time, was very much 
wanted there : in a word, we went up to Sujham ; 
made a very great voyage ; were eight months out ; 
and returned to Bengal : and I was very well fatisfied 
with, my adventure. I obferve, that our people in 
England^ often admire how the officers, which the 
Company fend into India, and the merchants which 
generally flay there, get fuch very good eftates as 
they do, and fometimes come home worth fixty, 
feventy, and an hundred thoufand pounds at a 
time. 

But it is no wonder, or, at leafl, we fhall fee fo 
much farther into it, when we confider the innume- 
rable ports and places where they have a free com- 
merce, that it will then be no wonder ; and much lefs 
will it be fo, when we confider, that all thofe places and 
ports where the Englijh (hips come, there is fo much, 
and fuch conftant demand for the growth of all other 
countries, that there is a certain vent for the re- 
turn, as well as a market abroad for the goods car- 
ried out. 

In Ihort, we made a very good voyage, and I got 
fo much money by the firft adventure, and fuch an 

infight 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

infight Into the method of getting more, that, had I 
been twenty years younger, I fhould have beea 
tempted to have flayed here, and fought no farther 
for making my fortune : but what was all this to a 
man on the wrong fide of threefcore, that was rich 
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a 
reftlefs delire of feeing the world, than a covetous 
defire of getting in it ? And, indeed, I think, it is 
with great juftice that I now call it a reftlefs defire ; 
for it was fo : when I was at home, I was reftlefs to 
go abroad ; and now I was abroad, I was reftlefs to 
be at home. I fay, what was this gain to me ? I 
was rich enough already ; nor had I any uneafy de- 
fires about getting more money ; and therefore, the 
profits of the voyage to me, were things of no great 
force to me, for the prompting me forward to far- 
ther undertakings : hence I thought, that by this 
voyage I had made no progrefs at all ; becaufe I was 
come back, as I might call it, to the place from 
whence I came, as to an home ; whereas my eye, 
which, like that which Solomon fpeaks of, was 
never fatisfied with feeing, was ftill more defirous of 
•wandering and feeing. I was come into a part of the 
world which I never was in before ; and that part in 
particular, which I had heard much of; and was 
refolved to fee as much of it as I could ; and then I 
thought, I might fay, I had feen all the world that 
was worjh feeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions : 
I do not name this to infift upon my own, for I ac- 
knowledge his was moft juft, and the moft fuited to 
the end of a naerchant's life > who,, when he is 

R 3 abroad 



246 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

abroad upon adventures, it is his wifdom to flick to 
that, as the bed thing for him^ which he is like to 
get the moft money by. My new friend kept himfelf 
to the nature of the thing, and would have been con- 
tent to have gone, like a carrier's horfe, always to 
the fame inn, backward and forward, provided he 
could, as he called it, find his account in it : on the 
other hand, mine, as old as I was, was the notion of 
a mad rambling boy, that never cares to fee a thing 
twice over. 

But this was not all : I had a kind of impatience 
upon me to be nearer home, and yet the moft un- 
fettled refolution imaginable, which way to go. In 
the interval of thefe confultations, my friend, who 
was always upon the fearch for bufinefs, propofed 
another voyage to me, viz. among the Spice Iflands ; 
and to bring home a load of cloves from the Manillasy 
or thereabouts ; places where, indeed, the Dutch do 
trade, but the iflands belong partly to the Spaniards ; 
though we went not fo far, but to fome other, where 
they have not the whole power as they have at Bata* 
via, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing for 
this voyage ; the chief difficulty was in bringing me 
to come into it ; however, at laft, nothing clfe offering, 
and finding that really ftirring about and trading, the 
profit being fo great, and, as I may fay, certain, 
had more pleafure in it, and more fatisfaftion to the 
mind, than fitting ftill ; which, to me efpecially, 
was the unhappieft part of life, I refolved on this 
voyage too : which we made very fuccefsfully, touch- 
ing at Borneo, and feveral iflands, whofe names I do 
not remember, and came home in about five months. 
We fold our fpice, which was chiefly cloves, and 

4 fome 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 247 

fome nutmegs, to the Perjian merchants, who car- 
ried them away for the Gulph ; and, making near five 
of one, we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, fmiled 
at me : Well now, faid he, with a fort of an agreeable 
infult upon my indolent temper, is not this better 
than walking about here, like a man of nothing to 
do, and fpending our time in flaring at the nonfenfe 
and ignorance of the Pagans ? Why truly, faid I, 
my friend, I think it is ; and I begin to be a convert 
to the principles of merchandizing. But I muft tell 
you, faid I, by the way, you do not know what I 
am doing ; for if once I conquer my backwardnefs, 
and embark heartily, as old as I am, I fliall harrafs 
you up and down the world till I tire you j for 
I fhall purfue it fo eagerly, I fliall never let you 
lieftill. 

But to be fliort with my fpeculations : a little while 
after tliis, there came in a Dutch fhip from Batavia ; 
fhe was a coafler, not an European trader, and of 
about two hundred tons burden : the men, as they 
pretended, having been fo fickly, that the captain 
had not men enough to go to fea with, he lay by at 
Bengal ; and, as if having got money enough, or 
being willing, for other reafons, to go for Europe^ 
he gave public notice, that he would fell his fliip : 
this came to my ears before my new partner heard of 
it ; ftnd I had a great mind to buy it. So I went 
home to him, and told him of it : he confidered 
awhile, for he was no rafh man neither ; but mufmg 
fome time, he replied. She is a little too big j but, 
however, we will have her. Accordingly we bought 
thefliipi and, agreeing with the mafler, we paid 

R 4 for 



248 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for her, and took poffeflion ; when we had done fo, 
we refolved J:o entertain the men, if we could, to 
join them with thofe we had, for the purfuing our 
bufmefs ; but on a fudden, they not having received 
their wages, but their fhare of the money, as we af- 
terwards learnt, not one of them was to be found. 
We enquired much about them, and at length were 
told, that they were all gone together, by land, to 
jigra, the great city of the MoguFs refidence ; and 
from thence were to travel to Surat^ and fo by fea to 
the gulph of Perjia. 

Nothing had fo heartily troubled me a good while, 
as that I miffed the opportunity of going with them ; 
for fuch a ramble, I thought, and in fuch company 
as would both have guarded me, and diverted me, 
would have fuited mightily with my great defign ; 
and I fliould both have feen the world, and gone 
homewards too ; but I was much better fatisfied a 
few days after, when I came to know what fort of 
fellows they were ; for, in Ihort, their hiftory was, 
that this man they called captain was the gunner only, 
not the commander ; that they had been a trading 
voyage, in which they Were attacked on fliore by 
fome of the Malaccans^ who had killed the captain 
and three of his men \ and that after the captain 
was killed, thefe men, eleven in number, had re- 
folved to run away with the (hip, which they did ; 
and had brought her in at the bay of Bengal^ leav- 
ing the mate and five men more on fhore ; of whom 
w^e fhall hear farther. 

' Well ; let them come by the (hip how they would, 
we Came honeftly by her, as we thought ; though 
we did not, I confefs, examine into things fo ex- 

aaiy 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 249 

aSly as we ought ; for we never enquired any- 
thing of the feamen, who, if we had examined, 
would certainly have faultered in their accounts, 
contradidted one another, and perhaps have contra- 
diQ:ed * themfelves ; or, one how or other, we 
fliould have feen reafon to have fufpefted them : but 
the man fhewed us a bill of fale for the fhip, to one 
Emanuel Clojlerjhoven, or fonie fuch name (for I fup- 
pofe it was all a forgery) and called himfelf by that 
name j and we could not contradift him ; and being 
withal a little too unwary, or at leaft, having no 
fufpicion of the thing, we went through with our 
bargain. 

However we picked up fome Englijh feamen here 
after this, and fome Dutch' ; and we now refolved 
for a fecond voyage to the fouth-eaft, for cloves, &c« 
that is to fay, among the Philippine and Malacca 
ifles ; and, in fliort, not to fill this part of my ftory 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is fo remark- 
able, I fpent, from firfl to laft, fix years in this coun- 
try, trading from port to port, backward and for- 
ward, and with very good fuccefs ; and was 
now the laft year with my partner, going in the 
(hip above-mentioned, on a voyage to China; but 
defigning firft to go to Siam^ to buy rice. 

In. this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the ftraits of 
Malacca^ and among the iflands, we were no fooner 
got clear of thofe difficult feas, but we found our 
fhip had fprung a leak, and we were not able, by all 
our induftry, to find out where it was. This forced 
us to make for fome port ; and, my partner, who 
knew the country better than I did, direded the 
captain to put into the river of Cambodia ; for I 

had 



2SO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

had made the Englijh mate, one Mr. Thompfon^ cap- 
tain, not being willing to take the charge of the 
Ihip upon myfelf : This river lies on the north fide 
of the great bay or gulph, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on Ihore 
for refrelhment, there comes to me one day an £«^- 
lijhman^ and he was, it feems, a gunner's mate on 
board an Englijh Eaji India ftiip, which rode in the 
fame river^ up at, or near the city of Cdimbodia: 
what brought him hither we knew not ; but he comes 
up to me, and, fpeaking Englijh^ Sir, fa^^^-li^ you 
are a ftranger to me, and I to you ; but I hav^ 
fomething to tell you, that very nearly concerns 
you. 

I looked ftedfaftly at him a good while, and he 
thought at firft I had known him, but I did not : If 
it very nearly concerns me, faid I, and not your- 
felf, what moves you to tell it me ? I am moved, 
fays he, by the imminent danger you are in ; and for 
aught I fee, you have no loiowledge of it. I know 
no danger I am in, faid I, but that my fhip is leaky, 
and I cannot find it out ; but I propofe to lay her 
aground to-morrow, to fee if I can find it. But, Sir, 
fays he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it, 
you will be wifer than to lay your fhip on fhore 
to-morrow, when you hear what I have to fay to you : 
Do you know, Sir, faid he, the town of Cambodia 
lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? And there 
are two large Englijh (hips about five leagues on this 
fide, and three Dutch. Well faid I, and what is 
that to me ? Why, Sir, fays he, is it for a man that 
is upon fuch adventures as you are, to come into a 
port, and not examine firft what (hips there are there, 

and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2^1 

and whether he is able to deal with them ? I fuppofe 
you do not think you are a match for them ? I was 
amufed very much at his difcourfe, but riot amazed 
at it; for I could not conceive what he meant ; and 
I turned fliort upon him, and faid, Sir, I wifh you 
,would explain yourfelf ; 1 cannot imagine what rea- 
fon I have to be afraid of any of the Company's 
fhips, or Dutch Ihips ; I am no interloper ; what can 
they have to fay to me ? 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleafed ; 
and, paufmg awhile, but fmiling, Well, Sir, fays 
he, if you think yourfelf fecure, you muft take your 
chance ; I am forry your fate fhould blind you againft 
good advice ; but afTure yourfelf, if you do not put 
to fea immediately, you will the very next tide bo 
attacked by five long-boats full of men ; and, per- 
haps if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pi- 
rate, and the particulars be examined into after- 
wards : I thought. Sir, added he, I fhould have 
met with a better reception than this, for doing you 
a piece of fervice of fuch importance. I can never 
be ungrateful, faid I, for any fervice, or to any man 
that offers me any kindnefs ; but it is pad my com- 
prehenfion, faid I, what they fhould have fuch a de- 
iign upon me for : However, fince you fay there is 
no time to be lofl, and that there is fome villainous 
defign in hand againfl me, I will go on board this 
minute, and put to fea immediately, if my men can 
flop the' leak, or if we can fwim without flopping it: 
But, Sir, faid I, fhall I go away ignorant of the rea- 
fon of all this ? Can you give me no farther light 
into it? 

I can 



ft5* I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

I can tell you but part of the ftory, Sir, fays he ; but 
I have a Dutch feaman here with me, and, I believe, 
I could perfuade him to tell you the reft ; but there 
is fcarce time for it : But the fliort of the ftory is 
this, the firft part of which, I fuppofe, you know 
well enough, viz. That you were with this fhip at Sa- 
matra ; that there your captain was murdered by 
the Malaccans^ with three of his men ; and that 
you, or fome of thofe that were on board with you, ran 
away with the fhip, and are fince turned PIRATES. 
This is the fum of the ftory, and you will all be feized 
as pirates, I can aflure you, and executed vsath very 
Kttle ceremony ; for you know merchant fliips fliew 
but little law to pirates, if they get them iu their 
powet. 

Now you fpeak plain Englijh^ faid I^ and I thank 
you ; and though I know nothing that we have done, 
like what you talk of, but I am fure we came honeft* 
ly and fairly by the fhip ; yet feeing fuch work is a 
doing, as you fay, and that you feem to mean ho- 
neftly, I will be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, fays 
he, do not talk of being upon your guard ; the beft 
defence is to be out of the danger ; if you have any 
regard to your life, and the lives of all your men, 
put out to fea without fail at high- water j and as 
you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone 
too far out before they can come down ; for they will 
come away at high water ; and as they have twenty 
miles to come, you'll get near two hours of them 
by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length 
of the way : Befides, as they are only boats, and 
not fhips, they will not venture to follow you far out 

to fea, efpecially if it blows. 

Well, 



OF ROfilNSON CRUSOE, 253 

■ Well, faid I, you have been very kind in this * 
What Ihall I do for you to make you amends ? Sir^ 
fays he, you may not be fo wiUing to make me 
amends, becaufe you may not be convinced of the 
truth of it : I will make an offer to you ; I have 
nineteen months pay due to me on board the fliip 

, which I came out of England in ; and the 

Dutchman^ that is with me, has feven months pay 
due to him ; if you will make good our^pay to us, 
we will go along with you : If you find nothing 
more in it, we will defire no more ; but if we do 
convince you, that we have faved your life, and the 
fhip, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave 
the reft to you, 

I confented to this readily ; and went immediately 
on board, and the two men with me. As foon as I 
came to the fhip's fide, my partner, who was on 
board, came on the quarter-deck, and called to me 
with a great deal of joy, O ho! O ho! we have 
ftopped the leak ! Say you fo, faid I, thank God ; 
but weigh the anchor then immediately : Weigh ! 
fays he, what do you mean by that ? What is the 
matter ? fays he. Afk no queftions, faid I, but all 
hands to work, and weigh without lofing a minute. 
He was furprifed : But, however, he called the cap- 
tain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to be 
got up ; and though the tide was not quite done, yet 
a little land-breeze blowing, we fliood out to fea ; 
then I called him Into the cabin, and told him the 
ftory at large ; and we called in the men, and they 
told us the reft of it : but as . it took us up a great 
deal of time, fo before » we had done, a feaman 
comes to the cabin-door, and calls out to us, that 

the 
I 



254 ^IP2 -^ND ApVENTURES 

the captain bade him tell us, we were chafed : 
Chafed, faid I, by whom, and by What ? By five 
floops, or boats, faid the fellow, full of men. Very 
well, faid I ; then it is apparent there is fomething 
in it. In the next place, I ordered all our men to 
be called up : and told them, that there was a de- 
fign to feize the Ihip, and to take us for pirates ; 
and afked them, if they would ftand by us, and by 
one another ? The men anfwered, chearfuUy, one 
and all, that they would live and die with us. Then • 
I afked the captain, what way he thought befl for 
us to manage a fight with them : For refift them I 
refolved we would, and that to the lafl drop. He 
faid, readily, that the way was to keep them off" 
with our great fhot, as long as we could, and then 
to fire at -them with our fmall arms, to keep them 
from boarding us ; but when neither of thefe would 
do any longer, we fhould retire to our clofe quar- 
ters ; perhaps they had not materials to break open 
our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring 
two guns to bear fore and aft, out.of thefleerage, to 
clear the deck, and load them with mufquet-bullets, 
and fmall pieces of old iron, and what next came to 
hand ; and thus we made ready for fight ; but all 
this while kept out to fea, with wind enough, and 
could fee the boats at a diftance, being five large 
long-boats following us, with all the fail they could 
make. 

Two of thefe boats, which, by out glaffes, we 
could fee were Englijh^ had out-failed the reft, were 
near two leagues a-head of them, and gained upon 
us confiderably J lo that we found they would come 

up 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. CL^^ 

up with US : upon which we fired a gun without a 
Ihot, to intimate that they fhould bring to ; and we 
put out a flag of truce, as a fignal for palley ; but 
they kept crowding after us, till they came within 
fhot : upon this we took in our white flag, they 
having made no anfwer to it, hung out the red flag, 
and fired at them with fhot : Notwithflanding this, 
they came on till they were near enough to call to 
them with a fpeaking trumpet, which we had on 
board ; fo we called to them, and bade them keep 
off at their peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and en- 
deavoured to come under" our ftern, fo to board us 
on our quarter : Upon which, feeing they were re- 
folute for mifchief, and depended upon the flrength 
that followed them, I ordered to bring the fliip to, 
fo that they lay upon our broadfide, when immedi- 
ately we fired five guns at them ; one of them had 
been levelled fo true, as to carry away the ftern of 
the hindermoft boat, and bring them to the neceflity 
of taking down their fail, and running all to the 
head of the boat to keep herf from finking ; fo fhe 
lay by, and had enough of it ; but feeing the fore- 
moft boat ftill crowd on after us, we made ready to 
fire at her in particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, 
made up to the boat which we had difabled, to re- 
lieve her, and we could afterwards fee her take out 
the men : we called again to the foremoft boat, and 
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what 
was her bufinefs with us ; but had no anfwer : only 
Ihe crowded clofe under our ftern. Upon this our 

gunner 



^56 I^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

gunner, who was a very dexterous fellow, run oof 
his two chace guns, and fired at her ; but the fhot 
miffing, the men in the boat fhouted, waved their 
caps, and came on ; but the gunner, getting quickly 
ready again, fired among them a fecond time ; one 
fliot of which, though it miffed the boat itfelf, yet 
fell in among the men, and we could eafily fee had 
done a great deal of mifchief among them ; but we, 
taking no notice of that, weared the fhip again, and 
brought our quarter to bear upon them ; and, firing 
three guns more, we found the boat was fplit almoft 
to pieces ; in particular, her rudder, and a piece of 
her ftern, were {hot quite away ; fo they handed 
their fail immediately, and were in great diforder : 
but, to compleat their misfortune, our gunner let 
fly two guns at them again ; where he hit them we 
could not tell, but we found the boat was finking, 
and fome of the men already in the water : — 
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, 
which we had kept clofe by our fide, with orders to 
pick up fome of the men, if they could, and fave 
them from drowning, and imediately to come on 
board with them ; becaufe we faw the reft of the 
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace 
followed their orders, and took up three men ; one 
of which was juft drowning, and it was a good while 
before we could recover him. As foon as they were 
on board, we crowded all the fail we could make, 
and ftood farther out to fea ; and we found, that 
when the other three boats came up to the firft two, 
they gave over their chace^ 

Being 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. • 257 

Being thus ddivered from a danger, which tho' 
I knew not the reafon of it, yet feemed to be much 
greater than I apprehended, I took care that we fhould 
change our courfe, and not let any one imagine whi- 
ther we were going ; fo we flood out to lea eaftward, 
quite out of the courfe of all European fhips, whe- 
ther they were bound to China^ or any where elfe, 
within the commerce of the European nations. 

When we were now at fea, we began to confult 
with the two feamen, and enquire firft, what the 
meaning of all this fliould be ? The Dutchman let us 
into the fecret of it at once; telling us, that the fel- 
low that fold us the ftiip, as we faid, was no more 
than a thief that had run away with her. Then he 
told us how the captain, whofe name too he men- 
tioned, though I do not remember it now, was 
treacheroufly murdered by the natives on the coaft of 
Malacca^ with three of his men ; and that he, this 
Dutchman^ and four more, got into the woods, where 
they wandered about a great while ; till at length,^he, 
in particular, in a miraculous manner, made his 
efcape, and fwam off to a Dutch (hip, which failing 
near the fhore, in its wdLj {torn China, had fent their 
boat on fliore for frefh water; that he durft not 
come to that part of the (hore where the boat was, 
but made (hift in the night to take in the water 
farther off, and fwimming a great while, at laft the 
ftip's boat took him up. 

He then told us^ that he went to Batavia, where 
two of the feamen belonging to thefhip had arrived, 
having deferted the reft in their travels ; and gave 
an account, that the fellow who had run away with 
the fliip, fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates, which 

Vol. II. S were 



258 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

were gone a cruifing in her ; and that they had al- 
ready taken an Englijh Ihip, and two Dutch (hips, 
very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us direftly ; 
and though we knew it to be falfe, yet, as my part- 
ner faid very well, if we had fallen into their hands, 
and they had fuch a prepoffeflion againfl us before- 
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended 
ourfelves, or to hope for any good quarters at their 
hands ; efpecially confidering that our accufers had 
been our judges, and that we could have expefted 
nothing from them but what rage would have dic- 
tated, and ungoverned paflion have executed ; and 
therefore it was his opinion, we fhould go direftly 
back to Bengal^ from whence we came, without put- 
ting in at any port whatever ; becaufe there we could 
give an account of ourfelves, and could prove where 
we were when the (hip put in, whom we beught her 
of, and the like ; and, which was more than all the 
Teft, if we were put to the necefTity of bringing it 
before the proper judges, we (hould be fure to have 
fome juftice ; and not be hanged (irft, and judged 
afterwards. 

I was fome time of my partner^s opinion; but 
after a little more ferious thinking, I told him, I 
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt 
returning to Bengal^ for that we were on the wrong 
fide of the (traits of Malacca; and that if the 
alarm was given, we (hould be fure to be way-laid on 
every fide, as well by the Dutch of Batavia^ as the 
Englijh elfewhere ; that if we (hould be taken, as it 
were, running away, we (hould even condemn our- 
felves, and there would want no more evidence to 

deftroy 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 259 

deftroy us. I alfo afted the Englijh failor's opinion, 
who faid, he was of my mind, and that we fliould 
certainly be taken. 

This danger a little ftartled my partner, and all 
the fhip's company ; and we immediately refolved to 
go away to the coaft of Tonquirij and fo on to China ; 
and from thence purfuing the firft defign, as to trade, 
find fome way or other to difpofe of the fhip, and 
come back in fome of the veflels of the country, 
fuch as we could get. This was approved of as the 
beft method for our fecurity ; and accordingly we 
(leered away N. N. E. keeping above fifty leagues off 
from the ufual courfe to the eaftward. 
. This, however, put us to fome inconveniencies ; 
for firft the 'winds, when we came to that diftance 
from the fhore, feemed to be more fteadily againft 
us, blowing almoft trade, as we call it, from the eaft 
^nd E. N. E. fo that we were a long while upon our 
voyage ; arid we Were but ill provided with viduals 
for fo long a run ; and, which was ftill worfe, there 
was fome danger, that thofe Englijh and Dutch fhips, 
whofe boats purfued us, whereof fome were bound 
that way, might be got in before us ; and if not, 
fome other fhip, bound to China^ might have infor- 
mation of us from them, and purfue us with the 
fame vigour. 

I muft confefs, I was now very uneafy, and thought 
myfelf, including the late efcape from the long-boats, 
to have been in the moft dangerous condition that 
ever I was in through all my paft life ; for, whatever 
-illcircumftances I had been in, I was never purfued 
for a thief before ; nor had I ever done any thing 

S 2 that 



fl6o LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that merited the name of diflionefl: or fraudulent, 
much lefs thievifli. I had chiefly been mine own 
enemy ; or, as I may rightly fay, I had been no- 
body's enemy but my own. But now I was embar- 
rafled in the worfl: condition imaginable ; for though 
I wasperfedly innocent, I was in no condition to 
make t^ innocence appear. And if I had been 
taken, it had been under a fuppofed guilt of the 
word kind ; at leaft, a crime efteemed fo among the 
people I had to do with. 

This made me very amdous to make an efcape, 
though which way to do it, I knew not j or what 
port or place we Ihould go to. My partner, feeing 
me thus dejefted, though he was the moft con- 
cerned at firft, began to encourage me; and de- 
fcribing to me the feveral ports of that coaft, told 
me, he would put in on the coaft of Cochinchina^ or 
the bay of Tonquin ; intending to go afterwards to 
Macao^ a town once in the poffeflion of the PortU" 
guefe^ and where ftill a great many European families 
refided, and particularly the miflionary prieft ufually 
went thither, in order to their going forward to 
China. 

Hither we then refolved to go ; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregular courfe, and very 
miich ftraitened for provifions, we came within light 
of the coaft very early in the morning j and, upon 
refledion upon the paft circumftances we were in, 
and the danger, if we had not efcaped, we refolved 
to put into afmall river, which, however, had depth 
enough of water for us, and to fee if we could, ei- 
ther over land or by the ilaip's pinnace, come to 
I know 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 26 1 

know what (hips were in any port thereabouts. This 
happy ftep was, indeed, our deliverance; for tho* 
we did not immediately fee any European Ihips in the 
bay of Tonquirij yet, the next morning, there came 
into the bay two Dutch fhips, and a third without 
any colours fpread out, but which we believed to be 
a Dutchman^ paffed by at about two leagues diftance, 
fleering for the coaft of China ; and in the after- 
noon went by two Englijh Ihips, fleering the fame 
courfe ; and thus, we thought, we faw ourfelves 
befet with enemies, both one way and the other. 
The place we were in was wild and barbarous, the 
people thieves, even by occupation or profeffioh; 
and though, it is true, we had not much to feek of 
them, and except getting a few provifions, cared not 
how little we had to do with them ; yet it was with 
much difficulty that we kept ourfelves from being iii- 
fulted by them feveral ways. 

We were in a fmall river of this country, within 
a few leagues of its utmoft limits northward ; and by 
our boat we coafted north-eaft to the point of land 
which opens to the great bay of Tonquln ; and it 
was in this beating up along the fliore, that we dif- 
covered as above, that in a word, we were furrounded 
with enemies. The people we were among were 
the moft barbarous of all the inhabitants of the 
coaft ; having no correfpondence with any other na- 
tion, and dealing only in fifh and oil, and fuch grofs 
commodities ; and it may be particularly feen, that 
they are, as 1 faid, the moft barbarous of any of 
the inhabitants, viz. that among other cuftoms they 
have this one, that if any veffel had the misfortune 

S3 to 



262 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to be fhipwrecked upon their coaft, they prcfently 
make the men all prifoners ; that is to fay, flaves ; 
land it was not long before we found a fpice of their 
kindnefs this way, on the occafion following : 

I have obferved above, that our fhip fprung a 
leak at fea, and that we could not find it out ; and 
however it happened, that, as I have faid, it was 
flopped unexpededly, in the happy minute of our 
being to be feized by the Dutch and EngHJh (hips, 
near the bay of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the 
Ihip fo perfedly tight and found as we defired, we 
refolved, while we were in this place, to lay her 
on fhore, take out what heavy things we had on 
board, which were not many, and to wafli and clean 
her bottom ; and if poflible, to find out where the 
leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the fliip, and brought 
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one 
fide, we tried to bring her down, that we might 
come at her bottom ; for, on fecond thoughts, we 
did not care to lay her dry a-ground, neither could 
we find out a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with fuch a fight, came wondering down to the 
Ihore to look at us ; and feeing the fhip lie down on 
one fide in fuch a manner, and heeling towards the 
fliore, and not feeing our men, who were at work 
on her bottom, with flages, and with their boats on 
the oflf fide, they prefently concluded that the fhip 
was caft away, and lay fo very faft on the ground. 

On this fuppofition they came all about us in two 

or three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats, 

4 having 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 26^ 

having fome of them eight, fome ten men in a boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plundered the Ihip ; and if they had found us there, 
to have carried us away for flaves to their king, or 
whatever they call him, for we knew not who was 
their governor. 

When they came up to the fhip, and began to row 
round her, they difcovered us all hard at word, on 
the outfide of the fhip*s bottom and fide, waftiing 
and graving, and flopping, as every feafaring man 
knows how. 

They ftood for a while gazing at us, and we, who 
were a little furprized, could not imagine what their 
defign was ; but, being willing to be fure, we took 
this opportunity to get fome of us into the fhip, and 
others to hand down arms and ammunition, to thofe 
that were at work to defend themfelves with, if there 
fhould be occafion ; and it was no more than need ; 
for, in lefs than a. quarter of an hour's confultation, 
they agreed, it feems, that the fhip was really a 
wreck ; that we were all at work, endeavouring to 
fave her, or to fave our lives by the help of our 
boats ; and when we handed our arms into the boats, 
they concluded, by that motion, that we^ere endea- 
vouring to fave fome of our goods. Upon this they 
took it for granted they all belonged to them ; 
and away they came diredly upon our men, as if it 
had been in aline of battle. 

Our men, fipeing fo many of them, began to be 
frighted ; for we lay but in an ill poflure to fight, and 
cried out to us to know what they fhould do ? I im- 
mediately called to the men who worked upon the 

S 4 flages, 



264 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ftages, to flip them down, and get up the fide into 
the Ihip ; and bade thofe in the boat to row round 
and come on board : and thofe few of us who were 
on board, worked with all the flrength and hands 
we had, to bring the fhip to rights ; but however, 
* neithqr the men upon the ftage, nor thofe in the 
boats, could do as they were ordered, before the 
Cochinchinefe were upon them j and, with two of 
their boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay- 
hold of the men as their prifoners. 

The firft man they laid hold of was an Englijh 
feaman, a ftout ftrong fellow, who having a muf- 
quet in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it 
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he 
underftood his bufmefs better than I could teach him; 
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by main 
force out of their own boat into ours ; where, tak- 
ing him by the two ears, he beat his head fo againft 
the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died inftantly in 
his hands ; and in the mean time, a Dutchman^ who 
flood next, took up the mufquet, and with the butt- 
end of it, fo laid about him, that he knocked down 
five of them, who attempted to enter the boat : but 
this was little towards refitting thirty or forty men, 
who fearlefs, becaufe ignorant of their danger, be- 
gan to throw theraifelves into the long-boat, where 
we had but five men to defend it: but one accident 
gave our men a complete vidor)'-, which deferved 
our laughter rather than any thing elfe ; and that 
was this :— - 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out- 
fide of the fbip, as well as to pay the feams where 

he 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 26$ 

he had caulked her, to flop the leaks, had got two 
kettles juft let down into the boat ; one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rofm, tallow, and 
oil, and fuch fluff as the fliipwrights ufed for that 
work } and the man that tended the carpenter had 
a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he fup- 
plied the men that were at work with that hot fluff: 
two of the enemy's men entered the boat jufl where 
this fellow flood, being in the fore-fheets ; he imme- 
diately faluted them with a ladleful of the fluff, boiL 
ing hot, which fo burnt and fcalded them, being 
half naked, that they roared out like two bulls, and 
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the fca. The 
carpenter faw it, and cried out. Well done, Jack^ 
give them fome more of it ; when flepping forward 
liimfelf, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it 
in the pitch pot, he and his man threw it among 
them fo plentifully, that, in fhort, of all the men 
in three boats, there wais not one that was not 
fcalded and burnt with it in a mofl frightful pi- 
tiful manner, and made fuch an howling and crying, 
that I never heard a worfe noife, and, indeed, no- 
thing like it : for it was worth obferving, that tho* 
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every 
nation have a particular way of exclamation, and 
make noifes as different from one another as their 
fpeech. I cannot give the noife thefe creatures made 
a better name than howling, nor a name more pro- 
per to the tone of it ; for I never heard any thing 
more like the noife of the wolves, which, as I have 
faid, I heard howl in the forefl on the frontiers of 
Languedoc. 

I was 



2$6 LIFE AND ADVEKTURES 

I was never pleafed with a vidory better in my life; 
not only as it was a perfeft furprife to me, and that 
our danger was imminent before j but as we got this 
viftory without any bloodflied, except of that man 
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I 
was very much concerned at j for I was fick of killing 
fuch poor favage wretches, even though it was in my 
own defence, knowing they came on errands which 
they thought juft, and knew no better : and that 
though it may be a juft thing, becaufe neceflary, for 
there is no neceffary wickednefs in nature j yet I 
thought it was a fad life, when we muft be always 
obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures to preferve 
ourfelves ; and, indeed, Ithinkfoftill; and I would, 
even now, fuffer a great deal, rather than I would 
take away the life even of the worft perfon injuring 
me, I believe alfo, all confidering people, who know 
the value of life, would be of my opinion, if they en* 
tered ferioufly into the confideration of it. 

But to return to my ftory : All the while this was do- 
ing, my partner and I, who managed the reft of the 
men on board, had, with great dexterity, brought 
the Ihip almoft to rights ; and, having gotten the guns 
into their places again, the gunner called to me, to 
bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly 
among them. I called back again to him, and bid 
him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the 
work without him ; but bade him heat another pitch 
kettle ; which our cook, who was on board, took 
care of. But the enemy was fo terrified with what 
they met with in their fir ft attack, that they would 
not come on again ; and fome of them, that were 
fartheft off, feeing the Ihip fwim, as it were, upright, 

' began 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 567 

began, as we fuppofed, to fee their miftake, and 
gave over the enterprife, finding it was not as they 
expeded- Thus we got clear of this merry fight 5 
and, having gotten fome rice, and fome roots and 
bread, with about fixteen good big hogs, on board, 
two days before, we refolved to ftay here no longer, 
but go forward, whatever came of it ; for we made 
no doubt but we fhould be furrounded the next day 
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch- 
kettle would difpofe of for us- 

We, therefore, got all our things on board the 
fame' evening, and the next morning were ready to 
fail. In the mean time, lying at an anchor fome 
diftance from the fliore, we were not fo much con- 
cerned, being now in a fighting pofture, as well as 
in a failing pofture, if any enemy had prefented. The 
next day, having finifhed our work within board* 
and finding our fhip was perfedly healed of all her 
leaks, we fet fail : we would have gone into the bay 
of Tonquirij for we wanted to inform ourfelves of what 
was to be known concerning the Dutch Ihips that 
had been there ; but we durft not ftand in there, be- 
caufe we had feen feveral fhips go in, as we fuppofed, 
but a little before ; fo vve kept on N. E.^ towards the 
ifle of Formofa^ as much afraid of being feen by a 
Dutch or Englifh merchant Ihip, as a Dutch or EngUjh 
merchant fhip in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine 
man of war. 

When we were thus got to fea, we kept on N. E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine 
iflands, and this we did, that we might not fall into 
the way of any of the European fliips; and then we 
fleered north again, till we came to the latitude 

of 



a68 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of 22 deg. ao min. by which means we made the 
ifland of Formofa direftly, where we came to an an- 
thor, in order to get water and frefh provifions, 
which the people there, who are very courteous and 
dvil in their manners, fupplied us with willingly, 
and dealt very feirly and punftually with, us in all 
thdr agreements and bargains ; which is what we 
did not find among other people ; and may be owing 
to the remains of Chriftianity, which was once 
planted here by a I)utch mifTionary of proteftants, 
and is a teftimony of what I have often obferved, viz. 
That the Chriflian religion always civilizes the peo- 
ple, and reforms their manners, where it is received, 
whether it works faving effefts upon them or not. 

From hence we failed ftill north, keeping the coaft 
of China at an equal diftance, till we knew we were 
beyond all the ports of China^ where our European 
fiiips ufually come ; but being refolved, if poffible, 
not to fall into any of their hands, efpecially in this 
country, where, as our circumftances were, we could 
not fail of being entirely ruined ; nay, fo great was 
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them, 
that I believe firmly I would much rather have chofen 
to fall into the hands of the Spanijh inquifition. 

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 

refolved to put into the firft trading port we fliould 

come at ; and (landing in for the fhore, a boat came 

oflF two leagues to us, with an old Portuguefe pilot on 

board, who, knowing us to be an European fhip, 

came to offer his fervice, which, indeed, we were 

very glad of, and took him on board j upon which, 

without afking us whither we would go, he difmiifed 

the boat he came in, and fent it back. 

I thought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. a6g 

I thought it was now fo much in our choice to make 
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began 
to talk with him about carrying us to the Gulp/j of 
Nanquirij which is the moft northern part of the 
coaft of China. The old man faid he knew the 
Gulpb of Nanquin very well j but fmiling, afked us 
what we would do there ? 

I told him we would fell our cargo, and purchafe 
China wares, callicoes, raw filks, tea, wrought filks, 
&c. and fo would return by the fame courfe we came. 
He told us our beft port had been to have put in at 
Mcuao^ where we could not fail of a market for our 
opium, to our fatisfadion, and might, for our money, 
have purchafed all forts of China goods, as cheap as 
we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told 
him, we were gentlemen as well as merchants ; and 
that we had a mind to go and fee the great city of 
Pekiny and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. Why then, fays the old man, you fhould 
go to NingpOy where, by the river that runs into the , 
fea there, you may go up within five leagues of the 
great canal. This canal is a navigable made ftream, 
which goes through the heart of all that vafl empire 
of China^ crofles all the rivers, pafles fome confide- 
rable hills by the help of fluices and gates, and goes 
up to the city of Pekin^ being in length near 270, 
leagues. 

Well, faid I, Seignior Portuguefe^ but that is not 
our bufinefs now : the great queftion is. If you can 
carry us up to the city of Nanquin^ from whence we 
can travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he faid, he 

could 



jyO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

could do fo very well, and there was a great JDtdch 
fliip gone up that way juft before. This gave me a 
little (hock ; a Dutch fhip was now our terror, and 
we had much rather have met the devil, at leaft if he 
had not come in too frightful a figure : we depended 
upon it, that a Dutch fhip would be our deftruftion, 
for we were in no condition to fight them ; all the 
fhips they trade with in thofe parts being of great 
burden, and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confiifed, and under 
fome concern, when he named a Dutch fhip ; and 
faid to me. Sir, you need be under no apprehenfion 
of the Dutch, I fuppofe they are npt now at war with 
your nation. No, faid I, that's true ; but I know 
not what liberties men may take, when they are 
out. of the reach of the laws of their country. Why, 
faid he, you are no pirates, what need you fear ? 
They will not meddle with peaceable merchants, 
fure. 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up 
into my face at that word, it was hindered by fome 
flop in the velTels appointed by nature to circulate it ; 
for it put me into the greateft diforder and confu- 
fion imaginable ; nor was it poffible for me to con- 
ceal it fo, but that the old man eafily perceived it. 

Sir, faid he, I find you are in fome diforder in 
your thoughts at my talk : pray be pleafed to go 
which way you think fit ; and depend upon it. Til 
do you all the fervice I can. Why, Seignior, faid 
I, it is true, I am a little unfettled in my refolution 
at this time, whither to go in particular ; and I am 
fomething more fo, for what you faid about pirates ; 
I hope there are no pirates in thefe feas j we are but 

in 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 1 

in an ill condition to meet with them ; for yau fee we 
have but ^ fmall force, and but very weakly manned. 

O, Sir, f^d he, do not be concerned ; I do not 
know that there have been any pirates in thefe feas 
thefe fifteen years, except one, which w^s feen, as I 
hear, in the bay of Siam^ about a month fince; but 
you may be affured fhe is gone to the fouthward ; 
nor was Ihe a Ihip of any great force, or fit for the 
work : fhe was not built for a privateer, but was run 
away with by a reprobate crew that were on board, 
after the captain and fome of his men had been 
murdered by the Malaccans^ at or near the ifland of 
Sumatra. 

What ! faid I, feeming to " know nothing of the 
matter, did ihey murder the captain ? No, fsdd he, 
I do not underfland that they murdered him ; but, as 
they afterwards jran away with the fliip, it is gene- 
rally believed they betrayed him into the hands of 
the Malaccans^ who did murder him ; and, perhaps, 
they procured them to do it. Why then, faid I, 
they deferved death, as much as if they had done it 
themfelves. Nay, faid the old man, they do deferve 
it ; and they will certainly have it if they light upon 
any EngUfh or Dutch fhip ; for they have all agreed 
together, that if they meet that rogue, they will 
give him no quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the pirate is gone out 
of thefe feas ; how can they meet with him then ? 
Why, that is true, faid he, they do fay fo ; but he was, 
as I tell you, in the bay of Sianij in the river Cambodia^ 
and was difcovered there by fome Dutchmen^ who 
belonged to the fhip, and who were left on fhore 

when 



272 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

vrhen they run away with her ; and fome Englijb 
and Dutch traders being in the river, they were with- 
in a little of taking him. Nay, faid he, if the fore- 
mofl boats had been well feconded by the reft, they 
had certainly taken him ; but he, finding only two 
boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at 
thefe two, and difabled them before the others came 
up ; and then Handing off" to fea, the others were 
not able to follow him, and fo he got away. But 
they have all fo exa£t a defcription of the ihip, that 
they will be fure to know him ; and wherever they 
find him, they have vowed to give no quarter to 
dther the captain or the feamen, but to hang them 
all up at the yard-arm. 

What! faid I, will they ex^ute them right or 
wrong ; hang them firft, and judge them afterwards ? 
O, Sir ! faid the old pilot, there is no need to make 
a formal bufinefs of it with fuch rogues as thofe ; 
let them tie them back to back, and fet them a div- 
ing ; it is no more than they rightly deferve. 

I knew I had my old man faft aboard, and that 
he could do me no harm ; fo I turned fhort upon 
hhn: Well, Seignior, faid I, and this is the very 
reafon why I would have you carry us to Nanquin^ 
and not to put back to Macao^ or to any other part 
of the country, where the Englijh or Dutch fhips 
came ; for, be it known to you. Seignior, thofe cap- 
tains of the Englifo and Dutch fhips, are a parcel of 
rafh, proud, infolent fellows, that neither know 
what belongs to juftice, or how to behave them^ 
felves, as the laws of God and nature direct ; but 
being proud of their offices, and not underftanding 
their power, they would a6t the murderers to puniffi 

robbers ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1273 

rbbbers ; would take upon them to infult men falfe- 
ly accufed, and determine them guihy without due 
enquiry ; and perhaps I may live to call fome of them 
to an account for it, where they may be taught how 
juftice is to be executed ; and that no man ought to 
be treated as a criminal till fome evidence may be 
had of the crime, and that he is the man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very fhip 
they had attacked ; and gave him a full account of 
the fkirmifh we had with their boats, and how fool- 
ifhly and coward-like they had behaved. I told 
him all the ftory .of bur buying the fhip, and how 
the Dutchmen ferved us. I told him the reafons I 
had to believe that this ftory of killing the mafter 
by the Malaccans was not true ; as alfo the running 
away with the fhip ; but that it was all a fidiori of 
their own, to fuggeft that the men were turned pi- 
i^ates ; and they ought to have been fure it was fo, 
before they had ventured to attack us by furprife, 
and oblige us to refift them j adding, that they 
Would have the blood of thofe men, who were killed 
there, in our juft defence, to anfwer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation ; and told 
lis, we were very much in the right to go away to the 
north ; and that if he might advife us, it fhouldbeto 
fell the fhip in China^ which we might very well do> 
and buy or build another in the country : and, faid 
he, though you will not get fo good a fhip, yet you 
may get' one able enough to carry you and all your 
goods back again to Bengal^ or any where elfe. 

I told him I would take his advice, when I came to 
any port where I could find a fhip for my turn, or get 
any cuftomer to buy this. He replied, I fhould

and that a Chine/e ]\xnk would ferve mc very well to go 
back again ; and that he would procure me people 
both to buy one, and fell the other. 

Well, but, Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know 
the fliip fo well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your 
meafures, be inftrumental to bring fome honeft inno- 
cent men into a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be mur- 
dered in cold blood ; for wherever they find the 
fliip they will prove the guilt upon the men, by prov- 
ing this was the fhip ; and fo innocent men may pro- 
bably be overpowered and murdered. Why, faid 
the old man. Til find out a way to prevent that alfo ; 
for as I know all thofe commanders you fpeak of very 
well, and fhall fe^ them all as they pafs by, 1 will be 
fure to fet them to rights in the thing, and let them 
know that they had been fo much in the wrong ; that 
though the people who were on board at firft might 
run .away with the fhip, yet it was not true that they 
had ,|^rne4jpiratea; and that in particular thofe were 
not the men that firft went off with the Ihip, but inno- 
cently bought her for their trade : and I am per- 
fuaded they will fo far believe me, as, at leaft, to afl: 
more cautioufly for the time to come. Well, faid I, 
and will you deliver one meffage to them from me ? 
Yes, I will, fays he, if you will give it under your 
hand, in writing, that I may be able to prove it came 
from you, and not out of my own head. I anfwered, 
that I would readily give it him under my hand. So 
I took a pen and ink, and paper, and wrote at large 
the ftory of affaulting me with the long-boats, &c. 
the pretended reafon of it, and the unjuft cruel defign 
of it i and concluded to the commanders, that they

had done what they not only fliould have been 
afhamed of, but alfo, that if ever they came to 
England^ and I lived to fee them there, they fliould 
all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my country were 
not grown out of ufe before I arrived there^ 

My old pilot read this over and over again, and 
alked me feveral times, if I would ftand to it. I 
anfwered, I would ftand to it as long as I had any 
thing left in the world ; being fenfible that I fliould, 
one time or other, find an opportunity to put it home 
to them. But we had no occafion ever to let the 
pilot carry this letter ; for he never went back again. 
While thofe things were pafllng between us, by way 
of difcourfe, we went forward direftly for Nanqidhj 
and, in about thirteen days fail, came to anchor at 
the fouth-weft point of the great gulph of Nanquin ; 
where, by the way, I came by accident to under- 
ftand, that the two Dutch fliips were gone that length 
before me, and that I fliould certainly fall into their 
hands, I confulted my partner again in Jthis co- 
gency, and he was as much at a lofs as I wa|, and 
would very gladly have been fafe on fliore al- 
moft any where. However, I was not in fuch per- 
plexity neither, but I afked the old pilot if there was 
no creek, or harbour, which I might put into, and 
purfue my bufiinefs with the Chinefe privately, and be 
in no danger of the enemy ? He told me, if I would 
fail to the fouthward about two and forty leagues, 
there was a little port called ^inchang^ where the 
fathers of the miflion ufually landed from Macao^ on 
their progrefs to teach' the Chriftian religion to the 
Chinefe^ and where no European fliips ever put in j 
and, if I thought proper to put in there, I might con-

fider what farther courfe to take when I was on fkorA 
He confeffed, he faid, it was not a place for mer- 
chants, except that at fome certain times they had a 
kind of a faii^ there, when the merchants from 
Japa?! came over thither to buy the CTnnefe mer- 
chandizes* 

We all agreed to go back to this place : the name 
6f the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps fpell 
wrong ; for I do not particularly remember it, having 
loft this, together with the names of many other 
places fet down in a little pocket-book, which was 
fpoiled by the water, on an accident which I iliall 
relate in its ord^r ; but this I remember, that the 
Cbinefe or Japanefe merchants we correfpond with 
call it by a different name from that which our For- 
tuguefe pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above, 

As we were unanimous in our refolutions to go to 
this place, we weighed the next day, having only 
gone twice on Ihore, where we were to get frefh water; 
on both which occafions the people of the comitry 
were very civil to uSj and brotfght us abundanee of 
things to fell to us ; I mean of provifions, plants, 
roots, tea, rice, and fome fowls j but nothing with- 
out money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being con- 
trary) not till five days j but it was very much to our 
fatisfadkion ; and I was joyful, and, I may fay, 
thankful, when I fet my foot fafe on fhore j refolving^ 
and my partner too, that if it was pojSible to difpofe 
of ourfelves and effefts any other way, though not 
every way to our fatisfaftion, we would never fet one 
foot onboard that unhappy veffel again : and indeed, 

I mull 



/OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ' 277 

*1 mufl: acknowledge, that of all the circumftances of 
4ife that ever I had any .experience of, nothing makes 
mankind fo completely miferable as that of being, in 
.^onftant fear. Well does the fcripture fay, * The 
fear of man brings a fnare ;' it is a life of death ; and 
the mind is fo entirely fuppreffed by it, that it is ca- 
pable of no relief; the animal fpirits fink, and all 
.the vigour of nature, which ufually fupports men 
tunder other affliftions, and is prefent io them in the 
^eateft exigencies, fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of its ufual operations upon the fancy, 
:by heightening every danger ; reprefenting the En- 
glijh and Dutch ^captains to be men incapable of hear- 
ing reafon, or diftinguifliing between honefl men and 
Togues; or between a ftory calculated for our own 
,turn, made out of nothing, on purpofe to deceive, and 
a true genuine accountof our whole voyage, progrefs, 
,and defign ; for we might many ways have convinced 
any reafonable creature that we were not pirates ; the 
goods we had on boards -the courfe we (leered, our 
frankly (hewing ourfelves, and entering into fuch and 
fuch ports ; even our very manner, the force we had, 
thenumber of men, the few arms, little ammunition, 
and (hort provifions ; all thefe would hav€ ferved to 
convince any man that we were no pirates. The 
jopium, and other goods we had on board, would 
make it appear the (hip had been at Bengal ; the 
Dutchmen J who, it was fald, had th^e names of all the 
^en that were in the (liip, might eafily fee that we 
were a mixture of Englijh^ Portuguefe^ and Indians^ 
and but two Dutchnmi on board. Thefe, and many 
rOther particular circumftances, might have made it 
j^yide^t to die underftanding of any commander, , 

T 3 whofe 



578 LIFE AND ADVENTURES ' 

whofe hands we might fall into, that we were no 
pirates. 

But fear, that blind ufelefs paffion, worked another 
way, and threw us into the vapours ; it bewildered 
our underftandings, and fet the imagination at work, 
to form a thoufand terrible things, that, perhaps, 
might never happen. We firfl fuppofed, as indeed 
every body had related to us, that the feamen on board 
the Englijh and Dutch fliips, but efpecially the Dutch^ 
were fo enraged at the name of a pirate, and efpecially 
at our beating off their boats, and efcaping, that they 
would not give themfelves leave to enquire whether we 
were pirates or no j but would execute us off-hand, 
as we call it, without giving us any room for a de- 
fence. We refledted that there was really fo much 
apparent evidence before them, that they would fcarce 
enquire after any more : as, firft, that the fhip was 
certainly the fame, and that fome of the feamen 
among them knew her, and had been on board her; 
and, fecondly, that when we' had intelligence at the 
l-iver Cambodia^ that they were coniing down to ex- 
amine us, we fought their boats, and fled: So that we 
made no doubt but they were as fully fatisfied of our 
being pirates, as we were fatisfied of the contrary ; 
and I often faid, I knew not but I fhould have been 
apt to have taken the little circumftances for evidence, 
if the tables were turned, and my T:afe was theirs ; 
and have made no fcruple of cutting all the crew 
to pieces, without believing, or perhaps confider- 
ing, what they might have to oflfer in their de- 
fence. 

But let that be how it will, thofe were our appre- 
. henfions ; and both my partner and I too, fcarce flept 

a night 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE^ 279 

a night Without dreaming of halters and yard-arms; 
that is to fay, gibbets ; of fighting, and being taken ; 
of killing, and being killed ; and one night I was in 
fiich a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had 
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their feamen 
down, that I ftruck my double fift againft the fide of 
the cabin I lay in, with fuch a force as wounded my 
hand moft grievoufly, broke my knuckles, ^nd cut 
and bruifed the flefh, fo that it not only waked me out 
of my fleep, but I was once afraid I fhould have loft 
two of my fingers. 

Another apprehenfion I had, was, of the cruel 
ufage we fhould meet with from them, if we fell into 
their hands: then the ftory of Amboyna came into my 
head, and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, 
as they did our countrymen there ; and make fome 
of our men, by extremity of torture, confefs thofe 
crimes they never were guilty of; own themfelves, 
and all of us, to be pirates ; and fo they would put us 
to death, with a formal appearance of juftice; and 
that they might be tempted to do this, for the gain of 
our fhip and carga, which was worth four or five 
thoufand pounds, put all together. 

Thefi? things tormented me, and my partner toe, 
night and day ; nor did we confider that the captains 
of fhips have no authority to a£t thus ; and if we had 
furrendered prifoners to them, they could not anfwer 
the deflroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac- 
countable for it when they came into their own coun- 
try. This, I fay, gave me no fatisfaftion ; for, if 
they will aft thus with us, what advantage would it 
be to us that they would be called to an account for 
it ; or, if we were firft to be murdered, what fatif- - 

T4 faftion 



aSo I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

faftion would it be to us to have them punifhed when 
they came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflexions 
I now had upon the paft variety of my particular cir- 
cumftances ; how hard I thought it was, that I, who 
had fpent forty years in a life of continued difEcultieSj 
and was, at laft, come, as it were, at the port or 
haven which all men drive at, viz. to have reft and 
plenty, fhould be a volunteer in new forrows, by my 
own unhappy choice ; and that I, who had efcaped fa 
many dangers in my youth, fhould now come to be 
hanged in my old age, and in fo remote a place, for 
a crime I was not in the leaft inclined to, much lefs 
guilty of ; and in a place and circumftance, where 
innocence was not Uke to be any proteftion at all to 
me* 

After thefe thoughts, fomething of religion would 
come in ; and I would be confidering that this feemed 
to me to be a difpofition of immediate Providence; and 
I ought to look upon it, and fubmit to it, as fuch : 
that although I was innocent as to men, I was far from 
being innocent a^ to my Maker ; and I ought to look 
in, and examine what other crimes in my life were 
moft obvious to me, and for which Providence might 
juftly inflift this punifliment as a retribution ; an4 
that I ought to fubmit to this, juft as I would to a fliip- 
wreck, if it had pleafed God to have brought fuch a 
difafter upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would fometimcs take 

its place ; and then I would be talking myfelf up to 

vigorous refolution, that I would not be taken to be 

^ barbaroufly ufed by a parcel of mercilefs wretches in 

pold blood J that it was much better to have fallen 

2 into 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 28 1 

into die hands of the favages, who were meu-eaters^ 
and who, I was fure, would feaft upon me, when they 
had taken me, than by thofe, who would, perhaps^ 
glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and 
barbarities : that, in the cafe of the favages, I always 
refolved to die fighting, tq the laft gafp ; and why 
fliould I not do fo now, feeing it was much more 
dreadful, to me at leaft, to think of failing into thefe 
men's hands, than eyer it was to think of being eaten 
by men : for the favages, give them their due, would 
not eat a man till he was dead ; and killed him firft, 
;as we do a bullock ; but that thefe men had many 
arts beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever thefe 
thoughts prevailed, I was fure to put myfelf into a 
kind of fever, with the agitations of a fuppofed fight j 
my blood would boil, and my eyes fparkljg, as if I 
was engaged ; and I always refolved that I would take 
no quarter at their hands ; but even at laft, if I 
could refift no longer, I would blow up the fhip, and 
all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to 
boaft pf. 

But by how much the greater weightthe anxieties and 
perplexities of thofe things were to our thoughts while 
we were at fea, by fo much the greater ^yas our f^tif- 
faftion, when we f^w ourfelves on fhore ; and my 
partner told me, he dreamed, that he had a very heavy 
load upon his back, which he was to carry up an hill, 
and found that he was not able to ftand long under it ; 
but the Portuguejy jnlot came, and took it o£F his 
back, and the hill difaj^peared, the ground before him 
fhewing all fmooth and plain : And truly it was fo ; 
we were all like n^en who had a load taken off their 
J^acks, 

Fot 



282 LIFE AND ADVENTURE* 

For my part, I had a weight taken off from my 
heart, that I was npt able any longer to bear; and, as 
I faid above, we refolved to go no more to fea in that 
fhip. When we came on fhore, the old pilot, who 
was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a ware- 
houfe for our goods, which, by the way, was much 
the fame : it was a little houfe or hut, with a large 
houfe joining to it, all built with canes, and palifadoed 
round with large canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, 
of which it feems there were not a few in the country. 
However, thd magiftrates allowed us all a little guard, 
and we had a foldier with a kind of halbert, or half 
pike, who flood fentinel at our door ; to whom we 
allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, 
about the value of three -pence per day : fo that our 
goods were kept very fafe.. 

The fair or mart, ufually kept in this place, had 
been over fome time ; however, we found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two yapan^ 
Tiers ^ I mean, (hips from Japan^ with goods which 
they had bought in China^ and were not gone awayj 
having Japanefe merchants on fliore. 

The firft thing our old Portuguefe pilot did for us, 
was, to bring us acquainted with three miflionary 
Rom'tjh priefts, who were in the town, and who had 
been there fome time, converting the people to 
Chriftianity ; but we thought they made but poor 
work of it; and made them but forry Chriftians 
when they had done. However, that was not our 
bufinefs. One of thefe was a Frenchman^ whom they 
called father Simon ; he was a jolly well-conditioned 
man, very free in his converfation, not feeming fo 
ferious and grave as the other two did, one of whom 

was 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE/ ^83 

isras a Portuguefe^ and the other a Genoefe ; but father 
Simon was courteous, eafy in his manner, and very 
agreeable company ; the other two were more re- 
ferved, feemed rigid and auftere, and applied ferioufly 
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with, and 
infmuate themfelves among the inhabitants, where- 
ever they- had opportunity : we often eat and drank 
with thofe men : and though I mufl confefs, the con- 
verfion, as they call it, of the Chinefe to Chriftianity, 
is fo far from the true converfion required to bring 
heathen people to the faith of Christ, that it feems 
to amount toiittle more than letting them know the 
name of Christ, fay fome prayers to the Virgin Mary^ 
and her Son, in a tongue which they underftand 
not, and to crofs themfelves, and the like; yet itmuft 
be confeffed, that thefe religious, whom we call Mif- . 
fionaries, have a firm belief that thefe people Ihould 
be faved, and that they are the inftrument of it; and, 
on this account, they undergo not only the fatigue of 
jhe voyage, and hazards of living in fuch places, but 
oftentimes death itfelf, with the moft violent tortures^ 
for the fake of this work : and it would be a great 
want of charity in us, whatever opinion we have of 
the work itfelf, and the manner of their doing it, if 
we fhould not have a good opinion of their zeal, who 
undertake it with fo many hazards, and who have 
no profpeft of the leafl temporal advantage to them- 
felves. 

But, to return to my ftory : This French prieft, 
father Sinion^ was appointed, it feems, by order of 
the chief of the miffion, to go up to Pekin^ the royal 
feat of the Chinefe emperor ; and waited only for ano- 
tjh^r prieft, who was ordered to come to him from 

Macao^

J^acao^ to go along with him ; and we fcarce ev^ 
met together, but he was inviting me to go that joutr 
ney with him, telling me, how he would Ihew me all 
the glorious things of that mighty empire ; and among 
ihe reft, the greateft eity in the world ; a city, faid he, 
that your London^ and our Paris^ put together, can- 
pot be equal to^ This was the city of Peking which, 
I confefs, is very great, and infinitely full of people j 
but, as I looked on thofe things with .different eyes 
from other men, fo Ilhall give my opinion ofthemiij 
few words, when I come, in the courfe of my travels, 
to fpeak more particularly of them. 

But firft, I come to my friar or miffionary :' Dining 
.with him one day, and being very merry together, 
J fhewed fome little inclination to go with him j and 
he preffed me and my partner very hard, and with a 
great many perfuafions to confent. Why, father 
Swion^ fays my partner, why fliould you defire-our 
.company fo much ? You know we are heretics, and 
you do not love us, jior can keep us company with 
;any pleafure^ O ! fays he, you may, perhaps, be 
good catholics ia time j my bufmefs here is to con- 
cert heathens ; and who knows but I may convert you 
too ? Very well, father, faid I^ fo ypu will preach to 
|us all the way. I won't be troublefome to you, faid 
he ; our religion does not diveft us of good manners; 
befides, faid he, we are all here like countrymen; 
and fo we are, compared to the place we are in ; and 
if you are hugonots, and I a catholic, we may be all 
Chriflians at laft; at lead:, faid he, we are all gentle- 
jn(^n, and we may converfe fo, without being uneafy 
to one another. I liked that part of his difcourfe 
very well, and it began tp put mp in mind of my 

prieft

^rieft that I had left in the Brafils ; but this father 
Simon did not come up to his charafter by a great 
deal ; for though father Smon had no appearance of 
a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not that 
fund of Chriftian zeal, ftrift jnety, and fincere af-f 
fedion to religion, that my other good ecclefiaftic 
had, of whom I have faid fo much. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left usy 
nor foliciting us to go with him, but we had fome- 
f hirig elfe before us at that time ; for we had^ all this 
while, our fliip and our merchandize to difpofe of ;• 
and we began to.be very doubtful what we fliould do, 
for we were now in a place of very little bufmefs ; 
and once I was about to venture to fail for the river 
of Kilam^ and the city oi Nanquin : But Providence 
feemed now more vifibly, as I thought, than ever, ta 
Concern itfelf in our affairs ; and I was encouraged 
from this very time to think I fhould, one way ot 
other, get out of this eritangled circumftance, and be 
brought home to my own country again ; though I 
had not the leaft view of the manner ; and when I 
began fometimes to think of it, could not imagine by 
what method it was to be done. Providence, I fay^ 
began here to clear up our way a little ; and the firft 
thing that offered was, that our old Portuguefe pilot 
brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to en- 
quire what goods we had ; and, in the firft place, he 
bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price 
for it, paying us in gold by weight, fome in fmall 
pieces of their own coin, and fome in fmall wedges, 
of about ten or eleven ounces each* While we were 
dealing with him for our opium, it came into my head 
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the fliip 

too ; 



2S6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

too ; and I ordered the interpreter to propofe it to 
him. He fhrunk up his fhoulders at it, when it was 
firfl: propofed to him ; but, in a few days after, he 
came to me, with one of the mifEonary priefts for his 
interpreter, and told me, he had a propofal to make 
to me, and that was this : He had bought a great 
quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts (or 
propofals made to him) of buying the fhip j and that, 
therefore, he had not money enough to pay for the 
fhip ; but if I would let the fame men who were in the 
fhip navigate her, he would hire the fhip to go to 
yapariy and would fend them from thence to the 
Philippine iflands with another loading, which he 
would pay the freight of, before they went from 
Japan ; and that, at their return, he would buy the 
fhip* I began to liften to this propofal ; and fo eager 
did my head ftill run upon rambling, that I could not 
but begin to entertain a notion myfelf of going with 
him, and fo to fail from the Philippine iflands away 
to the South Seas; and accordingly I aflted the 
yapane/e merchant, if he would not hire us to the 
Philippijie iflands, and difcharge us there. He faid, 
no, he could not do that ; for then he could not have 
the return of his cargo ; but he would difcharge us in 
Japany he faid, at the fliip's return. Well, ftill I 
was for taking him at that propofal, and going my- 
felf; but my partner, wifer than myfelf, perfuaded 
me from it, reprefenting the dangers, as well of the 
feas, as of the yapane/e ^ who are a falfe, cruel, and 
treacherous people ; and then of the Spaniards at the 
Philippines ; more falfe, more cruel, more treacherous 
than they. 

But 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^87 

. But, to bring this long turn of our affairs to a con- 
clufion : the firft thing we had to do^ was to confult 
with the captain of the fhip, and with the men, and 
know if they were willing to go Xo "Japan; and, while- 
I was doing this, the young man, whom, as I faid, 
my nephew had left with me as my companion for my 
travels, came to me and told me, that he thought that 
voyage promlfed very fair, and that there was a great 
profpect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I 
undertook it ; but that if 1 would not, and would give 
him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I 
pleafed to order him ; that if ever he came to England y 
and I was there, and alive, he would render me a 
faithful account of his fuccefs, and it Ihould be as 
much mine as I pleafed^ 

I was really loth to part tvith him ; but, confidering 
the profpedt of advantage, N-jhich was really confider- 
able, and that he was a young fellow as likely to do 
well in it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go ; 
but firft I told him I would confult my partner, and 
give him an anfwer the next day. My partner and I 
difcourfed about it ; and my partner made a moft 
generous offer : he told me, you know it has been an 
unlucky fhip, and we both refolve not to go to fea in 
it again ; if your fteward (fo he called my man) will 
venture the voyage. Til leave my fhare of the velTel 
to him, and let him make the beft of it ; and if we 
live to meet in England^ and he meets with fuccefs 
abroad, he fhall account for one half of the pro- 
fits of the fhip's freight to us, the other fhall be 
his own. 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my 

young man, made him fuch an offer, I could do no

kfs than offer him the fame ; and all the fhip's com* 
pany being willing to go with him, we made over haK 
the fhip to him in property, and took a Writing froiii 
him, obliging him to account for the other ; and away 
he went to yapam The Japan merchant proved a 
very punftual honeft man to him, protefted him at 
yapan^ and got him a licence to come on fhore, which 
the Europeans in general have not lately obtained; 
paid him his freight very punftually, fent him to the 
Philippines^ loaded him with Japan and China wares, 
and a fupercargo of their own, who trafficking with 
the Spaniards J brought back European goods again, 
and a great quantity of cloves, and other fpice; and 
there he was not only paid his freight very well, and 
at a very good price, but being not willing to fell the 
Ihip then, the merchant furnifhed him with goods on 
his own account ; that, for fome money, and feme 
fpices of his own, which he brought with him, he 
went back to the Manillas^ to the Spaniards^ where 
he fold his cargo very well. Here, having gotten a 
good acquaintance at Manilla^ he got his fhip made a 
free fhip ; and the governor of Manilla hired him to 
go to Acapulco in America^ on the coafl of Mexico; 
and gate him a licence to land there, and trayel to 
Mexico; and to pafs in any Spanijh fhip to Europe y 
with all his meii. 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and 
there he fold his fhip j and having there alfo obtained

Being now to part with the fhip, and fliip's com* 
pany, it came before us, of courfe, to confider what 
recompence we fliould give to the two men, that 
gave us fuch timely notice of the defign againfl us in 
the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done 
«s a confiderable fervice, and deferv^d well at our 
hands ; though, by the way, they were a couple of 
rogues too : for, as they believed the ftory of our 
being pirates, and that we had really run away with 
the fhip, they came down to us, not only to betray the 
defign that was formed againfl us, but to go to fea 
with us as pirates ; and one of them confeffed after- 
wards, that nothing elfe but the hopes of going a 
roguing brought him to do it. However, the fer- 
vice they did us was not the lefs ; and therefore, as I 
had promifed to be grateful to them, I firft ordered 
the money to be paid to them, which they faid was 
due to them on board their refpeftive fhips ; that is 
to fay, the Englijhman nineteen months pay, and to 
the Dutchman feven; and, over and above that, I 
gave each of them a fmall fum of money in gold, 
which contented them very well : then I made the 
Englijhman gunner of the Ihip, the gunner being now 
made fecond mate and purfer ; the Dutchman I made 
boatfwain : fo they were both very well pleafed, and 
proved very ferviceable, being both able feamen, and 
very flout fellows. 

We were now on fliore in China. If I thought 

myfelf banifhed, and remote from my own country 

at Bengal^ where I had many ways to get home for 

my money, what could I think of myfelf now, when 

^ Vol. IL U I was 



ago LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was gotten about a thoufand leagues farther off 
from home, and perfeftly deftitute of all manner of 
profpedk of return ! 

All we had for it was this ; that in about four 
months time there was to be another fair at that 
place where we were, and then we might be able 
to purchafe all forts of the manufaftures of the coun- 
try, and withal might poffibly find fome Chineje 
junks or veffels from Nanquin, that would be to be 
fold, and would carry us and our goods whither we 
pleafed* This I liked very well, and refolved to 
wait ; befides, as our particular perfons were not 
obnoxious, fa if any Englijh or Dutch Ihips came 
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to 
load our goods, and get paflage to fome other place 
in India nearer home. 

Upon thefe hopes we refolved to continue here ; 
but, to divert ourfelves, we took two or three jour- 
nies into the country ; firft, we went ten days jour- 
ney to fee the city of Nanquirij a city well worth 
feeing indeed : they fay it has a million of people in 
it ; which, however, I do not believe : It is regularly 
built, the ftreets all exactly ftrait, and gofs one 
another in direft lines, which gives ti^^^ftco, of it 
great advantage. 

But when I came to compare the miferabFe people 
of thefe countries with our^s ; their fabrics, their 
manner of living, their government, their religionj 
their wealth, and their glory (as fome call it), I muft 
confefs, I do not fo much as think it worth naming, 
or worth my while to write of, or any that jQiall come 
after me to read* 

It 



01? ROBINSON CRUSOE, 29 1 

It IS very obfervable, that we wonder at the gran- 
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go- 
vernment, the manufadures, the commerce, and the 
condud of thefe people ; not that they are to be won- 
dered at, or, indeed, in the leaft to be regarded ; 
but becaufe, having firft a notion of the barbarity of 
thofe countries, the rudenefs, and the ignorance that 
prevail there, we do not expefl: to find any fuch 
things fo far off. 

Otherwife, what are their builings to the palaces 
and royal buildings of Europe ? What their trade to 
the univerfal commerce of England^ Holland^ France j 
and Spain ? What their cities to our's, for wealth, 
ftrength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and an 
infinite variety ? What are their ports, fupplied with a 
few junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer- 
chants fleets, our large and powerful navies ? Our 
city of London has more trade than all their mighty 
empire. One Englijh^ or Dutch^ or French man of 
war of 80 guns, would fight with and deftroyall 
the Ihipping of China. But the greatnefs of their 
wealth, their trade, the power of their government, 
and ftrenglh of their armies are furprizing to us, 
becaufe, as I have faid, confidering them as a -bar- 
barous nation of pagans, little better than favages, 
we did not expe£t fuch things among them ; and 
this, indeed, is the advantage with which all their 
greatnefs and power is reprefented to us : otherwife, 
it is in itfelf nothing at all ; for, as I have faid of 
their fhips, fo it may be faid of their armies and 
troops ; all the forces of their empire, though they 
were to bring two millions of men into the field to-

country, and ftarve themfelves. If they were to 
befiege a ftrong town in Flanders j or to fight a dif- 
ciplined army, one line of German cuirafliers, or of 
French cavalry, would overthrow all the horfe of 
China ; a million of their foot could not fland be- 
fore one embattled body of our infantry, ported fo 
as not to be furrounded, though they were not to be 
one to twenty in number : nay, I do not boaflif Ifay, 
that 30,000 German or EngUjh foot, and 10,000 
French horfe, would fairly beat all the forces of 
China. And fo of our fortified towns, and of the 
art of our engineers, in affaulring and defending 
towns ; there is not a fortified town in China could 
hold out one month againft the batteries and attacks 
of an European army ; and at the fame time, all the 
armies of China could never take fuch a town as 
Dunkirk^ provided it was not ftarved ; no, not in ten 
years fiege. They have fire-arms^ it is true, but 
they are awkward, clumfy, and uncertain in going 
off; they have powder, but it is of no ftrength; 
they have neither difcipline in the field, exercife in 
their arms, (kill to attack, or temper to retreat: 
and therefore I muft confefs it feemed flrange to mc 
when I came home, and heard our people fay fuch 
fine things of the power, riches, glory, magnifi- 
cence, and trad£ of the Chinefe^ becaufe I faw and 
knew that they were a contemptible herd or croud of 
ignorant, fordid flaves, fubjedted to a government 
qualified only to rule fuch a people ; and, in a word, 
for I am now launched quite befide my defign, I fay, 
in a word, were not its diftance inconceivably great 
from Mufcovy^ and were not the Mtyiovite empire

almofl as rude, impotent, and ill-governed a croud 
of flaves as they, the czar of Mufcovy might, with 
much eafe, drive them all out of their country, and 
conquer them in one campaign ; and had the czar, 
who I lince hear is a growing prince, and begins to 
appear formidable in the world, fallen this way, in* 
ftead of attacking the warlike Swedes^ in which at- 
tempt none of the powers of Europe would have 
envied or interrupted him ; he might, by this time, 
have been emperor of China j inftead of being beaten 
by the king of Sweden at Narua^ when the latter 
was not one to fix in number. As their ftrength and 
their grandeur, fo their navigation, commerce, and 
hufbandry, is imperfeft and impotent, compared to 
the fame things in Europe. Alfo, in their knowledge, 
their learning, their ikill in the fciences ; they have 
globes and fpheres, and a fmatch of the knowledge 
of the mathematics ; but when you come to enquire 
into their knowledge, how Ihort-fighted are the wifeft 
of their ftudents ! They know nothing of the mo- 
tion of the heavenly bodies ; and fo grofsly, abfurd* 
ly ignorant, that when the fun is eclipfed, they 
think it is a great dragon has affaulted and run away 
with it ; and they fall a clattering with all the drums 
and- kettles in the country, to fright the monfter 
away, juft as we do to hive a fwarm of bees. 

As this is the only ei^curlion of tjiis kind which I 
have made in all the account I have given of my 
travels, fo I fhall make no more defcriptions of 
countries and people : it is none of my bufinefs, or 
any part of my defign ; but giving an account of my 
own adventures, through a life of infinite wander- 
ings, and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps,

^94 LI^E AND ADVENTURES 

few have heard the like of, I fliall fay nothing of the 
mighty places, defart countries, and numerous peo- 
ple, I have yet to pafs through, more than relates 
to my own ftory, and which my concern among 
them wdll make necefTary. I was now, as near as I 
can compute, in the heart of China^ about the lati-r 
tude of thirty degrees north of the line, for we 
were returned from Nanquin ; I had indeed a mind 
to fee the city of Pekin^ which I had heard fo much 
of, and father Simon importuned me daily to do it : 
at length his time of going away being fet, and the 
other miflionary, who was to go with him, being ar- 
rived from Macaoj it was neceflary that wefliould re- 
folve either to go, or not to go ; fo I referred him to 
my partner, and left it wholly to his choice ; who, 
at length, refolved it in the affirmative ; and we pre- 
pared for our journey. We fet out with very good 
advantage, as to finding the way j for we got leave 
to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, 
a kind of viceroy, or principal magiftrate, in the 
province where they refide, and who take great ftate 
upon them, travelling with great attendance, and 
with great homage from the people, who are fome- 
times greatly impoverifhed by them, becaufe all the 
countries they pafs through are obliged to furnifh 
provifions for them, and all their attendants. That 
which I particularly obferved, as to our travelling 
with his baggage, was this ; that though we received 
fufficient provifions, both for ourfelves and our horfes, 
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we 
were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the 
market-price of the . country, and the mandarin's 
fteward, or commiiTary of the provifions, collefted 

it 



CW ROBINSON CRUSOE* 295 

It duly From us ; fo that our travelling in the retinue 
of *the mandarin, though it was a very great kind- 
nefs to us, was not fuch a mighty favour in him, but 
was, indeed, a great advantage to him, confidering 
there were about thirty other people travelling in the 
fame manner befides us, under the proteQ:ion of his 
retinue, or, as we may call it, under his convoy. 
TThis, I fay, was a great advantage to him ; for the 
country furnifhed all the provifions for nothing, and 
he took all our money for them. 

We were five^-and-twenty days travelling to Pekin^ 
through a country infinitely populous, but miferably 
cultivated j the hufbandry, ceconomy, and the way 
of living, all very miferable, though they boaft fo 
much of the induftry of the people : I fay mifera*- 
ble ; and fo it is ; if we, who underftand how to 
live, were to endure it, or to compare it with our 
own ; but not fo to thefe poor wretches, who know 
no other. The pride of thefe people is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty^ 
livhich adds to that which I call their mifery. I muft 
needs think the naked favages of America live much 
more happy, becaufe, as they have nothing, fo they 
defire nothing ; whereas thefe are proud and info- 
lent, and, in the niain, are mere beggars and drudges ; 
their oftentation is inexpreffible, and is chiefly fhewed 
in their clothes and buildings, and in the keeping 
multitudes of fervants or flaves, and, which is to 
the lad degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the 
world but themfelves. 

I muft confefs, I travelled more pleafantly after- 
wards, in the defarts and vaft wildernefTes of Grand 
Tartary^ than here ; and yet the roads here are well 
U 4 paved. 



Ct,g6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

paved, and well kept, and very convenient for tra- 
vellers : but nothing was more awkward to me, than 
to fee fuch an haughty, imperious, infolent people, 
in the midft of the groffeft fimplicity and ignorance; 
for all their famed ingenuity is no more. My friend, 
father Simon^ and I, ufed to be very merry upon thefe 
occafions, to fee the beggarly pride of thofe people: 
for example, coming by the houfe of a country gen- 
tleman, as father Simon called him, about ten leagues 
off from the city of ^anquin^ we had, firft of all, 
the honour to ride with the matter of the houfe about 
two miles ; the ftate he rode in was a perfeft Don 
^lixotifniy being a mixture of pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greafy Don was very proper for 
a fcaramouch, or merry-andrew ; being a dirty ca- 
lico, with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, 
fuch as hanging fleeves, taffety, and cuts and flaflies 
almoft on every fide: it covered a rich taffety veil, 
as greafy as a butcher, and which teftified, that his 
honour muft needs be a moft exquifite floven. 

His horfe was a poor, lean, ftarved, hobbling crea- 
ture, fuch as in England might fell for about 
thirty or forty fhillings j and he had two flaves 
followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature 
along : he had a whip in his hand, and he bela- 
boured the bead as fafl about the head as his flaves 
did about the tail; and thus he rode by us with 
^bout ten or twelve fervant^ ; and we were told he 
was going from the city to his country feat, about 
half a league before us. We travelled on gently, 
but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us ; 
and as wp flopped at a village about an hour to re. 
frefh us, when we came by the couixtry feat of tl\is

great man, we faw him in a little place before his 
door, eating his repaft ; it was a kind of a garden* 
but he wa« eafy to be feen ; and we were given to 
underftand, that the more we looked on him, the 
better he would be pleafed. 

He fat under a tree, fomething like the palmetto- 
tree, which efFeftually (haded him over the head, 
and on the fouth fide; but under the tree alfo was 
placed a large umbrella, which made that part look 
well enough : he fat lolling back in a great elbow- 
chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat 
being brought him by two women flaves, he had two 
more, whofe office, I think, few gentlemen in Eu» 
rope would accept of their fervice in, viz. one fed 
the 'fquire with a fpoon, and the other held the difh 
with one hand, and fcraped off what he let fall upon 
his worftiip's beard and taffety veft, with the other ; 
while the great fat brute thought it below him to em- 
ploy his own hands in any of thofe familiar offices, 
which kings and monarchs would rather do than be 
troubled with the clumfy fingers of their fervants, 

I took this time to think what pain men's pride 
puts them to, and how troublefome a haughty tem* 
per, thus ill-managed, muft be to a man of common 
fenfe ; and, leaving the poor wretch to pleafe him- 
felf with our looking at him, as if we admired his 
pomp, whereas we really pitied and contemned him, 
we purfued our journey ; only father Simon had the 
curiofity to flay to inform himfelf what dainties the 
country juflice had to feed on, in all his (late ; which 
he faid he had the honour to tafte of, and which was, 
I think, a dofe that an Englijh hound would fcarce 
J^ave eaten^ if it had been offered him, viz. a mefs 

of

of boiled rice, with a great piecfi of garlick in it, 
and a little bag filled ;with green pepper, and ano- 
ther plant which they have there, fomething like 
our ginger, but fmelling like mufk, and tafling like 
muftard j all this was put together, and a fmall lump 
or piece of lean mutton boiled in it ; and this wa^ 
his worfliip's repaft, four or five fervants more at- 
tending at a diftance. If he fed them meaner than 
he was fed himfelf, the fpice excepted, they muft fare 
verycoarfely indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was refpeded like a king ; furrounded always with 
his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances 
with fuch pomp, that I faw little of him but at a dif- 
tance ; but this I obferved, that there was not a 
horfe in his retinue, but that our carriers pack-horfes 
in England {eem to me to look much better ; but they 
were fo covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, 
and fuch like trumpery, that you cannot fee whether 
they are fat or lean. In a word, we could fcarce fee 
any thing but their feet and their heads. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I had given an account of being over, 
I had no anxious thoughts about me ; which made 
this journey much the pleafanter to me; nor had I 
any ill accident attended me, only in the pafling or 
fording a fmall river, my horfe fell, and made me 
free of the country, as they call it ; that is to fay> 
threw me in ; the place was not deep, but it wetted 
me all over : I mention it, becaufe it foiled my 
pocket-book, wherein I had fet down the names of 
feveral people and places which I had occafion to re-

member, and which not taking due care of, the 
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be 
read, to my great lofs, as to the names of fome 
places which I touched at in this voyage. 

At length we arrived at Pekin : I had nobody 
with me but the youth, whom my nephew the cap- 
tain had given me to attend me as a fervant, and 
who proved very trufty and diligent ; and my part- 
ner had nobody with him but one fervant, who was 
a kinfman. As for the Portuguefe pilot, he being 
defirous to fee the court, we gave him his paffage, 
that is to fay, bore his charges for his company ; and 
toufe.him as an interpreter, for he underftood the 
language of the country, and fpoke good French 
and a little Englijh ; and, indeed, this old man was a 
pioft ufeful implement to us every where ; for we had 
not been above a week at Pekin^ when he came laugh- 
ing : Ah, Seignior Inglefe^ faid he, I have fomething 
to tell you, will make your heart glad. My heart 
glad ! faid I : What can that be ? I don't know any 
thing in this country can either give me joy or grief, 
to any great degree. Yes, yes, faid the old man, in 
broken Englijh^ make you glad, me forrow ; forry he 
would have faid. This made me more inquifitive. 
Why, faid I, will it make you forry ? Becaufe, faid 
he, you have brought me here twenty-five days 
journey, and will leave me to go back alone ; and 
which way ihall I get to my port afterwards, without 
a Ihip, without ^ hprfe, without ^^^«w^ .^ So he called 
money ; being his broken Latin j of which he had 
abundance to make us merry with. 

In fhort, he told us there was a great caravan of 
Mufcovy and Polijh merchants in the city, and that they 

W(2re 



300 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

\vere preparing lo fet out on their journey, by land, 
to Mufcovy^ within four or five weeks, and he was 
fure we would take the opportunity to go with them, 
and leave him behind to go back alone. I confefs I 
was furprifed with this news : a fecret joy fpread it- 
felf over my whole foul, which I cannot defcribe, 
and never felt before, or fince ; and I had no power, 
for a good while, to fpeak a word to the old man ; 
but at lad I turned to him : How do you know this ? 
faid I : are you fure it is true ? Yes, he faid, I met 
this morning, in the ftreet, an old acquaintance qf 
mine, an Armenian^ or one you call a Grecian^ who 
is among them; he came laft from Ajiracan, zxA 
was defigning to go to Tonquitiy where I formerly 
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now re- 
folved to go back with the caravan to Mo/cow^ and 
fo down the river of Wolga to Ajiracan. Well, Seig- 
nior, >faid I, do not be uneafy about being left to go 
back alone ; if this be a method for my return to 
Engla7id^ it fhall be your fault if you go back to 
Macao at all. We then went to confult together 
what was to be done, and alked my partner what he 
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would 
fuit with his affairs : he told me he would do juft as 
I would ; for he had fettled all his affairs fo well at 
Bengal^ and left his effefts in fuch good hands, that 
as we made a good voyage here, if he could veft it 
in China filks, wrought and raw, fuch as might be 
worth the carriage, he would be content to go to 
England^ and then ipiake his voyage back to Bengaly 
by the company's fhips. 

Having refolved upon this, we agreed, that if our 

Portuguefe pilot would go with us, wq would bear his 

3 charges 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 30! 

charges to Mo/cow^ or to England^ If he" pleafed ; 
nor, indeed, were we to be efteemed over generous 
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him 
farther ; for the fervice he had done us was really worth 
all that, and more ; for he had not only been a pilot 
to us at fea, but he had been alfo'like a broker for us 
on Ihore; and his procuring for us the y apart mer- 
chant, was fortie hundreds of pounds in our pockets. 
So we confulted together about it; and, being 
willing to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing 
him juftice, and very willing alfo to have him with us 
befides, for he was a moll neceffary man on all oc- 
cafions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined 
gold, which) as I compute it, came to about 175 
pounds fterling between us, and to bear his charges, 
both for himfelf and horfe, except only a horfe to 
carry his goods. 

Having fettled this among ourfelves, we called 
him to let him know what we had refolved : I told 
him, he had complained of our being like to let him 
go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were 
refolved he fliould not go back at all : that as we had 
refolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we re- 
folved alfo he fhould go with us, and that we called 
him to know his mind. He' Ihook his head, and 
laid it was a long journey, and he had no pecune to 
carry him thither, nor to fubfift himfelf when he 
came thither. We told him, we believed it was fo, 
and therefore we had refolved to do fomething for 
him, that fhould let him fee how fenfible we were of 
the fervice he had done us ; and alfo how agreeable 
he was to us : and then I told him what we had 
refolved to give him here, which he might lay out as 

we 



302 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we would do our own ; and that as for his charges, if 
he would go with us, we would fet him fafe afliore^ 
(life and cafuahies excepted) either in Mufcovy or in 
England^ which he would, at our own charge, except 
only the carriage pf his goods. 

He received the propofal like a man tranfported, 
and told us, he would go w^th us over the whole 
world ; and fo, in ihort, we all prepared ourfelves 
for the journey. However, as it was with us, fo it 
was with the other merchants, they had many things 
to do ; and inftead of being ready in five weeks, it 
was four months and fome odd days before all things 
were got together. 

It was the beginning of February^ our ftyle, when 
we fet out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot 
had gone exprefs back to the port where we had firfl 
put in, to difpofe of fome goods which we had left 
there ; and I, with a Chinefe merchant, whom I had 
fome knowledge of at Nanquiriy and who came to 
Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanquirij where I 
bought ninety pieces of fine damalks, with about two 
hundred pieces of other very fine filks, of feveral 
forts, fome mixed with gold, and had all thefe brought 
to Pekin againft my partner's return : befides this, we 
bought a very large quantity of raw filk, and fome 
other goods ; our cargo amounting, in thefe goods 
only, to about three thoufand five hundred pounds 
fterling, which, together with tea, and fome fine 
callicoes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and cloves, 
loaded in all eighteen camels for our Ihare, befides 
thofe we rode upon ; which, with two or three fpare 
horfes, and two horfes loaded with provifions, made 

"^ us. 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 303 

US, in fliort, twenty-fix camels and horfes in pur 
retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I can 
remember, made between three and four hundred 
horfes and camels, and upward of an hundred and 
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all 
events. For, as the eaftern caravans are fubjeft to 
be attacked by the Arabs.^ fo are thefe by the Tar* 
tars; but they are not altogether fo dangerous as the 
Arabs J nor fo barbarous when they prevail. 

The company confifted of people of feveral nations, 
fuch as Mufcovites chiefly ; for there were about (ixty 
of them who were merchants or inhabitants of Muf" 
cow J though of them forae were Livonians ; and to 
our particular fatisfadion, five of them were ScotSy 
who appeared alfo to be men of great experience in 
bufinefs, and very good fubftance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen- 
tlemen and merchants; that is to fay, all the paflen- 
gers, except the fervants, to a great council, as they 
termed it. At this great council every one depofited 
a certain quantity of money to a common ftock, for 
the neceflary expence of buying forage on the way, 
where it was not otherwife to be had, and for fatif- 
fying the guides, getting horfes, and the like. And 
here they conflituted the journey, as they called it, 
i^/z. They named captains and ofl[icers to draw us all 
up, and give the command in cafe of an attack, and 
gave every one their turn of command. Nor was 
this forming us into order any more than what we 
found needful upon the way, as fhall be obferved in 
its place. 

The 



304 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The road all on this fide of the country is very po- 
pulous, and IS full of potters and earth-makers ; that 
is to fay, people that tempered the earth for the China 
ware J and, as I was going along, our Portuguefe 
pilot, who had always fomething or other to fay to 
make us merry, came fneering to me, and told me> 
he would fhew the greateft rarity in all the country ; 
and that I fhould have this to fay of China ^ after all 
the ill-humoured things I had faid of it, that I had 
feen one thing which was not to be feen in all the 
world befide. I was very importunate to know what 
it was ; at laft he told me, it was a gentleman's houfe, 
built all with China ware. Well, faid I, are not the 
materials of their building the produd of their own 
country ; and fo it is all Qhina ware, is it not ? No, 
no, fays he, I mean, it is a houfe all made of China 
ware, fuch as you call fo in England; or, as it is 
called in our country, porcelain. Well, faid I, fuch 
a thing may be : How big is it ; Can we carry it in 
a box upon a camel ? If we can, we will buy it. 
Upon a camel ! faid the old pilot, holding up both 
his hands, why there is a family of thirty people 
lives in it. 

I was then curious, indeed, to fee it ; and when I 
came to it, it was nothing but this : it was a timber 
houfe, or a houfe built, as we call it in England^ with 
lath and plaifter, but all the plaiftering was really 
China ware, that is to fay, it was plaiftered witli the 
earth that ma^es China ware. 

The outfide, which the fun fhone hot upon, was 
glazed, and looked very well, perfedly white, and^ 
painted with blue figures, as the large China ware 
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been 

burnt* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

burnt* As to the infide, all the walls^ inftead of 
wainfcot, were lined with hardened and painted tiles, 
like the little fquare tiles we call gaily tiles in England^ 
all made of the fined Chinay and the figures exceed- 
ing fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of co- 
lours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one 
figure, but joined fo artificially with mortar, being 
made of the fame earth, that it was very hard to fee 
where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were 
of the fame compofition^ and as hard as the earthen 
floors we have in ufe in feveral parts of England^ 
efpecially Lincolnjhire^ Nottinghamjhire^ Leicejierjhire^ 
&c. as hard as fl:one, and fmooth, but not burnt 
and painted, except fome fmaller rooms, like clofets, 
which were all, as it were, paved with the fame tile ; 
the cielings, and ih a word, all the plaiftering-work 
in the whole houfe, were of the fame earth ; and, 
after all, the rpof was covered with tiles of the 
feme, but of a deep fliining black. 

This was a China warehoufe indeed, truly and li- 
terally to be called fo ; and, had I not been upon the 
journey, I could have fl:aid fome days to fee and Ex- 
amine the particulars of it. They told me there 
were fountains and fifh-ponds in the garden, all 
paved at the bottom and fides with the fame, and 
fine fl:atues fet up in rows on the walks, entirely 
formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole. 

As this is one of the fingularities o£ China^ fo 
they may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very 
fure, they excel in their accounts of it ; for they 
told me fuch incredible things* of their perform- 
ance in crockery-ware, for fuch it is, that I care 
not to relate, as knowing it could not be true :— • 
One told me, in particular, of a workman that made

a fhipy with all its tackle^ and mafts, and fails, iff 
earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If he 
had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to 
Japan in it, I might have faid fomething to it indeed ; 
but as it was, I knew the whole ftbry, which was, 
in fhort, afldng pardon for the word, that the fellow 
lied ; fo I fmiled, and faid nothing to it. 

This odd fight kept me two hours behind the ca- 
ravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined 
me about the value of three fliillings ; and told me, 
if it had been three days journey without the wall, 
as it was three days within, he mufl have fined me 
four times as much, and made me alk pardon the 
next council day : fo I promifed to be more orderly? 
for, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made for 
keeping all together were abfolutely neceffary for our 
common fafety. 

In two days more we paifed flie great China wall, 
made for a fortification againft the Tartars ; and a 
very great work it is, going over hills arid moun* 
tains in an endlefs track, where the rocks are impaffa- 
ble, and the precipices fuch as no enemy could pot 
fibly enter, or, indeed, climb up, or where, if they 
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us, its 
length is near a thoufand Englijh miles, but that the 
country is five hundred, in a ftraight meafured line, 
which the wall bounds^ without meafuring the 
windings and turnings it takes : *tis about four fa- 
thom high, and as many thick in fome places. 

I flood flill an hour, or thereabouts, without 
trefpaffing on our orders, for fo long the caravan 
was in paffing the gate ; I fay, I flood flill an hour 
to look at it, on every fide, near, and far off, I

mean, what was within my view ; and the guide of 
our caravan, who had been extolling it for the won- 
der of the world, was mighty eager to hear my opi- 
nion of it. Itold him it was a moft excellent thing 
to keep off the Tartars^ which he happened not to 
underftand as I meant it, and fo took it for a com- 
pliment: but the old pilot laughed : O Seignior Inglefe^ 
faid he, you fpeak in colours. In colours ! faid I, 
what do you mean by that ? Why you fpeak what 
looks white this way, and black that way ; gay one 
way, and dull another way : you tell him it is a 
good wall to keep out Tartars ; you tell me, by that, 
it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartars ; or, 
wiil keep out none but Tartars : 1 underftand you. 
Seignior Inglefe^ I underftand you, faid he, joking ; 
but Seignior Chinefe underftand you his own way. 

Well faid I, Seignior, do you think it would ftand 
out an army of our country people, with a good 
train of artillery; or our engineers, with two com- 
panies of mmers^? Would they not batter it down 
in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, or 
blow it up into the air, foundation and all, that there 
fliould be no fign of it left ? Ay, ay, faid he, I know 
that. The Chine/e wanted mightily to know what I 
faid, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, 
for we were then almoft out of their country, and 
he was to leave us in a little time afterwards ; but 
when he knew what I had faid, he was dumb all 
the reft of the way, and we heard no more of his 
fine ftory of the Chinefe power and greatnefs whila 
he ftaid. 

After we had pafled this mighty Nothing, called 
a wall, fomething like the Pids wall, fo famous in , 
Northumberland^ and built by the Romans^ we begaa

to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people 
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities, 
as being fubjed to -the inroads and depredations of 
the Tartars^ who rob in great armies, and there- 
fore are not to be refilled by the naked inhabitants 
of an open country. 

And here I began to find the neceffity of keeping 
together in a caravan, as we travelled ; for we faw 
feveral troops of Tartars roving about ; but when I 
came to fee them diflindly, I wondered how that the 
Chinefe empire could be conquered by fuch contempti- 
ble fellows ; for they are a mere herd or crowd of 
•wild fellows, keeping no order, and uhderftanding 
no difcipline, or manner of fight. 

Their horfes are poor, lean, ftarved creatures, 
taught nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this 
we found the firfl day we faw them, which was after 
we entered the wilder part of the country, Our 
leader for the day gave leave for about fixteen of us 
to go a hunting, as they call it ; and what was this 
but hunting of fheep! However, it may be called 
hunting too ; for the creatures are the wildeft, and 
fwiftefl of foot, that ever I faw of their kind ; only 
they will not run a great way, and you are fure of 
fport when you begin the chace ; for they appear ge- 
nerally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like tnie 
flieep, always keep together when they fly. 

In purfuit of this odd fort of game, it was, our 
hap to meet with about forty Tartars : Whether they 
were hunting mutton as we were, or whether they 
looked for another kind of prey, I know not; but 
' as foon as they faw us, one of them blew a kind of 
horn very loud, but with a barbarous found that I 

had

had never heard before ; and, by the way, never 
care to hear again. We all fuppofed this was to call 
their friends about them ; and fo it was ; for in lefs 
than half a quarter of an hour, a troop of forty or 
. fifty more appeared at about a mile diftance ; but 
our work was over firft, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Mo/cow happened 
to be amongfl: us ; and as foon as he heard the horn, 
he told us, in fhort, that we had nothing to do but 
to charge them immediately, without lofs of time ; 
and, drawing us up in a line, he alked. If we were 
refolved ? We told him. We were ready to follow 
him : So he rode direftly up to them. They flood 
gazing at us, like a mere crowd, drawn up in no ' 
order, nor fhewing the face of any order at all ; but 
as foon as they faw us advance, they let fly their ar- 
rows ; which, however, mifled us very happily : It 
feems they miftook not their aim, but their diftance ; 
for their arrows all fell a little fhort of us, but with 
fo true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards 
nearer, we muft have had feveral men wounded, if 
not killed. 

Immediately we halted ; and though it was at a 
great diftance, we fired, and fent them leaden bullets 
for wooden arrows, following our fhot full gallop, 
f efolving to fall in among them fword in hand ; for 
fo our bold Scot that led us, direfted. He was, in- 
deed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that vi- 
gour and bravery on this occafion, and yet with fuch 
a cool courage too, that I never faw any man in adlion 
fitter for command. As foon as we came up to them, 
we fired our piftols in their faces, and then* drew ; but 
they fled in the greateft confufion imaginable ; the 

X 3 only 



3IO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

only ftand any of them made was on our right, where 
three of them flood, and, by figns, called the reft 
to come back to them, having a kind of fcymitar in 
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs. 
Our brave commander, without afldng any body to 
follow him, galloped up clofe to them, and with his 
fufil knocked one of them off his horfe, killed the 
fecond with his piftol, and the third ran away ; and 
thus ended our fight ; but we had this misfortune 
attending it, viz. That all our mutton that we had 
in chace got away. We had not a man killed or 
hurt ; but, as for the Tartars^ there were about five 
of them killed ; how many were wounded, we knew 
not ; but this we knew, that the other party wasfo 
frighted with the noife of our guns, that they fled, 
and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinefe dominions, 
and therefore the Tartars were not fo bold as after- 
wards ; but in about five days we entered a vaft 
great wild defart, which held us three days and 
nights march ; and we were obliged to carry our 
water with us in great leather bottles, and to encamp 
all night, juft as I have heard they do in the defarts 
of Arabia. 

I a(ked our guides, whofe dominion this was in? 
and they told me this was a kind of border that 
might be called No Man's Land ; being part of the 
Great Karakathy^ or Grand Tartary ; but that, how- 
ever, it was reckoned to China ; that there was no 
care taken here to preferve it from the inroads of 
thieves ; and therefore it was reckoned the word defart 
in the whole inarch, though we were to go over feme 
much larger. 

I In 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 311 

In paffing this wildernefs, which, I confefs, was 
at the firft view very frightful to me, we faw two 
or three times little parties of the Tartars^ but they 
feemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no 
defign upon us ; and fo, like the man who met the 
devil, if they had nothing to fay to us, we had no- 
thing to fay to them ; we let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came fo near as 
to ftand and gaze at us ; whether it was to confider 
what they Ihould do, viz. to attack us, or not at- 
tack us, we knew not ; but when we were paffed at 
fome diflance by them, we made a rear guard of forty 
men, and flood ready for them, letting the caravan 
pafs half a mile, or thereabouts, before us : After a 
while they marched off, only we found they affaulted 
us with five arrows at their parting ; one of which 
wounded a horfe, fo that it difabled him ; and we 
left him the next day, poor creature, in great need 
of a good farrier. We fuppofe they might fhoot more 
arrows, which might fall fhort of us ; but we faw no 
more arrows, or Tartars^ at that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
being not fo good as at firft, though ftill in the do- 
minions of the Emperor of China ; but lay, for the 
moft part, in villages, fome of which were fortified, 
becaufe of the incurfions of the Tartars. When 
we came to one of thefe towns (it was about two 
days and a halPs journey before we were to come to 
the city of Naum^J I wanted to buy a camel, of 
which there are plenty to be fold all the way upon 
that road, and of horfes alfo, fuch as they are, be- 
caufe fo m'any caravans coming that way, they are 
X 4 very 



31 ft LIFE AND ADVEllTUllES 

very often wanted. The perfon that I fpoke to 
to get me a camel, would have gone and fetched it 
for me ; but I, like a fool, muft be officious, and 
go myfelf along with him. The place was about 
two miles out of the village, where, it feems, they 
kept the camels and horfes feeding under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company, 
and a Chinefe^ being defirous, forfooth, of a little va. 
riety. When we came to this place, it was a low 
marfhy ground, walled round with a ftone wall, piled 
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a 
park, with a little guard of Chinefe foldiers at the 
doors : Having bought a camel, and agreed for the 
price, I came away ; and the Chinefe man, that went 
with me, led the camel, when on a fudden came up 
five Tartars on horfeback ; two of them feized the 
fellow, and took the camel from him, while the 
other three ftepped up to me and my old pilot j feeing 
us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about 
me but my fword, which could but ill defend me 
againft three horfemen. The firft that came up 
flopped fhort upon my drawing my fword (for they 
are arrant cowards \) but a fecond coming upon 
my left, gave me a blow on the head, which I never 
felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to 
myfelf, what was the matter with me, and where I 
was, for he laid me flat on the ground ; but my ne- 
ver-failing old pilot, the Fortuguefe (fo providence, 
unlooked for, direfts deliverances from dangers, which 
to us are unforefeen,) had a piftol in his pocket, 
which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither ; 
if they had, I fupppfe they would not have attacked 

USl 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

US ; but. cowards are always boldeft when there is no 
danger. 

The old man, feeing me down, with a bold heart 
ftepped up to the fellow that had ftruck me, and lay- 
ing hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him 
down by main force a little towards him with the 
other, he fhot him into the head, and laid him dead 
on the fpot ; he then immediately ftepped up to him 
who had ftopped us, as I faid, and before he could 
come forward again (for it was all done as it were in 
a moment) made a blow at him with a fcymitar, 
which he always wore, but, miffing the man, cut 
his horfe into the fide of his head, cut one of his 
ears oflF by the root, and a great flice down the fide 
of his face. The popr beaft, enraged with the 
wounds, was no more to be governed by his rider, 
though the fellow fat well enough too ; but away he 
flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach ; 
and, at fome diftance, rifing upon his hind legs, threw 
dpvinth^ Tartar J and fell upon him. 

In this interval the poor Chinefe came in, who had 
loft the camel, but he had no weapon ; however, fee- 
ing the Tartar down, and his horfe fallen upon him, 
he runs to him, and feizing upon an ugly ill-favoured 
weapon he had by his fide, fomething like a pole- 
axe, but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from 
him, and made fhift to knock his Tartarian brains 
out with it. But my old man had the thilrd Tartar 
to deal with ftill ; and, feeing he did not fly as he 
expedled, nor come on to fight him, as he appre- 
hended, but flood ftock ftill, the old man ftood ftill 
too, and falls to work with his tackle to charge his 
piftol again: but as foon as the Tartar faw the 
4 piftol. 



314 ^^F^ AND ADVEKTURXS 

piftol, whether he fupp.ofed it to be the fame or and* 
ther, I know not ; but away he fcoured, and left 
my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a 
complete viftory. 

By this time I was a little awake ; for I thought, 
when I firft began to awake, that I had been in a 
fweet fleep ; but, as I faid above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was 
the matter : in a word, a few minutes after, as fenfc 
returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where ; 
I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody ; then I felt my head ache ; and then, in 
another moment, memory returned, and every thing 
was prefent to me again, 

I jumped up upon my feet inftantly, and got hold 
of my fword, but no enemies in view. I found a 
Tartar lie dead, and his horfe Handing very quietly 
by him ; and looking farther, I faw my champion 
and deliverer, who had been to fee what the Chineje 
had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. 
The old man, feeing me on my feet, came running to 
me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being 
afraid before that I had been killed ; and feeing me 
bloody, would fee how I was hurt ; but it was not 
much, only what we call a broken head ; neither 
did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from 
the blow, other than the place which was hurt, and 
which was well again in two or three days. 

We mad'e no great gain, however, by this vidory ; 
for we loft a camel, and gained a horfe: but; that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
village, the man demanded to be paid for the ca- 
mel; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3x5 

mel ; I difputed it, and it was brought to a hearing 
before the CA/;2^ judge of the place; that is to fay, 
in Englijh^ we went before a juftice of the peace. 
Give him his due, he afted with a great deal of pru- 
dence and impartiality ; and having heard both fides, 
he gravely alked the Chinefe man that went with me 
to buy the camel, whofe fervant he was ? 1 am no 
fervant faid he, but went with the ftranger. At 
whofe requeft ? faid the juftice. At the ftranger's 
requeft, faid he. Why then, faid the juftice, you 
were the ftranger's, fervant for the time ; and the 
camel being delivered to his fervant, it was delivered 
to him, and he muft pay for it. 

I confefs the thing was fo clear, that I had 
not a word to fay ; but admiring to fee fuch juft ' 
reafoning upon the confequence, and fo accurate 
ftating the cafe, I paid willingly for the camel, and 
fent for another ; but you may obferve, Ifent for it ; 
I did not go to fetch it myfelf any more j I had 
enough of that. 

The city of l^aum is a frontier of the Chinefe em- 
pire : they call it fortified, and fo it is, as fortifica- 
tions go there ; for this I will venture to affirm, that 
all the Tartars in Karakathay^ which, I believe, are 
fome millions, could not batter down the walls with 
their bows and arrows ; but to call it ftrong, if it 
were attacked with cannon, would be to make thofe 
who underftand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have faid, above two days jour- 
ney of this city, when meffengers were fent exprefs 
to every part of the road, to tell all travellers and 
caravans to halt, till they had a guard fent to them ; 

for 



3l6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for that an unufual body of Tartan^ making ten 
thoufand in all, had appeared in the way, about 
thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, 
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were 
very glad to hear we fhould have a guard. Accord- 
ingly, two days after, we had 200 foldiers fent us 
from a garrifon of the Chinefe on our left, and three 
hundred more from the city of Naum^ and with thofe 
we advanced boldly : the three hundred foldiers from 
Naufn marched in our front, the two hundred in our 
rear, and our men on each fide of our camels with 
our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre : 
in this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought 
ourfelves a match for the whole ten thoufand Mogul 
Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the next day, 
when they did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when marching from 
a little well-fituated town, called Changu, we had a 
river to pafs, where we were obliged to ferry ; and 
had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been 
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan 
being over, the rear guard was behind : but they 
did not appear there. 

About three hours after, when we were entered upon 
a defart of about fifteen or fixteen miles over, be- 
hold, by a cloud of duft they raifed, we faw an 
enemy was at hand ; and they were at hand indeed, 
for they came on upon the fpur. 

The Chinefe^ our guard on the front, wha had 
talked fo big the day before, began to ftagger^ and 
the foldiers frequently looked behind them ; which is 
a certain figu in a foldier, that he is juft r^ady to run 

away^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 317 

^\vay. My old pilot was of my mind ; and being 
near me, he called out: Seignior Inglefej faid he, 
thofe fellows muft be encouraged, or they will ruin 
us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never 
fland it. I am of your mind, faid I : But what 
courfe muft be done ? Done, faid he j let fifty of our 
men advance, and flank them on each wing, and 
encourage them, and they will fight like brave fel- 
lows in brave company j but without it, they will 
every man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to 
our leader, and told him, who was exadbly of our 
mind ; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the 
right wing, and fifty to the left, and the reft made a 
line of referve ; for fo we marched, leaving the laft 
two hundred men to make another body to them- 
felves, and to guard the camels ; only that, if need 
were, they Ihould fend an hundred men to aflift the 
laft fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innume- 
rable company they were ; how m^ny, we could not 
tell, but ten thoufand we thought was the leaft. A 
party of them came on firft, and viewed our pofture, 
traverfing the ground in the front of our line ; and as 
we found them within gun-lhot, our leader ordered 
the two wings to advance fwiftly, and give them a 
falvo on each wing with their fhot, which was done ; 
but they went off, and I fuppofe went back to give 
an account of the reception they were hke to meet 
with ; and, indeed, that falute clogged their fto- 
machs ; for they immediately halted, ftood awhile 
to confider of it, and, wheeling off to the left, they 
gave over the defign, and faid no more to us for 
that time ; which was very agreeable to our circum- 

ftances. 



Jig LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

ftances, which were but very indiflferent for a batde 
with fuch a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naum^ 
or Naunm : We thanked the governor for his care for 
us, and coUeded to the value of loo crowns, or 
thereabouts, which we gave to the foldiers fent to 
guard us; and here we refted one day. This is a 
garrifon indeed, and there were nine hundred fol- 
diers kept here ; but the reafon of it was, that for- 
merly the Mufcovite frontiers lay nearer to them than 
they do now, the Mufcovites having abandoned that 
part of the country (which lies from the city weft, 
for about two hundred miles) as defolate and unfit 
for ufe ; and more efpecially, being fo very remote? 
and fo difficult to fend troops hither for its defence ; 
for we had yet above two thoufand miles to Mufcovy, 
properly fo called. 

After this we paffed feveral great rivers, and two 
dreadful delarts, one of which we were lixteen days 
paffing over, and which, as I faid, was to be called 
No Marias Land ; and on the 13th of Aprils we came 
to the frontiers of the Mufcovite dominions. I think 
the firft city, or town, or fortrefs, whatever it might be 
called, that belonged to the Czar of Mufcavy^ was 
called Argun^ being on the weft fide of the river 
Argun. 

I could not but difcover an infinite fatisfa&Ion, 
that I was now arrived in, as I called it, a Chriftian 
country; or, at leaft, in a country governed by 
Chriftians : for though the Mufcovites do, in my opi- 
nion, but juft deferve the name of Chrifliians ; (yet 
fuch they pretend to be, and are very devout in their 

way);

travels the world as I have done, and who had any 
power of refledHon j I fay, it would occur to him,

it made the very receffes of my foul rejoice to fee it.

320 LIFE AND ADVEKTURES 

all the reft of this country, for above a thoufand 
miles farther, is inhabited by the worft and moll 
ignorant of pagans : and fo indeed we found it. 

We were now launched into the greateft piece of 
folid earth, if I underftand any thing of the furfece 
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
world : we had at leaft twelve hundred miles to the 
fea, eaftward ; we had at leaft two thoufand to the 
bottom of the Balic fea, weftward ; and almoft three 
thoufand miles, if we left that fea, and went on weft 
to the Britijh and French channels ; we had full five 
thoufand miles to the Indian or Perjtan fea, fouth; and 
about eight hundred miles to the frozen fea, north: 
nay, if fome people may be believed, there might be 
no fea north-eaft till we came round the pole, and 
confequently into the north-weft, and fo had a con- 
tinent of land into America^ no mortal knows where; 
though I could give fome reafons why I believe that 
to be a miftake too. 

As we entered into the Mufcovite dominions, a 
good while before we came to any confiderable town, 
we had nothing to obferve there but this : firft, that 
all the rivers run to the eaft. As I underftood by the 
charts which fome of our caravans had with them, 
it was plain that all thofe rivers r?ui into the great 
river Tamour^ or Gammour. This river, by the 
natural courfe of it, muft run into the eaft fea, or 
Chinefe ocean. The ftory they tell us, that the 
mouth of this river is choaked up with bulrufhes of a 
monftrous growth, viz. three feet about, and twenty 
or thirty feet high, I muft be allowed to fay, I be- 
lieve nothing of j but as its navigation is of no ufe, 

becaufe 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 32I 

becaufe there is no trade that way, the Tartars^ to 
whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle j 
fo nobody that ever I heard of, has been curious 
enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, 
or to come up from the mouth of it in (hips; but 
this is certain, that this river running due eaft, in 
the latitude of 60 degrees, carries a vaft concourfe 
of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty 
itfelfin that latitude; fo we are fure of fea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are 
feveral confiderable rivers, whofe ftreams t"un as due 
north as the Tumour runs eaft ; and thefe are all found 
to join their waters with the great river Tartarus^ 
named fo from the northermoft nations of the Mogul 
Tartars^ who, the Chinefe fay, were the firft Tartars 
in the world ; and who, as our geographers alledge, 
are the Gog and Magog mentioned in facred ftory. 

Thefe rivers running all northward, as well as all 
the other rivers I am yet to fpeak of, made it evident 
that the northern ocean bounds the land alfo on that 
fide ; fo that it does not feem rational in the leaft to 
think that the land can extend itfelf to join with 
America on that fide, or that there is not a commu- 
nication between the northern and the eaftern ocean ; 
but of this I Ihall fay no more ; it was my obfervation 
at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in this 
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by 
eafy and moderate journeys, and were very vifibly 
obliged to the care the czar of Mufcovy has taken 
to have cities and towns built in as many places as arc 
poflible to place them, where his foldiers keep garri- 
fbn, fomething like the ftationary foldiers placed

by the Romans in the remoteft countries of their 
empire, fome of which 1 had read w.re particularly 
placed in Britain for the fecurity of commerce, and 
for th€ lodging of travellers ; and thus it was here j 
for wherever we came, though at thefe towns and 
ftations, the garrifons and governor were Rufftam 
and profeffed mere pagans, facrifieing to idols, and 
worfhipping the fun, moon, and ftars, or all the 
hoft of heaven ; and not only fo, but were, of all 
the heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the 
moft barbarous, except only that they did not eat 
man^s flefli, as our favages of America did. 

Some inftances of this we met with in the 
country between Arguna^ where we enter the Muf 
covite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Rujians 
together, called Nertzifijkay ; in which fpace is a 
continued defart or foreft, which coft us twenty 
days to travel over it. In a village, near the lafl 
of thofe places, I had the curiofity to go and fee 
their way of living ; which is moft brutifh and un- 
fufferable : they had, I fuppofe, a great facrifice that 
day J for there flood out upon an old ftump of a 
tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil ;, 
at leaft as any thing we can think of to reprefent the 
devil that can be made : It had an head certainly not 
fo much as refembling any creature that the world 
ever faw ; ears as big as goats horns, and as high ; 
eyes as big as a crown piece ; and a nofe like a 
crooked ram's horn, and a mouth extended four- 
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, 
hooked like a parrot's under bill. It was drefled up 
in the filthieft manner that you can fuppofe j its up-

per garment was of fheep-fkins, with the wool out- 
ward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two 
horns growing through it : it was about eight feet 
high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other propor- 
tion of parts. 

This icarecrowwas fet upatthe outfideof thevillage ; 
and when I eame near to it, there were fixteen or 
feventeen creatures, whether men or women I could 
not tell, for they make no diftinftion by their habits, 
cither of body or head ; thefe lay all flat on the 
ground, round this formidable block of fhapelefs 
ViTood, I faw no motion among them any more than 
if they had been logs of woods like their idol ; at 
firfl I really thought they had been fo ; but when I 
came a little nearer, they ftarted up upon their feet ; 
and raifed an howling cry, as if it had been fo 
many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as 
if they were difpleafed at our difturbing them. A 
iittle way off from this monfter, and at the door of 
a tent or hut, made all of Iheep-lkins and cow^fkins, 
dried, flood three butchers : I thought they were 
fuch ; for when I came nearer to them, I found they 
had long knives in their hands, and in the middle 
of the tent appeared three flieep killed, and one 
young bullock, or fteer. Thefe, it feems, were fa- 
crifices to that fenfelefs log of an idol ; and thefe 
three men priefts belonging to it ; and the fpventeen 
proftrated wretches were the people who brought 
the offering, and were making their prayers to that 
flock. 

I confefs I was more moved at their flupidity, and 
this brutifh worfhip of an hobgoblin, than ever 1

rious and bed creature, to whom he had granted fo 
many advantages, even by creation, above the reft 
of the works of his hands, vefted with a reafonable 
foul, and that foul adorned with faculties and capa- 
cities adapted both to honour his Maker and be ho- 
noured by him ; I fay, to fee it funk and degenerated 
to a degree fo more than ftupid, as to proftrate itfelf 
to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary objeft dreffed 
up by themfelves, and made terrible to themfelves 
by their own contrivance, adorned only with clouts 
and rags ; and that this fhould be the effe£t of mere 
ignorance, wrought up into hellifh devotion by the 
devil himfelf; who, envying his Maker the homage and 
adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into 
fuch grofs, furfeiting, fordid, and bruitifh things, as 
one would think fhould fhock nature itfelf. 

But what fignified all the aftonifhment and reflec- 
tion of thoughts ? Thus it was, and I faw it before 
my eyes ; and there was no room to wonder at it, 
or think it impoflible. All my admiration turned to 
ragb ; and I rode up to the image or monfter, call 
it what you will, and with my fword cut the bonnet 
that was on its head in two in the middle, fo that it 
hung down by one of the horns ; and one of our 
men that was *with me, took hold of the (heep-flda 
that covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a moft 
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, 
and two or three hundred people came about my 
ears, fo that I was glad to fcour for it j for we faw

that moment to vifit them again.

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

Our caravan refted three nights at the town, 
which was about four miles off, in order to provide 
fome horfes, which they wanted, feveral of the 
horfes having been lamed and jaded with the badnefs 
of the way, and our long march over the laft de- 
fart ; fo we had fome leifure here to put my defign 
in execution. I communicated my projefl: to the 
Scots merchant, of Mofcow^ of whofe courage I had 
a fufEcient teftimony, as above. I told him what I 
had feen, and with what indignation I had fince 
thought, that human nature could be fo degenerate. 
I told him, I was refolved, if I could get but four 
or five men well armed to- go with me, to go and 
deftroy that vile, abominable idol ; to let them fee, 
that it had no power to help itfelf, and confequently 
could not be an objeft of worfhip, or to be prayed 
to, much lefs help them that offered facrifices to it. 

He laughed at me : faid he. Your zeal may be 
good; but what do you propofe to yourfelf by it ? 
Propofe ! faid I ; to vindicate the honour of God, 
which is infulted by this devil« worfhip. But how 
will it vindicate the honour of God ? faid he, while 
the people will not be able to know what you mean 
by it, unlefs you could fpeak to them too, and 
tell them fo ; and then they will fight you too, I will 
affure you ; for they ^re defperate fellows, and that 
efpecially in defence of their idolatry. Can we not, 
faid I, do it in the night, and then leave them the 
reafons in writing, in their own language ? Writing ! 
faid he, why there is not in five nations of them, 
one man that knows any thing of a letter, or how 
to read a word in any language, or in their own. 
Y 3 Wretched 



3^6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Wretched ignorance ! faid I to him ; however, 1 
have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature may 
draw inferences from it to them, to let them fee how 
brutifh they are to worfhip fuch horrid things. Look 
you. Sir, faid he, if your zeal prompts you to it fo 
warmly, you muft do it ; but, in the next place, I 
would have you confider thefe wild nations of people 
are fubjeded by force to the czar of Mufcovy^ do- 
minions ; and if you do this, it is ten to one but 
they will come by thoufands to the governor of 
Nertzinjkay^ and complain, and demand fatisfaftion ; 
and if he cannot give them fatisfadion, it is ten to 
one but they revolt; and it wdll occafion a new 
war with all ihc Tartars in the country. 

This, I confefs, put new thoughts into my head 
for a while ; but I harped upon the fame firing ftill ; 
and all that day I was uneafy to put my projeQ: in 
execution. Towards the evening, the Scots merchant 
met me by accident in pur walk about the town, 
and defired to fpeak with me : I believe, faid he, 
I have put you off your good defign ; I have been 
a little concerned about it fmce ; for 1 abhor the 
idol and idolatry as much as you can do. Truly, 
faid I, you have put it off a little as to the execution 
of it, but you have not put it all out of my thoughts ; 
and, I believe, I fhall do it ftill before I quit this 
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for 
fatisfaftion. No, no, faid he; God forbid they 
fhould deliver you up to fuch a crew of monfters ! 
they fliall not do that neither ; that would be mur- 
dering you indeed. Why, faid I, how would they 
ufe me ? Ufe you ! faid he ; I'll tell you how they 
ferved a poor Ruffian^ who affronted them' in their 

worlhip 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 327 

"troTlhip juft as you did, and whom they took pri- 
foner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that 
he could not run away; they took him and ftripped 
him ftark naked, and fet him upon the top of the 
idol moufter, and flood all round him, and fhot as 
many arrows into him as would flick over his whole 
body ; and then they burnt him and all the arrows 
Clicking in him, as a facrifice to the idol. And was 
this the fame idol ? faid I. Yes, faid he, the very 
fame. Well, faid I, I will tell you a flory : So I 
related the flory of our men at Madagafcar^ and how 
they burnt and facked the village there, and killed 
man, woman, and child, for their murdering one of 
our men, juft as it is related before ; and when I 
had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do 
fo to this village. 

. He liftened very attentively to the flory ; but whea 
i talked of doing fo to that village, faid he, you mif- 
take very much ; it was not this village, it was al- 
mofl an hundred miles from this place; but it was 
the fame idol, for they carry him about in proceflion 
all over the country. Well, faid I, then that idol 
ought to be puniftied for it ; and it fhall, faid I, if I 
live this night out. 

In a word, finding me refolute, he liked the de- 
fign, and told me, I Ihould not go alone, but he 
would go with me ; but he would go firfl, and bring 
a flout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go alfo 
with us ; and one, faid he, as famous for his zeal 
as you canr-defire any one to be againfl fuch devilifli 
things as thefe. In a word, he brought me his com- 
rade, a Scotfman^ whom he called Captain Richard- 
Jon ; and I gave him a full account of what I had 

Y 4 feen. 



3a8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

feen, and alfo of what I intended ; and he told me 
readily, he would go with nje, if it coft him his life. 
So we agreed to go, only we three. I had, indeed, 
propofed it to my partner ; but he declined it. He 
faid, he was ready to afSft me to the utmoft, and 
upon all occafions, for my defence ; but that this 
was an adventure quite out of his way : fo, I fay, 
we refolved upon our work, only we three, and my 
man-fervant, and to put it in execution that night 
about midnight, with all the fecrecy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond thoughts, we were willing 
to delay it till the next night, becaufe the caravan 
being to fet forward in the morning, we fuppofed the 
governor could not pretend to give them any fatis- 
faftion upon us when we were out oT his power.— 
The Scots merchant, as fteady in his refolution to en- 
terprize it as bold in executing, brought me a Tar- 
tarus robe or gown of fheep-lkins, and a bonnet, 
with a bow and arrows, and had provided the fame 
for himfelf and his countryman, that the people, if 
they faw us, Ihould not be able to determine who we 
were. 

All the firft night we fpent in mixing up feme 
combuftible matter with aqua-vitae, gunpowder, and 
fuch other materials as we could get ; and, having 
a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour 
after night we fet out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at 
night, and found that the people had not the lead 
jealoufy of danger attending their idol ; the night 
was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough to 
fee that the idol flood juft in the fame pofture and 
place that it did before. The people feemed to be

all at their reft y only, that in the great hut, or tent 
as we called it, where we faw the three priefts, whom 
we miftook for butchers, we faw a light, and, go- 
ing up clofe to the door, we heard people talking, 
as if there were five or fix of them ; we concluded 
therefore, that if we fet wild-fire to the idol, thefe 
men would come out immediately, and run up to the 
place to refcue it from the deftruftion that we intended 
for it ; and what to do with them we knew not. Once 
we thought of carrying it away, and fetting fire to it 
at a diftance ; but when we came to handle it, we 
found it too bulky for our carriage ; fo we were at 
a lofs again. The fecond Scot/man was for fetting 
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the creatures 
that were there on the head, when they came out ; 
but I could not join with that; I was againft killing 
them, if it was poffible to be avoided. Well then, 
faid the Scots merchant, I will tell you what we will 
do ; we will try to make them prifoners, tie their 
hands, and mals:e them ftand and fee their idol 
deftroyed. 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread 
enough about us, which we ufed to tie our fire- 
works together with ; fo we refolved to attack thefe 
people firft, and with as little noife as we could. 
The firft thing we did, we knocked . at the door, 
when one of the priefts coming to it, we immediate- 
ly feized upon him, flopped his mouth, and tied his 
hands behind him and led him to the idpl, where we 
gagged him that he might not make a noife ; tied 
his feet alfo together, and left him on the ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expeding that 
another would come out to fee what the mattet 



230 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

was ; but we waited fo long till the third man came 
back to us; and then, nobody coining out, we 
fcnocked again gently, and immediately out came 
two more, and we ferved them juft in the fame man- 
ner, but were obliged to go all with them, and lay 
them down by the idol fome diftance from one 
another ; %vhen, going back, we found two more 
were come out to the door, and a third flood 
behind them within the door. We feized the two, 
and immediately tied them : when the third ftepping 
back, and crying out, my Scots merchant went in 
after him, and taking out a compofition we had 
made, that would only fmoke and (link, he fet 
fire to it, and threw it in among them : by that time 
the other Scot/man and my man taking charge of the 
two men already bound, and tied together alfo by 
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them 
there, to fee if their idol would relieve them, making 
hafte back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the 
hut with fo much fmoke that they were almoft fuffo- 
cated, we then threw in a fmall leather bag of 
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and, fol- 
lowing it in, we found there were but four people 
left, who, it feems, were two men and two women, 
and, as we fuppofed, had been about fome of their 
diabolic facrifices. They appeared, in fhort, fright- 
ed to death, at leaft fo as to fit trembling and ftupid, 
and not able to fpeak neither, for the fmoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had 
the other, and all without any noife. I fhould have 
faid, we brought them out of the houfe, or hut, firft ; 
for, indeed, w'e were not able to bear the fmoke any 

more 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33I 

more than they were. When we had done this, we 
carried them altogether to the idol : when we came 
there we fell to work with him ; and firft we daubed 
him all over, and his robes alfo, with tar, and fuch 
other ftuflF as we had, which was tallow mixed with 
brimftone ; then we flopped his eyes, and ears, and 
mouth full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a 
great piece of wildfire in his bonnet ; and then flick- 
ing all the combuftibles we had brought with us upon 
him, we looked about to fee if we could find any 
thing elfe to help to burn him ; when my Scot/man 
remembered, that by the tent, or hut, where the 
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether 
ftraw or rufhes I do not remember : away he and 
the other Scotfman ran, and fetched their arms full of 
that. When we had done this, we took all our pri- 
foners, and brought them, having untied their feet, 
.and ungagged their mouths, and made them fland 
up, and fet them juft before their monftrous idol, 
.and then fet fire to the whole. 

We flayed by it a quarter of an hour, or there- 
abouts, till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and 
ears of the idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, 
had fplit and deformed the fhape of it ; and, in a 
word, till we fa\y it burnt into a mere block or log 
of wood J and then fetting the dry forage to it, wc 
found it would be foon quite cdnfumed ; fo we began 
to think of going away; but the Scotfman faid: No, 
we mufl not go ; for thefe poor deluded wretches 
will all throw themfelves into the fire, and burn 
themfelves with the idol ; fo we refolved to flay till 
the forage was burnt down too, and then we came 
away and left them. 

In 



33* ^I^^ AND ADVENTURES 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow 
travellers, exceeding bufy in getting ready for our 
journey ; nor could any man fuggeft that we had been 
anywhere but in our beds, as travellers might be 
fuppofed to be, to fit themfelves for the fatigues of 
that day's journey. 

But it did not end fo ; for the next day came a 
great multitude of the country people, not only of 
this village, but of an hundred more, for aught 1 
know, to the town gates ; and, in a mofl outrageous 
manner, demanded fatisfaftion of the Rtcffian gover- 
nor, for the infulting their priefts, and burning their 
great ChamXhi-Thaungu ; fuch an hard name they 
gave the monftrous creature they worfhipped: the 
people of Nertzinjkay were at firft in a great confler- 
nation ; for, they faid, the Tartars were no lefs than 
thirty thoufand, and that in a few days more, they 
would be one hundred thoufand flronger. 

The Rujftan governor fent out meffengers to ap- 
peafe them, and gave them all the good words ima- 
ginable. He affured them he knew nothing of it, 
and that there had not a foul of his garrifon been 
abroad ; that it could not be from any body there j 
and if they would let him know who it was, they 
fhould be exemplarily punifhed. They returned 
haughtily. That all the country reverenced the 
great Cham-Chi-Thaungu^ who dwelt in the fun, and 
no mortal woulci have dared to offer violence to his 
image, but fome Chrijiian mifcreant ; fo they called 
them, it feems, and they therefore denounced war 
againft him, and all the Ruffians^ who, they faid, 
were mifcreants and Chri/iians. 

The 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 333 

The governor, ftill patient, and unwilling to 
make a breach, or to have any caufe of war alledged 
to be given by him, the czar having ftraightly charged 
him to treat the conquered country with gentlenefs 
and civility, gave them ftill all the good words he 
could; at laft he told them, there was a caravan 
gone towards Rujfia that morning, and perhaps it ^ 
was fome of them who had done them this injury; 
and that, if they would be fatisfi^d with -that, he 
would fend after them, to enquire into it. This 
feemed to appeafe them a little; and accordingly 
the governor fent after us, and gave us a particular 
account how the thing was ; intimating, withal, that 
if any in our caravan had done it, they fhould make 
their efcape ; but that, whether they had done it or 
no, we fhould make all the hafte forward that 
was pofSble ; and that in the mean time, he would 
keep them in play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. How- 
ever, whgga it came to the caravan, there was no- 
body knew any thing of the matter; and, as for us 
that were guilty, we were the leaft of all fufpefted; 
none fo much as aiked us the queftion ; however, the 
captain of the caravan, for the time, took the hint 
that the governor gave us, and we marched or tra- 
velled two days and two nights without any confide- 
rable ftop, and then we lay at a village called 
Plothus ; nor did we make any long ftop here, but 
haftened on towards Jarawena^ another of the czar 
of Mtifcovy's colonies, and where we expefted we 
fhould be fafe; but it is to be obferved, that here 
we began, for two or three days march, to enter 
upon a vaft namelefs defart, of which I fhall fay more

who had injured them, for we were not the people ; 
fo defired them not to iiiflurb us ; for if they did, 
wc fhould defend ourfelves. 

They were far from being fatisfied with this for an 
anfwer, and a great crowd of them came down in 
the morning, by br6ak of day, to our camp ; but, 
feeing us in fuch an advantageous fituation, they 
diirft come no farther than the brook in our front, 
where they flood, and fliewed us fuch a number, as, 
indeed, terrified us very much ; for thofe that fpoke 
leaft of them, fpoke of ten thoufand. Here they 
flood, and looked at us a while, and then fetting up 
a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows among 
us J but we were well enough fortified for that, for 
we were fheltered under our baggage ; and I do not 
remember that one man of us was hurt. 

Some time after this, we faw them move a little 
to our right, and expefted them on the rear, when 
a cunning fellow, a Cojfack^ as they call them, of 
Jarawena^ in the pay of the Mufcovites^ calling to 
the leader of the caravan, faid to him, I will fend 
all thefe people away to Sibeilka : This was a city four 
or five days journey, at leaft to the fouth, and rather 
behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and, 
getting oahorfeback, he rides away from our rear 
direftly, as it were, back to Nertzin^ay ; after this, 
he takes a great circuit about, and comes to the army 
of the Tartars y as if he had b'een fent exprefs to 
tell them a long ftory, that the people who had 
burnt their Cham-ChuThaungu were gone to Sibeilkdj 
with a caravan of mifcreants, as he called them ; 
that is to fay, Chriftians ; and that they were re-

a moft violent hurry^ to Sibeilka^ which, it feems, 
was five days journey to the fouth ; and in lefs than 
three hours they were eiitirely out of our fight, 
and we never heard any niore of them, nor ever 
knew whether they went to that other place called 
Sibeilka^ or no. 

So we paffed fafely on td the city of Jarawena^ 
where there was a garrifon of Mufcovites ; and there 
we refted five days, the caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the lafl day*s march, and with want 
of reft in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful defart, which 
held us three-and-twenty days march. We furniflied 
ourfelves with fome tents here, for the better ac- 
commodating ourfelves in the night ; and the leader 
of the caravan procured fixteen carriages, or wag- 
gons, of the country, for carrying our water and 
provifions ; and thefe carriages were our defence 
.every night round our little camp ; fo that had the 
Tartars appeared, unlefs they had been very nume- 
rous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt 
us. 

We may well be fuppofed to want reft again after 
this long journey ; for in this defart we faw nei- 
ther houfe or tree, or fcarce a bufh ; we faw, indeed, 
abundance of the fable*hunters, as they called* them : 
Thefe are all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary^ of which 
thi^ country is a part ; and they frequently attack 
Vql.II. Z fmall

fniall caravans ; but we faw no numbers of them to- 
gether. I was curious to fee the fable-lkins they 
catched ; but I could never fpeak with any of them; 
for they durft not come near us ; neither durft we 
ftraggle from our company to go near them. 

After we had paffed this defart, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited; that is to fay, A?e 
found towns and caftles fettled by the czar of Muf- 
covy^ with garrifons of ftationary foldiers to proted 
the caravans, and defend the country againft the 
Tartars^ who would otherwife make it very dan- 
gerous travelling ; and his czarifh majefty has given 
fuch ftri£t orders for the well guarding the caravans 
and merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard 
of in the country, detachments of the garrifon are 
always fent to fee travellers fafe from ftation to fta- 
tion. 

And thus the governor of Adtnjkoy^ whom I had 
aa opportunity to make a vifit to, by means of the 
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, of- 
fered us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there 
was any danger, to the next ftation. 

I thought long' before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe^ we fhould find the country better peopled, 
and the people more civilized ; but I found myfelf 
miftaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the 
Tonguefes to pafs through ; where we faw the fame 
tokens of paganifm and barbarity, or worfe, than 
before ; only as they were conquered by the Muf- 
co'vites^ and entirely reduced, they v/ere not fo dan- 
gerous ; but for the rudenefs of manners, idolatry, 
and polytheifm, no people in the world ever went 
beyond thern^ They are clothed all in fkins of

You know hot a man from a woman, neither by 
the ruggednefs of their countenances, or their 
clothes; and in the winter, w hen the ground is co- 
vered with fnow, they live under ground, in houfes 
like vaults, which have cavities or caves going from 
one to another. 

If the Tartan had their Cham-Cbi'Thaungu iox a 
whole village, or country, thefe had idols in every 
hut, and every cave; befides, they worfhip the 
flars, the fun, the water, the fnow ; and, in a word^ 
every thing that they do not underftand, and they 
underfland but very little ; fo that almofl every ele-* 
ment, every uncommon thing, fets them a facri-* 
ficing. 

But I am no more to defcrlbe people than coun- 
tries, any farther than my own ftory comes to be 
concerned in them. I met with nothing peculiar 
to myfelf in all this country, which, I reckon was, 
from the defart which I fpoke of laft, at leaft four 
hundred miles, half of it being another defart, 
which took us up twelve days fevere travelling, 
without houfe, tree or bufh ; but were obliged again 
to carry our own provifions, as well water as bread. 
After we were out of this defart, and had tra- 
_ veiled two days, we came to Janezay^ a Mufco* 
vite city or ftation, on the great river Janczay^ 
This river, they told us, parted Europe from Afia^ 
though our map-makers, as I am told, do not agree 
to it ; however, it is certainly the eaftern boundary 
of the antient Siberia^ which now makes a province 
only of the vaft Mufcovite empire, but is itfelf equal 
in bignefs to the whole empire of Germany.

340 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

And yet here I obferved ignorance and paganifin 
ftill prevailed, except in the Mufcovite garrifons: 
All the country between the river Obyj and the river 
Janezay^ is as entirely pagan, and the people as bar- 
barous, as the remoteft of the Tartars ; nay, as 
any nation, for aught I know, in Afta or America. 
I alfo found, which I obferved to the Mufcovite go. 
vernors, whom I had opportunity to converfe with, 
that the pagans are not much the wifer, or the nearer 
Chriftianity, for being under the Mufcovite go- 
vernment; which they acknowledged was true 
enough, but, they faid, it was none of their bu- 
finefs ; that if the czar expedled ta convert his 5i- 
berian^ or Tonguefs^ or Tartar fubjefts, h (hould be 
done by fending clergymen among them, not fol. 
diers ; and they added, with more fmcerity than I 
expefted, that they found it was not fo much the con- 
cern of their monarch to make the peopk Chriflians, 
as it was to make them fubjefts* 

From this river to the great river Ohy^ we croffed 
a wild uncultivated country ; I cannot fay 'tis a bar- 
barous fail \ *tis only barren of people, and wants good 
management ; otherwife it is in itfelf a mofl 
pleafant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What 
inhabitants we found in it are all pagans, except 
fuch as are fent among them from Ruffia ; for this 
is the country, I mean on both fides the river Ohjy 
v* hither the Mufcovite criminals, that are not put 
to death, are banifhed, and from whence it is next 
to impoflible they fliould ever come away. 

I have nothing material to fay of my particular 
affairs, till 1 came to Tobolfki^ the capital of Si- 

beria^ 



OTF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 341 

hfriay where I continued fome time on the following 
occafion : — 

We had been now almofl: feven months on our 
journey, and winter began to come on apace; 
whereupon my partner and I called a council about 
our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, 
confidering that we were bound for England^ and 
not for Mafcviv, to confider how to difpofe of our- 
felves. They told us of fledges and rein deer to 
carry us over the fnow in the winter-time ; and, in- 
deed, they have fuch things, as it would be incredi- 
ble to relate the particulars of, by which means the 
Ritffiam travel more in the winter than they can in 
fummerj becaufe in thefe fledges they are able to 
run night and day : the fnow being frozen, is one 
univerfal covering to nature, by which the the hills, 
the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all fmooth, and 
hard as a ftone ; and they run upon the furface, 
without any regard to what is underneath. 

Bdt I had no occafion to pufli at a winter journey 
of this kind ; I was bound to England^ not to Mof-^ 
€ow^ and my route lay two v/ays : either i mufl: go 
on as the caravan went, till I came to Jarijlaw^ and 
then go off wefl: for Narva^ and the gulph of iv«- 
hnd^ and fo either by fea or land to Dantzick^ where 
I might poffibly fell my CJyina cargo to gopd advan- 
tage, or I mufl: leave the caravan at a little town on 
the Dwinaj from whence I had but fix days by wa- 
t^r to Arch-Angel^ and from thence might be fure 
of fliipping, either to England^ Hollandj or Ham- 
burgh. 

% 3 Now 



34^ ^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

Now to go any of thefe joumies in the winter 
would have been prepofterous ; for as to Dantzicy the. 
Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get paffagej 
and to go by land in thofe countries, was far lefs 
fafe than among the Mogul Tartars ; likewifc to 
Arch-Angdy in O^ober all the fhips would be gone 
from thence, and even the merchants, who dwell 
there in fummer, retire fouth to Mo/cow in the win- 
ter, when the fliips are gone ; fo that I ftiould have 
nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a 
fcarcity of provifions, and muft lie there in an 
empty town all the winter : fo that, upon the whole, 
I thought it much my better way to let the caravan 
go, and to make provifion to winter where I was, 
viz. at Toboljkiy in Siberia^ in the latitude of fixty 
degrees, where I was fure of three things to wear 
out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of provifions, 
fuch as the country aflForde^, a warm houfe, with 
fuel enough, and excellent company ; of all which 
I fhall give a full account in its place. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my 
beloved ifland, where I never felt cold, except when, 
I, had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do 
to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any 
fire but without doors, and my neeeffity, in dreffing 
my food, &c. Now I made me three good vefts, 
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down 
to the feet, and button clofe to the wrifts, and all 
thefe lined with furs, to make them fufBciently 
warm. 

As to a warm houfe, I muft confefs, I greatly dif-^ 
like our way in England^ of, making fires in every 

room 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 343 

room in the houfe, in open chimnles, whi:h, when 
the fire was out, alvifays kept the air in the room 
cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in a 
good houfe in the town, I ordered a chimney to be 
built like a furnace, in the centre of fix feveral rooms, 
like a ftove ; the funnel to carry the fmoke went up 
one way, the door to come at the fire went in 
another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, 
but no fire feen ; like as they heat the bagnios in 
England. 

By this means we had always the fame climate in 
all the rooms, and an equal heat was preferved ; and 
how cold foever it was without, it was always warm 
within ; and yet we faw no fire, nor were ever in- 
commoded with any fmoke. 

The mod: wonderful thing of all was, that it (hould 
be poffible to meet with good company here, in a 
country fo barbarous as that of the moft northerly 
parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, and v/ithin 
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. 

But this beinej^ the countrv where the ftate crimi- 
nals of Mufcovy, as I obferved before, are all baniflied ; 
this city was full of noblemen, princes, gentlemen, 
colonels, and^ in fhort, all degrees of the nobility, 
gentry, foldiery, and courtiers of Mufcovy. Here 
were the famous Prince Galilfken, or Galoffken, and 
his fon ; the old general Robojiijhy, and feveral other 
perfons of note, and fome ladies. 

By means of my Scots merchant, whom, never - 
thelefs, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance 
with feveral of thefe gentlemen, and fome of them 
of the firft rank ; and from thefe, in the long winter 
nights, in which I ftaid here, I received feveral agree- 

Z 4 able 



344 L^f^ AND ADVENTURES 

able vifitj. It was talking one night with a certain 
prince, one of the baniflied minifters of ftate be-i 
longing to the czar of Mufcovy^ that my talk of my 
particular cafe began. He had been telling me abun- 
dance of fine things, of the greatnefs, the magni- 
ficence, and dominions, and the abfolute power of 
the emperor of the Ruffians. I interrupted him, and 
told him, I was a greater and more powerful prince 
than ever the 3car of Mufcovy was, though my do- 
minions were not fo large, or my people fo many. 
The Ruffian grandee looked a little furprized, and 
fixing his eyes fteadily upon me, began to wonder 
what I meant. 

I told him hjs wonder would ceafe when I had 
explained myfelf. Firft, I told him, I had the ab- 
folute difpofal of the lives and fortunes of all my 
fubjefls : That notwithftanding my abfolute power, 
I had not one perfpn difaffeded to my government 
or to my perfon, in all my dominions. He Ihook 
his head at that, and faid. There, indeed, I out-did 
the czar of Mufcovy* I told him, that all the lands 
in my kingdom were my own, and all my fubjefts 
were not only my tenants, but tenants at will ; that 
they would all fight for me to the laft drop ; and 
that never tyrant, for fuch I acknowledged myfelf to 
be, was ever fo univerfally beloved, and yet fo hor-» 
ribly feared, by his fubjedts. 

After amufing them with thefe riddles in go- 
vernment for a while, I opened the cafe, and told 
them the ftory at large of my living in the ifland, 
and how I managed both myfelf and the people there 
that were under me, juft as I have fince minuted it 
down. They were exceedingly taken with the ftory, 

and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. , 345 

and efpecially the prince, who told me with a figh, 
that the true greatnefs of life was to be matter of 
ourfelves ; that he would not have changed fuch a 
ftate of life as mine, to have been czar of Mufcovy ; 
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he 
feemed to be baniflied to there, than ever he found 
in the higheft authority he enjoyed in the court of 
his matter the czar : that the heighth of human wif- 
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circum- 
ftances, and to make a calm within, under the 
weight of the greateft ttorm without. When he 
came firtt hither, he faid, he ufed to tear the hair 
from his head, and the clothes from his back, as 
others had done before him ; but a little time and 
confideration had made him look into himfelf, as 
well as round himfelf, to things without : that he 
found the mind of man, if it was but once brought 
to refleft upon the ttate of univerfal life, and how 
little this world was concerned in its true felicity, 
was perfedly capable of making a felicity for itfelf, 
fully fatisfying to itfelf, and fuitable to its own beft 
ends and defires, with but very little aflittance from 
the world ; that air to breathe in, food to fuftain life, 
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercife, in order 
to health, compleated, in his opinion, all that the 
world could do for us : and though the greatnefs, 
the authority, the riches, and the pleafures, which 
feme enjoyed in the world, and which he had en- 
joyed his fhare of, had much in them that was agree- 
able to us, yet he obferved, that all thofe things 
chiefly gratified the coarfeft of our affeftions ; fuch 
as our ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, 
pur vanity, and our fenfualityj all which were, 

indeed.

indeed, the mere produft of the worft part of inan^ 
were in themfelves crimes, and had in them the feeds 
of all manner of crimes ; but neither were related to 
or concerned with, any of thofe virtues- that confti- 
tuted us wife men, or of thofe graces which diftin- 
guiflied us as Chri/iians : that being now deprived of 
all the fancied felicity, which he enjoyed in the full 
exercife of all thofe vices, he faid, he was at leifure 
to look upon the dark fide of them, where he found 
all manner of deformity ; and was now convinced, 
that virtue only makes a man truly wife, rich, and 
great, and preferves him in the way to a fuperior 
happinefs in a future ftate ; and in this, he faid, 
they were more happy in their banilliment, than all 
their enemies were, who had the full pofTeffion of all 
the wealth and power that they (the baulfhed) had 
left behind them. 

. Nor, Sir, faid he, do I bring my mind to this 
politically, by the neceffity of my circumftances^ 
which fome call miferable ; but, if I know any thing 
of myfelf, I would not go back, no not though 
my mafter, the czar, fhould call me, and offer to 
reinftate me in all my former grandeur; I fay, I 
would no more go back to it, than I believe my foul 
when it fliall be delivered from this prifbn of the body 
and has had a tafte of the glorious ftate beyond life> 
would come back to the goal of fiefh and blood it is 
now inclofed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt 
and grime of human affairs. 

He fpake this with fo much warmth in his temper, 
fo much earneftnefs and motion of his fpirits, which 
were apparent in his countenance, that it was evident 
it was the true fenfe of his foul ; and, indeed, there 
was no room to doubt his fincerity. 

I told 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 347 

I told him, i once thought myfelf a kind of a 
monarch in my old ftaticn, of which I had given 
him an account, but that I thought he was not a 
monarch only, but a great conqueror ; for that he 
that has got a viftory over his own exorbitant de- 
fires, and has the abfolute dominion over himfelf, 
and whofe reafon entirely governs his will, is cer- 
tainly greater than he that conquers a city. But, 
my lord, faid I, fhall I take the liberty to afk you a 
queftion ? With all my heart, faid he. If the door 
of your liberty was opened, faid I, would not you 
take hold of it to deliver yourfelf from this exile ? 

Hold, faid he, your queftion is fubtle, and re- 
quires fome ferious juft diftinftions to give it a fincere 
anfwer j and Pll give it you from the bottom of my 
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world would 
move me to deliver myfelf from the ftate of banilh- 
ment, except thefe two : Firft, the enjoyment of my 
relations j and, fecondly, a little warmer climate : 
but I proteft to you, that to go back to the pomp of 
the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a mi- 
nifter of ftate ; the wealth, the gaiety, and the plea- 
fures, that is to fay, follies of a courtier ; if my maf- 
ter fhould fend me word this moment, that he reftorcs 
me to all he banifhed me from ; I proteft, if I know 
myfelf at all, I would not leave this wildernefs, thefe 
defarts, and thefe frozen lakes, for the palace of 
Mo/cow. 

But, my lord, faid I, perhaps you not only are 
baniflied from the pleafures of the court, and from the 
power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be- 
fore, but you may be abfent too from fome of the con- 
yeniencies of life ; your eftate, perhaps, confiicated, 

and 



348 I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

and your effefts plundered ; and the fupplies left 
you here may not be fuitable to the ordinary demands 
of life. 

Ay, faid he, that is as you fuppofe me to be, a lord, 
or a prince, &c. So, indeed, I am ; but you are 
novv to confider me ohly as a man, an human crea- 
ture, not at all diftinguifhed from another \ and fo I 
can fuffer no want, unlefs I fhould be vifited with 
ficknefs and diftempers. However, to put the quef- 
lion out of difpute ; you fee our manner ; we are in 
this place five perfons of rank ; we live perfedly re- 
tired, as fuited to a ftate of banifhment ; we have 
fomething refcued from the fhipwreck of our fortunes 
which keeps us from the mere neceflity of hunting 
for our food ; but the poor foldiers who are here, 
without that help, Kve in as much plenty as we. 
They go into the woods, and catch fables and foxes ; 
the labour of a month will maintain them a year ; 
and as the way of living is not expenfive, fo it is not 
hard to get fufficient to ourfelves : So that objeftion 
is out of doors. 

I have no room to give a full account of the moft 
agreeable converfation I had with this truly great 
man ; in all which he fhewed, that his mind was fo 
mfpired with a fuperior knowledge of things, fo fup- 
portecj by religion, as well as by a vaft fhare of wif- 
dom, that his contempt of the world was really as 
much as he had expreffed, and that he was always 
the fame to the laft, as will appear in the ftory I am 
going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful 
winter I thought it to be ; the cold was fo intenfe, 

tha

that I couH not fo much as look abroad without 
being wrapt in furs, and a malk of fur before my 
face, or rather a hood, with only an hole for breath, 
and two for fights The little day-light we had, was, 
as we reckoned, for three months, not above fivt: 
hours a day, and fix at mod ; only that the fnow 
lying on the ground continually, and the weather 
being clear, it was nevar quite dark. Our horfes were 
kept (or rather ftarved) under-ground j and,, as, for 
our fervants (for we hired fervants here to look after 
our horfes and ourfelves), we had every now and then 
their fingers and toes to thaw, and take care of, left 
they (hould mortify and fall oiF. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houfes 
being clofe, the walls thick, the lights fmall, and the 
glafs all double. Our food was chiefly the flelh of 
deer, dried and cured in the feafon; good bread 
enough, but baked as bifcuits ; dried fifh of feveral 
forts, and fome flefh of mutton, and of buffaloes, 
which is pretty good beef. All the flore of pro- 
vifion for the winter are laid up in the fummer, and 
well cured ; our drink was water mixed with aqua 
vitae inftead of brandy ; and, for a treat, mead inllead 
of wine j which, however, they have excellent gootJ*

much care for the laft. We had a good ftock of tea, 
with which we treated our friends as above; and, in 
a word, we lived very chearfully and well, all things 
confidered. 

It was now Marchy and the days grown confider- 
ably longer, and the weather at leaft tolerable ; fo

35<3 JLIFfi AND ADVENTURES 

Other travellers began to prepare fledges to carry them 
over the fnow, and to get things ready to be going • 
but my meafures being fixed, as t have faid, for 
Arch' Angel, and not for Mu/covy or the Baltick, I 
made no motion, knowing very v/ell, th^t the Ihips 
from the fouth do not fet out for that part of the 
world till May or June ; and that if I was there at 
the beginning of Aiiguji, it would be as foon as any 
fliips would be ready to go away ; and therefore, I 
fay, I made no hade to be gone, as others did ; in a 
word, I faw a great many people, nay, all the tra- 
vellers, go away before me. ' It feems, every year 
they go from thence to Mofcow for trade ; viz. to 
carry furs, and buy neceflaries with them, which 
they bring back to furnifli their fliops ; alfo others 
went on the fame errand to Arch-Angel ; but then 
they alfo, being to come back again above eight 
hundred miles, went all out before me. 

In Ihort, about the latter end of May, I began to 
make all ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, 
it occurred to me, that feeing all thefe people were 
baniflied by the czar of Mu/covy to Siberia, and yet, 
when they came there, were at liberty to go whither 
they would ; why did they not then go away to any 
part of the world wherever they thought fit ? and I 
began to examine what fliould hinder them from 
making fuch an attempt. 

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon 
that fubje£t with the perfon I have mentioned, who 
anfwered me thus ; Confider, firft, - faid he, the 
place where we are ; and, fecondly, the condition we

people who are banifhed hither. We arefurrounded, 
faid he, with ftronger things than bars and bohs: 
on the north fide is an unpavigable ocean, where fhip 
never failed, and boat never fwam,; neither, if we 
had both, could we know whither to go with them. 
Every other way, faid he, we have above a ihoufand 
miles to pafs through the czar's own dominions, and 
by ways utterly impaflable, except by the roads made 
by the government, and through the towns garrifoned 
by his troops ; fo that we could neither pafs undif- 
covered by the road, or fubfift any other way : fp 
that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I Was filencedj indeed, at once, and found that 
they were in a prifon, every jot as fecure, as if they 
had been locked up in the caftle of Mofcovj ; how. 
ever, it came into my thoughts, that I might 
certainly be made an inflrument to procure the efcape 
of this excellent perfon, and that it was very eafy 
for me to carry him away, there being'no guard over 
him in the country ; and as I was not going to Mof^ 
cow^ but to Arch'Angel^ and that I went in the na- 
ture of a caravan, by which 1 was not obliged to lie 
in the flationary towns in the defart, but could en- 
camp every night were I would, we might eafily. 
pafs uninterrupted to Arch-Angel, where I could im- 
mediately fecure him on board an Englijh or Dutch 
fhip, and carry him off fafe along with me ; and 
as to his fubfiftence, and other particulars, that 
fhould be my care, till he fliould better fupply him- 
felf. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earneftly 

on me all the while Ifpoke ; nay, I could fee in his 

very face, that what I faid put his fpirits into an ex-

lieve I fpoke my very foul to you, and that I had 
really maintained that degree of felicity here, that 
had placed me above all that the world could give 
me, or do for me ? Did you believe I was fincere,

flopped, as if he would hear what I would fay ; but,

fefs, aflonifhed at the thing, as well as at the man,

fummons by Providence, who hasi the care and

and to render himfelf ufeful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himfelf. How do 
you know. Sir, faid he, warmly, but that inftead of 
a fummons from Heaven, it may be a feint of another 
inftrument, reprefenting, in all the alluring colours, 
to me, the fhew of felicity as a deliverance, which 
may in itfelf be my fnare, and tend directly to my 
ruin ? Here I am free from the temptation of return. 
lAg to my former miferable greatnefs j there I am 
not fure, but that all the feeds of pride, ambition, 
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my 
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a word, 
again overwhelm me ; and then the happy prifoner, 
whom you fee now mafter of his fouPs liberty, fhall 
be the miferable Have of his own fenfes, in the full 
pofleffion of all perfonal liberty. Dear Sir, let me 
remain in this bleffed confinement, banifhed from the 
crimes of life, rather than purchafe a fhow of free- 
dom at the expence of the liberty of my reafon, 
and at the expence of the ' future happinefs which 
now I have in my view, but fhall then, I fear, quick- 
ly lofe fight of; for I am but flelh, a man, a mere 
man, have paffions and afFedions as likely to poffefs 
and overthrow me as any man : O be not my friend

great) that though the weather was extremely cold, 
it put him into a moft violent fweat, and I found he 
wanted to give vent to his mind ; fo I faid a word or 
two, that I would leave him to confider of it, and 
wait on him again j and then I withdrew to my own 
apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard fomebody at or 
near the door of the room, and I was going to open 
the door ; but he had opened it, and come in : My 
dear friend, faid he, you had almoft overfet me, but 
I am recovered : do not take it ill that I do not clofe 
with your oflFer ; I affure you, it is not for want of 
a fenfe of the kindnefs of it in you ; and I come to 
make,the moft fincere acknowledgement of it to you j 
but, I hope, I have got the vidory over myfelf. 

My lord, faid I, I. hope you are fully fatisfied, that 
you did not refift the call of Heaven, Sir, faid he,* 
if it had been from Heaven, the fame power would 
have influenced me to accept it ; but I hope, and am 
fully fatisfied, that it is from Heaven that I decline 
it; and I have an infinite fatisfadion in the parting, 
that you fhall leave me an honeft man ftill, though 
not a free man, 

I had nothing to do but to acquiefce, and make 
profefEon to him of my having no end in it, but a 
fincere defire to ferve him. He embraced me very 
paflionately, and aflTured me, he was fenfible of that, 
and fhould always acknowledge it ; and with that 
he oflTered me a very fine prefent of fables, too much 
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum- 
ftances; and I would have avoided them, but he 
would not be refufed. 

The 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35^^ 

The next morning I fent my fervant to his lord- 

fliip, with a fmall prefent of tea, two pieces of China 

damafk, and four little wedges of japan gold, which 

did not all weigh above fix ounces, or thereabouts ; 

but were far fhort of the value of his fables, which 

indeed, when I came to England^ I found worth near 

two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and 

one piece of the damaflc, and one of the pieces of 

gold, which had a fine ftamp upon it, of the Japan 

coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it, 

but would not take any more ; and fent word by my 

fervant, that he defired to fpeak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me, I knew what 
had paffed between us, and hoped I would not move 
him any more in that affair ; but that, fince I made 
fuch a generous offer to him, he afked me, if I had 
kindnefs enough to offer the fame to another perfon 
that he would name to me, in whom he had a great 
fliare of concern. I told him, that I could not fay I 
inclined to do fo much for any one but himfelf, for 
whom 1 had a particular value, and fhould have been 
glad to have been the infttument of his deliverance : 
however, if he would pleafe to name the perfon to me, 
I would give him my anfwer, and hoped he would 
not be difpleafed with me, if he was with my anfwer. 
He told me, it was only his fon, who, though I had 
not feen, yet was in the fame condition with himfelf, 
and above two hundred miles from him, on the other 
fide the Oby ; but that, if I confented, he would 
fend for him. 

I made no hefitation, but told him I would do it : 

I made fome ceremony in letting him underftand 

that it was wholly on his account j and that feeing I 

A a 2 could

could not prevail on him, I would fhew my refpeS: 
to him by my concern for his fon : but thefe things 
^re too tedious to repeat here. He fent away the 
next day for his fon, and in about twenty days he 
came back with the meffenger, bringing fix or feven 
horfes loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the 
whole, amounted to a very great value. 

His fervants brought the horfes into the town, 
but left the young lord at a diftance till night, when 
he came incognito into our apartment, and his 
father prefented him to me ; and, in Ihort, we con- 
certed there the manner of our travelling, and every , 
thing proper for the journey. 

I had bought a confiderable quantity of fables, 
black fox-fkins, fine ermins, and fuch other furs 
that are very rich ; I fay, I had bought them in 
that city for exchange for fome of the goods brought 
from China ; in particular, for the cloves and nut- 
megs, of which I fold the greateft part here ; and 
the reft afterwards at Arch-Angel^ for a much better 
price than I could have done at London ; and my 
partner, who was fenfible of the profit, and whofe 
bufmefs, more particularly than mine, was merchan- 
dize, was mightily pleafed with our ftay, on account 
of the traffic we made here. 

It was in the beginning of June when I left this 
remote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the 
world ; and, indeed, it is fo far out of the road of 
commerce, that I know not how it Ihould be much 
talked of. We were now come to a very fmall cara- 
van, being only thirty- two horfes and camels in all, 
and all of them paffed for mine, though my new 
gueft was proprietor of eleven of them. It was moft 

natural 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 357 

natural alfo, that I fhould take more fervants with 
me than I had before, and the young lord paffed for 
my fteward ; what great man I paffed for myfelf I 
know not, neither did it concern me to enquire. 
We had here the worft and the largeft defart to pafs • 
over that we met with in all the journey ; indeed I 
call it the worft, becaufe the way was very deep in 
fome places, and very uneven in others ; the beft we 
had to fay for it, was, that we thought we had no 
troops of Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they 
never came on this fide the river Oby^ or at leaft but 
very feldom ; but we found it other wife, ^ 

My young lord had with him a faithful Mufcovite 
fervant, or rather a Siberian fervant, who was per- 
fedly acquainted with the country ; and who led us 
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the 
principal towns and cities upon the great road, fuch 
as Tumen^ Soloy Kamajkoj^ and feveral others ; be- 
caufe thcMicfcGvite garrifons, which are kept there, are 
very curious and ftridt in their obfervation upon tra- 
vellers, and fearching left any of the banifhed perfons 
of note Ihould make their efcape that way into Mt^f- 
covy ; but by this means, as we were kept out of the 
cities, fo our whole journey was a defart, and we 
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when 
we might have had good accommodation in the cities 
on th€ way : this the young lord was fo fenfible of, 
that he would not allow us to lie abroad, when we 
came to feveral cities on the way ; but lay abroad 
himfelf, with his fervant, in the woods, and met us 
, always at the appointed places. 

We were juft entered Europe^ having paffed the 
river Kama^ which, in thefe parts, is the boundary 

A a 3 between 



358 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

between Europe and Afta ; and the firfl: city on the 
European fide was called Soloy Kamojkoy^ which is as 
much as to fay, the great city on the river Kama; 
and here .we thought to have feen fome evident ahe- 
ration in the people, their manners, their habit, 
their religion, and their bufmefs ; but we were mif- 
taken ; for as we had a vaft defart to pafs, which, 
by relation, is near feven hundred miles long in fome 
places, but not above two hundred miles over where 
we paffed it ; fo, till we came pad that horrible 
place, we found very little difference between that 
country, and the Mogul Tartary ; the people moftly 
Pagans^ and little better than the fi^vages of America; 
their houfes and towns full of idols, and their way 
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as 
above, and the villages neat them ; where they 
are Chrijiians^ as they call themfelves, of the Greek 
church ; but even thefe have their religion mingled 
with fo many reliques of fuperflition, that it is fcarce 
to be known in fome places from mere forcery and 
witchcraft. 

In paffmg this foreft, I thought, indeed, we muft, 
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, efca- 
* ped, as before, have been plundered and robbed, 
and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves ; of what 
country they were, whether the roving bands of the 
OJliachi^ a kind of Tartars^ or wild people on the 
banks of the Ohy^ had ranged thus far; or whether 
they were the fable-hunters of Siberia^ I am yet at a 
lofs to know; but they were all on horfeback, 
carried bows and arrows, and were at firft about 
five-and-forty in number; they came fo near to

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 359 

US as within about two mufquet fliot ; and, afking 
no queftions, they furrounded us with their horfe> 
and looked very eameftly upon us twice ; at length 
they placed thenifelves juft in our way ; upon which 
we drew up in a little line before our camels, being 
not above fixteen men in all ; and being drawn up 
thus, we halted, and fent out the Siberian fervant 
who attended his lord, to fee who they were ; his 
mafter was the more willing to let him go, becaufe 
he was not a little apprehenfive that. they were a 
Siberian troop fent out after him. The man came 
up near them with a flag of truce, and called to 
them ; but though he fpoke feveral of their languages, 
or dialefts of languages rather, he could not under^ 
ftand a word they faid : however, after fome figns 
to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, fo 
he faid he underftood them to mean, offering to 
flioot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back 
no wifer than he went, only that by their drefs, 
he faid, he believed them to be fome Tartars of 
Kalmuck^ or of the CircaJJian hords ; ^nd that there 
muft be more of them on the great defart, though 
he never heard that ever any of them were feen fo 
far north before. 

This was fmall comfort to us; however, we 
had no remedy: there was on our left hand, at 
about a quarter of a mile^s diftance, a little grove 
or clump of trees, which flood clofe together, and 
very near the road; I immediately refolved we 
would advance to thofe trees, ^nd fortify ourfelves 
as well as we could there; for, firft, I confidered 
that the trees' would in a great meafure cover us froni 
their arrows ; and in the next place, they could not 
A a 4 come 



360 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

come to charge us in a body : it was, indeed, my 
old Poriuguefe pilot who propofed it ; and who had 
this excellency attending him, namely, that he was 
always readieft and moft apt to direfl; and encourage 
us in cafes of the moft danger. We advanced im- 
mediately with what fpeed we could, and gained 
that little wood, the Tartars^ or thieves, for we 
knew not what to call them, keeping their ftand, 
and not attempting to hinder us. When we came 
thither, we found, to our great fatisfafliion, that it 
was a fwampy, fpringy piece of ground, and, on 
the other fide, a great fpring of water, which, 
running out in a little rill or brook, was a little far- 
ther joined by another of the like bignefs ; and was, 
in fhort, the head, or fource of a confiderable river, 
called afterwards the Wirtjka. The trees which grew 
jibout this fpring, were not in all above two hundred, 
but were very large, and ftood pretty thick ; fo that 
as foon as we got in, we faw ourfelves perfectly fafe 
from the enemy, unlefs they alighted and attacked 
us on foot. 

But to make t*his more difficult, our Portuguefey 
w!th indefatigable applicatign, cut dow great arms 
of the trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite 
off, from one tree to another j fo that he made a con^ 
tinued fence almoft round us. 

We ftaid here, waiting the motion of the enemy 
fome hours, without perceiving they made any offer 
tQ ftir ; when about two hours before night, they 
came down direftly upon us ; and, though we had 
not perceived it, we found they had been joined by 
fome more of the fame, fo that they were near four- 

' fcor« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 361 

fcore horfe, whereof, however, we fancied fome were 
women. They came in till they. >vere within half a 
fliot of our little wood, when we fired one mufquet 
without ball, and called to them in the Ruffian tongue, 
to know what they wanted, and bid them keep off; 
but, as if they knew nothing of whatwefaid, they 
came on with a double fury direftly up to the wood- 
fide, not imagining we were fo barricaded, that they 
could not break in : our old pilot wa^ our captain, 
as well as he had been our engineer ; and defired 
of us, not to fire upon them till they came within 
piftolfhot, that we might be fure to kill j and that 
when we did fire, we fhould be fure to take good 
aim. We bade him give the word of command j 
which he delayed fo long, that they were, fome of 
them, within two pikes length of us when we iired. 

We aimed fo true (or Providence direfted our 
fhot fo fure) that we killed fourteen of them at the 
firft volley, and wounded feveral others, as alfo 
feveral of their horfes ; for we had all of us ioaded our 
pieces with two or three bullets a piece, at leaft. 

'They were terribly furprifed with our fire, and 
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from 
us ; in which time we loaded our pieces again, and, 
feeing them keep that diftance, we fallied out, and 
caught four or five of their horfes, whofe riders, 
we fuppofed, were killed ; and coming up to the 
dead, we could eafily perceive they uere Tartars^ 
but knew not from what country, or how they came 
to make an excurfion fuch an unufual length. 

About an hour after, they made a motion to at- 
tack us again, and rode round our little wood, to 
fee where elfe they might break in j but finding us 

always 



362 V MFE AND ADV£NTyR|;S 

always ready to face them, they went off again, 
and we refolved not to ftir from the place for that 
night. 

We flept a little, you may be fure ; but fpent the 
mod part of the night in ftrengthening our fituation, 
and barricading the entrances into the wood ; and, 
keeping a ftriiSt watch, we waited for day-light, and, 
vhen it came, it gave us a very unwelcome difco- 
¥ery indeed : for the enemy, who we thought were 
difcouraged with the reception they had met with, 
were now increafed to no lefs than three hundred, 
and had fet up eleven or twelve huts and tents, as 
if they were refolved to befiege us ; and this little 
camp they had pitched, was upon the open plain, at 
about three quarters of a mile from us. We were in- 
deed furprized at this difcovery ; and now, I confefs, I 
gave myfelf over for loft, and all that I had. The 
lofs of my effedts did not lie fo near me (though 
ihey were very confiderable) as the thoughts of 
falling into the hands of fuch barbarians, at the 
lattd- end of my journey, after fo many difficulties 
and hazards as I had gone through ; and even in 
fight of our port, where we expefted fafety and de- 
liverance. As for my partner, he was raging: he 
declaredj that to lofe his goods would be his ruin ; 
and he would rather die than be ftarved j and he 
was for fighting to the laft drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever |lefh fhewed 
itfelf, was for fighting to the laft alfo ; and my old 
pilot was of the opinion wl were able to refift them 
all, in the fituation we then were in : and thus we 
fpent the day in debates of what we fliould do ; 
but towards evening, we found that the number of 

our 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 363 

our enemies f^iU increafed : perhaps, as they were 
abroad in feveral parties for prey, the firft had fent 
out fcouts to call for help, and to acquaint them of 
their booty ; and we did not know but by the morn- 
ing they might ftill be a greater number ; fo I 
began to enquire of thofe people we had brought 
from Tobol^i J if there was no other, or more pri- 
vate ways, by whitrh we might avoid them in the 
night,- and perhaps, either retreat to fome town, or 
get help to guard us over the defart. 

The Siberian^ who was fervant to the young lord, 
old us, if we defigned to avoid them, and not fight, 
•he would engage to carry us off in the night to a 
way that went north towards the yiwqt Petraz, by 
which he made no doubt but we might get away, 
and the Tartars never the wifer ;. but he faid, his lord 
had tcld him he would not return, but would rather 
chufe to fight. I told him, he miftook his lord ; 
for that he was too wife a man to love fighting for 
the fake of it ; that I knew his lord was brave enough 
by what he had fhewed already ; but that his lord 
knew better thaiii to defire to have feventeen or 
eighteen men fight five hundred, unlefs an unavoida- 
ble neceffity forced them to it ; and that if he thought 
it poffible for us to efcape in the night, we had no- 
thing elfe to do but to attempt it. He anfwered, if 
his lord gave him fuch order, he would lofe his life 
if he did not perform it. We foon brought his lord 
to give that order, though privately, arid we imme- 
diately prepared for the putting it in praftice. 

And firft, as foon as it began to be dark, we 
Jiindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept 

burning. 



3^4 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

burning, and prepared fo as to r^i^^e It burn all 
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were ftill 
there j but, as foon as it was dark, that is to fay, 
fo as we could fee the ftars, (for our guide would 
not ftir before) having all our horfes and camels 
ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who, I 
foon found, fleered himfelf by the pole, or north 
ftar, all the country being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter ftill ; not that it was quite dark 
all night, but the moon began to rife, fo that, in 
fhort, it was rather lighter than we wifhed it to be ; 
but by fix o'clock next morning, we were gotten 
near forty miles, though the truth is, we almoft 
fpoiled our horfes. Here we found a Ruffian village, 
named Kirmazinjkoy^ where we refted, and heaid 
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that day. About 
two hours before night we fet out again, and tra- 
velled till eight the next morning, though not quite 
fo haftily as before ; and about feven o*clock we 
pafled a little river, called Kirtza^ and came to a good 
large town inhabited by RiiJJiansy and very popu- 
lous, called Ozofnys : There we heard, that feveral 
troops, or herds of Calmucks had been abroad upon 
the defart, but that we were now completely out of 
danger of them, which was to our great fatisfaffion, 
you may be fure. Here we were obliged to get fome 
frefh horfes, and having need enough^ of reft, we 
ftaid five days ; and my partner and I agreed to give 
the honeft Siberian^ who brought us hither, the va- 
lue of ten piftoles for his conducing us. 

In five days more we came to Vettffima^ upon the 
river Witzo^da^ which running into the river Dwma^ 

we 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^8$ 

we were there very happily near the end of our tra- 
vels by land, that river being navigable in feven 
days paflage to Arch- Angel : from hence we came to 
Lawrenjkoy^ where the river joins, the third of y«/)^ ; 
and provided ourfelves with two luggage-boats, and 
a barge, for our convenience. We embarked the fe- 
' venth, and arrived all fafe at Arch- Angel the eigh- 
teenth, having been a year, five months, and three 
days on the journey, including our ftay of eight 
months and odd days at Toboljki. 

We were obliged to ftay at this place fix weeks for 
the arrival of the fhips, and muft have tarried longer, 
had not a Hambiirgher come in above a month fooner 
than any of the Englijh Ihips ; when, after fome con- 
fideration, that the city of Hamburgh might happen 
to be as good a market for our goods as London^ wc 
all took freight with him ; and having put our goods 
on board, it was moft natural for me to put my 
fteward on board to take care of them ; by which 
means my young lord had a fufficient opportunity to 
conceal himfelf, never coming on fhore again iii 
all the time we ftaid there ; and this he did, that he 
might not be feen in the city, where fome of the 
Mo/cow merchants would certainly have feen and 
difcovered him. 

We failed from Arch- Angel the twentieth of Au- 
gujl the fame year ; and, after no extraordinary bad 
voyage, arrived in the Elbe the thirteenth of Sep^ 
tember : here my partner and I found a very good 
fale for our goods, as well thofe of China^zs the 
fables, &c. of Siberia ; and dividing the produce of 
our effefts, my (hare amounted to 3475I* 17s. 3d. 
notwithftanding fo many lolTes we had fuftained, and 
3 charges 



366 LIFE AND ADVENTURE?, &C* 

charges we had been at ; only remembering that I 
had included, in this, about 600I. worth of diamonds, 
which I had purchafed at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe^ in order to go to the court of 
Vienna^ where he refolved to feek protedlion, and 
where he could correfpond with thofe of his father's 
friends who were left alive. He did not part with- 
out all the teftimonies he could give, of grati- 
tude for the fervice I had done him, and his fenfe 
of my kindnefs to the prince his father." 

To conclude : having ftaid near four months in 
Hamburgh^ I came from thence over land to the 
Hague J where I embarked in the packet, and arrived 
in London the 10th of January ^ 1705, having been 
gone from England ten years and nine months. 

And here, refolving to harrafs myfelf no more, I 
am preparing for a longer journey than all thefe, hav- 
ing livied feventy-two years a life of infinite variety, 
and learned fufEciently to know the value of re- 
tirement, and the bleffing of ending our days in

TT is lamented by thofe who labour the fields of 
A Britilh biography, that after being entangled in 
briars they are often rewarded with the fcanty pro- 
dudts of barrennefs. The lives of literary men are 
generally paffed in the obfcurities of the clofet,

fices of ftudy, whereby each may have rifen to emi- 
nence. And during the fame moment that the dili-

Thefe reflexions naturally arofe from my inquiries 
about the life of the Author of The History of

Swift, he had perhaps reafons for concealing what 
would have added little to his confequence. It is 
at length known, with fufEcient certainty, that our 
author was the fon of James Foe, of the parifhof 
St. Giles's, Cripplegate, London, Citizen and But^ 
cher. The concluding fentiment of The True-horn 
Englijhman^ we now fee, was then as natural as it 
will ever be juft ; 

Then, let us boaft of anceftors no more, 
For, fame of families is all a cheat; 
^Tis perfonal virtue only makes us great. 

If we may credit the Gazette, Daniel Foe, or De 
Foe, a$ he is faid by his enemies to have called 
hinifelf, that he might not be thought an Englifli-' 
man, was born in London*, about the year 1663. 
His family were probably Diffenters f , among whom

who was himfelfthe fon of Daniel Foe, of Elton, in the county 
of Northampton, Yeoman ; and who obtained his Freedom by 
ferving his apprentice fhip with John Levit, Citizen and Butcher, 
Daniel Foe, the fon of James, was admitted to his Freedom by birthy 
on the 26th of January, 1687-8. I was led to thefe difcoverics 
by obferving that De Foe had voted at an eleftion for a Repre- 
fentative of London ; whence I inferred, that he muft have been 
a citizen either by birth or fervlce. But in the parifh T)ooks I 
could find no notice of his baptifm ; as his parents were Dif- 
fenters^ 

f In his Preface to « Mare Reformattoriy^' De Fo^ complains. 
That feme Diffenters had reproached him, as if he had faijd,

ing tp the conventicle ; forgetting, that I mufl defign to have my

he received no unlettered education ; at leaft it is 
plain, from his Various writings, that he was 9, 
zealous defender of their principles, and a ftrenuous 
fupporter of their politics, before the liberality of 
our rulers in church and ftate had freed this condudt 
from danger. - He merits the praife which is due 
to fincerity in manner of thinking, and to unifor- 
mity in habits of afting, whatever obloquy may have 
been caft on his name, by attributing writings to 
him, which, as they belonged to others, he was 
ftudious to difavow. 

Our Author was educated at a diflenting academy, 
which was kept at Newington- Green by Charles 
Morton. He delights to praife " that learned gen- 
tleman*,*' whofe inftruftive leffons he probably en- 
joyed from 1675 ^^ 1680, as a mafter, who taught 
nothing either in politics, or fcience, which was 
dangerous to monarchial government, or which 
was improper for a diligent fcholar to know. 
Being in 1705 accufed by Tutchin of illiterature, 
De Foe archly acknowledged, " I owe this juftice 
to my ancient father, who is yet living, and in 
whofe behalf I freely teftify, that if I am a blockhead, 
it was nobody's fault but my own; he having 
fpared nothing that might qualify me to match 
the accurate Dr. B — — or the moft learned 
Tutchinf/'

374 THE LIPE OF DE FOf, 

De Foe was born a writer, as other men are boni 
generals and ftatefmen: and when he was not twenty- 
one, he publiflied, in 1683, a pamphlet againft a 
very prevailing fentiment in favour of the Turks, as 
oppofed to the Auftrians ; very juftly thinking, as 
he avows in his riper age, that it was better the 
Popifli Houfe of Auftria fhould ruin the Proteftants 
in Hungary, than the infidel Houfe of Ottoman 
Ihould ruin both Proteftants and Papifts, by over- 
running Germany *. De Foe was a man who would 
fight as well as write for his principles : and before 
he was three-and-twenty he appeared in arms for 
the Duke of Monmouth, in June 1685. Of this 
exploit he boaftsf in his latter years, when it 
was no longer dangerous to avow his participation 
in that imprudent enterprife, with greater men of 
fimilar principles. 

Having efcaped from the dangers of battle, and 
from the fangs of Jefferys, De Foe found complete 
fecurity in the more gainful purfuits of peace. Yet, 
he was prompted by his zeal to mingle in the con- 
troverfies of the reign of James 2d, whom he efE- 
cacioufly oppofed, by warning the DifTenters of the 
fecret danger of the infidious tolerance, which was 
offered by the monarch's bigotry, or by the minif- 
ter's artifice. When our Auth3or calle£ted his writ- 
ings, he did not think proper to republifli either his 
trad againft the Turks, or his pamphlet againft the 
King. 

De Foe was admitted a Liveryman of London 
on the 26th of January, 1687 — 8j when, being al- 
lowed his freedom by birth, he was received a mem-

ber of that eminent corporation. As he had en- 
deavoured to promote the revolution by his pen and 
his fword, he had the fatisfaftion of partaking, 
ere long, in the pleafures and advantages of that great 
event. During the hilarity of that moment, the Lord 
Mayor of London aflked King William to partake of 
the cityfeaft on the 29th of Odkober, 1689. Every 
honour was paid the Sovereign of the people's choice. 
A regiment of volunteers, compofed of the chief 
citizens, and commanded by the celebrated Earl of 
Peterborough, attended the King and Queen from 
Whitehall to the Manfion Houfe. Among thefe 
troopers, gallantly mounted, and richly accoutred, 
was Daniel De Foe, if we may believe Oldmixon *• 
While our author thus difplayed his zeal, and 
courted notice, he is faid to have afted as a hofier 
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill : but the hofier f and 
the poet are very irreconcileable charaSers. With 
the ufual imprudence of fuperior genius, he was 
carried by his vivacity into companies who were 
gratified by his wit. He fpent thofe hours with a 
fmall fociety for the cultivation of polite learning, 
which he ought to have employed in the calculations 
of the counting-houfe: and being obliged toabfcond 
from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attri-

t Being reproached by Tutchin in his Ohfervator with having 
been bred an apprentice to a hofier, De Foe aflerts, in May 1705, 
that he never was a hofier^ or an apprentice,, but admits that he 
had been a Trader. [Review, vol. ii. p. 149.] Oldmixon, who 
never fpeaks favourably of De Foe, allows that he had never been 
a merchant otherwife than peddling a little to Portugal. Hift.

buted thofc misfortunes to the war, which were pro- 
bably owing to his own mifcondud. An angry 
creditor took out a commiffion of bankrirptcy, 
which was foon fuperfeded on thepetition of thofc 
to whom he was moft indebted, who accepted a 
compofition on his iingle bond. This he punSu- 
ally paid by the efforts of unwearied diligence. 
But fome of thofe* creditors, who had been thus 
fatisfied, falling afterwards into diftrefs themfelves, 
De Foe voiuntarily paid them their whole claims j 
being then in rifing circumftances from King Wil- 
liam*s favour *. This is fuch an example of ho- 
nefty, as it would be unjuft to De Foe and to the 
world to conceal. Being reproached in 1 705 by 
Lord Haverfham with mercenarinefs, our author 
feelingly mentions ; " How, with a numerous fa- 
mily, and no helps but his own induftry, he had 
forced his way with undifcouraged diligence, through 
a fea^ of misfortunes, and reduced his debts, ex- 
clufive of compofition, from feventeen thoufand to 
lefs than five thoufand pounds f .*' He continued 
to carry on the pan-tile works near Tilbury-fort ; 
though probably with no great fuccefs. It was af- 
terwards farcaftically faid, that he did not^ like the 
Egyptians^ require bricks without Jiraw^ but, like the 
Jewsy required bricks ^without paying his labourers. 
He was born for other enterprifes, which, if they 
did not gain him opulence, have conferred a renown, 
that will defcend the ftream of time with the lan- 
guage wherein his works are written. 

While he was yet under thirty, and had mortified 
no great man by his fatire, or offended any party

by his pamphlets, he had acquired friends by his 
powers of pleafing, who did not, with the ufual in- 
ftability of friendfliips, defert him amidft his diftref- 
fes. They offered to fettle him as a fador at Cadiz, 
where, as a trader, he had fome previous correfpond- 
ence. In this fituation he might have procured bu- 
finefs by his care, and accumulated wealth without 
a rifque : but, as he affures us in his old age. Pro- 
vidence^ which had other work for him to do^ placed 
afecret averjion in his mind to quitting England. He 
had confidence enough in his own talents to think, 
that on this field he could gather laurels, or at leall 
gain a livelihood. 

In a projeding age^ as our Author denominates 
King William's reign, he was himfelf a projedor^ 
While he was yet young, De Foe was prompted by 
a vigorous mind to think of many fchemes, and to 
offer, what was mod pleafing to the ruling powers, 
ways and means for carrying on the war. He wrote, 
as he fays, many Jheets about the coin ; he propofed 
a regifl:er for feamen, long before the a£l of Par Ha" 
ment was thought of; he projected county banks aQd 
factories for goods ; he mentioned 2. propofal for a 
commiffion of inquiries into bankrupt* s ejiaies ; he con- 
trived a penfton-office for the relief of the poor. At 
length, in January 1696 — 7, he publiflied his PJfay 
upon Projedls ; which he dedicated to Dalby Tho- 
mas, not as a Commiffioner of glafs duties, under 
whom he then ferved, or as a friend, to whom he 
acknowledges obligations ; but as to the moft pro- 
per judge on the fubjeft. It is always curious to 
trace a thought, in order to fee where* it firft origi- 
nated, or how it was afterwards expanded. Among 
other projeds, which Ihew a wide range of know- 
ledge.

ledge, he fuggefts to King William the imitation of 
Lewis 14th, in the eftabiifliment of a fociety ^^ for 
encouraging polite learning, for refining the Eng- 
lifli language, and for preventing barbarifms of 
manners.*' Prior oflfered in 1700 the fame projed 
to King William, in his Carmen Secvlare ; Swift 
mentioned in 17 10 to Lord Oxford a propofal/or 
improving the Englijh tongue ; and Tickell flatters 
himfelf in his Profped of Peace y that our daring law 
guage-^Jhall /port no more in arbitrary found. How- 
ever his projects were taken, certain it is, that when 
De Foe ceafed to be a trader^ he was, by the inter- 
pofition of Dalby Thomas probably, appointed in 
1695, accomptant to the Commiffioners for manag- 
ing the duties on glafs ; who, with our Author 
ceafed to aft, on the firft of Auguft, 1 699, when 
the tax was fupprefTed by aft of Parliament *. 

From projects of ways and means^ De Foe*s ar- 
dour foon carried him into the thorny paths of fa- 
tiric poetry; and his mufe produced, in January 
1 700 — I , The True-bom Englijhman. Of the origin 
of this fatire, which was the caufe of much good for- 
tune, but of fome difafters, he gives himfelf the fol- 
lowing account:- — " During this time came out 
an abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verfe, written 
by one Mr. Tutchin, and called The Foreigners : in 
which the Author, who he was I then knew not, 
fell perfonally upon the King, then upon the Dutch 
nation, and, after having reproached his Majefty 
with crimes that his worft enemies could not think 
of without horror, he fums up all in the odious 
name of Foreigner. This filled me with a kind 
of rage againft the book, and gave birth to a trifle, 

* lo-ii Win.III. ch. 18. 

which 



CHARLES 2d— ^GEORGE 2d. 379 

v^hich I never could hope fhould have met with fo 
general an acceptation." The fale was prodigious, 
and probably unexampled; as Sacheverel's trial had 
not then appeared. The True-born Englijhman was 
anfwered, paragraph by paragraph, in February 
1700 — I, by a writer, who brings hafte to apo- 
logize for dulnefs. For this Defence of King 
William and the Dutch, which was doubtlefs circu- 
lated by detradion and by power, De Foe was 
amply rewarded. " How this poem was the occa- 
fion,** fays he, " of my being known to his Ma- 
jefty; how I was afterwards received by him; how 
employed abroad; and how, above my capacity of 
deferving, rewarded, is no part of the prefent cafe/' 
Of the particulars, which the Author thus declined 
to tell, nothing now can be told. It is only certain, 
that he was admitted to perfonal interviews with the 
King, who was no reader of poetry ; and that for 
the Royal favours De Foe was always grateful. 

When *' the pen and ink war was raifed againft 
a (landing army,*' fubfequent to the peace of Ryf- 
wick, our Author publiflied An Argument, to 
prove that a {landing army, with confent of Parlia- 
ment, is not iuconfiftent with a free government. 
*' Liberty and property," fays he, " are the glo- 
rious attributes of the Englifh nation; and the 
dearisr they are to us, the lefs danger we are in of 
lofmg them : but I could never yet fee it proved, 
that the danger of lofmg them by a fmall army was 
fuch, as we fhould expofe ourfelves to all the world 
for it. It is not the King of England alone, but 
the fword of England in the hand of the King, that 
gives laws of peace and war now to Europe : and

his hand in time of peace, bid the faired of all men

lirous of reading this treatife on an interefting topic, 
will meet with ftrength of argument, conveyed in 
elegant language. 

When the nation flamed with faftion, the Grand 
. Jury of ^ent prefented to the Commons, on the 8th 
of May 1701, a petition, which defired them—- 
*^ to mind the public bufmefs more, and their pri- 
vate heats lefs ;'* and which contained a fentiment, 
that there was a defign, as Burnet tells, other coun- 
ties and the city of London fliould equally adopts 
Meffrs, Culpeppers, Polhill, Hamilton, and Champ- 
neys, who avowed this intrepid paper, were com- 
mitted to the Gatehoufe, amid the applaufes of their 
countrymen. It was on this occafion that De 
Foe's genius diftated a Remonft ranee, vvhich was 
ligned Legion^ and which has been recorded in hif- 
tory for its bold truths and feditious petulance. De 
Foe's zeal induced him to affume a woman's drefs, 
while he delivered this faftious paper to Harley^ 
the Speaker, as he entered the Houfe of Commons*. 
It was then alfo that our Author, who was tranfported 
by an equal attachment to the country and the 

* Mr. Polhill, of Cheapftead-place, in Kent, whofe father, 
Mr. David Polhill, was committed to the Gatehoufe, and thereby 
gained great popularity, was fo good as communicate to me 
the curious anecdote of De Foe's dreffing himfelf in women's 
clothe?, and prefenting the Legion Paper to the Speaker. De 
Foe fays himfelf in his Original Power of the People^ p. 24:

of the Legion Paper ; the contents 6f which had fo much plain 
truth of fa6l ; and which I could give a better hiflory 0/*, if it were

court, publlflied The Original Power of the colledive 
Body of the People of England^ examined and ajferted. 
This timeful treatife he dedicated to King William, 
in a dignified ftrain of nervous eloquence. " It is 
not the leaft of the extraordinaries of your Majefty's 
charafker/' fays he, " that, as you are King of 
your people, fo you are the people's King ; a title, 
which, as it is the mod glorious, fo it is the moft 
indifputable/* To the Lords and Commons he ad- 
drefles himfelf in a fimilar tone : The vindication of 
the original right of all men to the government of 
themfelves, he tells them, is fo far from being a de- 
rogation from, that it is a confirmation of their legal 
authority. Every lover of liberty muft be pleafed 
with the perufal of a treatife, which vies with Mr. 
Locke's famous trad in powers of reafoning, and is 
fuperior to it in the graces of ftyle. 

At a time when ^' union and charity, the one 
relating to our civil, and the other to our religious 
concerns, were ftrangers in the land," De Foe pub- 
lifhed The Freeholder's Plea againjl Stockjobbing Elec* 
iions of Parliament Men^ " It is very rational to 
fuppofe,^' fays our Author, " that they who will buy 
will fell ; or, what feems more rational, they who 
have bought muflfelW This is certainly aperfuafive 
performance, though we may fuppofe, that many 
voters ^ere influenced then by arguments ftill 
more perfuafiye. And he concludes with afentiment,* 
which has not been too often repeated. That nothing 
can make us formidable to our neighbours, and 
maintain the reputation of our nation, but union 
among ourfelves. 

How much foever King William may have been 
pleafed with Ths %rue'born Englijfiman^ or with 

other 



382 THE LIFE OF DI FQEr 

Other ferviccs, he was little gratified probably by our 
Author's Reafons againji a War with France. This 
argument, Jhewing that the French King's owning the 
Prince of Wales as King of England^ is no fufficient 
ground of a War^ is one of the fineft, becaufe it is 
one of the moft ufeful, tradts in the Englilh lan- 
guage. After remarking the univerfal cry of the peo-^ 
fie for warj our Author declares he is not againft 
war with France, provided it be on juftifiable 
grounds ; but, he hopes, England will never be fo 
inconfiderable a nation, as to njiake ufe of difhoneft 
pretences to bring to pafs any of her defigns : and 
he wilhes that he who defires we fhould end the 
war honourably^ ought to defire alfo, that we begin it 
fairly. ** But if we muft have a war,*' our Author 
hoped, " it might be wholly on the defenfive in 
Flanders, in order to carry on hoftilities in remote 
places, where the damage may be greater, by wound- 
ing the Spaniard in fome weaker part ; fo as upon a 
peace he fhall be glad to quit Flanders for an equi- 
valent." Who at prefent does not wifh that Dc 
Fpe's argument had been more ftudioufly read, and 
more efficacioufly admitted ? 

A fcene of forrow foon after opened, which pro- 
bably embittered our Author's future life. The 
death of King William deprived him of a proteftor, 
who, he fays, trufted, efteemed, and much more 
valued him than he deferved ; and who, as he flattered 
himfelf amidft his later diftrefles, would never have 
fuffered him to be treated as he had been in the 
world. Of that monarch's memory, he fays, that 
he never patiently heard it abufed, nor ever could 
do fo : and in this gratitude to a Royal benefaftor 
there is furely much to praife, but nothing to blame.

In the midft of that furious conteft of party, civil 
aad religious, which enfued on the acceffion of 
Queen Anne, our Author was no unconcerned 
fpeSaton He reprinted his Enquiry into the Occa^ 
Jional Conformity of Dijfenters^ which had been pub- 
Kfhed in 1697, ^^^^ ^ dedication to Sir Humphrey- 
Edwin, a Lord Mayor, who having carried the 
Tegalia to a conventicle, gave rife to fome wit in 
The Tale of a Tub^ and occafioned fome claufes in 
an zSi of Parliament. De Foe now dedicated his 
Enquiry to John How, a diffenting minifter, of whom 
Anthony Wood fpeaks well. Mr. How did not 
much care, fays Calamy *, to enter upon an argu- 
ment of that nature with one of fo warm a temper as 
the author of that Enquiry^ and contented himfelf 
with publifliing fome Cotifiderations on the Preface of 
an Enquiry concerning the -vccafional Conformity of 
Diffenters. De Foe's pertinacity foon produced a 
reply. He out-laughs and out-talks Mr. How, who 
had provoked his antagonift's wrath by perfonal far- 
cafms, and who now thought it hard that the old 
fliould be fhoved off the ftage by the young. De 
Foe reprobates, with the unforbearance of the 
times, " this faft and loofe game of religion ;'* for 
which he had never met with any confiderable ex- 
cufe but this, '* that this is no conformity in point 
of religion, but done as a civil adkion." He foon 
after publifhed another Enquiry^ in order to fhew, 
that the Diffenters are no ways concerned in occaftonal 
conformity. The controverfy, which in thofe days 
occafioned fuch vehement contefts between the two 
Houfes of Parliament, is probably filenced for ever.

hepubliflied towards the end of the year 1702 ; and 
which is a piece of exquifite irony, though there 
are certainly paflages in it that might have fliewn

Jhould not have been perceived by all the town^ and that 
not one man can fee it^ either churchman or dijjenter. 
This is one of the ftrongeft proofs, how much the 
minds of men were inflamed againft each other,

The firfl: intent of laws 
Was to corred the effeft, and check the caufe. 

And all the ends of punifhment 
Were only future mifchiefs to prevent : 

But juftice is inverted, when 
Thofe engines of the law,

Keep honed ones in awe. 

He employed this involuntary leifure in coff efting 
for the prefs a collection of his writings, which, 
nvith feveral things he had no hand in, had been al- 
ready publiflied by a piratical printer. He thought 
it a moft unaccountable boldnefs in him to print 
that particular book called Ths Shorteji Way with the 
Dijfentcrs^ while he lay under the public refentment 
for the fame faft. In this coUeftion of 1703, there 
are one-and-twenty treatifes in poetry and profe, 
beginning with The True-born Englijhman^ and end- 
ing with The Shorteji Way to Peace and Union* To 
this volume there was prefixed the firft print of De 
FoQ ; to which was afterwards added, the apt in- 
fcription: Laudatur et a/get. 

In the folitarinefs of a goal, the energy of De Foe 
projeded 27?^ Review. This is a periodical paper 
in quarto, which was firft publifhed on the 19th of 
February,, 1703—4; and which was intended to 
treat of news, foreign and domeftic ; of politics, 
Britifh and European ; of trade, particular and uni- 
verfal. But our Author forefaw, from the natural 
averjion of the age to any tedious affair^ that however 
profitable, the world would never read, if it' were 
not diverting. With this defign, both inftruftive 
and amufing, he IkilfuUy inftitutes a Scandal Club,

which difcuffes queftions in divinity, morals, war, 
trade, languagCj poetry, love, marriage, drunken- 
nefs, and gaming. Thus, it is eafy to fee, that 
Tbe Review pointed the way to the Tatlers, Spec- 
tators, and Guardians, which may be allowed how- 
ever to have treated thofe interefting topics with 
more delicacy of humour, more terfenefs of ftyle, 
and greater depth of learning : yet, has De Foe 
many paffages, both of profe and poetry, which, for 
refinement of wit, neatnefs of expreffion, and effi- 
cacy of moral, would do honour to Steele or to 
Addifon. Of all this was Johnfon unconfcious, whefi 
he fpeaks of the Tatlers and Speftators as the firft 
Englifh writers who had undertaken to reform either 
the favagenefs of negleft, or the impertinence of 
civility ; to fhew when to fpeak, or to be filent j how 
to refufe, or how to comply. i 

In the midfl of thefe labours ouf Aiithor publifh- 
cd, in July 1704, The Storm ; or, a colledlion of 
the moft remarkable cafualties, which happened in 
the tempeft, on the 23d of November, 1703. In 
explaining the natural caiifes of winds De Foe fhews 
more faience, and in delivering the opinions of the an^ 
dents that this ifland was more fuhjeB to fiorms than 
other parts of the worlds he difplays more literature, 
than he has been generally fuppofed to poflefs. 
Our Author is nwreover entitled to yet higher 
praife. He feized that awful occafion to inculcate 
the fundamental truths of religion ; the being of a 
God, the fuperintendency of Providence, the cer- 
tainty of heaven and hell, the one to reward, the 
other to punifh. 

While, as he tells himfelf, he lay friendlefs 
ia the prifon of Newgate, his family ruined, and

himfelf without hopes of deliverance, a meflage was 
brought him from a perfon of honour, whom till 
that time he had not the leaft knowledge of. This 
was no lefs a perfon than Sir Robert Harley, the 
Speaker of the Houfe of Commons. Harley ap- 
proved probably of the principles and condufl: of 
De Foe, and doubtlefs forefaw, that, during a fac** 
tious age, fuch a genius could be converted to many 
ufes. And he fent a verbal meffage to the prifoner, 
defiring to knozu what he could do for him. Our Au- 
thor readily wrote the ftory of the blind man in the 
Gofpel; concluding— L^r^, that I may receive my 
fight. 

When the high-flyers were driven from the ftation 
which enabled them to inflame rather than conciliate, 
Harley became Secretary of State, in April 1704. 
He had now frequent opportunities of reprefenting 
the unmerited fuflferings of De Foe to the ^een and 
to the Treafurer ; yet, our Author continued four 
months longer in goal. The Queen, however, in- 
quired into his circumfliances; and Lord Godol- 
phin fent, as he thankfully acknowledges, a confi- 
derable fum to his wife, and to him money to pay 
his fine and the expence of his difcharge. Here is 
the foundation, fays he, on which he built his firfl: 
fenfe of duty to the Queen, and the indelible bond of 
gratitude to \\\sfrji benefador. '^ Let any one fay, 
then,*' he aflis, " what I could have done, lefs or 
more than I have done for fuch a Queen and fuch a

in the viciffitude of party, had been pcrfecuted by 
fadion, and overpowered, though not conquered, 
by violence. 

Such was the high interpofition by which De Foe 
was relieved from Newgate, in Auguft 1704. la 
order to avoid the town-talk, he retired immediately 
to St. Edmund's Bury : but his retreat did not pre- 
vent perfecution. Dyer, the news*writer, propa- 
gated that De Foe had fled from juftice. Fox, the 
bookfeller, publifhed that he had deferted his 
fecurity. Stephen, a ftate-meflfenger, every where 
faid, that he had a, warrant for feizing him. 
This I fuppofe was wit, during the witty age of 
Anne. In our duller days of law, fuch out* 
rages would be referred to the judgment of a Jury. 
De Foe informed the Secretary of State where he 
was, and when he would appear ; but he was told 
not to fear, as he had not tranfgrefled. Notwkhftand^^ 
ing this vexation, our Author's mufe produced, on 
the 29th of Auguft 1704, A Hy^nn to Victory ^ whei^ 
the fuccefsful fkill of Marlborough furnifhed our 
poets with many occafions to publifli Gazettes in 
Rhyme^ 

De Foe opened the year 1704 — 5 with his Double 
welcome to the Duke of Marlborough ; difclaiming any 
expeftation of place or penfion. His encomiaftic 
ftrains, I fear, v/ere not heard while he wrote, 
like an honed Englilhman, againfl the continuance 
of the war-^a war indeed of perfonal glory, of na- 
tional celebration, but of fruitlefs cxpence. De 
Foe's aftivity, or hi$ needs, produced in March 
1705, The Confolidator ; or. Memoirs of Sundry

€u ihey rof€y or one of his refources, to Jhoot folly as it 
Jlew. In the lunar language he applies his fatiric 
file to the prominences of every charafter : of the 
poets, from Dryden to Durfy; of the wits, from Ad- 
difon to Prior ; of the metaphyficians, from Mat- 
branche to Hobbs ; of the free-thinkers, from Afgyl 
to the Tale of a Tub- Our author continually com- 
plains of the ill ufage of the world; but with all his 
acutenefs he did not advert, that he who attacks the 
world, will be by the world attacked* He makes the 
lunar politicians debate the policy of Charles XII. in 
purfuing the Saxons and Poles, while the Mufco.. 
vites ravaged bis own people. I doubt whether it 
were on this occafion that the Swedifh Ambaffador 
was fo ill-advifed as to complaLtj againft De Foe, for 
merited ridicule of a futile warfare. They had not 
then difcovered, that the beft defence againft the 
ihaftS'Of fatire is to let them fly. Our Author's fen- 
timent was expanded by Johnfon, in thofe energetic 
lines, which thus conclude the charafter of the 
Swedijh Charles ; 

^' Who left the name, at which the world grew pale, 
^' To point a moral, or adorn a tale.'* 

De Foe was fo little difturbed by the appearance 
of The Moon Calf^ or accurate refleftions on the 
Oonfolidator,that he plunged into a corltroverfy with 
Sir Humphrey Mackworth about his bill/^r employ 
ing the poor. This had been pafled by the Com- 
mons, with great applaufe, but received by the 
jPeers with fuitable caution. De Foe, confidering

ruin the induftrious, and thereby augment the poon 
Sir Humphrey endeavoured to fupport his work* 
houfes, in every parifli, with a parochial capital 
for carrying on parochial manufadure. This drew 
from De Foe his admirable treatife, which he en- 
titled Giving alms no charity. As an Englijb Free- 
holder he claimed it as a right to addrefs his per- 
formance to the Houfe of Commons, having a par* 
ticular interefl in the common good ; but, confider- 
ing the perfons before whom he appeared, he laid 
down his archn^s, and affumed his dignity. He 
maintained, with wonderful knowledge of fad and 
power of argument, the following politions : ift. That 
there is inEnglandmore labour than hands to perform 
it ; and confequently a want of people, not of em- 
ployment:-^— i2dly. No man in England, of found 
limbs ^nd fenfes, can be poor merely for want of 
work: — 3dly,All workhoufes for employing the 
poor, as now they are employed, ferve to the ruin 
of families and the increafe 6f the poor: — 4thly, 
It .is a regulation of the poor that is wanted, not a 
fetting them to work. Longer experience Ihews 
this to be a difficult fubjeft, which increafes in dif- 
ficulty with the effluxion of time. 

De Foe had fcarcely difmiffed Sir Humphrey, 
wher^ he introduced Lord Haverfham, a peer, who 
is famous in our ftory, as a maker and publiflier of 
fpeeches. His Lordfliip publiftied his fpeech on the 
flate of the nation in 1705, which was cried about 
the town with unufual earneftnefs. Our Author's 
prudence induced him to give no anfwer to the 
ipeech ; but a pamphlet, which was hawked about 
the ftreets and fold for a penny, our Author's 
ihrewdnefs confidered as a challenge to every reader.

He laughed and talked fo much, through feveral Re- 
views, about this factious efFufion, as to provoke a 
defence of topics, which his Lordfhip ought neither 
to have printed nor fpoken, De Foe now publifhed 
a Reply to Lord Haverjham's vindication of his Speech. 
During fuch battles the town never fails to cheer the 
fmaller combatant. Our Author, with an allufion 
to the biography of both, fays farcaftically : ''But, 
fate that makes footballs .of men, kicks fome up 
ftairs, and fome down ; fome are advanced withoni 
honour J others fupprejfed without infamy ; fome are 
raifed without merits fome are crujioed without a crime ; 
and no man knows by thie beginning of things, whe- 
ther his courfe fhall iffue in a peerage or a pillory. ^^ 

In the midft of thefe difputes, either grave or lu- 
dicrous, De Foe publifhed. -^^^/V^ to all Parties. He 
ftrenuoufly recommends that moderation ^nd for- 
bearance, which his opponents often remarked he 
was not fo prone to praftice as to preach. While 
he thus gave advice to all parties, he conveyed many 
falutary leflbns to the Diflenters, whom he was 
zealous to defend. In the Review, dated the 25th 
of December 1705, he conjures them for God's 
fake, if not for their own fake, to be content. " Are 
there a few things more you could wifli were done 
for you ? refolve thefe wifhes into two conclufions : 
I ft. Wait till Providence, if it fhall be for your 
good, fhall bring them to pafs; 2dly, Compare the 
prefent with the paft circumftances, and you can- 
not repine without the higheft ingratitude both to 
God and man/* 

De Foe found leifure, notwithftanding all thofe* 
labours, perhaps a necefiity, to publifli in 1 705, A 
SscondVolume of the Writings of the Author of the ^rue*

iom Englijhman. The fame reafons which formerly 
induced him to colled fome loofe pieces^ held good, 
fays he, for proceeding to a fecond volume, '^ that 
if I do not, fomcbody elfe will do it for me/' He 
laments the fcandalous liberty of the prefs; whereby 
piratic printers deprive an author of the native pro- 
duft of his own thought, and the purity of his own 
ftyle. It is faid, though perhaps without authority, 
that the vigorous reraonftrances of De Foe procured 
5r>&^* A61 for the encouragement of learnings by vejiing 
the copies of printed books in the authors or their ajjigns. 
The vanity of an adminiftration, which afFefted 
to patronize the learned, concurring with the mu. 
tual intereft of bookmakers and bookfellers, pro- 
duced this falutary law, that our Author alone had 
called for without fuccefs. De Foe's writings, thus 
collected into volumes, were foon a third time 
printed, with the addition of a key. The fatire be- 
ing now pointed by the fpecification of charafters, 
and obfcurities being illuminated by the annexation 
of circumflances, a numerous clafs of readers were 
induced, by their zeal of party, or delire of fcan^ 
dal, to look for gratification from our Author's 
treatifes. He is ftudious to complain. That his writ^ 
ings had been moji negleded of theniy who at the fame 
time have owned them ufefuL The fecond volume of 
1705, containing eighteen treatifes in profe and 
rhyme, begins with A new Difcovery of an old In- 
trigue^ ^nd ends v,'ith Royal Religion. 

The year 1705 was a year of difquiet to DeFoe, 
jiot fo much from the oppreffions of ftate as from 
the pv^rfecutions of party* When his bufxnefs, of

whatever

whatever nature, led him to Exeter, and other weft- 
ern towns, in Auguft, September, and Oftober, 
J 705, a projeft was formed to fend him as a foldier 
to the army, at a time when footmen were taken 
from the coaches as recruits : but confcious of hi* 
being a Freeholder of England, and a Liveryman of 
London, he knew that fuch charafters could not be 
violated, in this nation, with impunity. When fome 
of the Weftern Juftices, of more zeal of party than 
fenfe of duty, heard from his opponents of De Foe's 
journey, they determined to apprehend him as a 
vagabond : but our Author, who, among other qua- 
lities, had perfonal courage in a high degree, refle5:ed, 
that to face danger is mod effeftually to prevent it. 
In his abfence, real fuits were commenced againft 
him for fiftitious debts : but De Foe advertifed, that 
genuine claims he would fairly fatisfy. If all thefc 
uncommon circumftances had not been publifhed 
in The Review^ we fhould not have feen thiis ftriking 
pifture of favage manners. So much more free are 
we at prefent, that the Editor of a newfpaper, how- 
ever obnoxious to any party, may travel peaceably 
about his affairs over England, without fear of in- 
terruption. Were a Juftice of Peace, from what- 
ever motive, to oflFer him any obflruftion, fuch a 
magiftrate would be overwhelmed by the public in* 
dignation, and puniihed by the higher guardians of 
our quiet and our laws. 

De Foe began the year 1706 with A Hymn i9 
Peace * ; occafioned by the two Houfes of Parlia- 
ment joining in one addrefs to the Queen. On

A few weeks after he gave the world a fecond effay, 
to foften rancour and defeat perverfity. But the

he had often promifed : and his fruitfulnefs produced 
in July 1706, Jure Divino^ a fatire againft tyranny 
and paffive obedience, which had been delayed, for 
fcar^ as he declares, of parliamentary cenfure. Of 
this poem, it cannot be faid, as of Thomfon's L/-

denied^ This fatire, fays the preface, had never 
been publifhed, though fome of it has been a long

ent upon law^ is not only the befl government in the 
world, but alfo the befl for this nation in par- 
ticular, moft fuitable to the genius of the pcoplcy 
and the circumjlances of the whole body. Dryden 
had given an example, a few years before, of ar- 
gumentative poetry in his Hind and Panther;

Church of Rome, Our author now reafoned in

Our author was foon after engaged in more im- 
portant, becaufe much more ufeful, bufmefs. Lord 
Godolphin, who knew how to difcriminate charac*« 
ters, determined to employ him on an errand, 
which, as he fays, was far from being unfit for a 
Sovereign to direft, or an honeft man to perform. 
By his Lordftiip he was carried to the Queen, who 
faid to him, while he kiffed her hand*, that Jhe had 
fuch fatisfa£lion in his former fervices^ that Jloe had 
again appointed him for another affair^ which was 
fomething nice, but the treafurer would tell him the 
reji. In three days he was fent to Scotland. His 
knowledge of commerce and revenue, his powers of 
infmuation, and above all his readinefs of pen, were 
deemed of no fmall utility in promoting the Union. 
He arrived at Edinburgh, in Odober 1706. And 
we fhall find him no inconfiderable aftor in the 
performance of that greateft of all good works. He 
attended the committees of Parliament, for whofe 
ufe he made feveral of the calculations f on the fub- 
jeft of trade and taxes. He complains |, however, 
that when afterwards fome clamour was raifed upon 
the inequality of the proportions, and the contrivers 
began to be blamed, and a little threatened a-la-mobj

was publlfhed by Webfter, and Hodges, and the otfief 
writers in Scotland againft the Union : and he had 
his (hare of danger, fince, as he fays, he was 
watched by the mob ; had his chamber windows 
infulted ; but, by the prudence of his friends, and 
God's providence, he efcaped *. In the midft of 
this great fcene of bufinefs and tumult, he collefted 
the documents, which he afterwards publiflied for 
the inftruftion of pofterity, with regard to one of 
the moft difficult, and, at the fame time, the moft 
fortunate, tranfaftions, in our annals* 

During all thofe labours and rifques, De Foe pub* 
Eflied, in December 1706, Caledonia, a Poem, in 
honour of the Scots nation. This poetic effay, 
which was intended to refcue Scotland from Jlander 
in opinion^ Caledonia herfelf bade him dedicate to 
the Duke of Queenfberry* Belide other benefac- 
tions, the CommifSoner gave the author, whom he 
calls Daniel De Foe, Efquire, an exclufive privilege 
to fell his encomiaftic drains for feven years, with- 
in the country of his celebration. Amidft our 
Author's bufy occupations at. Edinburgh, he was 
anxious to affure the world, that wherever the wri- 
ter may be, the Reviews are written with his own 
hand ; no perfon having, or ever had, any concern 
in writing them, but the known author, D. F. On 
the 1 6th of January, the a£t of Union was pafled 
by the Scots Parliament ; and De Foe returned 
to London, in February 1706-7. While he thus 
a£ted importantly at Edinburgh, he formed con-

of his future correfpondence, and profited from his 
political inter efts *• 

How our Author was rewarded by the minifters who 
derived a benefit from thofe fervices, and from that 
danger, as he does not tell, cannot now be known. 
Before his departure for Scotland, indeed. Lord 
Godolphin, as he acknowledges |, obtained for 
him the continuance of an appointment, which her 
Majefty, by the interpofition of his firft benefactor, 
had beenpleafed to make him, in confideration of a 
former fervice, in a foreign country^ wherein he run 
as much rifque as a grenadier on the counter-fcarp. 
As he was too prudent to difclofe \mfecret fervices^ 
they muft at prefent remain undifcovered. Yet is 
there reafon to think that he had a pen/ton rather 
than an office^ fince his name is not in the red book of

to procure h'un the arrears due to him in the time of thi 
former Minijlry. . This appointment^ whatever it were, 
he is ftudious to tell, he originally owed to 
Harley : he, however, thankfully acljnowledges^ 
that Lord Godolphin continued his favour to him 
after the unhappy breach that feparated his firft be- 
nefador from the Minifter, who continued in pover 
till Auguft 1710. 

The nation, which was filled with combuftible' 
matter, burft into flame the moment of that memo- 
rable feparation, in 17071^ In the midft of thi^ 
conflagration our Author was not inaftive. He 
waited on Harley after he had been driven from 
power, who generoufly advifed him to continue his 
fervices to the ^een^ which hefuppofed would ha've no 
relation to perfonal differences among Jlatefmen. Go- 
dolphin received him with equal kindnefs, by fay- 
ing — / always think a man honeji till I find to the

ticns, in the prefence of thofe who could have con- 
vi£ted him of falfehood, he for three years held n^ 
correfpondence with his principal benefactor ^ which the 
great man never took ill of him. 

As early as February 1706—7, De Foe avowed 
his purpofe to publifhtlieHiftory of the Union, which 
he had ably afliflied to accomplifli. This defign he 
executed in 1709, though he was engaged in other 
lucubrations, and gave the world a Review three 
times a week. His hiftory feems to have been

of public debate and private converfation. The 
fubjed of this work Is the completion of a meafure, 
which was carried into effeft, notwithftanding ob- 
ftruftions ?ipparently infurmountable, and tumults 
approaching to rebellion, and which has produced the 
endsdefigned,beyondexpeftation,whetherweconfider 
its influence on the Government, or its operation on the 
governed. The minutenefs with which he defcribes 
what he faw and heard on the turbulent flage, where he 
afted a confpicuous part, is extremely interefting to 
us, who wifh to know what actually paffed, however 
this circumftantiality may have difgufted contempo- 
raneous readers. Hiftory is chiefly valuable as it 
tranfmits a faithful copy of the manners ^nd^fentiments 
of every age. This narrative of De Foe is a drama, 
in which he introduces the highefl: peers and the 
loweft peafants, fpeaking and acting, according as 
they were each aduated by their charaderifticpaflions; 
and while the man of tafl:e is amufed by his manner ^ 
the man of bufinefs may draw infl:rudion from the 
documents J which are appended to the end, and in- 
terfperfed in every page. This publication had alone 
preferved his name, had his Crufoe pleafed us lefs. 

De Foe publiftied in 1709, what indeed required 
lefs effort of the intelleO: or the hand. The Hijiory of 
Addrejfes ; with no defign, he fays, and as we may 
believe, to dift:urb the public peace, but to com- 
pare the prefent tempers of men with the pafl:, in 
order to difcover who had altered for the better, and 
who for the worfe. He gave a fecond volume of Ad- 
dreflTes in 171 1, with remarks ferious and comical. 
His purpofe plainly was to abate, by ridicule, the 
public fervour with regard to Sacheverel, who, by 

Vol. II. Dd I know 



402 THE LIFE a? I^E FOB* 

I know not what fatality, or folly, gave rife to 
eventful changes. De Foe evinces, by thefe timeful 
publications, that amidfl all that enthufiafm and 
tumult, he preferved his fenfes, and adhered to his 
principles. 

When, by fuch imprudence as the world had nevet 
feen before, Godolphin was in his turn expelled, in 
Auguft 1 7 1 o, our Author waited on the ex-minifter ; 
who obligingly faid to him. That he had the fame 
good'%villj but not the fame power to afftfl him :■ and 
Godolphin told him, what was of more real ufe— 
to receive the ^een^s commands from her confidential 
fervants^ when hefaw things fettled. It naturally oc- 
curred to De Foe, that it was his duty to go along 
with the Minifters, while, as he fays, they did not 
break in on the conftitution. And who can blame 
a very fubordfnate officer, (if indeed he held an 
office), who had a wife and fix children to maintain 
with very precarious means ? He was thus, fays he, 
cafl back providentially on his firfl benefaCtor, who 
laid his cafe before her Majefty, whereby he preferved 
his intereft, without any engagement. On that me- 
morable change De Foe however fomewhat changed 
his tone. Themethod I fhall take, fayshe*, in talking 
of the public affairs, fhall for the future be, though 
with the fame defign to fupport truth, yet with more 
caution of embroiling myfelf with a party, who have 
no mercy, and who have no fenfeof fervice. 

De Foe now lived at Newington, in comfortable 
circumflances, publifhing The Reviews^ and fend- 
ing out fuch tradts, as either gratified his prejudices, 
or fupplied- his needs. During that contentious pe-

While thus occupied, De Foe was not forgotten

ciple. I pleafe my f elf with being the firft propofer of fo fair a 
treaty with you, becaufe I believe, as you cannot deny its being

I believe could convince you of my having been the firft and moft 
Ill-treated— for further proof of which I refer you to your letteni,

However, Mr# Dyer, this is a method which may end what is

I am fure cannot lye at my door. 

As to your letter, your propofal is fo agreeable to me, that

much to think of, and much to do at a diftance: 
and he foon after gave fome fupport to Lord Ox- 
ford's South-fea projeft, by publifhing An EJfay on 
the South-fea Trade^ with an inquiry into the reafons 
of the prefent complaint againft the fettlement of the 
South-fea Company. In the fame year he publifhed 
An EJfay at a plain Expojition of that difficult phrafi 
— A GOOD PEACE. He obvioufly intended to abate 
the national ardour for war, and to incite a national 
defire of quiet. 

The Minifters, by the courfe of events, were en-* 
gaged ere long in one of the hardeft talks which 
can be affigned to Britifh ftatefmen — the re-eftablifh'» 
ment of tranquillity after ^ glorious war. The 
treaty at Utrecht furnlfhes ^ memorable example of 
this. The furious debates which enfued within the 
walls of Parliament and without, arefufEciently reihem* 
bered. About this time, fays Boyer, in May 17 13, a 
paper, entitled Meivgatqr, or Commerce Retrieved, 
was publifhed on Tuefdays, Thurfdays, and Satur*

and great fweetnefs, confidering how much party then embittered 
every compofition. The Briti/h Merchant^ which pppofqd The

aflifted by DoQ:or D'Avenant; but the latter folemnly 
denied it : and it foon after appeared to be the 
produftion of Daniel De Foe, an ambidextrous 
hireling, who for this dirty work received a large 
weekly allowance from the Treafury. That he wrote 
in the Mercator^ De Foe admits ; but he exprefsly 
denies " that he either was the Author of it, had 
the property of it, the printing of it, the profit of it, 
or had the power to put any thing into it, if he 
would." And, by his Appeal^ he affirms before 
God and the world, " that he never had any pay- 
ment, or reward, for writing any part of it." Yet, 
that he was ready to defend thofe papers of the 
Mercator which were really his, if men would an- 
fwer with arguments, rather than abufe; though 
not thofe things which he had never written, but 
for which he had received fuch ufage. He adds, 
with the noble fpirit of a true-born Englifhman, 
** The prefs was open to me as well as to others ; 
and how, or when I loft my Englijh liberty of 
fpeaking my mind, I know not : neither how my 
fpeaking my opinions, without fee or reward^ could 
authorife any one to call me villain, rafcal, traitor, 
and fuch opprobrious names." 

Of the imputed connexion with hisjirji henefaSlor^ 
Harley, during that memorable period, our Author 
fpeaks with equal firmnefs, at a moment when firm- 
plainly mentioned in the fourth. Mr. Daniel Foe may change 
his nanae from Review to Mercator^ from Mercator to any other 
titky yet ftill his fingular genius fhall be diftinguifhed by his ini- 
mitable way of writing. Thus perfonal farcafm was introduced 
to fupply deficience of fafts, or weaknefs of reafoning. When 
Charles King republifhed The Britl/h Merchant in volumes, among 
various changes, he expunged, with other perfonalities, the name 
of De Foe.

nefs was neceffary. " I folemnly proteft,'* fays he, 
by his Appeal^ " in the prefence of Him who fhall 
judge us all, that I have received no inftruftions, 
orders, or direftions for writing any thing, or ma- 
terials jfrom Lord Oxford, fince Lord Godolphin 
was Treafurer, or that I have ever fliewn to Lord 
Oxford any thing I had written or printed.*' 
He challenges the world to prove the contrary; 
and he affirms, that he always capitulated for 
liberty to fpeak, according to his own judgment of 
things. As to confideration, penfion, or reward, he 
declares moft folemnly that he had none, except 
his old appointment made him long before by Lord 
Godolphin. What is extremely probable we may 
eafily credit, without fuch ftrong affeverations. 
However Lord Oxford may have been gratified by 
the voluntary writings of De Foe, he had doubtlefs 
other perfon^ who ftared his confidence, and wrote 
his Examiners *. 

But De Foe publifhed that, which by no means pro- 
moted Lord Oxford's views, and which, therefore, 
gained little of his favour. Our Author wrote 

* It is now fufficiently known. That Lord Oxford had relwr 
quijhed the Treaty of Commerce to its fate y before it was finally de-' 
hated In Parliament. See much curious matter on this fubjedl in 
Macpherfon's State Papers, vol. 11. p. 421-23. It is there faid, 
that he gave up the commercial treaty, in compliment to Sir 
Thomas Hanmer, as he would by no means be an occafion. of a 
"breach among friends. The Treafurer had other reafons: The 
treaty had been made by Bolingbroke, whom he did not love ; 
the Lords Anglefea and Abingdon had made extravagant de- 
' Biands for their fupport ; and, like a w^ife man, he thought it 
idle to drive a nail that would not go. Yet Lord Halifax boafted 
'to the Hanoverian minifler. That he alone had been the occafion of the 
treaty being rejedled. Same papers, p. 509-47.

againft the peace of Utrecht, becaufe he approved 
of it as little as he had done the treaty at Gertruy- 
denburgh, under very diflferent influences, a few 
years before. The peace he was for, as he himfelf 
fays, was fuch as fhould neither have given the 
Spanifh monarchy to the Houfe of Bourbon, nor to 
the Houfe of Auflria ; but that this bone of content 
tion fhould have been fo broken to pieces, as that it 
Ihould not have been dangerous to Europe ; and 
that England and Holland fhould have fo flrength-. 
ened themfelves, by fharing its commerce, as fhould 
have made them no more afraid of France, or the 
Emperor; and that all that we fhould conquer in the 
Spanifh Wefl Indies fhould be our own. But it is 
equally true, he affirms, that when the peace was 
eflabliflied, " I thought our bufinefs was to make 
the befl of it ; and rather to inquire what improve^ 
ments could be made of it, than to be continually 
exclaiming againfl thofe who procured it." 

He manfully avowed his opinion in 17 15, when 
it was both difgraceful and dangerous, that the 9th 
article of the Treaty of Commerce was calculated 
for the advantage of our trade j " Let who will make 
it, that," fays he, " is nothing to nie. My reafons 
'^'are, becaufe it tied up the French to open the door 
to our manufaftures, at a certain duty of importation 
there ^ and left the Parliament of Britain at liberty to 
fhut t heir's out, by as high duties as they pleafed 
here^ there being no limitation upon us, as to duties 
on French goods, but that other nations fhould pay 
the fame. While the French were thus bound, and 
the Britifh free, I always thought we mufl be in a 
condition to trade to advantage, or it mufl be our 
own fault : this was my opinion, and is iojlill; and

In May 17 13, our Author relinquiftied the Re^

could be more plain/' fays he, " than that the titles 
of thefe were amufements *, in order to put the books 
into the hands of thofe people, who had been de- 
luded by the Jacobites.** Thefe petty volumes were 
fo much approved by the zealous friends of the Pro- 
teflant fucceflion, that they were diligent to difperfe 
them through the mod diftant counties* And De 
Foe protefts, that had the Eleftor of Hanover given 
him a thoufand pounds, he could not have ferved him 
more efFeftually, than by writing thefe three trea- 
tifes. 

The reader will learn, with furprife and indigna- 
tion, that for thefe writings De Foe was arretted, 
obliged to give eight hundred pounds bail, contrary 
to the Bill of Rights, and profecuted by informa- 
tion, during Trinity term 1713. This groundlefs 
profecution was inftituted by the abfurd zeal of 
William Benfon, who afterwards became ridicu- 
loully famous for literary exploits, which juftly 
raifed him to. the honours of the Dunciad. Our 
Author attributes this profecution to the malice of 
his enemies, who were numerous and powerful. 
No inconjiderable people were heard to fay, that they 
knew the books were againft the Pretender, but that 
De Foe had difobliged them in other things, and 
they refolved to take this advantage to punifh him. 
This ftory is the more credible, as he had procured

was prompted by confcioufnefs of innocence to defend 
bimfelf in the Review during the profecution, which 
offended the Judges,who,beingfomewhat infefted with 
the violent fpirit of the times, committed him to New- 
gate in Eafter term 1 7 1 3. He was however foon neleaf- 
ed on making a proper fubmiifion. But it was happy 
for De Foe that his^^y? benefactor was ftill in power, 
whoprocured him the Queen*s pardon, inNovember* 
1713. This aft of liberal juftice was produced by 
the party- writers! of thofe black and bitter days, as an 
additionalproof of Lord Oxford's attachment to the 
abdicated family, while De Foe was faid to be con- 
vifted of abfolute Jacobitifm, contrary to the tenor 
of his life, and the purpofe of his writings. He him- 
felf faid farcaftically, that they might as well have 
made him a Mahometan. On his tomb-ftone it 
might have been engraved, that he was the only 
Englifhman who had been obliged to alk a royal par- 
don, for writing in favour of the Hanover fucceflioiu 
*' By this time, fays Boyer, in Oftober 17 14, the 
treafonable defign to bring in the Pretender was 
manifefted to the world by the agent of one of the 
late managers, De Foe, in his Hijiory of the While 
Staff. The Deteftionof the Secret Hiftory of the Whits 
^i^ff^ which was foon publifhed, confidently tells, 
that it was written by De Foe ; as is to be feen by

at that epoch, no plot in favour of the Pretender- 
except in the affertions of thofe who wiflied to pro^ 
mote their intereft by exhibiting their zeal. And 
I have fhewn, that De Foe had done more to keep 
out the Pretender, than the political tribe, who pro- 
fited from his zeal, yet detracted from his fame. 

" No fooner was the Queen dead,** fays he, 
*' and the King, as right required, proclaimed, but 
the rage of men increafed upon me to that degree, 
that their threats were fuch as I am unable to ex- 
prefs. Though I have written nothing fince the 
Queen's death ; yet, a great many things are called 
by my name, and I bear the anfwerers infults. I have 
not feen or fpoken with the Earl of Oxford,** con-

by unmerited obloquy. He probably loft his original 
appointment, when his firft benefaftor was finally ex- 
pelled. Inftead of ^ meeting with reward for his

And fixed his penfion firft, or he had never fung. 

While thus infulted by enemies, and difcounte-

for this intrepid meafure, he affeciingly fays. That,

It is a circumftance perhaps unexampled in the life 
of any other writer, that before he could finilh his 
Appeal, he was ftruck with an apoplexy. After 
languilhing more than fix weeks, neither able to go 
on, nor likely to recover, his friends thought fit to 
delay the publication no longer. " It is the opinion 
of moft who know him,** fays Baker, the publiflier, 
^^ that the treatment which he here complains of,, 
and others of which he would have fpoken,^ have been 
the caufe of this difafter." When the ardent mind 
of De Foe refleded on what he had done, and what 
he had fuffered, how he had been rewarded and per- 
fecuted, his heart melted in defpair. His fpirit, like 
a candle ftruggling in the focket, blazed and funk,, 
and blazed and funk, till it difappeared in dark- 
nefs^ 

While 



41 5 THE LIFE OF DE TOt. 

While his ftrength reinained, he expoftulated with 
his adverfaries in the following terms of great man- 
linefs, and inftruftive intelligence : — " It has been 
the difafl?er of all parties in this nation, to be very 
hot in their turn, and as often as they have been fo, 
I have differed with them all, and fliall do fo. 
I will repeat fome of the occafions on the Whig fide, 
becaufe from that quarter the accufation of my turn- 
ing about comes. 

" Thejirji time I had the misfortune to differ with 
my friends, was about the year 1683, when the 
Turks were befieging Vienna, and the Whigs in 
England, generally fpeaking, were for the Turks 
taking it ; which I, having read the hiftory of the 
cruelty and perfidious dealings of the Turks in their 
wars, and how they had rooted out the name of the 
Chriftian religion in above three fcore and ten king, 
doms, could by no means agree with : and though 
then but a young man, and a younger author, I op- 
pofed it, and wrote againfl it, which was taken 
very unkindly indeed. 

^' The next time I differed with my friends, was 
when King James was wheedling the DifTenters to 
take off" the penal laws and teft, which I could by 
no means come into. 1 told the DifTenters, I had 
rather the Church of England fhould pull our clothe^ 
off by fines and forfeitures, than the Papifis fiiould 
fall both upon the Church and the DifTenters, and 
pull our fkins off by fire and faggot. 

". The next difference I had with good men, was about

would freely acknowledge ; and if they would pro- 
duce any evidence of the bribes, the penfions, and

whether they were true or no. If they would, give 
a lift of the books which they charge me with, and 
the reafons why they lay them at my door, I would 
acknowledge any miftake, own what I have done, 
and let them know what I have not done. But thefe

With the fame independence of fplrit, but with 
greater modefly of manner ^ our Author openly dif« 
approved of the imtemperance, which was adopted 
by Government in 17 14, contrary to the original pur* 
pofe of George I. *' It is and ever was my opi-

tion is the only virtue by which the tranquillity of 
this nation can be preferved; and even the King 
himfelf, (I believe his Majefly will allow me that 
freedom,) can only be happy in the enjoyment of 
the crown, by a moderate adminiftration : if he 
fliould be obliged, contrary to his known difpofition, 
to join with intemperate councils, if it does not 
leflen his fecurity, I am perfuaded it will leflen his 
fatisfaftion. To attain at the happy calm, which is

will never do it^ a balance of parties may.^* Such was 
the political teftament of De Foe ; which it had been 
happy for Britain, had it been as faithfully executed 
as it was wifely made !

our Author's political life. Faftion henceforth

The bookfeiler foon procured a recommendatory let- 
ter from the Reverend Samuel Wright, a well- 
known preacher in the Black-Friars. It was praifed 
from the pulpit and the prefs j and the utility of the 
end, with the attradivenefs of the execution, gave 
it, at length, a general reception *. The Author's 
iirft defign was to write a Dramatic Poem ; but the

admit of reftraint, or to allow excurfions. His 
purpofewas to divert znd in/lrudj at the fame mo-

with his ufual archnefs : As to its being called a play, 
be it called fo, if they pleafe : it muft be confeffed, 
fome parts of it are too much aded in many fami- 
lies among lis. The Author wifhes, that either all 
our Plays were as ufeful for the improvement and 
entertainment of the world, or that they were lefs 
encouraged. There is, I think, fome myjiicifm m 
the preface, which, it were to be defired, a judicious

42a THE LIFE OF DE FOE* 

De Foe afterwards added a fecond volume, in two 
parts ; ift, relating to Family Breaches; 2dly, to the 
great Mi/iakej of mixing the Pafflons in the managing of 
Children. He confidered it, indeed, as a bold adven^ 
iure to write a fecond volume of any thing ; there 
being a general opinion among modern readers, that 
fecond parts never come up to the fpirit of the firft. 
He quotes Mr. Milton, for differing from the world 
upon the queftion, and for affirming with regard to 
his own great performances. That the people bad a 
general fenfe of the lofs of Paradife^ but not an equal 
gujl for regaining it. Of De Foe's fecond volume, 
it will be eafily allowed, that it is as inflrudtive and 
pleafmg as the firft. His Religions Courtfhipy which 
he publilhed in 1722, may properly be confidered as 
a third volume : For the defign is equally moral, the 
manner is equally attradive, and it may in the fame 
manner be called a Religious Play. 

But the time at length came, when De Foe was 
to deliver to the world the moft popular of all his 
performances. In April 17 19, he publifhed the 
well-known Life and furpriftng Adventures of Robin' 
fon Crufoe. The reception was immediate and univer-f 
fal ; and Taylor, who purchafed the manufcript 
after every bookfeller had refufed it, is faid to have 
gained a thoufand pounds. If it be inquired by 
what charm it is that thefe furpriftng Adiientures 
fhould have inftantly pleafed, and always pleafed, it 
will be found, that few books have ever fo natu- 
rally mingled amufement with inftruftion. The at. 
tention is fixed, either by the fimplicity of the nar- 
ration, or by the variety of the incidents ; the heart 
is amended by a vindication of the ways of God t$ 
plan: and the underftanding is informed, by various

examples, how much utility ought to be preferred to 
ornament : the young are inftrudled, while the old 
are amufed, 

Robinfon Crufoe had fcarcely drawn his canoe 
afhore, when he was attacked by his old enemies, 
ihefavages. He was affailed firft by The Life and 

Jirange Adventures of Mr. D De F — , of London, 

Hqfier, who has lived above Fifty Tears by himfelf i^ 
the Kingdoms cf North and South Britain. In a dull 
dialogue between De Foe, Crufoe, and his man Fri- 
day, our Author^s life is lampooned, and his mif- 
fortunes ridiculed. But he who had been ftruck by 
apoplexy, and who was now difcountenanced by 
power, was no fit objedt of an Englifhman's fatire. 
Our Author declares, when he was himfelf a writer 
of fatiric poetry, " that he never reproached any 
man for his private infirmities, for having his houfe 
burnt, his fhips cafl away, or his family ruined ; nor 
had he ever lampooned any one, becaufe he could 
not pay his debts, or differed in judgment from 
him." Pope has been juflly cenfured for purfuing 
a vein of fatire extremely diffimilar. And Pope 
placed De Foe with Tutchen, in The Dunciad, when 
our Author's infirmities were greater and his com- 
fort lefs. He was again affaulted in lyi^y hy An 
Epijile to D ■ De F — , the reputed Author of Ro^ 
binfon Crufoe. " Mr. Foe,*' fays the letter-writer, 
*' I have perufed your pleafant flory of Robinfon 
Crufoe; and if the faults of it had extended no fur- 
ther than the frequent folecifms and incorreclnefs of 
ftyle, improbabilities, and fometimes impoflibilities, 
I had not given .you the trouble of this Epiftle.** 
*' Yet," faid Johnfon to Piozzi, " was there ever 
any thing written by mere man, that was wilhed

longer by its readers, except Don Quixote, Robinjhn 
Crufoej and the Pilgrim^s Progrefs ?" This epiftot 
lary critic, who renewed his angry attack when the 
fecond volume appeared, has all the dulnefs, with- 
out the acumen, of Dennis, and all his malignity, 
without his purpofe of reformation. The Life of 
Crufoe has pafled through innumerable editions, and 
has been tranflated into foreign languages, while the 
criticifm funk into oblivion. 

De Foe fet the critics at defiance while he had 
the people on his fide. As a commercial legiflator he 
knew, that it is rapid fale which is the great incen-r 
tive : and, in Auguft 1719, he publiflied a fecond 
volume of Surprifing Adventures^ with limilar fuc- 
cefs. In hope of profit and of praife, he produced 
in' Auguft 1720, Serious Reflexions during the Life 
of Robinfan Crufoe^ with hisVifion of the Angelic World. 
He acknowledges, that the prefent work is not 
merely the produQ: of the two firft volumes, but the 
two firft may rather be called the product of this : 
the fable is always made for the moral, not the moral 
for the fable. He however did not advert, that in- 
ftruftion muft be infinuated rather than enforced, 
That this third volume has more morality than fabie,^ 
is the caufe, I fear, that it has never been read with 
the fame avidity as the former two, or fpokenof with 
the fame approbation. We all prefer amufement to 
inftruclion ; and he who would inculcate ufeful 
truths, muft ftudy to amufe, or he will offer his 
lefTons to an auditory, neither numerous, nor atten- 
tive. 

The tongue of detraftion is feldom at reft. It has 
often been repeated, that De Foe had furreptitioufly 
appropriated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a 

Scotch 



CHARLES 2d^-^GE0RGE 2d. 425 

Scotch mariner, who having lived folitarily on the 
ifle of Juan Fernandez, four years and four months, 
was relieved on the 2d of February, 1 708-9, by Cap- 
tain Woodes Rogers, in his cruizing voyage round the 
world. But let no one draw inferences till the fafl: 
be firft afcertained. The adventures of Selkirk had 
been thrown into the air, in 1712, for literary 
hawks to devour * j and De Foe may have catched a 

* The whole ftory of Selkirk is told in Woodes Rogers's voyage, 
which he publifhed in 1712, from p. 125 to 131, inclufive : whence 
it appears, that Selkirk had preferved no pen, ink, or paper, and 
had lofl his language ; fo that he had no journal or papers, whichhe 
could comnaunicate, or by others could be ftolen. There is an 
account of Selkirk in The Enghjhman^ No. 26. The particular 
manner how Alexander Selkirk lived four years and four months, 
in the ifle of Juan Fernandez, is related in Captain Cooks 
voyage into the South Sea, which was publifhediu' 1712, And 
Selkirk's tale was told in the Memoirs of Literature, 5. voL 
p. 1 18: fo that the world was fully poffeffed of Selkirk's ftory in 
1 7 12, feven years prior to the publication ol' Crufoe's adventures. 
Nor were his adventures fingular ; for, Ringrofe mentions, in his 
account of Captain Sharp's voyage, a perfon who had efcaped 
iingly from a fhip that had been wrecked on Juan Fernandez, and 
who lived alone five years before he was relieved : And Dam- 
pier mentions a Mofquito Indian, who having been accidentally 
left on this ifland, fubfifted three years folitarily, till that voyager 
jcarried him off. From which of thefe De Foe borrowed his great 
Incident, it is not eafy to difcover. In the preface to The Se^ 
rious ReJledtonSf he indeed fays, " That there is a man alive and 
well known, the adions ofwhofe life arethe juft fubjeft of thefe 
volumes, and to whom the moft part of the ftory dire6lly alludes." 
This turns the fcale in favour of Selkirk. Nor, was the name of 
Crufoe wholly fiftitious ; for, among De Foe's contemporaries, 
JohnDunton fpeaks of Timothy Grufoe, who was called theGolden 
Preacher, and was fo great a textuary, that he could pray two 
hours together in fcripture language ; but, he was not arrived at 
perfeiSlion ; as appeared by his floth in tying the conjugal knot : 
yet, his repentance was fincere and public, and I fear not but he 
\& now a glorified faint in heaven. — Life and Errors, p. 461.

426 THE LIFE OP D£ FOE; 

common prey, which he converted to the ufes of hi3 
intellea, and diftributed for the purpofes ofhisin- 
tereft. Thus he may have fairly acquired the fun- 
damental incident of Crufoe's life ; but, he did not 
borrow the various events, the ufeful moralities, 
or the engaging ftyle. Few men could write fuch a 
poem ; and few Selkirks could imitate fo pathetic aa 
original. It was the happinefs of De Foe, that as 
many writers have fucceeded in relating eriterprifes 
by land, he excelled in narrating adventures by fea, 
with fuch felicities of language, fuch attrafl:ive vari- 
eties, fuch infmuative inftruction, as have feldom 
been equalled, but never furpaffed. 

While De Foe in this manner bufied himfclf in 
writing adventures, which have charmed every 
reader, a rhyming fit returned on him. He pub- 
lifliedin 1720, The complete Art of Paintings which 
he did into EngliJIo from the French of Du Frefnoy. 
Dry den had given, in 1695, atranflation of DuFref- 
noy*s poem, which has been efteemed for its know* 
ledge of the filler arts. What could tempt De Foe 
to this undertaking it is not eafy to difcover, unlefs 
we may fuppofe, that he hoped to gain a few guineas, 
without much labour of the head or hand. Dryden 
has been juftly praifed for relinquifhing vicious ha- 
bits of compofition, and adopting better models 
for his raufe. De Foe, after he had feen the cor- 
reftnefs, and heard the mufic of Pope, remained 
unambitious of accurate rhymes, and regardlefs of 
fweeter numbers. His politics and his poetry, for 
which he was long famous among biographers, 
would not have preferved his name beyond the fleet- 
ing day; yet I fufpeft that, in imitation of Mikon, he 
would have preferred his Jure Divino to his Robin- 
fon Grufoe. 

De

De Foe lived not then, however, in pecuniary 
diftrefs; for his genius and his induftry were to hinr 
the mines of Potofi; and in 1722, he obtained from 
the Corporation of Colchefter, though my inquiries 
have not difcovered by what interpofition, a ninety- 
nine years leafe of Kingfwood-heath, at a yearly rent 
of a hundred and twenty pounds, with a fine of 
five hundred pounds *. This tranfaftion feems to 
evince a degree of wealth much above want, though 
the affignment of his leafe not long after to Walter 
Bernard equally proves, that he could not >eafily hold 
what he had thus obtained. Sangfwood-heath is now 
worth three hundred pounds a year, and is advertifed 
for faie by Bennet, the prefent poffeflbn 

Whatever may have been his opulence, our Au- 
thor did not wafte his fubfequent life in unprofitable 
idlenefs. No one can be idly employed who endea- 
vours to make his fellow fubjefts better citizens and 
wifer men. This will fuiEciently appear if we con- 
fider his future labours, under the diftinfl: heads of 
voyages ; fiftitious biography ; moralities, either 
grave or ludicrous; domeftic travels j and trafts on 
trade. 

The fuccefs of Crufoe induced De Foe to publifli, 
in 1720, The Life and Piracies of Captain Singletony 
though not with fimilar fuccefs : The plan is narrower, 
and the performance is lefs amufive. In 1725, he 
gave J New Voyage round the Worlds by a Courfe

misfortune, that whatever fuccefs they had in the ad- 
venture, they had very little in the narration : they are 
indeed full of the incidents of failing, but they have

4^8 THE LIFE OF DE FOE. 

nothing of llory for the ufe of readers who never in- 
tend to brave the dangers of the fea. Thefe fauhs 
De Foe is ftudious to avoid in his new voyage. He 
fpreads before his readers fuch adventures as no 
writer of a real voyage can hope to imitate, if we ex- 
cept the teller of Anfon's tale. In the life of Crufoe 
we are gratified by continually imagining that the 
fiftion is a fad: in the voyage round the world we 
are pleafed by conftantly perceiving that the fad 
is a fidion, which, by uncommon Ikill, is made 
more interefting than a genuine voyage. 

Of fifliitious biography it is equally true, that by 
matchlefs art it may be made more inftruftive 
than a real life. Few of our writers have excelled 
De Foe in this kind of biographical narration, the 
great qualities of which are, to attract by the diver- 
fity of circumftances, and to inftruft by the ufefuU 
nefs of examples. 

H6 publiftied, in 1720, the Hiftory of Duncan 
Campbell. Of a perfon who was bom deaf and 
dumb, but who himfelf taught the deaf and dumb 
to underftand, it is eafy to fee that the life would be 
extraordinary. It will be found, that the Author 
has Intermixed fome difquifitlons of learning, and 
has contrived that the merrleft pafTages fhall end 
with fome edifying moral. The fortunes and mlP 
fortunes of Moll Flanders were made to gratify the 
world in 1721. DeFoe was aware, that in relating 
a vicious life, it was neceflary to make the beft ufe 
of a bad ftory ; and he artfully endeavours, that 
the reader ihall be more pleafed with the moral than 
the fable ; with the application than the relation ; 
with the end of the writer than the adventures ^of 
the perfon. There was publilhed in 1721, a work 
? of 



CHARLES id GEORGE 2d^ 429 

of a fimilar tendency, the Life of Colonel Jack,xwho 
was born a gentleman but. was bred a pickpocket. — 
Our Author is ftudious to convert his various adven- 
tures into a delightful field, where the reader might 
gather herbs, wholefome and medicinal, without 
the incommodation of plants, poifonous, or noxious. 
In 1724, appeared the Life of Roxana. Scenes of 
crimes can fcarcely be reprefented in fuch a manner, 
fays De Foe, but fome make a criminal ufe of them; 
but when vice is painted in its low-prized colours, it 
is not to make people love what from the frightful- 
nefs of the figures they ought neceiTarily to hate. 
Yet, I am not convinced, that the world has been 
made much wifer, or better, by the perufal of thefe 
lives : they may have diverted the lower orders, but 
I doubt if they have much improved them ; if how- 
ever they have not made them better, they have not 
left them worfe. But they do not exhibit many 
fcenes which are welcome to cultivated minds. Of a 
very different quality are the Memoirs of a Ca- 
valier^ during the Civil Wars in England, which 
feem to have been publifhed without a date. This 
is a romance the likeft to truth that ever was writ- 
ten. It is a narrative of great events, which is 
drawn with fuch fimplicity, and enlivened with fuch 
reflexions, as to inform the ignorant and entertain 
the wife. 

The moralities of De Foe, whether publilhed in 
fmgle volumes, or interfperfed through many paf- 
fages, muft at laft give him a fupeiiority over the 
crowd of his contemporaries. The approbation 
which has been long given to his FafJiily Injlrudor and 
his Religious Courtjhip^ feem to contain the favour- 
able decifion of his countrymen. But there are (till 

other 



43^ '^^^ ^^^^ OF DE FOE. 

Other performances of this nature, which are now 
to be mentioned, of not inferior merit, 

De Foe publifticd, in 1722, J Journal of the 
Plague in 1665, The Author's artifice confifts in 
fixing the reader's attention by the deep diftrefs of 
fellow-men; and, by recalling the reader's recollec- 
tion to ftriking examples of mortality, he endeavours 
to inculcate the uncertainty of life, and the ufeful- 
nefs of reformation* In 1724, De Foe publiflxed 
The great Law of Subordination. This is an admi- 
rable commentary on the Unfufferable Behaviour of 
Servants. Yet, though he intereft by his mod6, in- 
form by his fads, and convince by his argument, 
he fails at laft, by expefting from law what muft 
proceed from manners. Our Author gave the 
Political Hi/iory of the Devil ^ in 1726. The -matter 
and the mode conjoin to make this a charming per- 
formance* He engages poetry and profe, reafoning 
and wit, perfuafion and ridicule, on the fide of reli- 
gion and morals, with wonderful efficacy. De Foe 
wrote a-fyftem of magic in 1 726. This may be pro- 
perly regarded as a fupplement to the Hiftory of the 
DeviK His end and his execution are exadly the 
fame. He could fee no great harm in the prefent 
pretenders to hiagic, if the poor people would but 
keep their money in their pockets ; and that they 
Ihould have their pockets picked by fuch an unper- 
forming, unmeaning, ignorant crew as thefe are, 
is the only magic De Foe could fee in the whole 
fcience. But the reader will difcover in our Au- 
thor's fyftem extenfive erudition, falutary remark, 
and ufeful fatire. De Foe pybliflied in 1727, his 
Treatife on the Ufe and Abufe of the Marriage-Bed. 
The Author had begun this performance thirty years 

before ;

before : he delayed the publication, though it had 
been long finiflied, in hopes of reformation. But 
being now grown M^ and out of the reach of fcandaly 
and defpairing of amendment from a vicious age, 
he thought proper to clofe his days with this fatire* 
He appealed to that Judge, before whom he expeft- 
ed foon to appear, that as he had done it with an 
upright intention, fo he had ufed his utmoft endeavour 
to perform it in a manner, which was the leaft liable 
to reflection, and the moft anfwerable to the end 
of it — the reformation of the guilty. After fuch an 
appeal, and fuch afleverations, I will only remark, 
that this is an excellent book with an improper title- 
page. 

We are now to confider our Author's Tours. 
He publiflied his Travels through England, in 
1724 and 1725; and through Scotland, in 
1727. De Foe was not one of thofe travellers 
who feldom quit the banks of the Thames. 
He had made wide excurfions over all thofe coun- 
tries, with obfervant eyes and a vigorous intellefl. 
The great artifice of thefe volumes confifts in the fre- 
quent mention of fuch men and things, as are always 
welcome to the reader^s mind. 

De Foe's Commercial Trads are to be reviewed 
!aftly. Whether his fancy gracfually failed, as age 
haftily advanced, I am unable to tell. He certainly 
began, in 1726, to employ his pen more frequently 
on the real bufinefs of common life. He publiflied, 
in 1727, The Complete Englijh Tradefman; direding 
him in the feveral parts of trade. A fecond volume 
foon after followed, which was addreffed chiefly to 
the more experienced and more opulent traders. In 
3 thefe 



43- THE LIFE OF DE FOEi 

thefe treatifes the tradefman found many direaions 
of bufinefs, and many leflbns of prudence. De Foe 
was not one of thofe writers^ who confider private 
vices as public benefits : God forbid, he exclaims, 
that I fhouid be underftood to prompt the vices of the 
age, in order to promote any practice of traffic : 
trade need notbe deftroyed though vice were mortally 
wounded. With this falutary fpirit he publi(hed, in 
1728, A Plan of the Englijh Commerce. This feems 
to be the conclufion of what he had begun in 
17 1 3. In 1728, Gee printed his Trade and Navi-^ 
gation con/idered. De Foe infilled, that our induftry, 
our commerce, our opulence, and our people, had 
increafed and were increafmg. Gee reprefented that 
our manufaftures had received mortal ftabs; that 
our poor were deftitute, and our country miferable* 
De Foe maintained the truth, which experience has 
taught to unwilling auditors. Gee aflerted the falfe- 
hood, without knowing the fad : yet Gee is quoted, 
while Pe Foe, with all his knowledge of the fub- 
jeft, as a commercial writer, is almoft forgotten* 
The reafon may be found perhaps in the charafte- 
riftic remark with which he opens his plan :. Trade, 
like religion, is what every body talks of, but few 
underftand. 

When curiofity has contemplated fuch copiouf- 
nefs, fuch variety, and fuch excellence, it naturally 
inquires, which was the lafl of De Foe's performances? 
Were we to determine from the date of the title- 
page, the Plan of Commerce muft be admitted to be 
his laft. But if we muft judge from his prefatory 
declaration, in The Abufe of the Marriage-Bed^ 
where he talks of clofing his days with this fatirCi 
which he was fo far from feeing caufe of being 

afhamed 



CHARLEi^ 2d-^GE0RdB 2d. 433 

alhamed of, that he hoped he (holild not be afliamed 
of it where he was going to account for it, we 
muft finally decide, that our Author clofed his ca- 
reer *' with this upright intention for the goodofman- 
kind:' 

De Foe, after thofe innumerable labours, which 
I have thus endeavoured to recal to the public recol- 
leftion, died in April, 1 731, within the parifh of 
St, Giles's, Cripplegate, London, at an age, if he 
were born in 1663, when it was time to prepare for 
his laji 'voyage. He left a widow, Sufannah, who 
did not long furvive him, and fix fons and daugh- 
ters, whom he boafts of having educated as well as 
his circumftances would admit. His fon Daniel is 
faid to have emigrated to Carolina ; of Benjamin, 
his fecond fon, no account can be given. His 
youngeft daughter Sophia, married Mr. Henry Ba- 
ker, a perfon more refpefliable as a philofopher than 
a poet, who died in 1774, at the age of feventy. 
His daughter Maria married one Langley ; but 
Hannah and Henrietta probably remained unmar- 
ried, fince they were heireffes only of a name, Vvhich 
did not recommend them. With regard to 

Norton, from Daniel and Oftrasa fprung *, 
Blefs'd with his father's front, and mother's tongue. 

It is only faid, that he was a wretched writer in the 
Flying Poft, and the author of Alderman Barber's 

* Pope had colle<fted this fcandal from Savage, who fa3''s in his 
preface to his Author to he Let^ " Had it not been an honefler 
livelihood for Mr. Norton, (Daniel De Foe's fon of love by a 
lady who vended oyfters) to have dealt in a fifh-market, than to 
be dealing out the diaieds of Billingfgate in the Flying Poll ?"

adiTiiniftration on his goods and chattels were 1 t 
granted to Mary Brooke, widow, a creditrix, in Sep- I ^^

knew our Author, defcribes him, in 1 705, as a man ^c 

of good parts and clear fenfe; of a converfation, in- ^ 

genious and brifk; of a fpirit, enterprifing and ^ 

bold, but of little prudence ; with good nature and ^ 

real honefty. Of his petty habits little now can be ^ 

told, more than he has thus confefled himfelf J : 
** God, I thank thee, I am not a drunkard, or a 
fwearer, or a whoremafter, or a bufy-body, or idle, 
or revengeful j and though this be true, and I chal- 
lenge all the world to prove the contrary, yet, I 
mufl own, I fee fmall fatisfaftion in all the negatives 
of common virtues; for though I have not been 
guilty of any of thefe vices, nor of niany more, I 
have nothing to infer from thence, but Te Deum lau* 
damns. ^^ He fays himfelf—

When De Foe had arrived at fixty-five, while he 
was encumbered with a family, and, I fear, pinched 
with penury. Pope endeavoured, by repeated ftrokes, 
to bring his gray hairs with forrow to the grave. 
This he did without propriety, and, as far as appears,

without provocation ; for our Author is not in the 
black lift of fcribblers, who by attempting to leffen 
the poet's fame, incited the fatirift's indignation. 
The offence and the fate of Bentley and DeFoe were 
nearly alike. ^ Bently would not allow the tranjlation 
to be Homer: De Foe had endeavoured to bring 
Milton into vogue feven years ere the Faradife Lojl 
and Chevy Chafe had been criticifed in the Speftators 
by Addifon. Our Author had faid in More Reform 
matioriy 

Let this defcribe the nation's chara6ter, 
One man reads Milton, forty . 

The cafe is plain, the temper of the time, 
One wrote the lewd^ the other the fublime. 

An enraged poet alone could have thruft into the 
Dunciad^ Bentley, a profound fcholar. Gibber, a 
brilliant wit, and De Foe, a happy genius. This was 
the confequence of exalting fatire as the teft of 
truth ; while truth ought to have been enthroned the 
teft of fatire. Yet, it ought not to be forgotten, that 
De Foe has fome farcafm, in his Syjiem of Magic^ on 
the fylphs and gnomes, which Pope may have deemed 
a daring invafion of his Roficrutian territories. 

De Foe has not yet outlived his century, though 
he have outlived moft of his contemporaries. Yet the 
time is come, when he muft be acknowledged as one 
of the ableft, as he is one of the moft captivating^ 
writers, of which this ifland can boaft. Before he 
canbe admitted to this pre-eminence, he muft be con- 
lidered diftinftly, as a poet, as a novelift, as a pole- 
mick, as a commercial writer, and as a grave hiftorian. 

As a poet, we muft look to the end of his effufions 
rather than to his execution, ere we can allow him 

F f 2 confiderable 



436 THE LIFE OF DE FOEr 

cohfiderable praife. To mollify national animofitieSj 
or to vindicate national rights, is certainly noble ob- 
jefts, which merit the vigour and imagination of 
Milton, or the flow aiid precifion of Pope ; but our 
Author's energy runs into harfhnefs, and his fweet- 
nefs is to be tafted in his profe more than in his 
poefy. If we regard the adventures of Crufoe, like 
the adventures of Telemachus, as a poem, his moral, 
his incidents, and his language, muft lift him high 
on the poet's fcale. His profeffed poems, whether 
we contemplate the propriety of fentiment, or the 
fuavity of numbers, may indeed,, without much 
lofs of pleafure or inftruftion, be refigned to thofe, 
who, in imitatioa of Pope, poach in the fields of 
obfolcte poetry for brilliant thoughts, felicities of 
phrafe, or for happy rhymes. 

As a novelift, every one will place him in the fore- 
moft rank, who confiders his originality, bis per- 
formance, and his purpofe. The Ship of Fools had 
indeed been launched in early times ; but, who like 
De Foe, had ever carried his reader to fea, in order 
to mend the heart, and regulate the practice of life, 
by fhewing his readers the effects of adverfity, or how 
they might equally be called to fuftain his hero's 
trials, as they failed round the world. But, without 
attraflions, neither the originality, nor the end, caa 
have any falutary confequence. This he had fore- 
feen ; and for this he has provided, by giving his ad- 
ventures in a ftyle fo pleaiing, becaufe it is fimple,and 
fo interefting, becaufe it is particular, that every one 
fancies he could write afimilar language. It was, then, 
idle in Boyer formerly, or in SmoUet lately, to fpeafc 
of De Foe as a party writer^ in little ejiimation. The 
\\T:itings of no Author fince have run through more 

numerous 



CHARLES 2d. GEORGE 2(3. 437 

numerous editions. And he vvhofe works have plea- 
fed generally and pleafed long, mufl be deemed a 
writer of no fmall eflimation ; the people's verdict 
being the proper teft of what they are the proper 
judges- 

As a polemick, I fear we mufl regard our Author 
with lefs kindnefs, though it muft be recolleded, 
that he lived during a contentious period, when two 
parties diftrafted the nation, and writers indulged 
in great afperities. But, in oppofition to reproach, 
let it ever be remembered, that he defended freedom, 
without anarchy ; that he fupported toleration, 
without libertinifmj that he pleaded for moderation 
even amidft violence. With aciitenefs of intelletSt, 
with keennefs of wit, with archnefs of diftion, and 
pertinacity of defign ; it mufl^be allowed that nature 
had qualified, in a high degree, De Foe for a difpu- 
tant. His polemical treatifes, whatevermight havebeen 
their attradions once, may now be delivered with- 
out referve to thofe who delight in polemical reading. 
De Foe, it mufl be allowed, was a party- writer : But, 
were not Swift and Prior, Steel and Addifon, 
Halifax and Bolingbroke, party-writers ? De Foe, 
being a party-writer upon fettled principles, did 
not change with the change of parties ; Addifon 
and Steel, Prior and Swift, connefted as they were 
with perfons, changed their note as perfbns were 
elevated or deprefTed* 

As a commercial writer, De Foe is fairly intitled 
to fland in the foremofl rank -among his contem- 
poraries, whatever may be their performances or 
their fame. Little would be his praife, to fay of 
him, that he wrote on commercial legillation like 
F f 3 Addifon, 



43* THE LIFE or DE FOE. 

Addifon, who when he touches on Trade, finks 
into imbecility, without knowledge of faft, or power 
of argument *. The diftinguifhing charafteriftics 
of De Foe, as a commercial difquifitor, are origina- 
lity and depth. He has many fentiments with re- 
gard to traffic, which are fcattered through his 
Reviews, and which I never re^d in any other book. 
His Giving Jims no Charity is a capital performance, 
with the exception of one or two thoughts about 
the abridgment of labour by machinery, which are 
either half formed or half expreffed. Were we to 
compare De Foe with D' Avenant, it would be found, 
that D'Avenant has more detail from official docu- 
ments; that De Foe has more faft from wider 
inquiry. D^Avenant is more apt to confider laws 
in their particular application; De Foe more fre- 
quently inveftigates commercial legiflation in its 
genera:l eflfects. From the publications of D'Avenant 
it is fufficiently clear, that he was not very regard- 
ful' of means or very attentive to confequences ; 
De Foe is more correft in his motives, and more 
falutary in his ends. But, as a commercial prophet, 
De Foe mufl yield the palm to Child ; who fore- 
feeing from experience that men's conduft muft 
finally be direfted by their principles, foretold the 
colonial revolt : De Foe, allowing his prejudices to 
obfcure his fagacity, reprobated that fuggeftion, 
becaufe he deemed interefl a more ilrenuous prompter 
than enthufiafm. Were we however to form an 
opinion, not from fpecial paflTages, but from whole

performances, we muft incline to De Foe, when 
compared with the ableft contemporary: we muft 
allow him the preference, on recoUeftion, that when he 
writes on commerce he feldom fails to infmuate fome 
axiom of morals, or to inculcate fome precept of 
religion. 

As an hiftorian, it will be found, that our Author 
had few equals in the Englifh language, when he 
wrote. His Memoirs of a Cavalier Ihew how well 
he could execute the lighter narratives. His Hiftory 
of the Union evinces that he was equal to the higher 
department of hiftoric compofition. This is an ac- 
count of a fmgle event, difficult indeed in its exe- 
cution, but beneficial certainly in its confequences. 
With extraordinary ikill and information, our Author 
relates, not only the event, but the tranfaftions which 
preceded, and the effeds which followed. He is at 
once learned and intelligent. Confidering the fac- 
tioufnefs of the age, his candour is admirable. His 
moderation is exemplary. And if he fpoke of James I. 
as a tyrant, he only exercifed the prerogative, which 
our hiftorians formerly enjoyed, of cafting obloquy on 
an unfortunate race, in order to fupply deficience of 
knowledge, of elegance, and of ftile. In this in- 
ftance De Fge allowed his prejudice, to overpower his 
philofophy. If the language of his narrative want 
the dignity of the great hiftorians of the current 
times, it has greater facility; if it be not always 
grammatical, it is generally precife ; and if it be 
thought defeftive in ftrength, it muft be allowed to 
excel in fweetnefs. 

Such then are the pretenfions of De Foe to be ac- 
knowledged as one pf the ableft and moft ufeful

would be acceptable to the Public, efpecially at 
the prcfent Time, when the Situation of Affairs 
in Ireland induces many Perfons to wifh that a 
fimilar Union between Great Britain and that 
Kingdom may take Place ; as it may caufe fuch 
an Union, if not to be effcfted, at leafl to be pro- 
pofed, and to become, for a Time, the Subject 
of Debate in both Countries.
