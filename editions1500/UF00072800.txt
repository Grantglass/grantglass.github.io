ADVENTURE

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

THIS person,-whose life and adventures have been
made immortal by Daniel Defoe, an author not
so well known as Shakespeare and Scott, but
whose name will descend to posterity with theirs.
was born in the city of York, where his father,
who was a native of Bremen, settled, after havingr
gained an estate by merchandise. "is head was
early filled with rambling thoughts, and though,
when he grew up, his father was anxious to settle
him in business, while his mother used the ten-
derest entreaties, yet nothing could prevail upon
him to lay aside his desire of going to sea. "a
at length resolved to gratify his roving disposition,
notwithstanding the uneasiness and distress which
his father and mother showed at his leaving them
Robinson relates, that--On the Ist of Septem
her, 165], I went on board a ship for London;
but no sooner was the ship out of the llumber,
than the wind began to blow, and the sea to rise
in a terrible manner. Having never been at sea
before, I was very sick, and very much frightened.
Next day the wind abated, and my companions
laughed at my fears, and made me half drunk,
and thus drowned my repentance and reflections .
The weather continued calm several days, and we
went into Yarmouth Roads, where we cast an-
chor. After riding there four or five days, the
wind blew very hard for eight days, when it still
increased,\and all hands were called to work to
strike our tepmasts, and at last cast our sheet an-

chor. ' w

It now blew a terrible storm. I began to see
terror in the faces even of the seamen; and as my
master passed by me, I heard him say to himself,
" Lord, be merciful to us, we shall be all. lost l"

I cannot express the horror with which I was
seized. The storm still increased, and I saw the
master, the boatswain, and several others at pray-
ers, thinking that every moment the ship would
go to the bottom. One of the men cried out that
we had sprung a leak, upon which all hands were
called to the pump, but the water gained upon us,
and the ship was likely to founder. The storm,
however, beginning to abate, the master fired guns
for help, and a ship which had rode out the storm
approached us, the crew venturing their lives to
<<ave ours; our men casting a mpe over the stern,
:thoy, after much hazard, got hold of it. and wenomssox 1, muses. 5

with great dilliculty got to land, and walked to
Yarmouth.

On my arrival, I contracted an acquaintance
with the master of a ship who was upon the point
of sailing to Africa to sell our coarse woollen and
linen goods, (there being no cotton mills in those

days,) 101 slaves, how, and gold d11st;he talcimr
a fancy tome, told me I should have liberty of
trading for my self. Encouraged by this, ofler, I
raised PS40, which I laid out in such tdys and
trifles as the captain directed me. Isr got some
knowledge of mathematics, naxigatiori, and how
to take an observation. In a word; this voyau'e
made me both a sailor. and a merchant, for my
adventure yielded use, in Londo1., at my return,

PS300.

I now set up for a slave trader; and perhaps
this trade may have been the occasion, in the ways
of Providence, of my misfortunes. My friend dy-
ing soon after his arrival, I resolt-ed to go the same
voyage again in the same vessel, with one who was
his mate in the former voyage, and had now the
command of the ship. This was one of the most
unhappy voy ages ever made: {01 as we were steer-
ing about the Canary Islands and the Af1iean
shore, we were surpiised by a 1ove1 oi Salee, usu-
ally called a 1iever or pi1ate, who gave chase to
11s. "To, finding that the pi1ate gained upon us,
prepared to fight, ou1 ship havmg twelve guns,
and the pirate eighteen. After a Uchase of nine
hours, she came up with 11s, and a vely sharp en-
gagement ensued; but we we ohligei to submit,
and were all carried prisoners into Salee, a port
belonging to the Moors.=15 t-UIHNSON (mason.

 

My master, the Moor, having got, in part of

his share ofthe prize, the long-boat of our ship,
had a little 821mm built irrtlie middle of it, like a
barge. In this pleasure boat he frequently went
:t-lishing; and as l was dexterous at catchinglish,
he never went without me. One day, he ap-
pointed to go out with two or three Moors ofdis-
tinotion, and he had 'et over-night a larger store
of provisions than usual, and ordered-me to get
"ready two or three fusils, with powder and shot,
as they designed to have sport at fowlmg as well
as fishing. At this moment the hopes of deliver-
ance darted into my thoughts, and I' resolved to
furnish myself for a voyage.

Every thing being prepared, I sailed out as if
to fish, but purposely catching none, I' told h'iuley,
(one of the Moors,) that we must stand farther elf.
Having the helm, I ran the boat a league farther
uni, and then hrtmght to, as if I wouldlish, when,
when giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward,
and steeping behind the Moor, took him by sur-
prise, and tossed him overboard. He rose imme~notiixsox cursors. 7

diately, and called to take him in; but fetching
one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it, and told
him that if he came near,l would shoot him ; and

 

as the. sea was calm, he might easdy reach the
shore. So he turned about, and l have no doubt
that he reached it easily:

I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury,
and said to him, "Xury, if you will he faithful to
me, I will make you a great man ; but if you will
not, 1 must throw you into the sea too." The
boy smiled and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him.

About ten days after, as l was steering out to
sea, on a sudden, Xur)r called out in a fright,
" Master, master, a ship! " I jumped out of the
cabin, and saw that it was a Portuguese vessel
On my coming near, they asked me what 1 was,
in Portuguese, Spanish, and French ; butI under
stood none of them. At last a Scotch sailor
called to me, and I answered, I was an English-
man, and had made my escape from slavery. inCL

tain of the ship, but he would take nothing from
me, and said that all tnat I had should be deli-
vered to me when we came to the Brazils. We
nad a good voyage to the Brazils, and the captain
recommended me to an honest man, who had a
plantation and a sugar-house, with whom I lived,
and learned the planting and making of sugar ; af-
ter which I took a piece of land, and became a
planter myself. Had I continued in the station
I was now in, I might have,becn happy, but my
fellow planters prevailed on me to go to sea again,
and make a trial of purchasing negrocs on the
coast of Guinea. \Ve titted outa ship, and made
sail, with the hopes of purchasing slaves, and had
very good weather for twelve days, but after we
had crossed the line, a violent hurricane drove us
quite out of our reckoning. In this distress one
of our men called out "land l" but the ship struck
against a sand bank. \Ve took to the boat, and
after we had rowed a league and a half, a wave
came rolling astern of us, and overset the boat at
once, so that out of fifteen, none escaped but my-
self. I got upon my feet and made towards the
shore, and got to land, clambering up the cliffs of
the shore, and sat down upon the grass.

Being much fatigued, I slept till morning.
When I awoke it was broad day, and the storm
abated ; but what surprised me most was, that in
the night the ship had been lifted from the land
by the swelling of the tide, and driven almost as
far as the place where I landed, and I saw, that
if we had all staid on board, we would have been
safe. I swam to the ship, and found she had
much water in the hold ; but, to my greatjoy, saw
that all the provisions were dry; and being well
disposed to eat, I filled my pockets, and ate as I
went about other things. I found several Spare.
yards and planks, with which I made a raft. I
emptied three of the seamen's chests, and let them
down upon the raft, and filled them with bread,
some dried goat's flesh, and three Dutch cheeses.
I also let down the carpenter's chest, two fowling-
pieces, two pistols, with some powder, and two
rusty swords, all which I placed on my raft, and
after much labour got it safely landed. My first
raft being too unwieldy,I swam to the ship and
made another; on which I placed three bags of
nails and Spikes, some hatchets, agrindstone, two
iron crows, several muskets, and another fowling-
piece, two barrels of musket bullets, a large bag
of small shot, all the men's clothes I could find, a
hammock and some bedding, and brought all to

 

land. After I 'had made five or six of these voy-
ages, and thought I had nothing more to expect
from the ship worth taking, I found a hogshead of
bread, three ankers of rum, 3 box of sugar, 8. bar--
rel of flour, and three dozen of knives and forks.10 noemsox causoe.

I then went in search of a place where to fix my
dwelling.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle
before a hollow place, which extended about
twenty yards, and drove large piles into the
gmund, sharpened at the top, and I made the en-
trance by a short ladder to go over the top, and
when l was in, I lifted it over me, so that I was
perfectly secure.

In the midst of my labours 1 found a little bag
with a few husks of corn in it, and shook it by
the side of my fortification; but how joyful was
I when I saw ten or twelve ears of barley spring-
ing up! \Vith this barley there came up a few
stalks of rice, and these were of more worth to
me than all the gold in the world.

I then took a view of the island, and at about
two miles distant from my habitat-ion, found some
fine meadows, and a variety of fruit, melons upon
the ground, and the trees spread over with vines
loaded with clusters of grapes. Here I built a
bower, fenced by a double hedge; and this coun-
try-house, as I called it, cost me two months' la-
bour; but the rainy season coming on, I was ob-
liged to retreat to my old one, taking with me a
Sufficient store of dried grapes.

When my corn was ripe, I made a scythe of
an old sword, and cut off the ears, which I rub--
bed out with my hands, At the end of the
harvest, 1 had about a bushel of rice and two
bushels of barley I kept all this for seed, my
hogshead of bread not being yet exhausted.

But when I was obliged to make bread, I had
innumerable wants. I wanted a mill to grind it,
sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into
' bread, and an oven to bake it. However, I had
six months to cont1 110 all these things. I made
some misshapen pots of day, that all biokein ti;- 0
sun except two, v hieh I cased in wicker worc-i
but I succeeded better in little pans, [lat dishes,
and pitchers, which the sun baked surprisingly
hard; but they could not bear the fire so as to
*boil any liquid, and I wanted one to boil my meat.

At dinner, there was my royal majest3, abso-
lute prince and rulei of my kingdom, attended by
my dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased, I could
either bang, draw, quarter, or give libe1ty to.
\Vhen I dined I seemeda kin 'r ,oating alone, none
daring to presume to do so t1 ll 1 bid done. My
p1etty poll, 1nypar'-,1ot which I had tamed, was
the only creature capable of talking with me. My
faithful dog, which I had brought from the ship,
and now giown exceeding old, continually sat at
my right hand; while my two cats sat on each
side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand as
11 principal mark of my royal favour.

Yet these were not the cats Ihad brought from
the ship; they had died long before, and had
been buried near my habitation by my own
hands , but one of them had kittens whu l1 1 took
great pains in taming, just as l have been told
that showman have done with lions and tigers;
but the expe1in1ent is a dangemus one, andIl'.' nomxsos causes.

would not advise any of my readers to be too fa-
miliar with any animal of that tribe, they being
all capricious, ungrateful, and cruel. Only two
of the kittens remained with me, the resthav-
ing run wild into the woods. They grew so im-
pudent, as to return and plunder me of my stores,
till such time as 1 shot many of them, and the
rest left me. One thing more, indeed, concern-
ed me,---the want of my boat. I knew not which
way to get round the island. I resolved one time
to go along the shore by land to her; but, had any
one in England met such afigure, it would either
have allirighted him, or made him burst into
laughter.

One day after I had dressed my dinner, i went
to put out my fire, and found a piece of one of
my earthen-ware vessels burnt as hard as a stone,
and as red as a tile; this taught me to burn my
pipkins, and I soon wanted for no sort of earthen-
ware; but, when I found that I had made a pot
which would hear the fire, I had hardly patience
to stay till it was cold before I set it on with a
tiiece of kid, which was tolerabl y well cooked.

I used to burn my earthen-ware in a care
which 1 found in the wood, and which I made
convenient for that purpose; but the principal
cause that first brought me there was to make
charcoal, so that I might bake and dress my vic-
tuals without danger. While I was cutting down
some wood for this purpose, I perceived a cave
behind a very thick branch of underwood. Curi-
ous to look into it, I got to its mouth, and found
it suflicient for me to stand upright in it. But,
when I entered. and took a further View, two rol-
ling shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to
dart themselves at me, so that I made all the haste
out that I could, not knowing whether it vas a
savage or a monster that had taken up his resi-
dence in that place. On recovering from my sur-
prise, I resumed all the courageI had,and taking
up a fircbrand, in I rushed again; when, not hav-
ing proceeded above three steps, I \'213 more af-
frighted than before, for I heard a very loud sigh,
like that of a human creature in great agony, suc-
ceeded by a noise, resembling words half expres.
sod, and then a broken sigh again. Stepping
hack, thought I to myself, have I got into one of
those enchanted places which are reported to con-
tain miserable captives, till death puts an end to
their sorrow? It struck me with a cold sweat;
but again, mastering all my courage, I proceeded
forward, and, by the light of my lirebrand, per-
ceived it to be a lie-goat lying on the ground gasp-
ing for life and dying of old age. When at first
I stirred him, thinking to drive him out, he strove
to get upon his feet, but was notable; so I left
him there, to fright any one from venturing into
the cave.

At the furthermost part of the cave I observed
an entrance, but so low as to oblige me to creep
to get through ; but, on advancing, I found that it
rose in height above twenty feet, and appeared to
be a grotto, adorned with diamonds and other pre-
cious stones. I found it dry and comfortable, and
therefore determined to make it my magazine.

Still my thoughts ran many times upon the
land I had seen, and I began to make a canoe,
the strangest enterprise that, ever man in his senses14 ROBINSON cuoson.

undertook. I felled a great cedar, about five feet
diameter next the root; but when I saw the im-
possibility of launching the canoe which I had
made, says I to myself I have made a very fine
sea boat, but'I can no more stir it than I can stir
the island. 'I had made it big enough to carry
twenty-five men, hut all my devices to get it into
the water failed me. I determined, since I could
not bring my canoe to the water, that 'I should
bring the water to the canoe, and began to dig;
but when I calculated the time this canal would
take in making, I found that 'I could not accom-
plish it in less than twelve years, and therefore
gave it over, determining to enjoy what 'I had,
without repiuing for what I could not get.

I had at length a great mind to go to the point
of the island to see how the shore lay, and resolv-
ed to travel thither by land. And now, reader,
I will give you a short sketch of the figure I made.
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's
skin; a jacket, with skirts coming down to the
middle of my thighs, and a pair of open-knee'd
breeches of the same, with the goat's hair hanging
to the middle of my leg. Stockings and shoes I
had none; .but I had a pair of somethings, I
scarce know what to call them, to slip over my
legs like spatterdashes. Under my arm hung two
pouches for shot and powder; on my back I car-
ried a basket, on my shoulder a gun, and over my
head a great clumsy goat's skin cover. My board
was cut short, except what grew upon my upper
lip; but as for my figure, as there was no one to
observe me, it was a matter of no consequence

In this dress. I went on my new iourney, and
was out five or six days. In one of my excursions
I was surprised with the print of a man's foot on
the sand. lstood like one thunderstruck; l lis-
tened and looked around, butI could hear nothing,
nor see anything. I went upon a rising ground
to see farther; I walked backward and forward
on the shore, but I could only see that one im-
pression. I went to look at it again; how it
came there i knew not, bntI hurried home to
my fortifications, looking behind meevery two or
three steps, and fancied every tree, bush, and
stump to be a man. I had no sleep that night;
but my terror were off, and I ventured to take
measure of the foot by my own, but found it much
larger. This filled me again with ridiculous
whimsics, and when I Went home, I began to
double my fortifications, purely from my appre-
hensions of this print of a foot.

Rambling more to the western point one day
than ever I had done before, I was convinced that
the sight of the print of a man's foot was not such
a strange thing in the island as I had imagined;
for, on approaching the shore, it is impossible to
express the horror l felt at seeing the shore spread
with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human
bodies, and particularly a place, where, as I sup-
posed, there had been a fire made, and a circle dug
in the earth for the savages to sit down to their
inhuman feasts on the bodies of their fellow-crea-
turcs.

I had now been twenty-two years in the island,
and fancied I could have been contented to have
staid m it till I had died of more old age.Iii aosmsox (:nusoa.

One morning very early I saw five canoes of
savages on shore. I clamhered up the hill, and
discovered no less than thirty dancing round afire.,
I soon after saw two dragged out of the canoes,
one of whom was immediately knocked down,
but the other, starting from them, ran with amaz-
ing swiftness along the sands towards me. I was
frightened when I saw him coming my way, ima-
gining he would be pursued by the whole body;
however, I kept my station, and only three fol-
lowed him. Ile greatly outran them, and was in
a fair way of escaping them all, when, coming to
a creek, 'he plunged into it, landed, and ran as
swift as before. 'I screwed my courage to the
sticking point, whenI found that of the three that
followed, but two entered the water, the other
returning. '1 hastily fetched my guns from the
foot of my ladder, and running down the hill in a
few minutes Istood between the savages and their
victim. The poor savage who had fled was so
terrified at the noise of my gun, that, though he
saw his enemies fallen, he stood stock-still, hut

 

seemed rather inclined to fly than come near me.
However, when i gave him signs of encourage-
ment, he came nearer, kneeling down every ten
or twelve steps. I then took him away to my
cave at the farther part of the island. Here i
gave him bread, and raisins, and water, which he
wanted much ; and, having refresh-ed him, I made
signs for him to lie down on some rice-straw,
which he did, and soon went to sleep. After he
had slept about hall" an hour, he waked again, and
mm running to me in the inclosure hard 1) ';
then kneeling again, he made all possible signs of
thauklulness, subjection, and submission. I began
to speak to him, and to teach him to speak to
to me; and first made him know that his name
should be Friday, which was the day on which I
had saved his life. 1 taught him to say, " Mas-
ter," and let him know that was to be my name.
The next day I gave him clothes, at which he
seemed pleased.

Indeed he was a- comely, handsome, young fel-
.low, extremely well made, with straight long
limbs, not too iarge, but tall and well shaped,
and, as near as I could reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. 1-] is countenance had nothing in it
fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his
face; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had
all the sweetness of an European. His skin was
not so tawney as the Virginians, Brazilians, or
other Americans; but rather of a bright dun,
olive colour, that had something agreeable in it,
though not very easy to give a description of. His
face was round and plump, with. a small nose,
very dill"crent from the flatness of the negroes,
a pretty small mouth, thin lips, line teeth, very
well set, and white as the driven snow. [u a
word, such handsome features, and exact symme--
try in every part, made me consider that I had
saved the life of an Indian prince. But let him he
either prince or peasant, all my happiness centered
in this, that I had now got a good servant or com-
panion, to whom, as he deserved, l was resolved
to prove a kind master and a lasting friend.

Having now more courage, and consequently
more curiosity, I took ,my man Friday With me,

 

and marched to the place where his enemies had
been. When we came there my blood ran cold,
for the ground bore dreadful evidence of the mas-
sacre. We saw three skulls, live hands, and the
bones of three or four legs and feet: and Friday,
by ms aging, mane me understand that they
brought over four prisoners to feast upon, and
that three of them were eaten up; that he, point-
ing to himself, was the fourth, and that they had
been conquered and taken in war. 1-" caused Fri-
day to collect the remains of this horrid carnage,
then to light a tire and burn them to ashes. W hen
this was done we returned to our castle._ItUi'.!.'J:-1C'.'e {JRUSOL' 1:)

I Look Friday once to that part 'of the island
where there still remained some pieces of the
long-boat; but he no sooner saw it than he ex~
claimed, " 0, Master, I have saved white mans
from being drowned in such a boat as that."
Thinking that he spoke of some European boat
which had been driven on his coast by stress of
weather, I asked how many were in it. He
counted on his fingers as far as seventeen ; and on
my asking if his people had eaten them, he repli-
ed, " No, no; my nation no eat men, but what
they take in light; they make poor distressed men
like brothers." I was glad to hear that some Eu-
rlopeans were near me, hoping soon to meet with
t rem.

Several weeks now elapsed, during which I re.
ceived many proofs of Friday's atTection for me,
and so very diligent was he, that I was sure of
having any thing done I set him about. One
day I put a piece of kid into a kettle to make
broth, and set him to watch it whileI went about
some other business.. Ihad not been long gone
when I heard Friday roar out so loud, thatI
thought the savages had attacked our hut. l in-
stantly seized my gun, and rushed in, when I
found no one there but Friday, in as great despe-
ration as when he was chased by the cannibals.
It appeared that poor Friday had never seen boil.
ing water, and, being fearful it might make its
escape, he had put his hand in to seize it, but felt
such pain as made him cry out.

I was now entered into the 97th year of my
captivity, when, one morning, I bid Friday go to
the sea-shore, to see if he could find a turtle. He
had not been gone long, when he came running
back, and before 1 had time to speak, cried, " 0,

master! master! ODdOI' tllOl'C be one two three
9 2
canoe."

Having hung my great sword naked by my side,
and made Friday assist in loading what lire-arms
we had, which consisted of four guns and two
pistols, I took my perspective-glass, and went up
to the side of the hill, when Isaw twenty-one
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes. H av-
ing by this means learned their force, I came down
from the hill determined to put the savages to
flight, and, if possible, to rescue the prisoners. l
sallied forth, and entered the wood, with Friday
beside me, till we came near them. They were
about the fire eating one of their prisoners. This
filled me with horror; and we both fired, and

 

killed four, and wounded three at the first volley,
while the cannibals were panic-struck at receiving
so unexpected a salute. We poured in a second
volley with such ellbct, that we killed two more,
and wounded several, while the air re-echoed with
their yells. Hitherto we fired on them from a
wood; but now giving Friday a loaded musket,
I ordered him to follow me, and we rushed upon
them with a shout, which' so dismayed the canni-
bals, that they fled in great terror. We pursued
them to the beach, and did such execution among
them, that out of twenty-one only four escaped ;
and even these I should have destroyed, but, on
jumping into one of their canoes, which I made
Friday also do, in order to pursue them, our at-
tention was arrested by the discovery of a man
lying bound in the canoe. I ordered Friday to
speak to him; but when the poor fellow looked
him in the face, and heard him speak, a scene en-
sued that would have touched the hardest heart!
Uttering a wild and discordant scream, he em-
braced him, then cried--put his head in his
bosom, danced, sung, and cried again l--Then
feeling in his pocketfor some biscuit, he exclaim-
ed, " Ah, no! hungry dog eat all up." It was
some time before I could learn the cause of his
emotion ; but at length becoming more calm, he
informed me that it was his father.

Here, indeed, I was infinitely moved to see the
dutiful and tender affection this poor savage had
forhis aged parent. He would sit down by him
in the boat, Open his breast, and hold his father's
head close to his bosom half an hour together, to
nourish it; then he took his arms and ancles,
which were stiff and numbed with binding, and
chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and l,
perceiving what the case was, gave. him some rum,
which proved of great benefit to him.

While we were busy in this action, the savages
had gotten almost out of sight, and happy it was
we did not pursue them; for there arose from the
north-west, which continued all night long, such
a violent storm, that I could not suppose otherwise
but that they were all drowned.

[0 my horror 1 now discovered a white man
lying bound to the ground, whom I found to be a
Spaniard, and immediately released him, giving
him a dram and some bread to refresh him.
\Vith much difficulty I got my new guests to my
but, where I accommodated them in the best
manner I was able; and after dinner,I made Fri-
day go to the scene of action, and fetch home the
fire-arms we had left in the wood.

During his absence, the Spaniard told nis tale
in nearly the following words :--" I was the cap-
tain of amerchantman, bound to Africa to pur-
chase slaves, whither we arrived in safety, and
tool: in our cargo; but on our return home, we
were overtaken by a violent storm, and wrecked
on an island where the inhabitants treated us hos-
pitably. we continued to live comfortably, till
the island being invaded by a neighbouring nation,
gratitude compelled us to take up arms in their
defence. I fought by the side of this brave old
man," continued the Spaniard,pointing to Friday's
father, " and had the misfortune to be taken
prisoner along with him, when, but for your aid,
we had fallen victims to our enemies." Here

- the Spaniard ended his story.

To get provisions for my poor weak subjects,
I ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat, which
. when he had done it, I cut off the hinder quar-
ters, and chopping it into small pieces, boiled and

the Spaniard too, who spoke the language of the

Friday to fetch home all our arms from the field
of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did acoordinC-ly.

And now I made Friday enquire of his father,
whether he thought those savages had escaped
the late storm in their canoe; and if so, whether
they would not return with a power too great for
us to resist. He answered, that he thou eht it
impossible they should outlive the storm; or if
they were driven southwardly, they would come
to a land where they would as certainly be de-
voured as if they were drowned in the sea; and
