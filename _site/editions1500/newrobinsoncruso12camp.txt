PREFACE. 



SOME writers have affirmed that 
mankind are all born, with the fame 
difpolitions and the fame degree of un- 
derftanding; and that education, laws, 
and cuftoms, create all the diiference 
perceivable between man and man. I 
confefs, I can hardly bring myfelf to 
fuppofe that education alone produced 
the wide diffimilarity which exifts be- 
tween the charafters of Therfites and 
Achilles, or thofe of Socrates and Any- 
tus : at the fame time it will ever be an 
acknowledged truth, that even he who 
k moll indebted to Nature will reap 
A 3 but

but fmall advantage from her gifts, un- 
lefs they are improved by mature and 
judicious cultivation. 

It is unneceffary to undertake a ferious 
demonftration of a truth univerfally ad- 
mitted in all ages and nations ; a truth 
confirmed by daily experience, and the 
pradlice of which v^^as the objedl con- 
ilantly aimed at by the labours both of 
the philofopher and the bulk of man- 
kind. The improvement of the latter, 
as far as it can be effecSed by education, 
has been more attended to in the prefent 
age than ever it was in any preceding 
one. If the endeavours ufed to this 
purpofe have not had all the fuccefs 
that might be expedled from them, they 
have at leaft excited the attention and 
directed the miinds of men towards an 
objed:, the accomplifliment of which, 
as it is more or lefs perfed, has ever a 

< pro- 



PREFACE. 7 

proportionable effect upon the happi- 
nefs of families, and confequently upon 
the ftate of fociety in general. 

A great genius of the prefent age 
has contributed, even by his falfe opi- 
nions, towards the acconiplilhment of 
this important objeft: for the errors 
of great men are remarked, and the 
difcuiTicn of them frequently leads ta 
the truth from which they have devi- 
ated. Thus Mr. Rouffeau's Emilius 
will, in fpite of the falfe opinions ad- 
vanced in it, always be a valuable book^ 
both on account of the important truths 
which it contains, and thofe which it has 
caufed to be difcovered 5 and it would 
be unjuft not to attribute to it at leaft a 
confiderable enlargement in our ideas 
concerning education. 

To free our fpecies, as far as in us 

lies, from the ailments and dilabihties 

A 4 to

to which Nature fubjeds them from 
their very birth, is a great objed:, but 
certainly not the only one. It is effen- 
tial to fociety that its members be found 
and robuft in conftitution ; but if they 
are not, at the fame time, honeft, juft, 
and good, they will be of more preju- 
dice than advantage to fociety. Mr. 
RoufTeau was perfectly fenfible of this 
truth ; he has paid confiderable atten- 
tion to it ; but, if I may be allowed 
the alTertion, he was frequently de- 
ceived both in the nature of fecial vir- 
tue, and the extent to v/hich it ihould 
be pradlifed. While he boldly attacks 
the prejudices under which we are en- 
jQaved from our infancy, he has, on the 
other hand, denied, or endeavoured to 
render doubtful, many valuable truths 
which conftitute our happinefs in a 
more advanced age. While he meant 

to 



PREFACE. 9 

to prune away the greedy branches that 
impeded the growth of the tree, he 
has, though perhaps without intention, 
wounded its very roots. Whilfl: he_ 
wifhes to affift Nature, he allows Na- 
ture too much ; and where he thought 
he found her defedive, he has .not al- 
ways been able to find the beft means 
of fupplying her defeds. In a word, 
young Emilius is the child of Mr- 
RouiTeau's fancy, not the child of edu- 
cation. 

Neverthelefs, the following work is 
indebted to that of Mr. Roulfeau for 
the form that it bears. Mr. Campe, th^ 
author of it, expreffes himfelf thus : *' I 
never read the following paffage in the 
fecond volume of Emilius without the 
moft feniiblefatisfadLion. Nothing upon 
earth can be fo v/ell calculated to in-^ 
ipire one with ardour in the execution 
A 5 of 



Jo P R E F A C E, 

of a plan approved by fo great a ge- 
nius/* 

<* Might there not be found means/^ 
lays Roufleau, *' to bring together £o 
many leffons of inftruftion that lie feat* 
tered in fo many books ; to apply them 
through a fmgle objed of a familiar and 
not uncommon nature, capable of en- 
gaging the imitation,, as well as roufing 
and fixing the attention even at fo ten- 
der an age ? If one could imagine a 
fituation, in which all the natural wants 
of man appear in the cleareil light to 
the underiianding of a child, and in 
which the means of j(atisfying thefe 
wants unfold tliemfelves fucceffively in 
the fame clear, eafy manner,, the lively 
and natural defcription of fuch a flate 
fhould be the firft means that I would 
ufe to fet his imagination at work. 

** I fee thine expand already, thou ar-

dent phllofopher. But be not in pain ; 
we have found fuch a fituation. It is 
defcribed, and no difparagement to your 
talents, much better than you would 
defcribe it yourfelf, at leaft with more 
truth and fimpHcity. Since we muft have 
books, there is one that furnifhes,. in 
my opinion, the beft irnagined treatife. 
upon natural education that can pof— 
fibly be.. This book fhall be the firft 
that I will put into the hands of my 
Emilius j this fingly fliall for a long, 
time compofe his whole library, and 
indeed fhall always hold a diftinguifhed 
place there. It fhall be the text to 
which all our difcourfes upon natural 
fcience fhall ferve as a commentary. It 
fhall be the criterion of our taile and 
jxidgment; and, as long as thefs re« 
main uncorrupted,. the reading, of it 
will always be agreeable to uSo Y^eUy, 
A 6 tfien^, 



12 PREFACE. 

then, what is this wonderful book ? Is 
it Ariftotle, Pliny, Buffon ?— No ; it 
is Robinfon Crufoe. 

'^RobinfonCfufoe, alone in his ifland, 
deprived of the affiftance of his fellow 
creatures, without * tools of any fort, 
yet providing for his fifety and fub- 
fiftence, and even procuring himfelf a 
fort of happinefs, prefents a fubjeCl in- 
terefting to every age, and which there 
might be a thoufand ways of making 
agreeable to children. This you fee 
realizes the ideal circumftances of the 
defert iiland, which I ufed at firft as a 
comparifon. I grant, it is by no means 
the (late of man as deftined for fociety; 

* Mr. RouiTeau is miftaken here. The Old Re- 
hlnfon Crujoe has plenty of tools and inflrumenls, which 
he faves from the wreck of a fhip ; whereas the AVlu 
'Rohinfon Crujoe has nothing but his head and his hands 
to depend on for his prefervation, 

nay. 



PREFACE. 13 

nay, probably Emilius might never ex- 
perience fuch a fituation ; nevertbelefs, 
it is that by which he fliould eilimate 
the value of every other condition in 
life. The fureft way to rife fuperior to 
all prejudice, and to form our judg- 
ment upon the true report of things, 
is to place ourfelves in the fituation of a 
man cut off from all fociety, and to 
judge of every thing as that man muft 
naturally judge, regard being had at the 
fame time to his own degree of utility 
in the fphere of exiftence. 

*' This ftory, cleared of all its unne^ 
ceffary rubbifli, beginning with Ro- 
binfon's being (hipwrecked upon his 
iiland, and ending with the arrival of 
the veiTel that takes him away, fhall be 
both the amufement and inftrudtion of 
Emilius during the tender age that I 
fpeak of. I will have his head run 



upon 



14 PREFACE. 

upon nothing elfe but Robinfon Crufoei 
he fhall talk inceflantly about his caflle, 
his goats, and his plantations. He 
fliall learn, not from books, but from 
things, every fingle particular neceffary 
to be known in fuch a cafe ; he (liall 
imagine himfelf to be Robinfon Crufoe, 
and drefs himfelf up in ikins, with a 
great cap on his head, a broad fword. 
by his fide, and, in fhort, the whole of 
the grotefque drefs and accoutrements 
with which we generally fee Robinfon 
Crufoe's picture reprefented, except the 
umbrella, for he fhall have no occafioa 
for that. I will have him ftudy how 
he ihould proceed if he happened td be 
in want of this or that necelTary ; he 
fhall examine his hero's condud:, and 
try if he has left nothing undone, or if 
he went the befi: way to work about 
what he has done;, he fhall remark 

where 



PREFACE. 15 

where he is wrong, and take care not 
to fall into the fame miftake himfelf ; 
for you need not have the leaft doubt 
but he will be for imitating Robinfoa 
in his whole plan. Nothing, indeed, 
can be better calculated to pleafe the 
imagination at that calm period of life,, 
when, if our wants are fatisfied, and 
our adlions unrestrained, we. look no 
farther for happinefs. 

** What advantage may not an able 
mafter take of this romantic projeft in a 
child ! a project to which he himfelf has^ 
given birth for the fake of the profitable 
fruits that may be reaped from it. The 
child, ever bufy and eager to make provi- 
fion for his iiland fettlement,will be more 
ready to learn than the mafter to teach » 
He will defire to know every thing that 
is ufeful, and nothing more ; you will

have no occafion to fpur him on — 
The exercife of the natural arts, for 
which one man alone is fufficient, leads 
to the invention of the arts of induftry, 
which require the co-operation of many- 
hands/* 

This paflage from RoufTeau will ex- 
plain, infinitely better than I can, the 
utility of a book compofed upon fuch 
a plan ; it now remains to be feen how 
far Mr. Campe, the author of the fol- 
lowing work, has purfued Mr. Rouf- 
feau's idea. 

The public is pretty generally agreed 
not to depend on the report of tranflators 
concerning the works which they tranf- 
late, efpecially if their judgment be 
favourable to the original : and I be- 
lieve this caution is well founded ; for 
it is no ealy niatter to decide with im- 
partiality 



PREFACE. 17 

partiality where felf-opinion has equal 
influence with juftice in paffing the^ 
fentence. 

Perhaps fome may not think as I do 
concerning fhis work of Mr. Campe's ; 
particularly, thofe who are fond of me- 
taphyfical treatifes upon education, will/ 
no doubt, be difappointed to find no- 
thing in the New Robinfon Crufoe but 
things that are ufeful, introduced in an 
unafFefted manner, clearly exprelTed and 
demonftrated without pedantry; they 
will be furprifed to fee children fpeak 
like children, and their inftru6lor af- 
fume the fimple language of childhood, 
in order to make himfelf underftood. 
Thofe who are governed by the fpiritof 
free thinking will find it ftrange that 
religion is refpedted and rendered re- 
fpe(5table in this work ; that God is re- 
prefented as the mover of all things,, 

and 



I§ PREFACE. 

and the principle to which all our ac- 
tions fhould be referred, as well as the 
motives which determine them, and 
the fentiments which gave them birth. 
Thefe are, no doubt, particularities 
that may be remarked : neverthelefs, at 
this time of day, to think wifely, we 
muft not always think with philofophers. 
'' The Old Robinfon Crufoe," fays 
Mr. Campe, in his Preface to the original 
of this work, ** independent of its other 
defefts, is erroneous in one particular 
fufficient to deilroy every advantage that 
this Hiftory might produce, which is, 
that Robinfon Crufoe is provided with 
all forts of European tools and inftru- 
ments neceffary to procure him many 
of thofe conveniencies that belong to 
fociety. Thus the opportunity is loft 
of affording the young reader a lively 
fenfe both of the wants of man in a ftate 

of 



PREFACE. 19 

©f folitude, and the multiplied happi- 
nefs of a fecial life ; another important 
reafon why I thought proper to depart 
from the old Hiftory of Roblnfon 
Crufoe. 

'* I have, therefore, divided the time 
of my New Robinfon Crufoe's remain- 
ing upon the ifland into three periods. 
In the firft he is all alone and deflitute 
of any European tool or inftrument 
whatfoever, affifting himfelf merely by 
his hands and invention ; in order to 
fhew, on the one hand, how helplefs man 
is in a ftate of folitude, and, on the 
other, how much refledlion and perfe- 
vering efforts can contribute to the im- 
provement of our condition. In the 
fecond period, I give him a companion, 
on purpofe to fhew how much a man*s 
fituation may be bettered by taking even 
this fingle ftep towards fociety. Lailly, 

in 



20 PREFACE. 

in the third period, a veflel from Europe 
is fiiipwrecked on his illand, and gives 
him an opportunity thereby of pro- 
viding himfelf with tools and mod 
other articles neceflary in common life, 
in order that the young reader may fee 
how valuable many things are of which 
we are accuftomed to make very little 
account, becaufe we have never expe- 
rienced the want of them." 



Thus far the French Tranflator's 
Preface ; which containing a very am- 
ple explanation of the plan and fcope 
of the follow^ing work, there is little 
necelTity to offer any thing in addition 
to what he has faid upon that fubjedl. 
It only remains for the Englifh Tranf- 
lator to requeft the indulgence of the 

Public, 



PREFACE. 21 

Public, on account of the deviations 
which he has taken the Uberty to make 
from the original. Many paffages he 
has found himfelf obliged either to omit 
entirely, or to throw into a new form, 
according as the difference of national 
manners andcharadler feemed abfolutely 
to require it. He hopes, however, that 
this liberty has never been ufed unlefs 
under circumftances of unavoidable ne- 
ceffity. For the external form of this 
little work, it is but juft to obferve, 
that no pains have been fpared to em- 
belliih it, and that the addition of 3 a 
handfome cuts cannot fail of rendering 
it at once more fprightly and intelhgible 
to the young reader, for whom it is in- 
tended. In effed, thefe little prints 
ferve admirably to afford the child a juft 
conception of the remarkable paffages 
in a work ^ and it may, perhaps, be 

affirmed. 



22 PREFACE. 

affirmed, with truth, that no parts, eveii 
of the moft interefting flories, make a 
ftronger or more lafling impreffion on 
the memory, than thofe which are the 
fubjedts of the cuts. 

With thefe advantages. It is hoped, 
the New Robinfon Crufoe will find its 
way to the ftudies of the younger clafs 
of both {exes, and afford them at once 
both innocent entertainment and moral 
inilrudion. 



THE 



THE 



NEW ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



FIRST EVENING. 

A GENTLEMAN, of the name of 
Billingfley, refided fome years ago at 
Twickenham, who, having a pretty large 
family, and but a moderate fortune, deter- 
mined to undertake himfelf the care of his 
children's education. He propoled, by this 
plan, on th^ one hand, to avoid the enormous 
expence of keeping them at what are called 
genteel boarding-fchoois, and, on the other, 

to 



24 T H E N E W 

to enjoy the pleafing obfervation of their im- 
provement in learning, fenfe, and good be- 
haviour. To remark, with filent but at- 
tentive eyes^ the gradual advance of his 
children towards the perfe6lion of reafon and 
virtue j to aififl, with his advice and in- 
llruclion, their endeavours to become more 
learned, honeiL, and wife; and to have the 
happy confcioufnefs, that he fhould one 
day be confidered, v;hat all parents ought, 
as the inftrument and caufe of his children's 
eternal welfare -, all this, he thought, would 
be more than a fufficient reward for whatever 
cares and fatigue he fhould undergo in the 
courfe of their education. 

He, therefore, laid down for themi a re- 
gular plan of ftudy, to which he afterwards 
ftridlly adhered. In this was included a 
courfe of reading ; and fome book, that v^'as 
at once both inftrudtive and entertaining, 
afforded them amufement every evening for 
two or three hours before fupper. But, as 
this exercife was meant by their father folely 
to encreafe their fund of knowlege, and 

enlarge 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

enlarge their vinderftancling, in order that 
it might appear rather as a relaxation from 
their clofer iludies, than a labour impofed 
on them^ Mr. BillingQey, in general, un- 
dertook the talk of reading himfelf. The 
following Hiflory of the New Robinfon 
Crufoe was, during fome weeks, the fub- 
jed of their evening's entertainment 5 and 
was thus introduced. 

Mr. and Mrs. Biilingfley, being feated by 
the parlour fire, togerher with Mr. Rofe and 
Mr. Meredith, two intimate friends of the 
family, and all the children, whofe names 
will appear fucceffively in the courfe of the 
llory, being aifembled in their proper 
places, Mr. Biilingfley began his relation 
as follows : 

. Mr. BtUingJley. Well, my dear chil- 
dren, I have a book for your entertainm.ent 
this evening that contains a very extraor-- 
dinary fiery. Some parts of it will make 
your hair fland on end, and others will 
perfedly delight you. 

Vol. I. B George. 



26 T H E N E W 

George, Ah ! but do not let it be too me- 
lancholy, papa. 

Harriet, No, my dear papa, not too 
melancholy ; for then it will make us all cry, 
you know. 

Richard, Hold your tongues \ papa 
knows what to read, I warrant you. 

Mr, Bill, Do not be uneafy, my dears. 
I will take care that there fhali not be any 
thing too tragical in it. 

There lived in the town of Exeter a 
perfon of the name of Crufoe, who follow- 
ed the profeflion of a broker. He had 
three fons, the eldeft of whom, having 
an inclination to ferve in the army, enlifted 
bimfelf as a foldier, went abroad with his 
regiment to Flanders, and was killed at the 
battle of Fontenoy. 

The fecond entered the Univerfity of 
Oxford, and made a confiderable progrefs 
in learning j but purfuing his fludies with 
too much eagernefs, he impaired his health 
beyond all pofTibility of recovering, and 
(Jied of a confumption. 

There 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2/ 

There remained, therefore, but the 
youngell, whofe name was Robinfon. In 
him, as he was now become their or^iy Ton, 
Mr. and Mrs. Crufoe placed all their hopes 
and expeftations. They loved him as the 
apple of their eye, but their love was blind 
and injudicious. 

Geo, What is the meaning of that, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. I will tell you — your mother 
and I love you all, my dear children, as 
you well know 5 but for that very reafon we 
keep you clofe at your bufinefs every day, 
and teach you many things both ufcful and 
agreeable, becaufe we know that to be the 
beft way to make you good and happy. 
But Robinfon's parents did not ad: in the 
fame manner. They fufFered their dear 
child to do whatever he pleafed i and as this 
dear child liked better to play than to work 
or to learn any thing, they let him play al- 
moft the whole day long, by which means he 
learned little or nothing. Now this is whac 
"we call an injudicious love in parents, 

Geo. I underftand now, papa. 

B z Mr. 



2S T H E N E W 

Mr. BilL Robinfon grew up a flout 
tripling before his parents had determined 
what profeflion they fliould give hini. His 
father was defirous that he fhould learn fonae 
trade, but the Ton had not the kali inclina- 
tion that way. He faid he Ihould like bet- 
ter to travel, to fee the world, and beconrre 
acquainted with the various objecls and 
cuftomsthat foreign countries afford. 

In fpeaking thus, .young Cxufoe fhewed 
his ignorance and folly. If he had begun 
by laying in a good flock of. learning, it 
would have been another matter. .But 
Yvhat profit could a raw, ignorant boy, like 
him, gain by feeing foreign countries ? When 
a m.an wifhes to make his v/ay in the world, 
be it in wliat country it will, he ought to be 
provided beforehand with a tolerable (hare 
of knowledge; but. this was what Robinfon 
never once thought of. 

.He was now feventeen years of age. The 
greatefl part of this time he had mifpent in 
fauntering about and playing in the flreets 
o{ Exeter. Every day he was teazing his 

father 



ROBINS ON CRUSOE. 2() 
father for leave to go and travel. But his 
father told him that he did not know his 
own mind, nor what fort of a requeft he was 
making, and therefore would not hear a 
word upon the fubjecl. " My dear child," 
his m.other would fay to him, " ftick to 
your own country^ and never think of ram^ 
bling." ' 

One day — - 

Harriet, Aha ! now it begins. 

Edijo. Plhaw ! hold your tongue.' 

Mr, Bill, One day, when, according to 
cuftbm, he was drolling about the ftreets, he 
met one of his old playfellows, whofe fa- 
ther was captain of a fhip trading to Am- 
fterdam, and who had juft come down from 
Plymouth to fee fome of his relations that 
lived at Exeter. He told Robinfon that he 
was to fet off with his father in a day or 
two for Amfterdam. 

Charlotte, What, papa, by the flage ? 

Henry, No, Charlotte, but in a fhip 5 
for you muft crofs the fea to go to Amifler- 
dam. Well, papa. 

Mr. Bill, He aiked Robinfon if he ihould 
B 3 like 



30 T H E N E W 

like to go with him. " Yes, very well," re- 
plied he, *^ but my parents will not confent 
to it." " Pooh ! " faid the other, "come off 
with me as you are,juft for thefrolick. We 
Ihall be back again in a month or fix weeks; 
and as to your father and mother, you have 
only to let them know where you are gone." 
" But," fays Robinfon, " I have no mo- 
ney in my pocket." " You will not want 
any," replied his companion -, " but if you 
fliould, when we arrive at Amflerdam, Til 
fupply you." 

Young Crufoe hefitated a few moments, 
as if confidering what refolution Lc fhould 
take j at lafr, flapping his companion's 
hand, he cried, '^ Agreed, my boy ! I will 
o;o alonp; with vou : let us fet off this mo- 
ment for Plymouth." At the fame time he 
commifTioned one of his acquaintances to 
let his father know (after the expiration of 
a few hours), that he was only gone to fee^ 
the city of Amilerdam, in Holland, and 
that he fhould be back in a week or two. 

Rich, I do not like this Mr, Robinfon 
Crufoe. 

Edw. 



ROBINSON CRU-SOE. 3I 

Edw. Nor I neither. 

Mr. Rofe. Why fo, Richard ? 

Rich, Becatrle he feems to make nothing 
of leaving his father and mother without 
their perm ifTion. 

Mr. Rofe. You are extremely right, 
Richard J he committed there a very rafh, 
foolifh action, and we fhould pity him for 
his folly. But, thank Heaven, there are 
not many young perfons now fo ignorant as 
not to know their duty towards their pa- 
rents. 

Edw, What ! are there other boys, then^ 
like Robinfon Crufoe ? 

Mr» Rofe, I have not yet found any ; but 
one thing I know for certain, which is, that 
no good can ever come of young people 
who behave like him. 

Rich. Well, let us hear what becomes of 
Robinfon. 

Mr\ Bill, A iliort time after Robinfon 

and the captain's fon were got on board, 

the failors weighed anchor and fet their falls. 

The wind blew frefh, and they cleared out 

B 5 of 



32 THE NEW 

of the harbour, bidding adieu to Plymouth 
for a fhorc while. Young Crufoe was upon 
the deck with his friend, and almoft out of 
his wits with joy that he was at length going 
to begin his travels. 

The evening was fine, and the breeze 
blew fo favourably, that they foon loft fjght 
of the town and harbour of Plymouth. 
They were now on the open fea, and Ro- 
binfon ftared with admiration when he faw 
nothing before him but the fky and the wa- 
ter. By degrees they began to lofe fight of 
land, and as night came on, they could fee 
nothing on that quarter but the Eddiftone 
iighthoufe. This alfo difappeared in a 
ihort time, and from that moment Robinfon 
faw nothing above him but the fky, nor 
before, behind, and all round him, but the 
fea. 

Geo, That muft be a profpe6t ! 

Mr, Mered, It is not impoflible but you 
may fee fuch a one before it be long. 

Geo, Oh ! fhall we go upon the fea ? 

Mr, Mered, If you will be very attentive 

while 



ROBINSON CRtrSOE. 33 
while you are learning geography, fo as to 
know which courfe you mufl take to go 
from one place to another. 

Mr. Bill, Yes, and if by working con- 
ftantly, and being tennperate in your vic- 
tuals, you make your bodies hardy enough 
to bear the fatigue of fuch a voyage, we may,

down the river as far as London, where 
fome of you have never been yet. 

All the Children, 0\\\ Q\i\ 

Mr, BilL I cannot tell but we may take 
a trip to Margate for a few weeks, where 
you will have as wide a profpe6l of the fea 
as Robinfon Crufoe had when he was failing 
out of Plymouth harbour. (Here they all get 
up and run ahout their father, ^hey hang 
on his neckj his armSy and his knees, ex^ 
J>reJ/ing their joy with careJJeSy clapping of 
handsy and'jurnping about,) 

Harriet, Will you let me make one of 
the party ? 

Mrs, Bill, Yes, my dear, ifyou are able 
to go fo far,

Harriet, But it is very far, is not it, pa- 
pa ? Perhaps farther than Richmond, where 
Mr. Compton lives, and another gentle- 
man that has a great houfe and a large gar- 
den — oh! fo large ! a great deal larger than 
our garden. I was all through it, was not 
J, papa ? the day that Charlotte and I were 
gathering cowflips in the meadow. 

Mr. BllL Yes, I remember, and we were 
looking at the folks plowing. 

Harriet. Yes, and we went into a fmith's 
forge that was by the road's fide. 

Mr. Bill. And afterwards up into awind** 
jTiilh ; 

Harriet. Ah, yes, where the wind blew 
off my bonnet. 

Mr, Bill. Which the miller's boy brought 
back to you again. 

Harriet, Thac was a good boy -, was not 
he, papa ? 

- Mr. BilL Yes, he was a good boy for 
being fo obliging as to do us a kindnefs, 
though he had never feen us before. 

Harriet, 



ROBINSON CRirSOE. 3^ 

~ Harriet, However, you gave him fome- 
thing, I fuppofe. 

Mr, Bill, Certainly, my dear, I gave 
him fomething ; for every one likes to re- 
ward thofe that are obliging — But we for- 
getRobinfon Crufoe. We muft make hafle 
to overtake him, or elfe we fhall lofe fight 
of him, for he is going at a furious rate. 

For two days they had conllantly good 
weather, and a favourable wind. The 
third day the iky was darkened with clouds, 
the wind blew with uncommon violence, 
and the air grew every moment darker and 
darker. 

In fhort, it was a dreadful Itorm. At 
one time the lightning flafned as if the ikj 
was on fire ^ then fucceeded a pitchy dark- 
nefs, like that of midnight, with claps of 
thunder which they thought would never 
end. The rain came down in floods, and 
the violence of the wind tolled the fea abouc 
in fuch a m.anner that the waves fwelled and 
rofe mountain high. 

Then it would have been worth while ta 

fee 



3$ THE NEW 

fee how the fhip went fee- fa w. One time a 
large wave carried it, as it were, up to the 
clouds ; another time it dipped down as if 
it was going to the bottom of the deep ; 
then it rolled to one fide and the other, and 
lay down fo flat that at times its very mafts 
feemed to touch the water. 

What a noife was amongft the ropes ! 
what a clattering upon the deck ! The 
failors were obliged, each of them, to hold 
fafl to fomething or other for fear of being 
wafhed overboard. Robinfon Crufoe, who 
had never been accuftomed to all this, grew 
giddy, felt a ficknefs at his ftomach, and 
was fo bad that he ihaughc he fhould have 
vomited to death. They call it fea-fick- 
nefs. 

Ricb. That is what he has gained by 
running away. 

Mr, BilL " Oh ! my poor parents ! my 
poor father and mother !" cried he incef- 
fandyi "they will never fee me more! 
Oh mifcrable fool that I am to have brought 
this affiiftion on them T' 

Crack ! 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 37 

Crack! went fomething on the deck. 
*^ Heaven have mercy on us !** cried the Tail- 
ors, turning as pale as death, and clafping 
their hands together. ** What is the matter V* 
afked Robinfon, who was half-dead with 
affright. 

^^ Ah ! ive are all loft !" anfwered one of 
the feamen 5 *^ the lightning has fhivered 
our mizen-maft to pieces," (that is, the 
hindmoft of the three mafts that are in a 
fliip,) " and the main-maft ftands by fo 
flender a hold that we muft cut it down and 
throw it overboard." 

"We are all loft '."cried out another voice 
from below 3 " the fhip has fprung a leak, 
and there are four feet water in the hold." 

At thefe words Robinfon, who was fitting 
down on the cabin floor, fell backwards 
void of fenfeand motion.' All the reft ran to 
the pumps, in order, if poftible, to keep the 
veflel afloar. At laft, one of the failors came 
and ftiook Robinfon by the fhoulder, aflc- 
ing him if he intended to be the only one 
who would do nothing for the prefervation 

of 



38 THE N E \V 

of the lliip, but lie there ftretched at his 
length while all the reft of the people work- 
ed until they were not able to fiand. 

He tried, therefore, to rife, weak as he 
was, and took his place at one of the 
pumps. In the mean time the captain or- 
dered fome guns to be fired as a fjgnal of 
ditlrefs to other fhips, if there Ihould hap- 
pen to be any within hearing capable of af- 
fifting them. Robinfon, who did rtot know 
the meaning ofthefe (hots, thought the veffer 
was fplitting in pieces, and fainted away 
again. One of the failors, who took his 
place at the pump, pufhed him on one fide 
with his foot, and left him there ftretched 
at full length, imagining that he was dead. 

They pumped with all their ftrength 5 
neverthelefs the water ftill gained upon them 
in the hold, and now they only waited for 
the nioment when the veftei would fmk. 
In order to lighten her, they threw over- 
board every thing that they could pofTlbly 
fpare, as the guns, bales of goods, hogf- 

ficads.

heads, &c. But all that was of no man* 
ner of fervlce. 

However, another fhip had heard their 
fignals of diftrefs, and, as the ftorm began 
about rhis cinae to abate confiderably, ven- 
tured to fend out her boat, in order, if pofli- 
ble, to fave tlie crew. But the boat could not 
come near, the waves running too high. 
At length, Lowevcr, they came near enough 
to throw a rope to the people who were on 
board, by m.eans of which they towed the 
boat clofe under the fhip's flern, and then 
every one who could make ufe of his legs 
eagerly jumped into it. Robinfon, who 
could not fland upon his, was tumbled in 
haftily by fome of the feamen more com- 
pafTionate than the reft. 

They had hardly rowed many minutes, be- 
fore the Ihip, which was ftill pretty near 
themi, funk before their eyes. Happily 
the ftorm was now almoft totally abated, 
otherwife the waves would inevitably have 
fwallowed up the boat, which was then as 
full of people as it could hold. After ma- 

tiy 



4© T H E N E W 

ny dangers it got fafe at length to the fhip, 
where they were all taken in. 

Geo, Ah ! well, I am glad, however, that 
the poor people were not drowned. 

Edw, I was fadly in pain for them. 

Harriet, Well, this will teach mafter 
Robinfon never to be fo naughty again. 

Mrs, Bill. That is jufl my opinion too. 
Let us hope tliat he will be the better for 
this danger. 

Henry, Well, what became of him af- 
ter ? 

Mr. Bill. The fhip that had taken him 
and the reft of the crew in, was bound to 
London. In four days fhe arrived at the 
Nore, and the next day came to anchor in 
the river. 

Charlotte, What is the Nore, papa ? 

Mr, Bill. The Nore is a fmall fandy 
bank at the mouth of the Thames, where 
a vefTel is conftantly ftationed, which hangs 
up two lights every night to be a guide to 
ihips that enter the river. ^ 

They now landed, and happy was dach

ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^t 

one to have thus efcaped the dangers of the 
fea. As to Robinfon, his firft care was to fee 
London, and for this purpofe he fpent a 
day or two in rambling all over the city, 
where he met with fuch a variety of new ob- 
jects as entirely put the remembrance of paft 
dangers out of his head, as well as all 
thoughts of the future. Happening one 
day to meet the captain with whom he had 
fet fail from Plymouth, he received an in- 
vitation to dine with him, which was very 
agreeable to Robinfon, as he had fpent 
what little money he had borrowed from the 
captain's fon, and his pocket now was not 
able to afford him a fingle meal. At din- 
ner the captain afked him what particular 
motive he had for going to Amfterdam, and 
what he intended to have done there. Ro- 
binfon anfwered him frankly, that he had 
nothing in view but his amufement ; that 
he had come off unknown to his father and 
mother, and at prefent did not know whit 
to do with himfelf. 

" Unknown to your father and mother !'* 

cried 



4S T H E N ■ E W 

cried the captain, laying down his knife 
and fork : '^ Good heavens ! why did not f 
know that before ? Believe mey. innpru^ 
dent young man, if I had known fomuch* 
at Plynnoutb, I would not have taken you 
on board of my fliip, if you had offered me. 
a million of money/*' 

Robinfon fat with down-cafl eyes blufh* 
ing for fhame, and unable to anfwer a An- 
gle word. 

The honeft captain continued to reprefent 
to him the folly that he had been guilty of^ 
and told him that he could never be happy 
unlefs he repented of what he had doney 
and obtained forgivenefs of his parents. At 
thefe words Robinfon wept bitrerjy, 

" But what can I do now ?** cried he 
at length, fobbing heavily. " What can you 
do?'* faid the. captain: *^ Return to your 
parents, fall on your knees before them, 
and, like a fenfible and dutiful lad, implore 
their pardon for your imprudence : that is 
what you caa do, and what you ought to 
do." 

Harriets 



R O B t N S O N C R U S O E. 43 

Harriet. Ah, papa, I like this captain 
much y he was a very good man. 

Mr, BilL My de2.r^ he did what every 
one ought to do w^hen he fees his fellow- 
creature fall into an error ; he endeavoured 
to bring this young man back to his duty, 

** Will you take me with you to Ply- 
mouth again?'' faid Robinfon. 

^' Who, I ?" faid the captain: '' Have 
you' forgot, then, that my Ihip is loft? It 
may be a confiderable time before I return 
there in a fhip of my own : but as for you, 
there is not a moment to lofe ^ you ihould 
go aboard of the very firll veiTel that faiU 
for Plymouth, if it were even to-day. 

" But," fays Robinfon, ^' I have no mo-, 
ney." 

" Well," faid the honeft captain, " I 
will lend you a couple of guineas out of the 
little that I have to fpare. Go down to 
the river, and get aboard of fome vefTel that 
is bound for Plymouth, unlefs you rather 
chufe to travel by land. If your repen- 
tance is fmcerc, God will blefs your return/ 

and 



44 T H E N E W 

and make it happier than your outfet has 
been." With thefe words, having made 
an end of dinner, he fhook Robinfon by 
the hand, and wilhed him a good voyage, 
who parted from him with many thanks for 
his kindnefs and good advice. 

Edw, What, is he going back home 
again already ? I thought the ftory was 
only beginning. 

Mrs, BilL Are not you fatlsfied, then, 
my dear Edward, that he ihould go home 
to his parents, and put an end to the forrow 
and diftrefs that they fufFer on his account ? 

Mr, Mered, And are you not pleafed to 
find that he fees his error, and is willing to 
make amends for it ? 

Edw. Yes — that — to be fure. But I 
thought to hear fomething diverting before 
it came to that. 

Mr, BilL Well, he is not returned home 
yet. Let us hear the remaindcr.of his ad- 
ventures. 

While he was walking down towards the 

i-iver, his head was filled with various re- 
flexions.

fledions. *^ What will my father and mo- 
ther fay/* thought he to himfelf, '^ if 1 
go back to them now ? Certainly they will 
punifh me for what I have done. And then 
all my companions, and every one elfe that 
hears of it, what game they will make of 
me for returning fo foon, after feeing only 
two or three flreets of London 1" 

This thought made him Hop fhort. One 
moment he feemed determined not to go 
home yet ; again, he refledled on what the 
captain had told him, that he would never 
be happy unlefs he returned to his parents. 
For a long time he Vv^as at a lofs what to re- 
folve on. At length, however, he went 
down to the river; but there he learned, to 
his great fatisfadtion, that there was not a 
Tingle veflel in the river bound for Ply- 
mouth. The perfon who gave him this in- 
formation was a captain of a fhip in the 
African trade, who was fliortly to fet fail for 
the coaft of Guinea. 

Charlotte. Where is the coaft of Guinea, 
papa ? 

Mr. Bilh 



^,6 T H E N E W 

Mr, BilL Henry can tell you that i. he 
knows where it lies. 

Henry, Don't you remember there is a 
country called Africa? Very well 5 one part 
of the coaft 

Charlotte, Qo2i?i\ What is that ? 

Henry. The land that lies along by the 
fea-fide. Hold, here's Fenning's Geogra- 
phy : look at this little map. All this part 
of Africa that turns down here is called the 
coaft of Guinea. 

Mr. BilL And Englilh fhips fail to this 
coaft in order t© trade there. The perfon 
who fpoke with Robinfon was captain of 
one of thofe ftiip^. 

When he found that the young man had 
fo eager a defire for travelling, and would 
have been forry to return fo foon to Ply- 
mouth, he propofed to him to take a trip to 
the coaft of Guinea. Robinfon at firft was 
ftarded at the idea : but when the captaia 
affured him that the voyage would be ex- 
ceeding pleafant ; that, fo far from cofting 
him any thing, it might turn out a very 

profitable 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

profitable adventure. Robinfon's eyes be- 
gan to fparkle, and his pafTion for travelling 
revived in his bread with fuch force that 
he immediately forgot every advice which 
the honeft Plymouth captain had given 
him, and all the good refolutions that he 
himfelf had taken but fo fhort a time before. 

*^ But/' faid he, after confidering a 
while within him.felf, " I have only two 
guineas in the world j what ufe can I make 
of fo fmall a fum in trading at the place that 
you mention ?" 

*' I will lend you five more," faid the 
captain ; " that will be quite fufficient to 
purchafe you goods, which, if we have but 
tolerable fuccefs, may make your fortune." 

*^ And what fort of goods muft I pur- 
chafe r" faid Robinfon. 

" All forts of toys and playthings," an- 
fwered the captain -, " glafs, beads, knives, 
fciffars, hatchets, ribbands, guns, &c. of 
which the negroes of Africa are fo fond that 
they will give you a hundred tim^es the va- 
lue in gold, ivory, and other things." 

Vol. I. C Robinfon 



40 T H E N E W 

Robinfon was not able to contain himielf 
;forjcy. He forgot, at once, his parents, 
friends, and country. " Captain/* faidhe, 
^^ I am willing to go along with you whea 
■you pleafe." 

" Agreed !'* replied the other, taking 
him by the hand, and thus the n>atter was 
fettled. 

Rich. Well, now it is all over .5 I fhall ne- 
ver have the lead pity any more for fuch a 
blockhead as Pvobinfon, whatever misfor- 
tunes may happen to him. 

-Mr. Bill. No pity, Richard ? 

Rich. No, papa : why is he fuch a fool 
as to forget a fecond time his duty to his 
parents ? Providence, no doubt, will pu« 
nidi him afrefh for it. 

Mr. Bill. And do you think that a man 
deferves no pity who is unfortunate enough 
to forget his parents, and to draw down 
upon, himfelf the chaftifement of Heaven ? 
I grant he is himfelf the caufe of every thing 
tl^t happens to him ; but is not he for that 
very reafon fo much the more unfortunate ? 

Oh! 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

Oh ! my dear child, may Heaven pre- 
ferve you and every one of us from that 
moil terrible of all punilhments, to feel that 
we alone have caufed our own wretchednefs 1 
But whenever we hear of fuch an unfortu- 
nate perfon, we fliould confider that he is 
our brother, our poor deluded brother ; we 
fhould fhed over him tears of compafnon, 
and offer up to Heaven the prayers of bro- 
therly love in his behalf. 

All were filent for a few moments ; after 
which Mr. Billinglley continued in the fol- 
lowing words : 

Robinfon made hafte to lay out his fe- 
ven guineas. He purchafed with them 
fuch articles as the captain had mentioned - 
to him, and had them carried on board. 

After fome days, the wind being favour- 
able, the captain weighed anchor, and they 
fet fail. 

Henry. What courfe fhould they hold to 
arrive at Guinea ? 

Mr. Bill. Here, you have Fenning's

lifter the Coaft of Guinea juft now. How- 
ever, I will fhew you their courfe. You fee, 
from London here they go down the 
Thames, and come into the Downs. Af- 
terwards they fteer Weft, through the Britifti 
Channel, and enter the great Atlantic 
Ocean, in which they continue their courfe 
here clofe by the Canary Iflands, and fo paft 
the Cape Verd Iflands, until at laft they 
land hereabouts on the Coaft of Guinea. 

Henry. But at what particular fpot will 
they land ? 

Mr. Bill, Perhaps there, near Cape Coaft 
Caftle. 

Mrs, Bill Well, now I think it is high 
time for us to fet fail towards the land of 
fupper. What think ye, children ? 

Geo. I am not the leaft hungry, mama. 

Harriet. And I would rather hear the 
ftory too. 

Mr. Bill, To-morrow, my dears, to- 
morrow evening we ftiall have the reft of 
Robinfon*s adventures. At prefent we will 
put him by and prepare for fupper.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5I 



SECOND EVENING. 

THE next evening the whole company 
having taken their places as before, 
Mr. Billingfley continued his flory in the 
following ternns : 

Robinfon*s fecond voyage began as fa- 
vourably as the firft. They had already 
cleared the Channel without any accident, 
and were now in the middle of the Atlantic 
Ocean : here they met with fuch contrary 
winds for feveral days fucceflively, that 
they found themfelves driven a confiderable 
way towards the coafl of America,- 

Here, my dear children, I have brought 
you a large map, which will fhew you 
much better than a fmall one the'courfe 
which the fhip fhould have held, and that 
which the wind obliged her to take. They 
wanted to fleer down all along this way, fo ; 
but becaufe they had a fide wind from that 
quarter, they were driven, in fpite of them- 
felves, towards this part, where you fee 
C 3 America 



52 T H E N E W 

America lie. I will lay it down here on 
the table that we may all caft our eyes upon 
k whenever there is occafion. 

One evening the lleerfman declared that 
he faw a fire at a great diftance, and that he 
heard the firing of guns from the fame quar- 
ter. All hands immediately haftened up- 
on deck, where they both faw the fire and 
could diftinctly hear the report of feveral 
guns. The captain examined his maps, 
and found there was no land on that quar- 
ter within the diftance of a hundred leagues ; 
and they all unanimoufiy concluded that 
•what they faw could be nothing elfe but 
a fhip on fire. 

It was immediately refolved to affift the 
veiTel in diftrefs, and they accordingly (leer- 
ed that way. In a very fhort time their 
conje6bures were verified ; for they beheld 
a large fhip all in flames, and burning with 
the greateft fury. 

The captain inflantly ordered five guns 
jto be fired as a fignal to the poor people 
Yiho were on board the burning (hip, that 

help 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

help was at hand. Scarcely was this order 
put in execution, before they faw, with ter- 
ror and aftonifhnnent, the fhip which had 
been on fire blow up with a dreadful explo- 
fion ; and immediately after every thing 
funk, and the fire was ken no more. It is 
to be obferved, that the flames had, at length, 
reached the powder room, and this was the 
caufe of the fliip*s blowing up. 

Nobody could tell as yet what was be- 
come of the poor people belonging to her. 
There was a poflibility that they might 
have taken to their boats before the vefTel 
blew up ; for which reafon the captain con- 
tinued firing guns the whole night, in or- 
der to inform them on what quarter the fhip 
was that defired to aflift them. He alfo 
ordered all the lanterns to be hung' our, 
that they might have a chance of feeing the 
ihip in the night time. 

At break of day they difcovered, by 

means of their glafles, two boats full of 

people, tofilng -about at the mercy of the 

waves. They could perceive that the 

C 5 wind 



54 T H E N E W 

•wind was agalnft them, but that they rowed 
with all their force towards the (hip. Im- 
mediately the captain ordered the colours 
to be hoifted as a fignal that he faw their 
diftrefs, and was ready to relieve them. At 
the fame time the fhip made all the fail pof- 
fible towards them, and in the fpace of half 
an hour happily came up with them. 

There were fixty in the boats, men, wo- 
men, and children, who were all taken on 
board. It was an afFeding fcene to behold 
the adlions of thefe poor people when they 
faw themfelves fo happily delivered. Some 
fobbed and wept for joy, others lamented 
as if their danger was but juft begun ; fome 
jumped about upon the deck as if they had 
loft their wits, others were wringing their 
hands, and as pale as death j feveral of 
them were laughing like mad people, and 
danced and fliouted for joy j others, on the 
contrary, ftood ftock-ftill as if fpeechlefs 
and infenfible, and couid not utter a fingle 
word. 

Sometimes one or two amongft them fell 

on 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55 

on their knees, lifted up their hands to Hea- 
ven, and with a loud voice returned thanks 
to God, whofe providence had fo miracu- 
loufly faved them from perifhing. 

Some of them again would ftart up, dance 
about like children, tear their cloaths, cry 
and fall down in fainting fits, from which 
they could with difficulty be recovered. 
There was none of the fhip's crew, though 
ever fo hardened, that could help Ibedding 
tears at the fight of thefe poor people's ex- 
travagant behaviour. 

Among them happened to be a young ' 
prieft, who a6led with more firmnefs and ^ 
dignity than any of the reft. As foon as • 
he fet his foot upon the deck, he fell upon 
his face, and feemed to have loft all fcnfe 
and motion. The captain went to aftift - 
him, thix^king that he had fvvooned away ; 
but the clergyman calmly thanked him for . 
his good- nature, and faid, " Ailov/ me firft.i 
to return thanks to my Creator for our de- - 
liverance j I v/ill afterwards endeavour to 
fliew you how lively a fenfe 1 entertain of 
C 6 youf 



56 THE NEW 

your extreme kindnefs to us." Upon this 
the captain politely withdrew. 

The pried remained a few minutes in this 
poflure of humble proftration -, after which, 
rifing chearfully, he went to the captain to 
teftify his gratitude to him for the civility 
that he had fhewn to him and his people. 
"This done, he turned to his companions in 
jnisfortunc, and faid, *^ My dear friends, 
calm the agitation of your minds. The 
Being who is fupremely good, hath vouch- 
fifed to ftretch out a father's hand over you. 
You fhould lift up your hearts to him, and 
thank him without delay for the unexpe6led 
prefer vation of your lives.'* There were 
feveral of them who acSted in conformity to 
his exhortations, and immediately began to 
return thanks to Heaven with fervour and 
devotion. 

After this the prieft gave the captain an 
account who they were, and what had hap- 
pened to them. 

The ihip that was burnt was a large 
FrerK:h merchantman, bound for Quebec 

— 'Here^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 
*— Here, you fee ; this fpot in America — 
The fire broke out in the fail room, and 
burned with fuch rapidity as baffled all 
their endeavours to flop it. They had 
barely time to fire fome guns as fignals of 
their diflrefs, and then to take to their boats, 
uncertain of the deftiny that awaited them. 
The mofl likely profped before them in 
that moment of horror was, that, upon the 
ieaft fwell of thefea, the waves would fwal- 
low up them and their boats, or elfe that 
they muft perifh with hunger, as they had 
been able to fave nothing from the fhip 
on fire but a fmall quantity of bifcuit and 
water, fufficient for a few days. 

Charlotte, What occafion had they to 
carry water with them ? They were on the 
water. 

Mr, Bill. You forget, my dear Char- 
lotte, that the water of the fea is fait and un- 
fit for drinking. 
Charlotte, So, fo ! 

Mr, Bill, In this diflrefsful fituation they

lifli fhlp, and foon after obfcrved die light 
of their lanterns. They pafTed ail that 
long and difmal night between hope and 
fear, exerdng all their Ilrength to get to the 
fhip, but continually driven back by the 
winds and waves. At length, however, the 
long-wifhed-for appearance of day put an 
end to their diftrels. 

Robinfon all this tiaie had been filled with 
the moft dreadful retlc6lions. " Heavens !'* 
laid he to himfelf, " if thefe people, amongft 
whom there are certainly many good and 
devout perfons, have fufFered fo great dif- 
trefs, what, muft not I expe£b, who have 
a6led with fo much ingratitude towards my 
poor parents !" This thought lay heavy at 
his heart. Pale and filent, like one whofe 
confcience is not good, he fat in a corner,- 
with his hands clafped together, and fcarce- 
ly daring even to pray, becaufe he feared 
left God would have no regard to his 
prayers. 

The people who were faved from;tthe 
boats, and were almoll cxhaulled with f^- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

tigue, had now taken fome refrefhnrient, 
when their captain, holding a large purfe 
full of money in his hand, came up to the 
fhip's captain, and told him that whatever 
money they had been a^ble to fave from 
their fliip was in that purfe, which he begged 
him to accept as a flight mark of the gra- 
titude which they all entertained towards 
him for the prefervation of their lives. 

'^ God forbid," anfv/ered the captain, 
" that I fhould accept your offers ! I have 
done no more than humanity required of 
me, and I am convinced that you would 
have done the fame thing if you had been 
in our place, and we in yours. 

In vain did the Frenchman prefs him to 
accept the purfe 3 the captain perfifted in 
refufing it, and begged him to fay no m^ore 
about it. — It vvas now debated where they 
jQiould land the people that had been faved. 
To carry them to Guinea did not appear ad- 
vifeable for two reafons. In the firft place, 
why fhould thofe poor people be obliged 
to make fo long a voyage to a country 

where 



6o T H E N E W 

where they had not the leaft bufinefs in the 
world ? And befides there were not provi- 
fions enough aboard for fo many people to 
hold out until they lliouJd arrive at Guinea. 

At length the captain gcnerouily refolved 
to go a hundred leagues out of his way for 
the fake of thefe poor people, and to carry 
them to Newfoundland, where they might 
have an opportunity of returning to France 
in fome of the fhips employed in the cod 
fifhery. 

Harriet. What is that ? 

Rich, Do not you remember what papa 
has told us about the cod fifh 3 how they 
come down from the North feas to the very 
banks of Newfoundland, where people fifh 
for them and catch them in fuch quantities ? 

Harriet. Oh, yes ! now I recolledt. 

Rich. Look here on the map : this is 
Newfoundland up here, near to America, 
and thofe dotted fpots are the banks where 
they fifh for the cod. 

Mr, Bill. To Newfoundland, therefore, 
they bent their courfe i and as it happened 

to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 01 

to be the middle of the fifhing feafon, they 
found feveral French velTels there, which 
took on board the people of the Ihip that 
had blown up. Their gratitude to the Eng- 
iifh captain was too great to be exprefied in 
words. 

As he had now, therefore, conducted 
thern to fhips of their own nation, he return- 
ed with a favourable wind, in order to con* 
tinue his own voyage to the Coaft of Gui- 
nea. The Ihip cut the waves with the 
fwiftnefs of a bird that wings its airy way 
through the fkies, and in a fhort time they 
had failed fome hundred leagues. This 
was what Robinfon Crufoe liked; things 
never could go too faft for him, as he was 
of a reftlefs, unfettled difpofition. 

Their courfe now was moftly directed to 
the Southward. One day as they were (leer- 
ing in that diredlion, they perceived a large 
fhip making up towards them. Prefently 
after they heard them fire fome guns of 
diftrefs, and could difcern that they had loft 
their foremaft and their bowfprit. 

Edw, 



6r2 T H E N E W 

Edw, Bowfprit ? What is that ?' 
Mr. Bill, Why, fureiy^ you cannot have 
forgot what that is. 

Edw, Ah ! right! It is a little maft that 
does not (land ftraight up like the reft, but 
comes out Hoping, fo, from the fore-part of 
thelliip. 

Mr. Bill. Very vvell. They fteered their 
courfe towards the fhip that was in diftrefs, 
and when they were within hearing of each 
other, the people aboard of her cried out, , 
** For Heaven's fake have compainon on us> 
and fave our lives 1 We are at the laft extre- 
mity, and muft perilh if you do not relieve 
us." 

The captain, therefore, afked them in 
what confided their diftrefs ; when one of 
their number anfwered thus : 

** We are Engliftimen, bound for the 
French I (land of Martinico" — See, children ; 
here it lies in the Weft Indies—" We. 
took in a cargo of coffee there ; and while 
we v;ere lying at anchor, and juft rea- 
dy to depart, our captain and mate, with 

moft 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63 

inoft of the fhip's crew, went aihore one 
day to get in a few things for the fhip's 
ufe. In their abfence, there arofe fo 
violent a ftornn that our cable was broke, 
and we were driven out from the harbour 
into the open fea. The hurricane" 

Geo, What is that, papa ? 

Mr. BilL It is a kind of whirlwind occa* 
fioned by many winds blowing from diffe- 
rent quarters, one againft the other. 

" The hurricane," continued he, " blew 
furioufly three days and three nights. We 
loft our mails, and were driven fome 
hundreds of leagues out to fea. Unfortu- 
nately we are moft of us paiTengers, with 
but one feaman and a boy or two on 
board to work the fhip i fo that for nine 
weeks we have been driven about at the mer- 
cy of the winds and waves : all our provi- 
fions are gone, and many of us are, at this 
moment, dying with hunger." 

Immediately the good captain ordered 
out his boatj took fome provifions, and went 

aboard 



64 T H ]P N E W 

aboard the fliip, accompanied by Robin- 

fon Crufoe. 

They found the crew reduced to the 
mod deplorable condition poflible: they 
all looked as if they were flarved, and many 
of them could hardly fland. But when they 
went into the cabin — Heavens ! what a 
fliocking fpedlacle they beheld ! A mo- 
ther, with her Ion and a young maid fervant, 
were (Iretched on the floor, and, to all ap- 
pearance, ftarved to death. The mother, 
already quite ftifT, was fitting on the ground 
between two chairs tied together, with her 
face leaning againil one of the planks of the 
Ihip's fide. The m.aid fervant was ftretched 
at her length befide her miftrefs, and had 
one of her arms clafped round the foot of 
the table. As to the. young man, he was 
laid upon a bed, and had flill in his mouth 
a piece of a leather glove, of which he had 
gnawed avv'ay the greatefl part. 

Harriet, Oh ! papa, what a Inocking ac- 
count this is ! 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

Mr, Bill, Right — I had forgot that you 
did not wifh to hear any thing melancholy. 
Well, then, I will pafs by this ftory. 

JIL Oh no 1 Oh no ! Dear papa, let us 
have the whole of it now. 

Mr. Bill. As you pleafe. I mull tell 
you then, in the firft place, who thefe poor 
people were that lay ilretchcd in this deplo- 
rable manner. 

They were coming paflengers in this iliip 
from America to England. The whole 
crew faid that they were very worthy peo- 
ple. The mother was fo remarkably fond 
of her fon, that fhe refufed all manner of 
nouriihment purpofely that her fon might 
have fomething to eat, and this excellent 
young man had done the fame thing, in or- 
der to referve every thing for his mother. 
The faithful maid fervant was more con- 
cerned for her mailer and miflrefs than for 
herfelf. 

They were thought to be dead, all 
three, but, on examination, appeared to 
have fome remains of life 5 for, after a few 

drops 



66 THE NEW 

drops of broth had been forced into theii 
mouths, they began, by degrees, to open 
their eyes. But the mother was now too 
weak to fwallow any thing -, and fhe made 
figns that they fhould confine their atten- 
tions to her fon. In efFed, fhe expired a 
few minutes after. 

The other two were brought to them-, 
felves by the force of cordials, and as they . 
were in the flower of their age, the captain, 
by his attentive care, fucceeded in refloring 
them to life. But when the young man 
turned his eyes upon his mother, and faw 
that fhe was dead, the fnock made him fall 
again into a fwoon, from which it was very 
difHcult to recover him. However, they 
were fortunate enough to bring him to his 
fenfes again, and he was, in a fhort time, 
perfectly re-eftablifhed -, as was alfo the fer- 
vant maid. 

The captain furnifhed the (hip in dif- 
trefs with all the provifions that he could 
polTibly fpare : . he ordered his carpenter to 
put up mails for them in the room of thofe 

that 



ROBINSON e R U S E, 6"^ 
that had been broken, and gave the crew 
proper inftru6lions for conveying them- 
felves to the neareftland, which was that of 
the Madeira Iflands. He bent his courfc 
thither alfo, on purpofe to take in more pro- 
vifions. 

One of thele iflands, ydu know, is call- 
ed Madeira, from which the refl: take their 
iiame. 

Henry, Yes, I know it 3 they belong to 
the Portuguefe. 

Rich. From them the fine Madeira wine 
'Comes : does it not ? 

Geo. And the fugar canes. 

Mr. Bill The fame. At this iHand the 
captain cafl anchor ; and Pvobinfon went 
■aihore with him in the afternoon. 

He could never fiifficiently admire the 
beautiful profped which this fertile ifle af- 
fords. As far as his eyes could fee, the 
mountains were all covered with vines. 
How his mouth watered at the fight of the 
delicious grapes that hung on them ! and 
how did he regale himfelfwhen the captain 

paid 



68 T H E N E W 

paid for him that he might have leave to 
eat his fill ! 

They underflood from thofe who were 
in the vineyards, that in making wine they 
did not prefs the grapes here in a wine prefs, 
as they do in other countries. 

Geo, How then ? 

Mr, Bill, They tumble the grapes into a 
large tub, and then tread upon them with 
their feet, or bruife them with their elbows* 

Harriet. Oh fie ! I fhall not like to drink 
Madeira wine for the future. 

Rich, Now I fhould not like to drink it, 
if it were even made with the wine prefs. 

Charlotte, Why ? 

Rich. Ah ! you were not here when pa* 
pa fhewed us that wine is not good for 
young people. If you v/ere to know all the 
harm that it can do them ! 

Charlotte, Is he in earneil, papa ? 

Mr, Bill, Yes, my dear j nothing can be 
more true. Children that drink wine or 
other ftrong liquors often, become weak 
and filly. 

Charlotte* 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

Charlotte, Gracious ! I'll never drink 
wine any more. 

Mr, Bill, You will a6t very wifely, my 
dear. 

As the captain was obliged to flop here 
fome time to repair his fhip which had re- 
ceived a little damage, poor Robinfon, at 
the end of a few days, began to grow tired 
of his fituation. His refllefs temper want- 
ed fome change, and he wifhed to have 
wings that he -might fly all over the world 
in as fhort a time as pofTible. 

Juft at this interval arrived a Portuguefe 
fhip that came from Lifbon, and was bound 
for Brazil, in South America. 

Hetiry (pointhig to the map). Is it not 
this country here, belonging to the Portu- 
guefe, and where fo much gold-duft and pre* 
cious ftones are found ? 

Mr, Bill. The very fame. ' 

Robinfon got acquainted with the cap- 
tain of this fhip, and hearing him talk of 
gold-dufl and precious flones, he would 
have given the world to m.ake a voyage to 

Vol. I. D Brazil,.- 



JO :T H £ NEW 

Brazil^ where he thought he. Ihould fill his 
pockets with diamonds. 

Edw, He did not know, I fuppofe, that 
in that country nobody dares to gather gold- 
duft or precious flones, which are the fole 

.property of the king of Portugal. 

Mr, Bill. And the reafon that he did not 
know was, becaufe when he was young he 
would never learn any thing. 

Finding, therefore, that the Portuguefe 

. captain was difpofed to take him along with 

• him as one of his crew, and that the Eng- 
lilh lliip would be obliged to flop at leafl 
a fortnight longer, he could not refill his 
defire of rainbling. He, therefore, told his 
good friend, the Englifh captain, bluntly, 
that he was going to leave him, and to 

;take a voyage to Brazil. The captain, who 
had learned from Robinfon himfelf, a fhort 
time before, that he was rambling thus about 
the world without the knowledge or confent 
of his parents, was glad to get rid of him. 
He agreed to take Robinfon's venture, 
.which confifled of toys and hardware, for 

the 



ROBINSON- CRUSOE. *j\ 

the money that he had lent him in England, 
and gave him befides all manner of good 
advice. 

Robinfon, therefore, went aboard the 
Portuguefes and now behold him failing 
for Brazil. They palTed pretty near the 
ifland of Teneriff. 

Harriet, Where that high mountain is 
to be feen, called the Peak of TenerifF; 
eh, papa ? 

Rich, Aye, aye, don't interrupt. 

Mr» Bill. It was an admirable prolpe6b, 
even long after fun-fet in the evening, when 
all the fea was covered with gloomy dark- 
nefs, to fee the top of that mountain, one 
of the higheft in the whole world, fninc 
with the rays of the fun as if it had been 
all on fire. 

Some days after they faw another fight upon 
the fea, which was very agreeable. A large 
number of flying fifhes rofe upon the fur- 
face of the water. They gliilened like po- 
lifhed filver, fo that they threw forth a flrong 
light from their bodies, as it were in rays. 
O 2 Charlotte. 



7-2 T H E K E W 

•Charlotte. What, are there fifhes that 
ily ? 

Mr. 5///. Yes, Charlotte ^ and I think, 
en a, certain day, you and I faw one. 

Geo. Ah, yes; that was when we were 
in town laft Whitfuntide : but for all that, 
papa, it had neither feathers nor wings. 

Mr, Bill. But it had a couple of long 
fins, which ferve it as wings when it rifes 
above the furface of the water. 

For feveral days fucceffively the voyage 
was as fine as pofiible; but all of a fudden 
a violent hurricane arofe from the South- 
Eaft. The waves frothed and rofe moun- 
tain high, tofling the vefTel too and fro. 
This dreadful ftorm continued for fix days 
fucceffively, and carried the fhip fo far out 
of her way, that neither the captain nor 
any perfon on board knew where they were. 
Flowever, by their reckoning, they fuppofed 
tjiat they could not be far from the Ca- 
ribbee Iflands. They lie hereabouts. 

The feventh morning, exactly at day- 
break, one of the Tailors threw the whole 

crew 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

crew into a fit of extravagant joy, by crying 
out from the mad head. Land ! 

Mrs. Bill. This call comes very feafon- 
ably, for fupper is almoft ready in the next 
room. To-morrow we fhall hear the reft. 

Geo. O dear mama, only let us hear 
how they landed, and what happened to 
them afterwards. I Ihould be contented 
with a bit of dry bread, if papa would but 
go on. 

Mr. Bill. Well, my dear, as your ma- 
ma only fays that fupper is ahnoft ready, 
perhaps there may be a few minutes to 
fpare. If fhe will indulge you until fup- 
per is quite ready, I am content. 

Mrs, Bill. I have no obje6lion : fo that 
you may go on until I call you, which 
fhall be when every thing is perfectly 
ready. 

All the children. Oh ! that will do. That 
is charming ! 

Mr. Bill. To proceed, therefore, with 
my ftory : 

The whole crew haftened upon deck to 
D 3 fee 



74 T H E N E V/ 

fee what land this was j but In the very 
moment their joy was changed into terror 
and confternation : the Ihip ilruck, and 
all thofe who were upon the deck received 
fo violent a ihock as aliiioll to throw them 
backwards. 

Rich, What was the niatter ? 

Mr. Bill. The fhip had run upon a fand 
bank, and fluck fail as fuddenly as if it 
had been nailed to the fpot. Then the 
foaming waves dafhed over the deck with 
fuch violence, that they were all obliged to 
take refuge in the cabin and between decks, 
for fear of being carried overboard. 

Nothing was now to be heard amongft the 
crew but lamentable cries, groans, and fighs, 
that would have foftened a heart of ftone. 
Some were praying, others wept aloud; 
fome tore their hair like people in defpair, 
others were half dead, and ftupidly infenfi- 
ble. Amongft this laft clafs was Robinfon 
Crufoe, who was literally more dead than 
alive. 

Suddenly fome one cried out that the 

fhip 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

fhip had fplit. Thefe dreadful tidings 
brought them all to new life. They ran 
haftily upon deck, lowered the boat as fail 
as poffible, and all jumped into it with the 
mofV precipitate hade. 

But there were now fo many people in 
the boat, that its fides were fcarcely four 
inches above the water. The land was ftill 
far off, . and the ilorm fo violent, that 
every one thought it impoflible to reach the 
fhore. Neverthelefs, they exerted their 
whole ftrength in rowing, and fortunately 
the wind drove them towards land. All at 
once they beheld a wave, mountain high, . 
rolling towards the boat. 

At this dreadful fight the whole crew fat 
motionlefs, and dropped their oars. The huge 
wave ftrikes the boat, overfets it, and ail are 
at once fwallowed up in the enraged deep ! 

Here Mr. Billinglley made a flop y the 
whole company remained filent, and many 
of them could not help fighing with com- 
paffion for the fate of the poor feamen. At 
length Mrs, Biliingfley arriving with the 
D 4 news 



76 T H E N E W 

news that fupper was ready, pvt an end to 
theie melancholy ideas. 



THIRD EVENING, 

^EQRGE. Dear papa, is poor Robinfon 
. Crufoe loft for good ? Is he dead ? 
Mr, BilL We left him laft night in the 
moft imminent danger of lofing his life, 
the boat being overfet. 

Robinfon was fwallowed up in the fea 
along with the reft of the Ihip's company ; 
but the fame wave, that dreadful wave, 
which had buried him in the deep, at^ its 
return drew him along with it, and dafhed 
him towards the Ihore. He was thrown 
with fuch violence upon a piece of a rock, 
that the pain occafioned by the jolt roufed 
him from the ftate of almoft infenfibility 
that he was in before. He opened his eyes, 

and 




Ds 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

and feeing himfdf, contrary to all exneda- 
tion, upon dry ground^ he exerted the lafl: 
efforts of his ftrength to gain the top of the 
beach. 

He reached it at length, but the mo- 
ment that he arrived at this fpot of fafety 
he fainted away with fatigue, and rennained 
a long time wirhout fenfe or motion. 

When he recovered, he opened his 
eyes and locked round. Heavens, what 
a profped ! The fhip, the boat, his com- 
panions, all loft ! There was nothing 
to be feen but a few broken planks, which 
the waves drove towards the fhore. He 
alone was faved out of the whole fhip's 
company. 

Trembling at once with fear and joy, he 
fell upon his knees, lifted up his hands to- 
wards Heaven, and, while he fhed a flood of 
tears, returned thanks aloud to the Ma- 
ker of Heaven and Earth for his miraculous 
prefervation* 

Rich, But. papa, why did God Almighry 
D 6 ikve 



78 T H E N E W 

fave Robinfon Crufoe alone, and fuffer 
the reft to perifh ? 

Mr. Bill. My dear Richard, are you al- 
ways able to difcover the reafons why we 
who are fo much older than you, and who 
love you tenderly, ad; towards you in this 
manner or that ? 

Rich. No. 

Mr. Bill. Lately, for inftance, when the 
day was fo fine, and we had all fo great a 
fancy to go on a nutting party, what did I 
do? 

Rich. I have not forgot it. Poor Ed- 
ward was obliged to fcay at home and keep 
houfe, and the reft of us were forced to go 
to Richmond, and not, on the nutting party. 

Mr. Bill. But why was I fo cruel to 
poor Edward, not to let him go with us ? 

Edw. Ah, 1 know the reafon of that. 
James came prefently after, and took me 
to Lady Caftleton's. Frederick, my old 
playfellow, wasjuft come home fromfchool> 
and begged his mima to fend for me. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

A/r. Bill. And was not that better than 
to go a nutting ? 

Edw, Oh yes, a hundred tinnes. 

Mr, Bill. I had lent word before to Lady 
Caftleton, that you Ihould go and lee her 
fon, as fhe requefted -, and therefore it was 
that 1 ordered you to flay at home. And, 
Richard, what did you meet at Richmond? 

Rich. I met you there, papa, and my 
mama. You were there before me, 

Mr, Bill, That too I knew i and, there^ 
fore, I made you for thvit time go to Rich- 
mond, and not on the nutting party. My 
intention in all this never once entered your 
heads, for you did not know my reafons. 
But why did not 1 tell you thefe reafons ? 

Rich, That you might afford us an un- 
expedled pleafure. 

Mr. Bill. Juft fo. Well, my dear chil- 
dren, do you not think that our heavenly 
Father loves his children, that is to fay, all 
mankind, as niuch as we love you ? 

Geo, Certainly, and m^ore. 
Mr, BilL And have you not learnt lorg 

ago. 



So T H E N E W 

ago, that God knows all things better than 
we poor mortals do, whofe knowledge is fo 
contracted, and who can fo feldom tell what 
is really for our own advantage. 

Rich, Yes ; I believe it. God has a 
knowledge that is without bounds, and> 
therefore, knows every thing that wall come 
to pafs I a knowledge that we have no 
idea of. 

Mr, Bill. Since, therefore, God loves all 
mankind as his children, and is at the fam.e 
time fo wife that he alone knows what is 
really ufeful for us, it is impofiible but he 
fhould do what is beft for our intereft. 

Geo. Without doubt, and fo he does con- 
tinually. 

Mr. Bilh But are we always able to dif- 
cover the reafbns why God doth any a6lion 
that affeds us in one particular manner ra- 
ther than in another ? 

Rich, To difcover them^we fhould have 
as much knowledge and wlidom as God 
himfelf, 

Mr, Bill Well^ my dear Richard, do 

you 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8l 

you wlfh now to repeat the queftion that 
you afked me juft now ? 

Rich, What queftion ? 

Mr. Bill. Why the Supreme Difpofer of 
things faved only Robinlbn Crulbe, and fuf- 
fered the reft to periih ? 
^Rich. No. 

Mr. Bill. Why not ? 

Rich. Becaufe I fee now that it was an 
unreafonable queftion. 

Mr, Bill. Unreafonable ! How ? 

Rich. Becaufe our Maker knows very 
well why he does any adion, and we are 
not capable of knowing it. 

Mr. Bill. The Ruler of the Univerfe had 
therefore reafons which were wife, excel- 
lent, and worthy of himfelf, for fufrering 
the whole crew to perifh, and faving only 
the life of Robinfon Cruloe. But thefe 
reafons are infcrutable to us. We may, in- 
deed, carry our conjeclures to a certain 
length, but we ought never to flatter our- 
feives that we have hit upon the truth. 
For inftance, infinite wifdom might forefee 

that 



82 T H E N E \\\ 

that a longer life would be more hurtful 
than advantageous to thofe whom he fuf- 
fered to perilh : they might fall into great 
diftreiTes, or even become wicked : for that 
reafonj perhaps, he removed them from 
this world, and condudled their immortal 
fouls to a place where they are happier thnn 
here. As for Robinfon Crufoe, probably 
his life was preferved to the end that af- 
fli6iion might be a fchool of wifdom to 
him ; for God, being a kind father, all 
wife and all juft, fends adverfity to turn the 
hearts of men, when they are blindly infen- 
fible to his goodnefs and fupport. 

Keep this in remembrance, my dear 
child, through the courfe of your life. 
You may meet wich accidents and reverfes 
in which you cannot perceive the defign of 
Providence. Then, inilead of raihly en- 
deavouring to r^afon or explain the feemdng 
inconfiitency, fay to yourfelf, *' God knows 
better than I what is for my good j I will, 
therefore, fufrer with chearfulnefs this mif- 
fortune v/hich he fends m.e as a trial. I am 

con- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

convinced that his difpen fat ions of good 
and evil arc ever intended to render us better 
than we are ; I, for my part, will therefore 
labour to become fo, and certainly God 
will blefs and reward my endeavours." 

Henry, Did Robinfon think fo upon that 
occafion ? * 

Mr, Bill, Yes, then when he had been 
in fo great danger of perifhing, and faw 
himfelf cut off from all the world, then he 
felt fincerely how unjuil and blameable his 
condu61: had been s then he prayed to Hea- 
ven, on his knees, for pardon -, and then he 
took the ftedfaft refolution of amending his 
life, and of never doing any adion con- 
trary to the warning of his confcience, 

Edw. But what did he do after that ? 

Mr. Bill. When the joy that he felt on 
his happy deliverance had a little fubfided, 
he began to refle6l on his fituation. He 
looked about him, but could fee nothing 
except trees and thickets ; he could not 
perceive, on any fide, the leaft mark that 
the country was inhabited.

This was a dreadful neceflTity impofed 
upon him ; to live all alonj in a ftrange 
country ! But hisanxiety was (liil more dread- 
fully increafed when this reile<ftion occurred 
to hina, What, if there Ibould be wild beafis 
or ravages here, fo that I fhould not be able 
to live a nnonnent in fafety ! 

Ojarlotte, What are favages, papa? 

Rich, Savages are wild nnen. Have 
you never heard talk of them;, Charlotte ? 
In countries, a great, great way off from 
this, there are men nearly as wild as beads. 

Geo, That go almoft naked — What do 
you think of that ? 

Henry, Aye, and know fcarce any thing : 
in the world. They cannot build them- - 
felves houfcs, nor make gardens, nor fow 
and plant, as we do, . 

Harriet, And they eat raw meat and ra^r ' 
fifh. I heard my papa tell of them — Did • 
not you, papa ? - 

Rich. And would you think it? Thcfc 
poor creatures are entirely ignorant of their 

Maimer, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

Maker, becaufe they never had any perfon 
to inftriidl them. 

Henry. It is for that reafon too that they 
are fo barbarous. You would hardly be- 
lieve that fome of them eat human flelh. 

Charlotte, Oh ! what wicked men ! 

Mr, Bill, What poor unhappy men ! 
you (hould fay. Alas ! thefe poor people are 
fufficlently to be pitied, that they have been 
brought up in this ignorance, and live like 
brutes, 

Charlotte. Do they ever come here ? 

Mr, Bill. No : the countries where thefe 
unfortunate people live are fo far off, that 
they never come here. Their number alfo 
grows lefs everyday, becaufe other civilized 
men, who come amongft them, endeavour 
to inftrudl: and civilize them, 

Henry, Were there, then, any of thofe fa-* 
vages in the country where Robinfon Cru- 
foe was thrown by the ftorm ? 

Mr, Bill. That he could not tell him- 
felf as yet. But having formerly heard that 
there were favages in the iflands in this part 

of 



86 T H E N E W 

of the world, he thought it very pofTiblc 
that there might be feme on the particular 
fpot where he now was ; and this thought 
raifed fuch an apprehenfion of danger in his 
mind, that every bene of his. body fhook for 
fear. 

Geo. I do not doubt it. It would be no 
very pleafant matter to meet v/ith fa, ages. . 

Mr. BilL Fear, at firll, rendered him mo- 
tionlefs j he did not dare toiVir ; the leafl noife 
terrified him j his heart was frozen : but a 
burning third forced him at length from this 
fearful ftate of inacfbion, and fent him up and 
down in fearch of fame brook or fpring to 
quench his thirfl. Luckily he found a 
brook of pure and clear water where he 
might refrefh himfelf to his utmoft wifh. 
Oh ! what a delicious treafure for a man 
who was parched up with thirfl ! 

Robinfon returned thanks to God for it, 
hoping, at the fame time, that he would 
alfo vouch fafe him food. " He who feeds 
the fowls of the air,''faid he, *^ will not fufFer 
rae toperifliwith hunger." 

Indeed^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

Indeedj hunger was not very prefTing on 
him at this time; fear and anxiety had ta- 
ken away his appetite. He longed for red 
more than any thing elfe. His pain and 
vexation of mind had fo overpowered, him 
that he cou-d fcarce (land upon his legs. 

However, the queftion was. Where mud he 
pafs the nigiit ? On the ground, under the 
open air ? There he would be expofed to 
favages or wild beads that would devour 
him. Hcufe, or cabin, or cave, he faw no 
flgns of. He knew not what to do ; his 
didrefs brought tears into his eyes ; he cried 
heartily. At length he refolved to imitate 
the birds, and like them to feek a retreat in 
fome tree. Prefently he difcovered one, the 
boughs of which were lb thick and fo clofely 
interwoven, that he could fit amongft them, 
and even lay himfelf at his length very con- 
veniently. He climbed up this tree, offer- 
ed up an earned prayer to his Maker, then 
fetded himfelf, and fell afleep in a mo- 
nnent. 

While he flept, his heated imagination 

reprefented 



88 T H E N E W 

reprefented to him afrefti the tranfa6lIons 
of the preceding day. Difturbed with tu- 
multuous dreams, he fancied he flill faw 
the waves fwelling round him, and the fhip 
finking. The cries of the feamcn ftill 
founded in his ears. After this, he ima- 
gined himfelftranfported into the prefence 
of his parents : they appeared overwhelmed 
with forrow and diftrefs for the lofs of their 
beloved fon : they fighed, wept, lifted 
up their hands to Heaven, and were utterly 
dellitute of comfort. A cold fweat broke 
out all over his body : he cried aloud, " I 
am not loft, my dear parents; I am reftored 
to you once more :" and with thefe words, 
making a motion in his fleep as if to em- 
brace his parents, he loft his feat amongft 
the branches, and fell down out of the tree- 
Harriet, Oh poor Robinfon ! 
Ceo. I fuppofe he is killed now, 
Mr, BiU. Fortunately for him, he had not 
fixed himfelf far up in the tree ; and the 
grafs was fo high upon the ground that his 
fall was not very fevere. In efFe(5l, the 
flight pain which it occafioned him he 

hardly 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

hardly felt, in comparifon to the anguifh 
that he had iuffered in the conflids of his 
dream, and vvMch ftill agitated his whole 
body. He, therefore, clinnbed up once more 
into the tree, and lay there quietly until 
fun -rife. 

He then began earneftly to confider how 
he fliould procure himfelf food. He had 
no fort of viduals fuch as we ufe in this 
part of the world, neither bread, nor meat, 
nor vegetables, nor milk i and, had he even 
■been mailer of a joint of meat, he had 
neither fire, nor fpit to road it on, nor pot 
to boil it in. All the trees that he had 
feen hitherto were logwood-trees, which 
never bear any fruit. 

Rich. What fort of trees are they, pa- 
pa ? 

Mr, Bill. Thefe are trees the woed of 
which is of confidcrable ufe in dying. They 
grow in fome countries of South America, 
and much of the logwood is brought to 
Europe. When it is boiled, the water 

turns 



90 T H E N E W 

turns of a reddifh black colour, and dyers 

make life of it to give a fhade to other co* 

lours. 

But to return to Roblnfon Crufoe. 

Still uncertain what he Ihould do, he 
came down from the tree. As he had eaten 
nothing the day before, hunger began to 
be exceedingly troublefome to him. He 
rambled about for feveral miles, but found 
nothing, except grafs, and trees that bore no 
fruit. 

It was impoffible now to add to his diftrefs : 
*' Muft I, then, perifh with hunger at laft T' 
cried he, fot)bing and looking up towards 
Heaven. However, neceflity reanimated 
him with frefh ftrength to go and fearch 
carefully along the fhore for fomething eat- 
able. 

But in vain: nothing but logwood- 
trees and Indian willow j nothing but grafs 
and fand. At length, fatigued, weakened, 
and exhaufted, he threw himfelf down with 
his face to the ground, burft into tears, and 

wifhed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9I 

wiflied that he had perilhed in the waves of 
the lea rather than be preferved only to die 
a miferable death by hunger. 

He thought of nothing, therefore, now 
but of waiting in this forlorn fituation for 
the flow and dreadful approach of death ; 
when^ turning by chance, he favv a cormo- 
rant devouring a fifh that he had taken. 
Immediately he recolleded that he had. 
fomewhere read the following words : 

The Lord, who feeds with bounteous hand 

The feathered tenants of the air, 
^Vill furely over man expand 

The wings of his paternal care. 

He then reproached himfelf with having 
put fo little trufl in Divine Providence ; and, 
rifing haftily, he determined to walk as far 
as ever his ftrength would permit him. He 
fhaped his courfe, therefore, along the iliore, 
and looked narrowly about to difcover, if 
pofTible, fomething that might ferve him for 
food. 

At length he perceived a number of oyfcer 
/hells lying on the fhore. He ran eagerly 

Vol, I, E to- 



g2 THE NEW 

towards the fpot where they were, and care- 
fully examined all round it, hoping to find 
^oyfters thereabouts. He did find fome, and 
his joy was inexpreflible. 

Ricb» Are there oyflers on land then ? 

Mr, Bill, Why no, not properly. On 
the contrary, they belong to the fea and live 
in it. There they fallen themfelves to 
j-Gcks, one upon another, in immenfe quan- 
tities. Such a heap of them is called a bed 
of oyflers. Now, the waves, in dafhing 
againfl this, loofens feveral of the oyflers, 
and the tide carries them towards the fhore. 
Afterwards, when the tide ebbs, and it is low 
water, thefe oyflers are left on the beach, 
where it is then dry. 

Charlotte, You fay when the tide ebbs, 
papa, what is that ? 

Harriet, What, don't you know that ? It 
is v;hen the water that was fo high before, 
runs back, and grows quite fhallow. 

Charlotte, What water ? 

Harriet, Why, the fea water, or a river 
like our Thames, where the tide comes up. 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^J 

Mr. Mered, Charlotte, make your bro- 
ther Richard explain that to you. He will 
be able to give you a clear idea of it. 

Rich. Who, I ? Well, I will do my 
beft. Have you never obferved that the 
water of the Thames rifes fometimes pretty 
high at the bottom of our garden ; and then, 
after a while, falls back and leaves the 
ground dry ; fo that one can walk where it 
was but a little time before covered with 
water. 

• Charlotte, Oh ! yes, now I remember to 
have feen it. 

Rich, Well, when the water rifes in that 
manner, it is called the tide, or the flowing 
of the tide ; and when it falls back and leaves 
the ground dry, it is called the ebb. Thus 
we fay the tide ebbs and flows. 

Mr, Bill, Befldes this, you mufl: know, 
my dear Charlotte, that, in the courfe of 
four and twenty hours, the water of the fea 
rifes thus twice, and falls twice. It conti* 
nues to rife for a little more than fix hours, 
and then to fink "for a little more than ^ix 
E 2 hours. 



94- THE NEW 

hours. The hours during which it rifesy are 
called die time of theiiow, and the hours 
during which it falls, are called the tinae of 
die ebb. Do you underftand it now,? 

Charlotte. Yes 3 but why does the fea al- 
ways rife fo ? 

Geo, I think I have heard the reafon. It 
is faid, the moon attradls the waters in fuch 
a manner, that they are obliged to rife. 

Edw, Oh ! we have often heard that. 'Let 
papa go on. 

Mr, BilL Another rime, , Charlotte, I 
.will tell you more upon this fubje^Sb. 

Robinfon was almoil out of his wits for 
joy at having found fomething to appeafe 
his raging hunger. The oyftcrs that he 
found did not, it is true, ferve to fill his 
belly ', but he was fatisfied with having 
found fomething which barely made him for- 
get his hunger, as it were. 

His greateft uneafinefs was next to know 
where he fhould dwell for the future, to be 
free from all dread of favages and wild beads , 
His firft bed had been fo inconvenient, that 

be 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

he could not think of his condition without 
fhuddering, if he fhould be obliged to pafs 
all his nights in the fame manner. 

Geo. Oh ! I know very well what I would 
have done. 

. Mr. Bill. Well, what would you have 
done ? Inform us. 
^'Geo. In the firft place, I would have 
built a houfe, with walls as thick as that, 
and with iron gates— fo (Irong ! — And then 
I would have made a ditch all round with a 
drawbridge, ^nd this drawbridge I would 
haVc lifted up every night, and then the fa- 
vages nniill be pretty cunning if they could 
have done me any harm while I was afleep, 

Mr. Bill. Plere is fine talking! It is a pity 
that you had not been there. You would 
have been able to give poor Robinfon ex- 
cellent advii'e. — But — anfwer me one thing 
—Have you ever carefully obferved how car- 
penters and'-mafons go about building a 
houfe ? 

Geo. Oh 1 yesj- many a time. The m^a- 

foil begins with preparing the lime and 

Ii 3 mixing 



g6 T H E N E W 

mixing fand with it. Then he lays one 
flone upon another, and with his trowel 
puts mortar between them to keep them 
firmly together. Next the carpenters, with 
their hatchets, cut out the rafters and place 
them carefully. Then, by means of a 
pully, they raife the beams to the height 
pf the v/ali and join them. Afterwards 
they fav/ the boards for the floors, and m.ake 
laths, which they nail to the rafters in order 
to place the tiles. And then 

Mr. BilL I fee you have taken particu- 
lar notice how they go about building a 
houfe. But then a mafon makes ufe of 
lime, and a trowel, and bricks j or elfe 
flones, which mufl: firil be cut into form : 
and carpenters have occafion for hatchets, 
and faws, and chilTels, and nails, ^nd ham- 
mers. Where would you have found all 
thefe, if you had been in Robinfon's place ? 

Geo* Why — really I don*t ^now. 

Mr, BilL Neither did Robinfon, and for 
that reafon he was obligecj to give up the 
fchenae of building a real l?.oufe. He had 

not 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

not a fingle tool in the world: nothing 
but his two hands, and with thefe alone peo- 
ple do not build fuch houfes as we live in. 

Edw. Why, then, he had only to make 
himfelf a litde hut with the branches that 
he could have plucked from the trees. 

Air. Bill. And could a little hut, made of 
branches, have defended him from ferpents, 
wolves, tigers, panthers, lions, and other 
fierce beafts of prey? 

Rkb. Ah! poor Robinfon, how will you 
manage in this diftrefsful fituation ? 

Edw. Could he fhoot ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes^ if he had only a gun, with 
powder and ball; but once more I tell 
you, the poor lad had nothing — abfolutely 
nothing but his two hands to depend on. 

When he viewed his fituation, and fa w 
that all refources failed him, he fell again 
into his former defpondency. " To what 
purpofe," faid he within himfelf, '' have I 
hitherto efcaped periihing with hunger, fince, 
perhaps, this very night wild beafts will tear 
me to pieces ?" 

E4 He 



98 T H E N E W 

He even fancied (fuch is the force of the 
imagination) that a furious tiger was before 
him;, with its dreadful jaws open and ready- 
to devour him. Thinkino; that the tiger 

D D 

had him already by the throat, he cried out, 
" Oh ! my poor father and mother," and fell 
to the ground half dead. 

After having lain there fome time in an 
agony of grief and defpair, he recolle6i:ed a 
hymn which he had heard his excellent mo- 
ther fometimes fing, when flie had any pref- 
fure of afflidion on her mind, it began 
thus : 

He who beneath Heaven's guardian wing 

Hath wifely fixt his place, ■ 
May to his foul thus freely fing. 

When forrowo come apace : 

In God's eternal Providence 

My hope redemption fees ; 
Bleft with fo pow'rful a defence. 

My foul, be thou at eafe. 

The refieftions contained in thefe words 
llrengthenedjhim confiderabiy. Two or 
three times he repeated thefe beautiful lines 

to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

tohimfelfwith much devotion j after which 
he exerted his (Irength to rife, and went up- 
on another fearch, endeavouring to find fome 
cave that might ferve him as a fafe retreat. 

But in vvhat part of the world was he ? 
In South America, or elfewhere ? Was he 
upon an ifland or a continent ? This was 
more than he could tell as yet himfelfi but 
he faw a pretty high hill at a diftance, and 
he walked towards it. 

As he went along, he made this forrovv- 
ful difcovery, that the whole country pro- 
ducednothing but grafs and trees which bore 
no fruit. It is eafy to imagine vvhat gloomy 
ideas a fight like this infpired him with. 

He climbed up, with fome difficulty, to 
the top of the hill, which was pretty high, 
and from which he could fee all round liim 
to the diftance of feveral leagues. To his 
great mortification, he perceived that he was 
really in an ifland, within fight of v/hich 
there appeared no other land, except two or 
three fmall i Hands that rofe out of the fea at 
the diftance of a few leagues. 

E 5 *^ Poor 



lOO THE NEW 

" Poor, unhappy wretch that I am !*' 
cried he, lifting flowly his trembling hands 
towards Heaven : " I am, then, feparated, 
cut off from all men, and have no hopes of 
being ever delivered from this favage place. 
Oh ! my poor afflidted parents, I fhall, then, 
never fee you more ! I fhall never be able to 
afk you forgivenefs for my folly 1 Never 
Ihall ^ hear the fweet voice of a friend, of a

he. '' Oh Lord, thou art jufl: in all thy ways ! 
I fhould but deceive myfelf were 1 to com- 
plain. It is I myfelr that have made my lot 
fo miferable.'* 

In this mournful filence he continued on 
the ipot, with his eyes fixed, as it were, to 
the ground. " Cut off from God and man!" 
was the only reflection that pofTefTed his 
his mind. At length, however, thoughts 
more rational and confoling came to his 
relief. He threw himfelf upon his knees, 
lifted up his heart to Heaven, promifed to 
be patient and refigned to his diflrefTes, and 
prayed for ftrength to fupport them. 

Harriets 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. lOI 

Harriet. It was a good thing, however, 
that Robinibn could fay his prayers in the 
time ot diflrefs. 

Mr, Bill. Certainly it was happy for him. 
What would have become of him, then, if he 
had not known that God is the Father of 
all mankind j that he is fupremely good, 
almighty, and omniprefent ! He would 
have funk under his terror and deipair, if he 
had not formerly been taught thefe great 
and comfortable truths. But the idea of 
his heavenly Father's goodnefs gave him 
conftantly frefh courage and confolation, 
whenever his diftrefics wer^ upon the point 
of overpowering his refolution. 

He now found himfelf much ftrengthen- 
cd, and began to travel round the hill. All 
his fearch was, for a long time, ufelefs : he 
could find no place where he might be in 
fafety. At length, he came to a little hill, 
vhich, in front, was as fteep as a w^all. In 
examining this fpot attentively, he found sl 
place thatfeem.ed to be hollowed in under the 
tiilj wkh a pretty narrov/ entrance to it»

J02 THE NEW 

If he had had a pickaxe, a crow, and 
other rools, it would have been an eaf\ mar- 
ter to hollovV out a complete dwelling under 
the rock, which was partly done bv nature ; 
but he had none of thefe tools. The quef- 
tion was, then, how he fhould fupply the 
ivant of them. 

After puzzling his head a long time, he 
began to reflect in this rr.anner : *' Some 
*' of the trees that I lee here are like the 
willows of niy country, which are eafily 
Iranfplanted. I will pluck up a number of 
thefe young trees, and here, before this h(>le, 
I will plant them clofe together, fo that they 
may form a fort of wall. When they grow 
up. pretty high, I ihall be able to fleep 
within this enclofure as fafely as if I was in 
a houfe ; for behind, ihe fleep wall of this 
rock will fecure me^ and in front, as well as 
on both fides, the ciofe row of trees will 
ktep off all danger." 

This happy thought pleafed him very 
iTiUch, and he immediately fet about putting 
it in execution. His joy was flill greater 

whea 



ROBINSON GRUSOE. lOj 

when he faw, not far from that fJDot, a beau- 
tiful and clear fpring bubbling out from the 
fuie of the hill. He haftened to quench his 
thirft at it, being extremely dry, as he hid 
run about a good deal during the hotted 
time of the day. 

Geo. Was it fo very warm, then, In the 
ifland ? 

Air. Bill. Yes, you may eafily imagine 
that it was warm. Look here, (pointing to 
the map,) this is the coall of South Ame- 
rica^ near which, probably, was fituated the 
ifland on which Robinfon was cafl away. 
- Nowj you fee, this part is not far froni the 
equinoctial line, wht-re the fun is fometimes 
diredtly over people's heads. It is, there- 
fore, natural to fuppofe that all that quarter 
muft be extremely hot, 

Robinfon now fer about plucking up out 
of the ground, with his hands, fome of the 
young trees that I mentioned before, which he 
eifedled with a great deal of trouble, and car- 
ried them to the place that he had deftined for 
bis dwelling. Here again he was obliged to 

fcratch 



I04 T H E N E W 

fcratch a hole in the ground for each of his 
trees, and as this work went on but very 
flowly, the day clofed by the time that he 
had fixed five or fix of them. 

After he had finifhed his w^ork, hunger 
obliged him to walk down towards the fhore 
in order to fearch for oyflers ; but, unfor- 
tunately, . the tide was up^ fo that he found 
none, and was forced for this time to go to 
bed fupperlefs. But where was his bed ?- — 
He determined, until he could finifh for 
himfelf a complete and fecure habitation, to 
lie every night in the tree in which he had 
lain the lafl: night. 

But, that he might not be expofed to the 
fame accident as had then difturbed him, he 
took his garters, tied them round his body, 
and faftened himfelf tightly to the branches 
on which he lay; and then, recommending, 
himfelf to his Creator, he fell aileep. 

Rich, That was wifely done of him to tie 
himleif fo.

It is to this intent that our Creator hath 
formed us, and this earth that we inhabit, in 
fuch a manner, that we have different wants, 
which we cannot fatisfy unlefs by the ma- 
nifold efforts of invention. If ever we are 
mafters of good fenfe and an adtive under- 
ftanding, it is to thefe wants that we are in- 
debted for them : for if larks fell down out, 
of the air into our mouths ready roafled ; 
if houfes, beds, cloaths, viduals, and every 
thing clfe neceffary for the prefervation and 
comfort of our lives, grew up of their own 
accord out of the ground or on the tops of 
trees, quite ready and prepared to our band, 
certainly we fhould do nothing elfe but eat, 
drink, and ileep, and be as flupid as brutes 
as long as we lived.

FOURTH EVENING. 

JIJR' Bill, Well, my dears, where did 
we leave Robinfon Crufoe lafl night ? 

Rich. We left him like a bird perched in 
a tree to take his night's reft. 

Mr. Bill. Very well. To proceed, then, 
with his ixory : Every thing v;ent on that 
night as well as pofiible ; he had no fall, and 
Hept foundly till morning. 

At break of day, the firft thing that he 
did was to fet off towards the fliore to look 
for oyflers^ intending afterwards to return to 
his work. He happened this time to go 
another way, and, as he walked along, was 
overjoyed to find a tree which bore large fruit. 
It is true, he did not as yet know what they 
might be ; but he hoped to find them good 
for eating, and therefore, to make a trial, he 
knocked down one. 

It was a large nut, fomething of a tri* 
angular form, and as big as a young child's 
head. The outward rind was compofei of 

iihments. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 10/ 

filaments, or flrlngy folds, as if made of 
hemp. The fecond huik or fliell was, on 
the contrary, almofl: as hard as the fhell of a 
tortoife, and Robinfon foon perceived that it 
would fervc him for a cup* This fliell is 
fo large that it fometimes affords a place of 
retirement to the little long-tailed American 
monkey. The fruit within was a fort of 
juicy kernel, which tafled like a fweet al- 
mond, and in the middle of this kernel, 
which was hollow, he found a moft delicious 
and finely flavoured milk. This was a mofl 
agreeable treat for poor Robinfon, who was 
halfHarved, 

His empty flomach was not fatlsfied with 
one nut, he knocked down a fecond, which 
he ate with equal greedinefs. His joy at 
having difcovered this excellent fruit brought 
tears into his eyes, and he looked up to Hea- 
ven with fenfations of the warmed gratitude. 

The tree was tolerably large, and quite 
bung with fruit ; but, alas ! it was the only, 
one in the whole iflaad, 

Gea* 



loS THE NEW 

Geo, What fort of a tree might it be^ 
then ? We have- none fuch here, 

Mr. Bill, It was a cocoa-nut tree. They 
grow chiefly there^ in the Eaft Indies ; and 
here^ in the South Sea ifiands. There are 
fome of them found in the Weft Indies ; in- 
deed, they are pretty common there. 

Though Robinfon^s hunger was now fa- 
tisfied, yet he did not omit going down to 
the ihore, to fee what (hew the oyfters made 
that day. He found a fev/, indeed^ but far' 
too fev/ to afford him a hearty meal. He 
had, therefore, great reafon to thank God 
for having this day furnifhed him with ano- 
ther fort of food ; and he did fo with- a h^art" 
full of gratitude. 

He carried home for his dinner the oyfters 
that he had found, and went chearfuUy about 
his ycfterday's work again. 

He had picked up on the beach a large 
fnell, which ferved him» inftead of a fpade, 
and advanced his work confiderablv. A^ 
iUuc af:er \\z difcovered a plant, the ftalk of 

which - 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I 09 

which was full of threads, like flax or hemp. 
At another time he -would not have paid 
any attention to luch matters, but, at prefen.r, 
nothing was indifferent to him. He exa- 
mined every thing, and refledled on every 
thing, in order, if poffible, to apply every 
thing to advantage. 

Having fome hopes that this plant might 
be ufed in the fame mjanner as flax or hemp, 
he plucked a quantity of ir, tied it up in 
fmall bundles, and left them to foak in wa- 
ter. Having obferved, at the end of a few 
days, that the thick outfide fkin was fuf- 
ficienily foftened by the water, he drew out 
the bundles, and fpread them thinly on the 
grafs before the fun, the flalks being now 
quite Ibfr. As foon as ever they were pro- 
perly dried, he n:iade a trial -with a large 
ftick to pound them and break them like 
-flax, and he fucceeded. 

Immediately he endeavoured to turn the 
llringy part of thefe plants to ufe by making 
fm.ali cords of it. It is true they were not 
fo.well twilled as thofe made by. our rope- 
makers 



XIO T H E N E W 

makers here, for he had neither wheel nor a 
fecond perfon to aflift him. However, they 
were flrong enough to faflen his great fhell 
to the end of a flick, by which means he 
was now mafter of an inftrument not much 
unlike a gardener's fpade. 

He then went on with his work very di- 
ligently, and planted tree clofe by tree until 
he had completely palifaded the fpace that 
was before his intended dwelling. But, as 
one fingle row of a tree fo very pliable did 
not feem a fufficient wall of defence, he 
fpared no labour, but planted a fecond row 
round the firfl. He then interwove the 
branches of the two rows together, and, at 
iaft, hit upon the idea of filling up with 
earth the diftance that was between them. 
This completed his wall, fo folid that it 
would have required a confiderable force to 
pufh it in. 

Every morning and evening he watered his 
little plantation with water from the neigh- 
bouring fpring, which he took up in his 
cocoa fhell ^ and he had very foon the fa- 

tisfadioa 



•ROBINSON CRUSOE. IIIi 

tisfadllon of feeing his young trees fprout up 
and flourilh fo as to afford a charming view 
to the eye. 

When he had almoil entirely finifhed his 
hedge, he fpent a whole day in making a 
number of thick cords, out of which h^ 
formed, as well as he could, a ladder of 
ropes. 
Henry. What was that for? 

Mr. Bill. I'll tell you. His dcfign was 
to make no door to his habitation, but to plant 
more trees, and fo flop up even the opening 
that remained. 

Henry. How, then, was he to go in and 
out? 

Mr\ Bill, By the afTiftance of his ladder 
of ropes. 

It is to be obferved, that the rock which 
hung over his habitation was about as high 
as the fecond ftory of a houfe, and on the 
top of the rock was a tree. To this he fatt- 
ened his ladder of ropes, and let it hang 
down to the ground. He then tried to 
climb up by it, and fucceeded to admiration. 

All 



112 T H E N E W 

All this being finilhed, he confidered by 
what means he might make the little hollow 
under the rock large enough to ferve him 
for a habitatbn. He faw very well, that 
with his hands alone he fhould never be 
able to manage it. What was to be done, 
then ? He mufl find out fome tool or in- 
ilrument for the purpofe. 

With this defign he repaired to a fpot 
where he had feen a great number of hard 
green ..ftones fcatt^red on the ground. Hav- 
ing fearched amongft them carefully, he at 
lall found one, the very fight of which made 
him jump for joy ; for, in effed:, this 
ilone had the very form of a hatchet, 
and even a hole to fit the handle in. 
Robinfon faw, at firft view, that it would 
make an excellent hatchet, if he could but 
enlarge the hole ever fo little. After a 
world of pains he at length happily accom- 
plilhed this by means of another ftone..; 
then he fixed a pretty thick flick in it, by 
way of handle, and with fome of the cord 
which he had made himfelf, he faflened it 
as firm as if it had been naikd in. 

He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. IIJ 

He now tried to fell a fmall tree, and the 
attempt proving no lefs lliGcefbful, tilled 
him with inexpreflible joy. Had any one 
offered him one hundred pounds for his 
hatchet, he would not have parted with it> 
fuch vafi: advantages did he promife himfelf 
from the ule of it. 

Searching ftili amongft thofe green flones^ 
he found two more equally fit for ufe. The 
one had nearly the form of a mallet, fuch 
as is ufed by carpenters and flonecutters ; 
the other was fhaped like a (lout fliort 
bludo;eon, havinc- an edse or corner at the 
end. Pvobiufon carried them both to his 
habitation, intending to go to work v/ith 
them immediately. 

He fucceeded to his wifh. Laying the 
edge of the one fione upon the earth and 
rock, and ftriking it with the other refem- 
blinga mallet, he knocked off feverai pieces 
of the rock, and, in a few days, was fo far 
advanced in clearing out the hollow, that it 
leemed large enough for him to lie in at his 
cafe.

114 THE NEW 

He had before this plucked up with his 
hands a quantity of grafs, which he had 
fpread before the fun to make hay of it. 
This being now fufficiently dried, he car- 
ried it to his cave to make himfelf a good 
bed. 

From this time he was able to fleep like 
a human creature, without being obliged, 
as he had for many nights before, to perch 
like a bird up in a tree. What a luxury 
it was to him to flretch his weary limbs 
upon a foft bed of hay ! He thanked God, 
and faid within himfelf, " Oh ! if my coun- 
trymen knew what it is to pafs, as I have 
done, feveral nights fucceffively, feated 
upon a hard branch of a tree, how happy 
would they count themfelves to be able to 
enjoy the refrefhment of fleep in conveni- 
ent beds, fecure from accidents by falling 
or otherwife ! Certainly they would not let 
flip a day without fincerely thanking Pro- 
vidence for all the conveniences and de- 
lights which they enjoy. 

The following day was Sunday. Ro-

binfon dedicated it to reft, to prayer, and 
meditation. He Ipent whole hours on 
his knees, with his eyes turned towards 
heaven, praying to God to pardon his fins, 
and to blefs and connfort his poor parents. 
Then, with tears of joy, he thanked his 
Maker for the providential afTiftance that 
he had experienced in a fituation in which 
he was cut off from the whole world , he 
prom i fed to grow better every day, and to 
perfevere in his fiiial obedience. 

Harriet, Well, I think mafter Robinfon 
is grown much better than he was. 

Mr. Bill. Providence forefaw that he 
would grow better under affli6lion, and, 
therefore, fuffered him to undergo the trial 
of it: for thus our heavenly Father adls 
towards us all. It is not in his anger, but 
In his tender mercy, that he fends us mis- 
fortunes : he knows that they are neceflary 
to us, in order to render us humbler and 
better. Far from being hurtful to us, they 
become falutary remedies in his beneficent 
hands. 

F 2 That 



Il6 THE NEW 

That he might not forget the order of 
days, but know regularly on what day Sun- 
day would fall, Robinfon thought of making 
himfelf an almanack. 

Rich, An almanack ? 

Mr. Bill. Yes ; not a printed one, it is 
true;, nor quite fo exadl as thofe that we 
have in Europe, but flill an almanack by 
which he was able to count the days regu- 
larly. 

Rich. And how did he manage that ? 

Mr, Bill. Having neither paper nor any 
thing elfe requifite for writing, he chofe 
four trees that were clofe befide each other, 
and pretty fmooth on the bark. On the 
iargellofthe four he marked every even- 
ing a notch, to fignify that a day was pad. 
When he had made feven notches, the week 
was expired. Then he cut in the next tree 
another notch, to exprefs a week. As 
often as he had completed in the fecond 
tree four notches, he marked on the third, 
with a notch of the fame fort, the revo- 
lution of a whole month , and, laflly, when 

thefe 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II7 

thefe marks that flood for months amounted 
to twelve in number, he made a fcore on 
the fourth tree, to denote that the whole 
year was expired. 

Henry. But all the months are not 
equally long: Ibme have thirty-one days, 
others but thirty : how then could he mark 
exadiV the number of days in each ? 

Mi', Bill, That he could reckon on his 
fingers. 

RIcb, On his fingers ? 
Mr. Bill. Yes -, and, if you chufe, I will 
fhevv you how too. 

^11 the children. Oh ! dear papa, do. 
Mr, Bill. Well, then, obferve. He 
fliut his left hand fo 5 then, with the fore 
finger of his right hand, he touched one of 
the knuckles or finger joints of the left, and 
then the hollow that is befide it, and fo on, 
naming the months in their order. Every 
month that falls upon a knuckle has thirty- 
one days, whereas the others which fall 
upon the hollows between the joints have 
only thirty \ excepting the mcuith of Febru- 
F 3t ary 



Il8 T H E N E W 

ary alone, which has not fo much as thirty, 
but twenty-eight, and once in every four 
years twenty-nine. 

He began, therefore, with the knuckle 
of the fore finger, and touching that, he. 
nanned the firft month of the year, January. 
How many days then has January ? 

Rich, Thirty-one. 

Mr, BilL I will go on, then, reckoning 
the months upon the knuckles of my fin- 
gers', and do you, Richard, as I name each, 
tell me the number of days that it contains. 
In the fecond place, therefore, February ? 

Rich, Should have thirty days, but it 
has only twenty-eight, and fometimes twen- 
ty-nine.

Henry, Yes, papa, you have not mifTed a

Mr. Bill. Such little matters as thef^ are 
worth remembering, becaufe you have not 
always an almanack at hand, and yet there 
is occafion for you fometimes to know how 
many days there are in this or that month. 

Rich. Oh, I'll warrant I fhall not forger. 
F 4 Henry,

Henry. Nor I, for I have taken particular 
notice. . 

Mr, BUI. It was thus, then, that our 
friend Robinfon took care not to iofe the 
order of time, but to know on what days 
the Sabbath fell, that he nnight keep it holy, 
after the nianner of Chriftians. 

In the mean time, he had ufed the great- 
cfl part of the cocoa nuts that he had ftored 
up, having difcovered but one tree of the 
kind as yet, and the fhore furnilhed him 
with fo few oyfters, that they were not fuf- 
ficient to keep him alive. He began, there-^ 
fore, to be uneafy again concerning the ar- 
ticle of food. 

Hitherto fearful and cautious, he had not 
dared to go to any great diftance from his 
dwelling. The dread of wild beafts, or of 
men not much more civilized, if any were 
lO be found in the country, kept him at 
home; but neceffity at length obHged him 
to conquer his reludtance, and to walk a 
little farther into the ifland, in order, if poi^ 
Rble, to difcover a new ftock of provifions. 

Witt\ 



RORIXSON CRUSOE, 121 

With this intent he refolved, the follov;ing 
day, wich God's blefTing and protedtion, to 
traverfe the v\hole ifland. 

But, in order to defend himfeif froni the 
excefTive heat of the fun, he fpent the whole 
evening making an umbrella. 

Edzv. Where did he find filk and whale- 
bone ? 

Afr. Bill. He had neither filk nor whale- 
bone ; nor had he either knife, fciffars, 

needle, or thread ; and yet but how do 

you think he fet about making au um- 
brella ? 

Eciw, That I cannot telh 

Mr, Bill. He wove the top of it witfi 
fprigs of willow, like a large round baiket,. 
not very deep: in the middle of this he 
fixed a ftick, which he tied with his pack- 
thread, and then he w^ent to the cocoa- nxiE 
tree for fome large leaves, which he failened 
with pins to the outfide. 

Ricb. With pins > Where had he thofe 
pins ? 

Mr. Bill. Guefs. 

F 5 Harriet 



122 T H E . N E W 

Harriet, Oh, I can tell. He found them 
among the fweepings, or between the chinks 
of the floor. I find a good many there. 

Rich, A wife difcovery 1 As if one could 
find pins where there was nobody to lofe 
them ! Befides, what fweepings could 
there be, or what floor in Robinfon's little 
cave ? 

Mr. Bill, Well, who can guefs ? How 
would you do if you wanted to faflien any 
thing and had no pins ? 

Rich, I would ufe thorns, fuch as grow 
on the hawthorn tree. 

Geo, And I would ufe thofe fl;rong 
prickles that we fee on goofeberry buflies. 

Mr. Bill, Pretty well both 3 however, I 
mufl: tell you, that Robinfon ufed neither 
the one nor the other, by reafon that he ne- 
ver faw either hawthorn or goofeberry tree 
in all his ifland. 

Rich, What then did he ufe ? 
Mr. Bill, Fifli bones. The fea threw 
dead fiflies up on the beach, from time to 
time, and when their bodies rotted away or 

were 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I23 

were devoured by birds of prey, their bones 
remained dry. Of thefe Robinfon had ga- 
thered feme of the ftrongeft and fharpelt to 
life as pins. 

By means of them he contrived to make 
Tjp an umbrella fo clofe that not a finglc 
ray of the fun could penetrate it. When- 
ever any new piece of work fucceeded with 
him, his joy was inexpreflible; then he 
ufed to fay to himfelf, '' Have not I been. 
a great fool to pafs the beft part of my 
youth in idlenefs ? Oh ! if I were in Eu- 
rope now, and had all thofe tools at my 
command that are fo eafy to be procured 
there, what things I could make for my- 
felf ! And what a pleafure it would be to.= 
me to make up myfelf the greateft part 
of my furniture, and the working tools that 
I fhould have occafion for. 

As it was not very late, he bethought: 

himfelf of trying to make a bag that mjght: 

hold his provifion, if he Ihould be fo lucky 

as to find any in his excurfion. He turn- 

F 6 ed 



124 T H E N B W 

cd this fcheme in his thoughts for a while^ 
and at length fucceeded in finding means 
to accompliih it. 

You nnufl know, he had made a tole- 
rable good (lock of packthread; of this he 
refolved to weave a piece of network, and 
of the network to make a bag. 

Now it was thus he fet about it. He 
fattened acrofs, between two trees that 
were little more than a yard afunder, fe- 
veral threads, one under the other, and 
as clofe as poflible. This refem^bled ex- 
adly what weavers call the warp. In 
the next place, he joined regularly, from 
top to bottom^ thread with thread, dill as 
clofe as poflible, knotting the thread that 
went down with each thread that went acrofs, 
€xa6lly in the fame manner as when one 
weaves a net. Thefe threads, therefore, that 
went downwards formed what is called the 
woof', and by this fort of workmanihip he 
in a Ihort time completed a piece of net- 
ting not unlike fuch as filhermen ufe. He 

next 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125 

next flipped off the ends of the threads 
from the trees to which they were faftened> 
and joined the fides of the netting toge- 
ther, clofing up the bottom -, thus he left 
no part open but the top. Here was a 
bag or pouch complete, which he hung by 
his fide, having faftened both ends of a 
flout piece of packthread to the mouth, 
and flipping the loop over his neck. 

The happy fuccefs of his labour filled 
him with fo much joy that he was fcarce 
able to ck)fe his eyes all night. 

Geo. I fhould like to have fuch a bag as 
that. 

Edw, So fhould I too, if we had only fome 
packthread. 

Mrs. Bill. If you wifhed to enjoy as 
much fatisfa(5lion from your wo k as Ro- 
binfon did from his, you fhould begin with 
making the packthread yourfelves, and you 
yourfelves fhould prepare the hemp or the 
flax for that purpofe ; bur as there is nei- 
ther flax nor hemp ripe at this time of the 
year, i will furniih you with packthread.

Geo. Oh! dear mama, will you be fa 
good ? 

Mrs, Bill. Yes, my dear, if you defire it. 

Geo, That is delightful. 

Harriet. You are doing what is very 
right J for if ever you fhould happen to be 
in an ifland where there was not a living 
Ibul but yourfelf, you know beforehand 
how to fet about fuch things ; eh, papa ? 

Mr. Bill. Right. Weil, make a trial. 
As to Robinfon, we will let him fleep till 
to-morrow. In the mean timx, we fhall fee 
if it is not poilible to be as cunning as he, 
and to make an umbrella. 



FIFTH EVENIN G . 

THE next evening, the company being 
affembled in the ufual place, Ed- 
ward came ftrutting in with a pouch of 

network

network that he made himfelf, and which 
drew the eyes of the whole company upon 
him. Inftead of an umbrella, he had bor- 
rowed a fieve from the cook, and ftuck a 
broomftick through it. This he held over 
his head as he came in, and marched up to 
the table with a great deal of importance 
and folemnity. 

Mrs^ BilL Bravo, Edward ! why this is 
excellent ! I had almofl taken you for Ro-

Rich, Ah ! if I had but had a few mi- 
nutes more time to finifh my bag, I could

Geo, So could I too. 
Mr, Bill, Well, Edward has fhewn thas 
other people can make pouches of network 
as well as Robinfon Crufoe. But, my man, 
your umbrella is not worth a farthing. 

Edw, Oh, papa, I only make Ihift with 
this for the prefent, becaufe I was not able 
to finifh another in the, time. 

Mr. Billingfley (opening a clojet door, and 
fetching out an umhrella which he had made

Edw. Ah ! that is a fine one. 

Mr. Bill. I keep it until we come to the

mentioned in it, ihall be our Robinfon Cru-

Geo, And muft he really make a cave 
too, or a hut ? 

Mr. Bill, Why not ? 

All the children. Oh, that is excellent, 
that is delightful. 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon could fcarce wait for 
the daylight. He rofe before the fun, and 
prepared for his journey. He flipped his 
pouch firing over his neck, put a ftrong 
cord round his waifl by way of girdle, in 
which he fluck his hatchet inftead of fword^ 
took his umbrella upon his (houlder, and 
fo courageoufly began his march. 

He firit paid a vifit to ais cocoa-nut tree^ 
to furnilh his oag with a nut or two. Pro- 
vided 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I29 

vided with feme of this excellent food, he 
went ftraight down to the fea-fide to feek alfo 
fonne oyilers j and, having got a faiall fiore 
of thefe two articles, in cafe of necefTicy, he 
took a flight break fad, with a drink of frelh 
water from his fpring, and marched off. 

The morning was delightful ; gthe fun was 
juil then rifing in all his glory, and feemed 
as if he afcended out of the fea. A thou- 
fand birds, of different forts, and the greateft 
variety of admirable plumage, were thea 
finging their morning fong, and rejoicing at 
tlie return of light. The air was as pure and 
as frelh as if it had been but juft then creat- 
ed, and the plants and flowers exhaled the 
moft exquifite perfume. 

Robinfon felt his heart expand with joy 
and gratitude. " Even here," faid he, *^ even 
here doth the Creator of the Univerfe Ihew 
himfelf the mod beneficent of beings !*'~ 
He then mixed his voice with the melody 
of the birds, and fung a morning hymn, 
which he had formerly learnt, and ftiU re- 
tained in memory. 

As 



130 THE NEW 

As his fear of wild animals, whether men 
or beads, was not yet entirely diffipated, he 
avoided, in his walk, as much as pofliole^ 
ail foreils and thickets, chufmg, on the 
contrary, fuch grounds as allowed hiin an 
open profpedl on every f:de ; but unfortu- 
nately thefe grounds were the barreneft 
parts of the v/hole ifland, fo that he had 
gone a pretty long way without finding any 
thing that could repay him far his trouble, 
or be the lealt ferviccable to him. 

At laft he obferved a parcel of plants, 
which he refolved to infped a litde clofer i 
they were growing together in tufts, and 
formed a kind of little coppice. Some had 
reddifh bloflbms, others white 5 a third fort, 
inftead of blofloms, were covered with litde 
green apples, about the fize of a cherry. 

He eagerly bit one of thefe apples, but 
found it unfit for eating,, which fo vexed him, 
that he plucked up the whole tuft, and was 
going to fling it away, with all his force, 
when he perceived, to his great furprife, a 
number of round knobs hanging from, the 

roots 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I^I 

roots of the tufr. He Immediately fufpe(5l- 
cd that thefe were properly the fruit of the 
plant, and, therefore^ began to examine 
them. 

But, however, this time his tafte difap- 
pointed him -, the fruit was hard and difa- 
greeable to the palate. Robinfon had a 
mind to throw the whole away j but fortu- 
nately he recolledled that a thing fhould 
not be reckoned abfolutcly ufelefs, becaufe 
we cannot all at once difcover the utility of 
it. He, therefore, put a few of thefe knob- 
bed fruit into his pouch, and continued his 
ivalk. 

Rich. I know what thefe knobbed fruit 
were. 

Mr, Bill, Come, what do you think they 
were ? 

Rich, Why, they were potatoes ^ they 
grow exadtly as you have defcribed thefe 
knobs. . 

Henry. And America is their original foil 
too. 

Gso. Aye, it was from that country that

Mr» Bill, Would you know them ? 

Geo, Law ! I have {ttn potatoes, and eat 
of them a hundred times. 1 am very fond 
of them. 

Mr. Bill But Robinfon had, perhaps, 
never ktn any of them i at leaft, as jhey 
grow in the ground. 

Geo, No ? 

Mr, Bill. No : confider, that was for-

means fo common in fome parts of England 
as they are at prefent. 

Geo, Oh ! then I beg his pardon. 

Mr, Bill, You fee, my dear George^ 
how wrong it is to be too hafty in blaming

Geo, It fhall, papa. 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon continued his walk„ 
but very flowly, and with a great deal of cau- 
tion. The leafl noife, made by the wind 
in {baking the trees and the thickets, ftar- 
tied him, and made him put his hand to his 
hatchet to defend himfelf in cafe of need. 
But he always faw, to his great joy, that his 
fright was without foundation. 

At length he arrived on the banks of a 
rivulet, where he refolved to make his din- 
ner. He feated himfelf at the foot of a 
large branchy tree, and was juft going 
to regale himfelf heartily, when, all at once, 
a noife, at a diftance, threw him again into

you. 

Rich, Oh ! yes, papa, if you pleafe. 

Mr, Bill. They are called lamas \ their 
country is properly that part of America 
which belongs to the Spaniards, and is call- 
ed Peru. There, before the difcovery of that 
extenfive country by Francis Pizarro and 
Almagro, the Peruvians had tamed this ani- 
mal, and were accuftomed to load it, and ufe 
it for a beaft of burthen, as we do horfes and 
mules. Of its wool they made ftufFs for 
cloathing. 

Rich, Then the people of Peru were not 
fo favage as the other Americans. 

Mr, Bill, Not by a great deal They liv- 
ed in houfes pioperly built ; as did alfo the 

Mexicans 



IIOBINSON CRUSOE. J^^ 
Ivlexicans (here in North America) ; they 
had built magnificent temples, and were 
governed b)' kings. 

Geo. Is it not from this country that the 
Spaniards draw all that gold and Vilver for 
which they go every year to America, in 
their galleons, as you have told us. 

Mr. BilL The fame.—Robinfon, feeing 
thefc lamas approach, felt a violent defire to 
cat fome roafl meat, which he had not tailed 
for fo long a rime. He thought, therefore, 
of killing one of thefe lamas; and for that pur- 
pofe he flood z\ok befide the tree, with his 
hatchet of ilint in his hand, waiting until the 
bealllhould, perhaps, pafs fo clofe to him, 
that he might ftnke it with his hatchet. 

It happened as he expeded. Thefe ani- 
mals, walking on without fufpicion, and 
probably having never been diflurbed by 
any living creature, paflcd hy, free from the 
leail dread of danger, clofe to the tree where 
P.obinfon ftood in ambufcade , and one of 
the fmalleft of them coming wirhin his 
reach, he gave it fo eii^ctual a flroke on

in a moment. 

Harriet, Oh fy ! how could he do fo ? 
The poor little ilieep ! 

Mrs. Bill. And why Ihould he not, Har- 
riet ? 

Harriet. Nay, the poor little thing had 
done him no harm, however ; and lo he 
might very well have let it live. 

Mrs. Bill. Certainly, he might fo -, but 
he had occafion for the flefh of this animal 
for his food and nourifhment ; and doft thou 
not know that God hath permitted us to 
make ufe of animals whenever v;e have the 
like occafion^ 

Mr. Bill To kill any living creature 
without neceffity, or to torture it, even 
barely to teaze it, is cruelty, and no good 
perfon will do fo ; but to draw ail the ad- 
vantage pofifible from them, and even to 
kill them and ufe their flefh for our nou- 
riflmient, is not forbidden. Befides, do not 
you know, as I explained to you the other

day, that It is very well for animals that we 
fhould deal thus with them ? 

Rich, Ah ! very true ; if we had no oc- 
cafion for animals, we fhould not take care 
of them, and in that cafe they would not be 
near fo well off as at prefent. How many 
of them would be flarved to death in a 
hard winter ! 

Henry, Yes -, and they would fuffer 
ftlll more if they were not killed, but left 
to die of ficknefs and old-age, becaufe they 
cannot afiift each other as men do. 

Mr, Bill, Again, we mull not fuppofc 
that the death to which we put animals 
caufes them a great deal of pain. They are 
not fenfible beforehand that they are going 
to be killed, fothat they are quiet and con- 
tented to the very lad moment ; and the 
feeling of pain, while they are killing, is 
foon pad. 

Pvobinfon never thought of afking him- 
felf how he was to drels the flelli of this 
young lam.a, until the mjoment that he had 
killed it.

Harriet. Dear me 1 could not he boil it or 

roaft it ? 

Mr, Bill. That is what he would have 
done with all his heart, but, unfortu- 
nately, he had not a Tingle article for the 
purpofe 'y he had neither pot nor fpit, and, 
what is worfe, he had not even fire. 

Harriet. No fire ? Why, then, all he 
had to do was to light one. 

Ivlr. Bill, True, if he had a flint and 
Heel, tinder and marches ; but he had none 
of them. 

Rich, I know what I would have done. 
Mr, Bill. What, pray ? 
Rich. 1 would have rubbed two bits of 
dry wood one againft the other, until they 
took fire. I recolle<tl, that is the me- 
thod ufed by fome favage people. V/e 
read it in a collection of voyages. 

Mr. Bill. Robin fon had exadlly the 
fam.e idea. He took up the lam^a, there- 
fore, upon his flioulders, and turned his 
fteps homewards. 

Or the way, he made another difcovery, 

which

which afforded him infinite joy. This was 
a number of lemon-trees, kven or eight, 
round which, on the ground, he found fe- 
veral ripe ones that had fallen. He ga^ 
thered them up carefully, marked the fpot 
where thefe trees grew, and, quite happy 
and content with his acquifition, hafcened 
hom.e to his habitation. 

There his firft bufinefs was to fkin the 
young lama. He effefted this by means 
of a iharp flint, which ferved him for a 
knife. He flretched the fkin in the fun as 
well as he could in order to dry it, becaufe he 
forefaw that it might be of fervice to him. 
Rich. Why, what could he make of that > 
Mr. Bill. Oh ! a great many things. In 
the firfl- place, his fhoes and {lockings be- 
gan already to be full of holes. He thought 
that, when his (hoes were quite gone, he 
might make foles of this ikin, and fallen 
them under his feet, fo as. not to be obliged 
to walk quite barefoot. Befides, the thoughts 
of winter troubled him not a little, and he 
was glad that he had found a way to furnifh

himfelf with fur againft the feverity-of the 
cold. 

It is true, he might have fpared himfelf 
this uneafinefs ; for, in the country where 
he now was, there was never any winter. 

Geo, Never any winter ? 

Mr, Bill, The cold of winter is feldom 
felt in any of thofe hot climates between 
the two tropics. I was fpeaking to you 
about them lately j have you forgot how 
they are called ? 

Henry, The Torrid Zone. 

Mr, Bill. Right.— However, to make 
amends for this want of winter, they have, 
during two or three months of the year, in- 
cefTant rains. As to Robinfon, he knew 
nothing of all that, becaufe, in his youth, 
he would not fuffer himfelf to be properly 
inftru6led. Hiftory, geography, and every 
other improving fcience, were tirefome and 
hateful to him. 

Rich. But, papa, I think, for all that, 
that we have read once how very high 
mountains, like the Peak of TenerifF, are 

always 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 14! 

always covered with fnow; and how, on 
that ridge of mountains which bounds Chili 
on the Eafl, and extends fronn Peru to the 
Straits of Magellan, fnow is to be fcen the 
whole year. It muft certainly be always 
winter there -, and yet thefe places are be- 
tween the tropics. 

Mr. Bill, You are right, nny dear 
Ilichard. Situations very high and moun- 
tainous are an exception -, for upon the 
tops of thefe high mountains there is com- 
monly a perpetual fnow. Do you remem- 
ber too what I told you of fome countries 
in the Eaft Indies, when we lately went 
over them on the map ? 

Rich, Yes -, that, in fome countries there, 
fummer and winter are but two or three 
leagues afunder. In the Ifland of Ceylon, 
which belongs to the Dutch -, and there alfo 
— where — where was it ? 

Mr, Bill. In the peninfula on this fide 

of the Ganges : for, when, on one fide of 

the Gaut mountains, it is winter, namely, 

upon the Coaft of Malabar, on the other 

G 4 fide 



142 THE N E W 

fide of thofe mountains, that is, upon the 
Coafl of Coromandel, it is fummer, and 
fo alternately. The fame is the cafe alfo in 
the Ifland of Ceram, one of the Moluccas, 
where a man needs only to travel three 
leagues to get out of winter into fummer, 
cr out of fumm.er into winter. 

But here have we travelled very far from 
our friend Robinfon. Obferve how, at one 
fpring, our thoughts can tranfport them- 
felves in the twinkling of an eye to places 
diftant from us by many thoufands of 
leagues. From America we have taken a 
flight to Afia, and now-— -take care — hey 
pafs ! we are back again in America, at 
Robinfon Crufoe's ifland. Is not this won- 
derful ? 

After he had fidnned the lama, ta- 
ken out its bowels, and cut off a hind quar- 
ter to roaft, h\9 firft care was to provide 
a fpit. For this he cut down a young 
lender willow-tree, peeled off the rind, and 
made it fharp at one end ; after which he 
chofe a couple of forked branches to hold 

up 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I43 

Up the fpit. Having cut them of an equal 
lengths and lharp at the ends, he lluck 
them into the ground, opponte to each 
other; put the joint on the fpit, which he 
then laid on the two forked (licks; and great 
indeed was his joy when he faw how well 
his fpit went round. 

He wanted nothing now but, what is 
moil neceffary of all, fire. In order to 
produce it by rubbing, he cut two pieces 
of wood from a dry trunk, and im- 
mediately fell to work. He rubbed {a 
brifkly, that the fweat ran down his. face in. 
great drops ; but he could not accomplifh 
his purpofe : for when the wood was heat- 
ed until it fmoked, jufl then he found him^ 
felf fo fatigued, that he was under an abfa^ 
lute neceffity to ilop a few mom.ents and 
recover flrength ; in the mean time, the- 
wood cooled a little, and his whole labour 
became ufelefs. 

Here again he had a lively inftance of 

the helpleflhefs of man in a ilate of foil- 

G 5; tudea, 



144 THE NEW 

tilde, and what mighty advantages the fo" 
ciety of other nnen affords us. 

He wanted but another man to go en 
rubbing when he was tired, and then he 
certainly would have fet the piece of wood 
on fire ; but thofe interruptions, which he 
could not avoids rendered the thing impof- 
fible. 

Rub, And yet I always thought that the 
favages produced hie by rubbing. 

Mr. Bill. So they do. But then thefe 
favages are generally much flronger than 
we Europeans, who are brought up a great 
deal too delicately. In the next place, 
they know better how to fet about it. They 
take two pieces of different v^^ood, one foft, 
the other hard, and they rub the latter with 
a great deal of rapidity againft the former, 
\vhich, at length, takes fire. Or elfe, again^ 
they miake a hole in one of the bits of wood, 
into which they put the end of the other, 
2nd then turn it between their handS;, with 
fo quick and incelfant a m.otion, that at 
kngth it begins to burn* 

Of

Q^'all this Robinfon knew not one tittle^ 
a«d therefore did not fucceed. 

At laft he threw away the pieces of wood, 
fat down upon his bed of hay in a nnelan- 
choly moodj fupporting his head upon his 
hand, and, figging heavily, call a look now 
and then upon the fine joint of meat which 
was likely now to remain on the fpit with- 
out roafcing. Then fuddenly rcfleding 
what would become of him in winter if he 
had no fire, he felt fuch piercing anxiety^ 
at the thought, that he was obliged to rife 
precipitately and walk about^ in order to- 
breathe more at hib cafe. 

As his ipirits were a good deal agitated^ 
he grew thirfly, and went to the fpring 
with a cocoa-nut (hell to fetch fomaC Vvater. 
With this he mixed the jui-.e of a lemon^j 
which made a mofl: excellent drink, and 9^^

ardently longed for a little dice of it. He 
recoil edted at length to have heard that ^hs 
Tartars put the meat which they mean to 
eat under their horfes faddles, and fo bake 
it, as it were, at full gallop. This, faid he 
to himfelf, might be done as well by ano* 
ther method, and he refolved to try. 

No fooner faid than done. He went to 
feek two pieces of ftone, pretty broad and 
fmooth, of the fame fort as that of which 
his hatchet was m.ade. Between thefe two 
ftones he placed a piece of meat that had 
no bones, and began immediately to ftrike 

wifl^mit internnlffion upon the Uppcrmoft 

•Rone with his ffcone mallet. After he had 
done this for five or fix minutes, the fl:on€ 
began to grow hot, which made him con- 
tinue to ftrike with redoubled adivity ; fo 
*hat in lefs than half an hour, the meat, 
■y by the heat of the ftone, and partly 
'^ prefTure and weight of the blows^

roafted ; but to Robinfon, who had been fo 
long a time without tailing meat, it was a 
delicious morfel. « O you/' he cried, 
'' O you amongft my countrymen, whofe 
delicate flomachs are often qualmilh at the 
fight of the bed food in the world, if it does 
not exaftly fuit the depraved fenfuality of 
your appetites, if you were only a week in 
my place, how contented would you be all 
the reft of your lives with whatever food 
Providence fhould fend you ! How careful 
would you be of defpifmg good vi6luals, 
and of fhewing your ingratitude to the all- 
nourifhing bounty of Heaven !" 

In order to make this meat more favoury^ 
he fqueezed a litde lemon juice upon it^ 
and then he made fuch a meal as he had 
not made for a long tim.e. Neither did he 
forget to thank, from the bottom of his 
heart, the Author of all Goodnefs for this 
new benefit* 

When he had made an end of eating, he 
debated in his own mind what work would 
be die moft neceiTary to fet about. The 

dread 



148 THE NEW 

dread of winter, which had but a little be- 
fore affedfced him fo ftrongly, made him think 
of taking or killing a great number of la- 
mas, merely to provide himfelf with flcins ; 
and, as thefe animals feemed to be ex- 
ceedingly tame, he hoped to accompliih 
this intent without much trouble. , 

With this hope he went to bed, and a 
found refrelhing fleep repaid him richly for 
all his fatigues during the day.

Our friend Robinfon flept till it was pret-

brifkly, he was going direclly to take the

field againft the lamas 5 but the heavens 
did not permit him. 

For no fooner did he put his head out of 
the cave, than he v^^as obliged to draw it in 



again. 



Harriet, How was that, papa ? 

Mr, Bilh It rained as hard as it could 
pour, fo that there was no pofiibUity of 
going out. He relblved, therefore, to wait 
until the fhower v/as over. 

But there appeared no likelihood of this > 
on the contrary, it grew more and more 
violent. It was accompanied alfo with 
lightning fo bright, that his cave, which 
commonly was pretty dark, feemed to be 
all in a blaze ; and then the fiaflies were fol- 
lowed by fuch claps of thunder as he had 
never heard. The earth trembled under 
the florm, and the echoes of the mountains 
repeated the found of the thunder fo often, 
that the tremendous roar feemed to be with- 
out end. 

As Robinfon had not received a good 

cduca- 



f^O T H 2 N E W 

education, it was natural enough for him 
to be foolifhly afraid of the ftornn. 

Geo, What, afraid of thunder and light- 
ning \ 

Mr. Bill. Yes, fo frightened, that he did 
not know where to hide himfelf. 

Geo, Why, it is fonaething grand ^ how 
could it frighten him ? 

Mr, Bill. I cannot well af!ign a reafon for 
this fear. Perhaps ic is, that the colledion 
of fulphur, fait, and nitre, which produces 
the explofion of thunder, by taking fire, 
does, fometimcs, in its courfe, fet buildings 
on fire, and deftroy the lives of thofe who 
are expofed to it. 

Rich. Yes -, but thefe accidents are very 
rare. 

Mr. Bill. Befides, how nnany advantages 
does the ftorm bring with it ! It purges 
the air of fulphureous vapours -, it renders the 
air nnuch purer and fitter to promote the 
vegetation of plants ; the burning heat of 
the weather k renders cool and temperate; 

and^ 



ROBINSON CROrSOE. I5I 

and, laft of all, it prefents us with the grand- 
eft and nnoft awful fpeclacle in nature. 

Harriet, I love to fee the lightning 
dearly. Papa, will you let us go out with 
you when it thunders, that we may obferve 
the courfe of the lightning. 

Mr. Bill. With all my heart. — Robin- 
fon, as you remember, had been ill-in- 
ftrudled in his youth. This was the reafon 
why he knew not how great an advantage 
ftorms are ; how they clear the air, and 
make every thing grow better in the fields 
and gardens j and how, confequently, they 
contribute to refrefh and give, as it were, 
new life to both men and animals, trees and 
plants. 

During the ftorm, he fat in a corner of 
his cave, with his hands clafped together, 
and oppreffed with moft dreadful anxiety. 
The rain, mean while, ran down in ftreams, 
the lightnings fiafhed, and the thunder 
roared inceflantly. It was almoft noon- 
day, and the violence of the ftorm had not, 
in the leaftj abated* 

Robinfon 



J52 T H E N E W 

Roblnfon was not hungry ; his terror had 
entirely taken away his appetite -, but his 
imagination was difquieted with the mofl 
frightful ideas* 

^' The time is come,'' faid he to himfelf, 
'^ when God will make me fufier the puniQi- 
ment due to my tranfgrefiions. He has

Mr. Mered. I muft confefs, I am not 
well pleafed at all with my friend Roblnfoa 
this time. 

Edw, Why not, Sir ? 

Mr» Msred, Had not his merciful Crea- 
tor done enough already in his favour, ta 
convince him that he never forfakes thofe 
who truft in him fincerely, and v/hofe con- 
trition is undiflembled ? Had he not faved 
him from the mod imminent peril of 
death ? Had he net already afliiled him in 
fuch a manner, that he had ample reafon 
never to fear periihing with hunger ? — And 

yet 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I53 

yet to be fo defponding ! Fy, fy ! It has 
not a good afpe^l. 

Mrs. Bill, I am of your opinion, Mr. 
Meredith i neverthelefs, lee us have com- 
paffion on the poor youth. It was but very 
lately that he had begun to think at all, and, 
confequently/ it was impoffible for him to 
have made fo-great a progrefs as one who 
had ftudied from his earlieft years to be- 
come always wifer and better. 

Mr, Bill, My dear, you are right. Your 
compafiion for poor Robinfon is as jufl as 
it is worthy of your tender nature. I m.y- 
felf begin to have a confiderable regard 
for him, as he has been fome time pafi in 
the right way. 

While he fat thus defponding, over- 
whelmed with trouble and difquiet, the 
florm, at length, began to abate. As the 
claps of thunder becam.e lefs loud, and the 
rain came down lighter, hope by degrees 
revived in his bread. He thought he 
fnould now be able to hi out on his expe- 
dition againil the lamas, and was going to 

take 



154 T H E N E W 

take his hatchet and his bag, when, all at 
once — what do you think ? — he fell back- 
wards, quite flunned and fenfelefs. 

Rich. Hey-day 1 What was the matter 
with him, then ? 

Mr. Bill, Exadly over his head there 
buril the terribleft noife imaginable: the 
earth trembled, and Roblnfon was thrown 
backwards, and fell like a dead man. It 
-feems the lightning had ftruck againft the 
txtt which grew on the top of the cave, and 
fhattered it all to pieces, with a found fo 
tremendous as deprived poor Robinfon of 
his fenfes, and he adluaiiy thought he was 
killed. 

He remained on the ground a confide- 
rable time before he recovered his fenfes. 
At length, perceiving that he was ftlll alive, 
he rofe up, and the firil objed that he be- 
held before the door of his cave was part 
of the tree which the lightning had torn in 
pieces, and thrown down. A frelh misfor- 
tune for Robinfon ! How was he now to 

fallen 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I^^ 

fatten his ladder of ropes, if the whole tree 
was broken down, as he thought it was ? 

As the rain had now totally ceafed, and 
the thunder was no longer heard, he took 
courage, at lafl, to go outi and then what 
did he fee ? 

That which, in a monnent, filled him 
with gratitude and love towards his Creator, 
and covered him with confufion for fufferino- 
himfelf to fall into defpondency, as he had 
done. You mud know, the trunk of the 
tree which had been flruck by the light- 
ning was all on fire. Thus Robinfon found 
himJelf, in a moment, mafter of that which 
he had mofl: wanted -, and thus Divine Pro- 
vidence had taken the mofl particular care 
of him, exaclly at the moment when he ima- 
gined, in his defpair, that he was entirely 
abandoned. Full of inexpreffible feelings 
of joy and gratitude, he lifted up his hands 
towards Heaven, and, Ihedding a flood of 
tears, he thanked, with a loud voice, the af- 
fedionate Father of the Univerfe, who g&- 
verns all, and who, even when he permits 

the 



156 THE NEW 

the mofl: terrifying events to take place, a6l$ 
ever by the wifeft and moft charitable rea- 
fons. " Oh 1" faid he, ^^ what, then, is 
man, this poor worm of the earth, whofe 
views are fo confined ? What is he, to 
dare to murmur a9;ainft that which God 
hath brought to pafs by means infcrutable 
to all mankind ?'' 

From that time he had fire, without hav- 
ing had the leaft trouble in lighting it; 
from that time it Vv^as eafy for him to keep 
the fire in 5 and from that time he had rea- 
fon to be lefs uneafy about his fubfiftence 
in this defert ifland. The dcfign that he 
had upon the lamas v/as dropped for to- 
day, becaufe Robinfon was delirous to make 
ufe of the fire immediately and roafl his 
meat, which had been upon the fpit ever 
fince yeflierday. 

As the fire had not yet reached the lower 
part of the tree, to which his ladder of ropes 
was faftened, he could m.ount in perfect fe- 
curity. He did fo, took a burning fplin- 
ter of the tree, defcended again into the en- 

clofiire 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I57 

clofure before his cave, kindled a good fire 
under his meat, and then climbed up once 
more to put out that which was (lill burning 
in the trunk of the tree. This he effected 
in a fhort time. 

And now he fet about performing the 
duty of a cook. He tended the fire nnd 
turned the fpit very carefully. The fight 
of the fire rejoiced him inflnitelyj he looked 
upon it as a precious gift which God had 
fent him from the clouds, and while he re- 
flected on the great advantages that he iHould' 
enjoy from the pofTefTion of it, his eyes were 
often turned with gratitude towards Hea- 
ven. And during the refl of his life, as 
often as he faw or thought of fire, he ne- 
ver failed to fay within himfelf, " That alfo 
God gave me.'' 

Mr, Mered, Fire, which preferves all 
that breathe on this earth, is an emblem of 
the Divinity ^ it is the nobleft of all ele- 
ments. 

Mr, Bill, Hence it is that the worfhip of 
fire hath been very common amongfl the 

Vol. I, H ignorant 



158 THE NEW 

ignorant pagans. At Rome it was prefcrv- 
cd in the temple of Veda -, at Athens, in that 
of Minerva ; at Delphi, in that of Apollo ; 
and you muft remember how much it was 
reverenced in Perfia. 

Mr, Mered, Yes, but thank Heaven we 
are better inftrudled, and know that iire is 
not God, but a gift of God's bounty, like 
water, earth, and air, which he hath crea- 
ted from the love he bears us. 

Mr. Bill. Robinfon, during his repaft the 
day before, had only regretted the want of 
fait, which would have improved the tafte 
of the meat that he drelTed by blows of the 
mallet. He hoped, however, in time to 
find fome fait in his ifland 5 for the prefent 
he contented himfelf with going to the.fiiorej 
and bringing home, in a cocoa- nut-{hel], 
fome fea water, with which he fprinkled his ' 
meat feveral times, faking it in this manner, 
in default of a better. 

His meat was now done. The joy with 
which he cut off the firft flice, and put the 
firft bit into his mouth, cannot be defcribed,

but by one, who, like him, ftiould not have 
tailed for a month before a Tingle mouthful 
of meat properly dreft, and who fhould have 
almoil given up the hopes of ever tafting 
any fuch again. 

After thisj the main point was how to keep 
in his fire always. 

Geo, That he could eafily manage by 
adding conftantly frefh wood. 

Mr, BilL Very good. But at night;, 
while he was afleep, if there came a fudden 
fhower, what was he to do then ? 

Harriet, But, papa, 1*11 tell you what ; 
I would have made the fire in my cave 
where the rain could not come. 

Mr. Bill, No bad thought. But, unfor- 
tunately, his cave was fo fmall, that it juft 
ferved him to lie down in : and, then, chim- 
ney he had none -, fo that the fmoke would 
liave been exceedingly inconvenient to him j 
he could not have borne it. 

Harriet. Nay, in that cafe I do not know 
how to alTift him, 

Richn What a terrible fitiiation ! There

muft always happen fomething to puzzle 
poor Robinfon. One would think, now 
and then, that he was made completely- 
happy j but, your humble fervant, fomething 
.r.ew comes all at once to crofs him. 

Mr, Bill. This may ihew you how ex- 
rtremely difficult it is for one man fingly to 
provide for all his own neceiiities, and how 
great the advantages are that we enjoy from 
civil life. My dear children, we Ihould be 
but poor miferable beings, if we were ob- 
liged each of us to live by himfelf, and if 
nobody were to receive any affiflance from 
his fellow-creatures. A thoufand hands are 
not fufficient to prepare what each of us 
wants every day. 

Rich. Oh! papa! — 

Mr. Bill, What, do you think that in- 
credible ? Well, let us reckon how many 
things you have had occafion for this day. 
In the firft place, you have flept till fun-. 
>rife this morning, and that on a good bed. 

Rich. With a mattrefs underneath. 

Mr. Bilh Very well. Mattreffes are

fluffed with horfe-hair : this horfe-hair re- 
quires two hands to cut it, two more to 
weigh and fell it, two to pack it up and 
fend it off, two to receive it and unpack 
it, and two, again, to fell it to the faddler or 
upholfterer: laftly, the upholfterer's hands 
find employment in picking it and filling 
the mattrefs with it. The cover of this

Rich, At the weaver's. 

Mr. BHL And how ? 

Rich, In a loom, with thread, and a 
fhuttle, and pafte, and — 

Mr, BilL That is enough. How many ' 
hands did it take to make the loom ? Let 
us be moderate, and fay, for inllance, 20. ^ 
Pafte is made of flour. What a number oF

get this ? 

Rich. From the women who fpin it. 

Mr, Bill. Out of what. 

Rich, Flax. 

Mr. Bill. And do you know, agaiw, 
through how many hands flax muft pafs be- 
fore it can be fpun ? 

Rich, bh yes, we were reckoning that 
lately. In the firft place, the hufbandman 
fifts the flax feed, that it may not be mixed 
with tares : then the land mufl be dunged 
and ploughed twice ; after which they fow, 
and then harrow. Next, when the flax be« 
gins to fprout up, a number of women and 
girls come to weed it. Again, when it grows 
to a proper height, they pluck up the flaiks, 
and ripple them in order to pull off the litde 
round heads that contain the (ttd. 

Edw. Yes, and then they tie the flalks 
together in bundles, and deep them in 
water. 

Henry ^ And when the b\indles have been

ileepcd long enough, they take them up out 
of the water. 

Geo, And fpread them in the fun to dr)f, 

Charlotte, Then they clear the flax from 
the hulls with a break, 

Harriet, Not yet, my dear Charlotte j it 
muft be well pounded firil. 

Charlotte, Very true, and then they break 
it, and then- 

Rieh. And then they /f«/c^ it, and then 
they haikle it to fcparate it from the tow, 

Mr, Bill, Now, put together all thefe 
things, which muft neceflarily be done be- 
fore we can have linen -, confider, alfo, how 
many forts of different labours are required 
to make the inftruments ufed by the huf- 
bandman, the flax-dreffer, and the fpinner ; 
and you muft own I do not exceed the truth 
in faying that more than a thoufand hands 
have been employed in the making of your 
mattrefs. 

Geo, A thoufand hands ! It is wonderful^ 
and yet it is very true. 

Mr, Bill, In the next place, confider how 
H 4 many 



164 T H E N E W 

many things you have daily occafion for, 
and then pray tell me, Ihould it furprife us 
that Robinfon Crufoe found himfelf every 
now and then puzzled and at a (land, when 
not another hand in the world but his own 
v^orked for him, and when he had nc»t a 
fingle one of thofe inHruments by means of 
which things in this part of the world are 
fo eafily and expeditioufly made. 

At this tim.e, therefore, what puzzled him 
was the finding of fome method or other to 
hinder his dear fire from going out. Some- 
times he fcratched his head as if he would 
have plucked a lucky thought out of it j 
again, letting his hands fall, he would walk 
backwards and forwards in his enclofure, not 
knowing what to have recourfe to. At laft. 
he fixed his eyes by chance cm the rock at 
the edge of his cave, and that moment the 
thought ftruck him how he was to ad. 

Henry, Eh ! how was that ? 

Mr. BilL There projeded out of the 
rock, about a yard from the ground, a very 
large and thick ledge of ftonc. 

Charlotte, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165 

Charlotte, How large might it be ? 

Mr, Bill, Why really I have not been 
able to procure the exadl proportions of it ; " 
but 1 will fuppofe, at a guefs;, that it was 
about as long as I am^ its breadth and 
thicknefs might be a yard and a half. 

Though it had rained very hard, the ' 
ground under this large piece of the rock • 
was perfeflly dry, - Robinfon faw at once 
that this fpot would anfwer every purpofe 
of a fire-place, being completely Iheltered 
from all accidents ^ but he faw, moreover, . 
that it would require no great trouble to 
make a proper kitchen under the flone, to- 
gether with hearth and chimney, and there- 
fore refolved to go immediately to work 
about it. 

With his fpade he hollowed the ground • 
under the great ftone about a yard deep. 
After that, he conceived the idea of en- 
clofmg this ground, at the fide, with two 
fmall walls reaching up to the flone itfclf. 

Geo, But how could he make v/alls ? 

Mr, Bill, He had been accuflomed, you

know, minutely to remark every thing that 
4ie met with, and he always afl-ced himfelf 
the queftion, " What ufe may be made of 
this ?" He had, amongft other things, ob- 
ferved a particular fort of clay in one part of 
his ifland, upon fight of which he immedi- 
ately faid to himfelf, ". Perhaps this clay 
would make good bricks, if ever I fhould 
have occafion to build a wall/' 

At that moment he recolledled the clay, 
and, having nearly finilhed hollowing out 
his kitchen, he took hisfpade and his knife 
of flint, and repaired to the fpot where this 
clay was to be found, in order to fet about 
the work without delay. 

The heavy rain had made the clay fo 
foft, that he found no difficulty in fhaping 
dt to the form of bricks, and cutting it 
fmooth viixh his knife. After preparing a 
pretty good number of thefe bricks in a 
ihort time, he placed them, befide each 
other, in a fpot where the fun fhone all day. 
He determined to go on with this work the 
next day, and in the mean time returned 

home

hotne to eat the reft of his roaft meat, the 
eagernefs with which he had worked having 
fliarpened his appetite. That he might re- 
gale himfelf in a princely manner on fuch a 
day of rejoicing as the prefent, he indulged 
himfelf by adding to his fupper a cocoa-nut 
from the fmall number of thofe that ftill 
remained. 

The repaft was excellent. " Ah T* faid 
Robinfon, fighing from the bottom of his 
heart, which was partly content and partly 
forrowful, " Ah ! how happy fhould I be 
at this moment, if I had but one finglc 
friend, merely a man, were it the moft mi- 
ferable beggar in the world, to bear me 
company ; one fingle man, whom I might 
call my friend, while I profeffed to him an 
equal friendfhip ! Had I, at leaft, the hap- 
pinefs of being mafter of fome tame animal, 
a dog or a cat, to whom I might Ihew kind- 
nefs in order to gain its affedtion ! But to 
live thus folitary, abfolutely cut off from 
^very living creature, and as if I were the

tears dropped down his cheeks. 

He then recalled to memory the time, 
ivhen, having it in his power to enjoy the 
fweet fociety of his brothers and other com- 
panions, he neverthelefs had frequently 
quarrelled and difputed with them : the re- 
colle6lion of this filled him with bitter for- 
row. " Ah 1" faid he to himfelf, '' how 
little I then knew the value of a friend, and 
the impoflibility of doing without the love 
and efteem of our neighbours, if we would 
live happy ! Oh, if I could now begin to 
pafs thofe days over again, with what com- 
plaifance and good-nature would I behave 
towards my brothers and other children! 
How patiently would I put up with fmall 
offences, and how would I exert myfelf to 
charm every body with my gentlenefs and 
good behaviour, and force them to love me 
in their turn ! Heavens ! Why did I not 
know how to value the happinefs of friend- 
fliip until I had loft that happinefs — alas ! 
lofl it for ever ?'* 

With 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. l6g 

With thefe words he turned his eyes 
accidentally towards the entrance of his 
little lodge, and perceived a fpider v/hich 
had Ipread its web in a corner. The thought 
of lying under the fanne roof with fome 
living creature fo filled him with joy, that 
he did not trouble himfelf in the kail about 
the fpecies of the animal. He refolved 
to catch flies every day for this Ipider, to 
iliew it that it lived in a place of free- 
dom and friendfhip, and in order to make 
it tame, if it was poflTible. 

As it was dill day, and the air, frefliened 
by the florm, was infinitely agreeable to 
the fenfe, RobinfoR did not chufe to go to 
bed yet, and, that he might employ the 
time in fomewhat ufeful, he took up his 
ipade again, and began to holk)W out the 
ground for his kitchen. In doing this, 
he ftruck all at once upon fomething hard 
that was in the earth, and was very near 
breaking his fpade. 

He took it at firft for aflone; but what 
was his aftoni(hment» when> having drawn 

out

Rich. Gracious ! Well, he certainly has

Mr. Bill, Surprifing luck, indeed ! This 
mafs of gold was fo thick,- that, had it been 
coined, it would have produced upwards 
of io,oool. Behold him^ therefore, at pre- 
ftnt, a man of vail: fortune ! What a num-

Mr, Bill. Oho ! I had forgot. — Robin- 
fon, however, did not j fo that, inftead of 
rejoicing for the treafure that he had found,- 
he kicked it from him with contempt^ 
and faid, " Lie there, miferable metal,

le6led on the ground, and afterwards, as he 
pafTed by, fcarce thought it v/orth a look.

SEVENTH EVENING. 

*" I^^IIE following evening, before Mr. Bil» 
^ lingdey began the continuation of 
Robinfon Crufoe's hiflory, he exprefied 
himfelf thus : I hope, my dear children, 
that, in relating this hiftory to you, I do 
not detain you frona any ennployment nnore 
agreeable or improving. I would not puc 
the leaft conflraint on you , (o that whenever 
our friend Robinfon grows tirefome to 

you 

A 3 Edw* 



4 T M E N E W 

Edm. Tirefome, papa ? It is impoffible, 
Mr, Bill. However, I obferved fome of 
you, yefterday evening, gape and yawn a 
good deal. 

Geo. Oh ! papa, the reafon of that was, 
that we had worked very hard in our gar- 
dens all the afternoon, fo that it was no 
wonder if we were a little fleepy towards 
night. 

Edw. To-day we have only been weed- 
ing and watering our lettuce beds, fo that 
we are quite frelh; 

Harriet. Oh! quite frefh, papa; look 
how I can jump. 

Mr. Bill. Well ; you have only to tell 
me whenever, this ftory begins to grow 
heavy or dull. 
Rich. Oh! never fear 3 I'll warrant you. 
Mr. Bill. Then I proceed. 
As the heat was exceflive in Robinfon's 
if] and during the day time, he was obliged, 
whenever he undertook any thing laborious, 
to work at it very early in the morning, or elfc 
in the cool of the evening. He rofe, there- 

fore^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 

fore, before the fun^ put frelh wood to his 
fire, and ate the half of a cocoa nut that he 
had left fince the evening before. After 
this he intended to. have put another joint 
of his lama on the fpit j but he found the 
fiefh already tainted, on account of the ex- 
traordinary heat. He was, therefore, ob- 
liged to go without the pleafure of eating 
meat for that day. 

Upon this, he prepared to fet out for the 
clay-pit -3 and, putting on his pouch, he 
found ftill remaining in it the potatoes 
which he had brought home two days be- 
fore. He refolved to try the experiment 
of dreffing them -, fo put them dov/n clofe 
by his fire, and having covered them with 
hot aihes, he fet out. 

He worked fo hard, that before twelve 
o'clock he had prepared as many bricks as 
he thought he fhould have occafion for, to 
complete the wall of his kitchen. He next 
went down to the beach to look for fome 
oyfters j but inftead of oyfters, of which he 
A 4 found 



6 ' T H E N E W 

found only very few, he difcovered, to his 
great joy, another fort of food, much bet- 
ter than any that he had found yet. 

Rich, What was that, papa ? 

Mr, Bill. It was an aninaal, the flefh of 
which, it is true, he had never tafced y but 
he had frequently heard that it was the 
mod wholefome and delicious imaginable. 

Rich, Well, then, v/hat was it ? 

Mr. Bill, A turtle, and fo large, that it 
is rare to fee the like in thofe parts. It 
might weigh loolb. 

Geo. Why, it mufl have been a monfler 
of a turtle.. Are there really fuch great 
ones ? 

Rich, Oh ! yes ; and much larger flilL 
Have you forgot what papa read from Cap- 
tain Cook's Voyages. The turtle that his 
people found in the South Seas weighed 
300 lb.

wards. — \_See theFrontlJpeceto this Volume.^ 
— When he arrived at his cell, his firll care 
was to come at the flefhof the turtle, which 
he did, at length, by cutting open, with his 
hatchet, the lower fhell that covered its 
belly ; he then killed it, and cut off a good 
part of it to roaft, which, having fixed up- 
on the fpit, he waited with impatience until 
it was done, for his work had confiderably 
Sharpened his appetite. 

While he turned the fpit, he confidered 
with himfelf what he muft do with the rell 
of the turtle, to keep it from tainting. To. 
fait it would have been the only etfeclual 
way, but then he had neither tub nor fait. 

It filled him with concern to think that 
all that fine turtle, the flelh of which would 
nourifh him for more than a week,, muft be 
unfit to eat the next day 3 and yet he could 
not think of any expedient to fave it. AH 
at once a thought fl:ruck him. The upper 
fhell of the turtle was fhaped like a large 
bowk " That," faid he, " Ihall ferve me 
A 5 £01 



8 T H E N E W 

for a trough to fait it in — but where is the 
fait? 

" Only think, what a great fool I muft 
be !" cried he, flriking his hand againft his 
head -, " cannot I fteep this meat in fea-wa- 
ter, and will not that have the fanae efFe6t, 
or nearly fo, that brine would have ? A 
lucky thought ! a lucky thought 1" cried 
he J and his joy made him turn the fpit 
twice as faft as before. 

His turtle was now nicely done. " Ah !" 
faid Robinfon, fighing, after he had tailed, 
with much fatisfadion, a fmall bit of it 
which he thought very favoury, ^^ if one had 
the leaft morfel of bread with this ! How 
ftupid was I, in my youth, not to know 
that we ihould thank God for a bit of 
dry bread ! I was feldom contented if 
my bread was not loaded with butter, and 
even then, perhaps, I mufl have cheefe. 
Oh idiot that I was 1 How happy Ihould I 
now be with a piece of the blackeit rye 
bread that ever was made in my country 1" 

While 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9 

While he was taken up with thefe reflec- 
tionSj he recolleded the potatoes that he 
had left in the aflies before he went out in 
the morning. *' Let us fee," faid he, *^ how 
they will turn out i" and he took up one of 
them. 

Here was new caufe of rejoicing ! The 
fruit, which was before fo hard, was now 
become quite tender; and when he opened 
it, the fmell was fo pleafing, he never hefi- 
tated to conclude that the tafte muft be 
equally fo. In efredl, this root tailed as 

agreeable — as agreeable as Eh ! Who 

will help me out with a fimiie ? 

Mr. Mered. As agreeable as a potatoe, 

Mr, Bill. Even fo. That fettles it all 
in one word. In fliort, Robinfon perceived 
that this root, which was fo agreeable to the 
tafle, would fupply the place of bread. 

He made, therefore, a magnificent re- 

pafti after which, as the fun was burnmg 

hot, he threw himfelf on the bed for a 

while, to confider at his eafe what work he 

A 6 ihould 



to THE N E W 

fhould begin when the violence of the heat 
was over. 

" What piece of work," faid he^ " fhould 
I undertake at prefent ? The fun muil 
harden my bricks before I can begin my 
v/ail. The beft way then^ certainly, will be 
to go and kill a couple of lamas. — But 
what am I to do with fuch a quantity of 
meat ? — -What, if 1 Ihould hang up fome of 
it to dry in the fmoke of my kitchen ? — • 
Excellent !" cried he^ and with thefe words 
he bounced from his bed, and fat down in- 
the front of his intended kitchen, to de- 
liberate on the means of fucceeding in this 
plan. 

. He prefently faw that the thing might be 
done v/ell enough. He had only to leave 
two holes in the walls that he was to build, 
and through them to run a large flick 
acrofs. It Vv'as an eafy matter to hang his 
hams and flitches upon this, and the fmoke 
of the chimney would do the refl. This 
happy thought was near turning his head with 



ROBINSON CRtrSOE. 11 

joy. What would he have given that his brides- 
were already hard enough, that he might 
begin the grand work that very nnoment ! 
But there was no help for it ; he muft be 
content to wait until the fun hardened his 
bricks. 

Something, however, muft be done to 
employ the time. While he meditated what 
that fhould be, a freih thought ftruck him, 
which by far furpafled, in clevernefs, all 
that he had hitherto conceived. And he was 
aflionilhed at his folly in not having hit up- 
on it before. 

Rich. What was it, then ? 
Mr, Bill, No more than this > he refolv- 
ed, in order that he might have company, 
and at the fame time provide for his fub- 
fiilence, to bring up fome tame animals. 
Geo. Ah ! fbme of the lamas, I dare fay. 
Mr. Bill Rio;ht. In facl, thefe were 
the only animals that he had feen hitherto. 
As thefe lamas appeared already to be ex- 
tremely tame, he hoped he ihould fuc- 
ceed in taking a couple of them alive. 

Geo, 



12 THE NEW 

Geo, Oh ! that would be delightful. I 
ihould like to be along with him, to have 
another couple. 

Mr, Bill But pray, George, how would 
you contrive it ? They were hardly fo tame 
as to let themfelves be caught. 

Geo, Then how did Robinfon mean to 
do? 

Mr, Bill, That was the very point that 
Robinfon had many long and ferious delibe- 
rations upon. But man, where an under- 
taking is not in itlelf abfolutely impofllble, 
man needs but to will feriouily and with 
perfeverance, and nothing is infurmounta- 
ble to his underftanding and induftry -, fo 
great and manifold are the faculties with 
which our good Creator hadi endowed us ! 

Attend to this, my dear children, and 
never defpair of fuccefs in any labour or 
difficulty whatfoever, provided you take 
the firm refolution of not giving over until 
-you have accomphfhed it. Unwearied ap- 
plication, conftant reileclion, and a courage 
that peifeveres in fpite of every obilaclcj, 

have 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

have often brought enterprizes to a period 
which were at firil deemed impracSuicable. 
Never, therefore, fuffer yourfelves to be dif- 
couraged by the difficulties which you will 
meet with in the affairs of life -, but always 
refled that the more exertion it has cofl to 
bring a bufinefs to a happy iflue, the more 
joy one feels at having accompiilhed it. 

Robinfon foon fucceeded in hitting upon 
a method to take the lamas alive. 

Rich, What was it ? 

Mr, Bill. He propofed to make a nooie 
upon a cord, and, hiding himfelf behind a 
tree, to throw the noofe over the head of the 
firft lama that (hould approach. 

With this intent, he twilled a pretty 
llrong cord, and in a few hours the cord and 
the noofe were completed : he made a tri- 
al or two to fee whether the noofe would 
catch well, and it anfwered perfedly to his 
wifh. 

As the place by which the lamas were 
accuftomed to pafs, in their way to the wa- 
ter, was pretty far off, and becaufe he was 

not 



14 T H E N E W 

not fure whether they would pafs by there 
that evening, as it was about noon that he 
faw them go to drink before, he put off till 
next day the execution of his projed : in 
the nriean time he made the preparations 
requilite for the journey. 

That is to fay, he went to the fpot where 
the potatoes grew, and filled his bag with 
tKem. Part of them he put down in the 
warm afhes to road, and the reft he threw 
into a corner of his cave for a future flore. 
In the next place, he cut off a pretty large 
piece of his turtle to ferve for fupper and 
the next morning's breakfaft, and fteeped 
what remained in fea water, v/hich he hadt 
brought with him for the purpofe. 

Laftly, he dug a fmall hole in the ground, 
which was to be his cellar, for want of a 
better. In it he placed his turtle fhell with' 
the faited meat, placed over that the piece 
that he meant to roaft for fupper, and then 
covered the whole with fmall branches of 
trees. 

For the reft of the afternoon, in order to 

refrefli 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I ^ 

refrefli his fpirits, he indulged himfelf with 
an agreeable walk along the Tea fide, where 
there blew a fine frefn eafterly breeze, 
which rendered the air agreeably cooL 
His eyes traverfed with pleafure the im- 
menfe ocean, whofe furface was then gently 
agitated by fnnall waves following each 
other in How fucceffion to the Ihore. He 
turned his eyes fondly towards the part of 
the world where his dear country was fi- 
tuated, and a few trembling tears trickled 
down his cheeks at the remembrance of 
his beloved parents. 

'^ What are they doing now, thofe poor 
difconfolate parents ?'^ cried he, bathed in 
tears, and clafping his hands together.. 
" If they have furvived the bitter forrow 
which I unhappily have caufed them, alas ! 
what grief confumes their days ! How muft 
they ligh to behold themlelves childlefsj to 
fee their laft, their only fon, become a trai- 
tor to their love, and abandoning them for 
ever ! Oh my dearell, befl of fathers ! my 
tender, affectionate mother !. pardon, ah, 

pardon 



l6 T H E N E W 

pardon your unhappy fon for thus affliding 
you ! And thou, O Heavenly Father, at 
prefent my only father, my only fociety, my 
only fupport and prote6tor ! — [here he threw 
himlelf upon his knees in the poflure of 
adoration] — Oh, my Creator, fhed thy mod 
precious blefTings, Ihed all the happinefs 
which thou hafl deftined for me, and of 
which I have rendered myfelf unworthy, 
Ihed them upon my dear parents, whom I 
have fo grievoufly offended, and thus con- 
fole them for their fufFerings. Ah ! how 
chearfully will I endure whatever difpenfa- 
tion it fhall pleafe thy wifdom and mercy 
to appoint for me in order to my future 
amendment, could but my poor parents, 
who are innocent, be made happy V* 

He remained a litde longer on his knees, 
looking up to Heaven in filent grief, and 
his eyes fwimming in tears. At length 
he rofe, and, with his knife of flint, he cut 
out upon the tender. bark of a tree that 
was at hand, the much-loved names of his 
parents. Over them he placed thefe words, 

"God 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I7 

*" God blefs you !'* and below, " Mercy to 
your loft Ton !" After that, his lips, warm 
with affedlion, kifted the names which he 
had cut out, and he bedewed them with his 
tears. He afterwards engraved thefe fame 
names, which were fo dear to him, upon a 
number of other trees in other parts of the 
ifland, and, from that time forward, he ge- 
nerally offered up his prayers at the foot of 
one of thefe trees, and never failed to re- 
member his parents in them. 

Geo. For once, I think, he behaved 
well. 

Mr, Bill, He is, at prefent, in the fair- 
eft train to become an honeft and good 
man, and for this he is indebted to the 
wife Providence of Heaven which con- 
du6ted him hither. 

Geo, He might now, therefore, return to 
his parents, if Providence thought fit. 

Mr. Bill. God, who forefees every thing 
that will happen, knows beft what is for the 
advantage of any man, and will regulate 
the events of his life accordingly. It is 

true^ 



iS T H E N E W 

true, circumftances have kindled a fpark 
of virtue in Robinfon's bread, but wha 
can tell if other circumftances would not 
quickly extinguifh this fpark again ; and if 
he was at this moment taken from his 
illand, and reilored to his father's houfe,. 
who knows whether the infeftion of exam- 
ple and profperity would not corrupt him 
once more I Oh, my children, how juft is 
this precept, « Let him that ftandeth take- 
heed left he fall !" 

While Robinfon walked backwards and 
forwards on the beach, it occurred to him 
tliat he would do well to bathe himfelf. 
He therefore took off his cloaths ; but how 
was he terrified on feeing the condition of 
his fliirt, the only one that he had ! As 
he had worn it without fhifting for fo long ] 
a time, and in fb hot a climate,, one could 
fcarcely perceive that the linen had ever 
been white. Wherefore, before he bathed 
himfelf, he took care to wafh this fhirt as 
well as poffible, and, having hung it upon 
a tree to dry, he jumped into the water. \ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I^ 

He had learned to fwim pretty early, 
fo that, being perfe6t mafter of the exer- 
cife, he amufed himfelf with fwimming out 
to a good diftance from fhore towards a 
neck of land that extended pretty far into 
the fea, and upon which he had never been 
yet. 

Charlotte, A neck of land? "What is 
that ? 

Mr, BilL We give that name to a long 
piece of land, one end of which joins an 
ifland or a continent, and the other flretches 
cut into the fea. You underiland ? 

Charlotte. Oh, perfedlly. 

Mr, BilL This thought of Robinfon's 
was very iucky^ for he found that the neck 
of land was, during the time of high wa- 
ter, entirely covered, and that, on the eb- 
bing of the tide, a confiderable quantity of 
turtles, oyfters, and mufcles, were left be- 
hind. This time, indeed, he could not 
carry any of them away, neither did he 
want them at prefent, as his kitchen was 
fufficiently ftored : however, the difcovery 

of 



to T H E N E W 

of them afforded him no fmall degree of 
fatisfadlion. 

That part of the fea in which he fwam. 
abounded with fifli fo plentifully that he , 
could almofl have caught them with his 
hands. If he had had a net he might have | 
taken them by thoufands; however, though 
he had none, he hoped, as he had been 
hitherto fo fortunate in all his underta* 
kings, that he might one day or other be 
mailer of a fiihing net. :l 

Satisfied with thefe difcoveries, he came 
out of the water, after having been a full 
hour in it. The heat of the fun had en- 
tirely dried liis fhirt, and he had the plea- 
fure once more of putting on clean linen. 

But, as he had contraded the habit of 
reflecting upon every thing, he confidered 
that this pleafure could not laft very long; 
for, having but one fhirt, he was obliged 
to wear it conllantly, and, when it was 
worn out, he had none to replace it. Thig 
refiedion damped his joy a good deal ; ne- 
verthelefs, he took courage, and after he , 

hadr

had drefled himfelf, returned to his habita- 
tion, frequently repeating to hinafelf, " The 
Lord be praifed for all things V* 

Rich. He is right now not to fufFer him- 
felf to be caft down or defpond, but to put 
a reafonable trufl in Providence. 

Harriet, Oh, how I fhould like to fee 
Robinfon. I am very fond of him. 

Geo, If papa would only give me paper, 
I Ihould like to write him a letter. 

Edw, So would I too. 

Rich, And 1 3 it would give me great 
pleafure to write to him. 

Harriet, Well, fo it would m.e, if I knew 
jhow to write. 

Mrs, BilL My dear, you fhall tell mc 
what you would fay to him -, I will write 
for you. 

Harriet. Oh, thank ye, mama, that 
will do charmingly. 

Mrs, Bill, Come, then, I will give you 
all paper. 

Upon this, they retired to the next 
room for about half an hour, at the end 

of

of which time they all returned in great 
Ipirits, with each his letter in his hand. 

Harriet. Here, papa^ here is my letter 5 
pray be fo good as to read it. 

Mr. Biilingjley reads: 
" My dear Robinfon,

that will pleafe every body, and efpecially 
your father and mother. You now fee 
how ufeful it is to fuffer a little hardlhip. 
George and Richard fend their compliments

Geo, Now mine, papa : here it is. 

Mr, Biilingjley reads :

Henry, Mine, I am afraid, is good for 
nothing. 

Mr. Bill. Let us fee. 

Henry. I only wrote a few words in a hur-. 
ry, that I might have done as foon as the reft. 

Mr. Billingsley reads :

Your faithful friend,

Geo. But now, after ail, how are we to 
fend our letters ? 

Harriet. We need only give them to 
fom.e captain of a fhip that is going to South 
America ; and then too we can fend him 
fomething. I will fend him fome apples 
and fome walnuts. You'll give me fome

Rich, (whi/pering his father) They are

Mr. Bill My dear children, I thank you, 
in Robinfon*s nanne, for the kindnefs that 
you ihew him ; but as to thefe letters, it 
won't be in my power to fend them, 

Geo, La ! why not ? 

Mr. Bill. By reafon that Robinfon has 
been long fince in heaven, and his body is 
returned to dud. 

Geo. Ah 1 what, is he dead ? and but 
juft now he has been bathing himfelf 1 

Mr. Bill. You forget, my dear George, 
that what I relate to you concerning Robin- 
fon Crufoe, happened fifty years ago: fo 
that he mud have been dead a long time. 
But I am now writing his hiftory, and fhall 
take care to have your letters printed along 
with it. 

Harriet. Oh ! that will be charming. 
But in the mean time, I fuppofe, papa, you 
will go on telling us fomething of him. 

Mr. Bill, With pleafure. I have things 
to tell you ftill that will pleafe you as well 

as 



"ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 

as what you have already heard. But for 
this evening, I think, we have had enough. 
— Robinfon, after bathing hinnfelf, went 
home to his dwelling place, ate his fupper, 
faid his prayers, and wxnt to reft contentedly. 
And it is time for us to do fo too* 



EIGHTH EVENIN®* 

JMK. BiU, Well, where did we leave 
off laft night ? 

Henry, Where Robinfon went to bed after 
bathing. 

Mr. Bill. Oh ! right.— Well, then, Ro- 
binfon rofe the next morning early, and pre- 
pared for the chace. He furnilhed his 
pouch with plenty of roafted potatoes, and a 
good large (lice of roafted turtle, which he 
wrapped up in the leaves of the cocoa-nut 
B 3 tree. 



23 T H E N E W 

tree. Next he flung his hatchet by his 
fide, tied the cord, which he had nnade the 
day before for catching the lamas, round iiis 
waifb, took his unabrella in his hand, and 
began his march. 

It was very early 5 he refolved, therefore, 
for this time, to take a round, in order to 
make himfelf acquainted with fome other 
parts of his iQand. Amongft the numbers of 
various birds that fluttered about the trees, 
he remarked fome parrots, the colours of 
whofe plumage were extraordinary beautiful. 
How did he wifh to have one of them that 
he might tame it, and have it for his com- 
panion ! But the old ones were too cun- 
ning to be caught, and he could no where 
difcover a neft with young ones. He was 
obliged, therefore, to put off the gratification 
of this wifli until fome other opportunity. 

In return for this difappointment, he dif- 
covered, in the Courfe of his walk, a thing 
much more neceflary to him than a parrot ; 
for, getting to the top of a hill near the fea- 
fide, and looking down between the cracks 

of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2<) 

of the rock, he faw fomething lie on the 
ground which excited his curiofity. He 
let himfelf dov/n by the aiTiftance of his feet 
and hands, and found, to his great fatisfac- 
tion, that it was— what do you think ? 

Henry. Pearls, perhaps. 

Rich, Yes, truly, the fight of pearls 
would have given him great fatisfadion ! Per- 
haps it was iron. 

Edw. Nay, do not you know that iron is 
not to be found in hot climates ? It was, per- 
liaps, another lum.p of gold. 

Harriet, Nonfenfe ! Would that have 
made him glad ? Gold was of no ufe to 
him, you heard before. 

Mr. Bill, I fee you will not be able to 
guefs, then ; I v/ill tell you. What he 
found was — fait. 

Hitherto he had, it is true, in fome re- 
fped, fupplied the want of fait with fea-wa- 
ter i but, after all, that v/as not fait. The 
fea-water has a bitter tafte which is very 
difagreeable -, and, befides, it was a miftake to 
think that meat faked in this manner would 
B 4 keep ^ 



JO -T Jl E U E W 

keep 5 becaufe fea-water, as well as that of 
a fpring or river, grows (linking after it has 
Hood fome tinne. It was, therefore, a very 
lucky thing that he found fonne real fair, and 
he filled both his pockets with it, in order 
to fupply himfelf with a flock for immedi- 
ate ufe. 

Geo. How did that fait come there, papa? 

Mr. BilL Then you do not remember 
what I told you one day concerning the 
original of fait ? 

Rich. Oh ! yes i I recolledl it flill. Some 
they take out of the earth, fome they make 
of fait- water that flows in fprings, and fome, 
again, is made from fea-water. 

Mr, BilL Now, the fait made from fea* 
water is either prepared by men or by the 
fun. 

Geo. The fun ? 

Mr. BilL Yes; for when any fea-water 
is left upon the land, after a high tide, or a 
fiood, the fun makes the water by degrees 
to evaporate, and what remains on the fpot 
is then fait. 

Harriet. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3I 

Harriet. Well, that is comical. 

Mr, Bill, See with what kindnefs Heaven 
provides for us! That which we can leaft do 
without, does always require the leaft pre- 
paration by art, and is always found in the 
greateft abundance. 

Robinfon went in high fpirits to the place 
where he hoped to noofe a lama. When 
he came there, he faw none 3 but then it 
was not quite noon. He fat down^ there- 
fore, at the foot of a tree to regale himfelf 
with his roaft turtle and potatoes. How 
much more favoury did they taftc to him 
now that he had a little fait to eat with:, 
them ! 

Juft as he had finifhed his meal, the la- 
mas appeared at a diftance, coming towards- 
him with fkips and bounds.- Robinfon . 
quickly placed himfelf in a pofture of at- 
tack, and waited with his noofe ready for 
the approach of one of the lamas. Several 
had pafied him beyond his reach ; but, all. 
at once, there cam.e up one fo near to him, 
that he fcarce needed more than to drop 
B 5 the. 



32 T H E N E W 

the noofe to have him faft in it. He did 

{o, and that naoment the lama was his pri- 

foner. 

The poor beaft would have bleated, but 
left that fhould frighten the reft, Robinfon 
pulled the noofe fo tight, that the lama was 
completely filenced. He then dragged it as 
faft as he could into a thick coppice to hide 
it from the reft. 

This lama was a female, and had two 
young ones, which followed her, to the 
great fatisfa6lion of Robinfon, and did not 
appear to be the leaft afraid of him. He 
patted the pretty little things, and they— 
juft as if they would have begged of himi to 
let their mother go— licked his hands. 

Geo. Well, then, I think he might have 
let her go. 

Mr. Bill. He would have been a great 
fool in doing fo. 

Geo. Nay, the poor creature had done him 
no harm hov/ever. 

Mr. Bill. But he had occafion for it i 
and you know, my dear George, we are 

permitted 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

permitted to make ufe of animals in cafe of 
need, provided we do not abufe them. 

Robinfon was tranfported with joy at 
.having fo happily attained his object. He 
dragged the creature along with all his 
ftrength, though fhe jumped and fkipped a 
good deal to get from him, and the two little 
ones followed quietly behind. The fhorteft 
way v;as novv' the bed for Robinfon, and, 
purfuing that, he at length arrived happily 
at his dwelling place. 

But here ftarted a diiHcuky. How was 
he to get the lama into his enclofure^ which>. 
as we have faid before, was fo ftrongly bar- 
ricaded all round r To fling it down from 
the top of the rock, by means of a cord, was 
not at all advifeable -, the poor animal might 
be ftrangled in the way. Robinfon refolved, 
therefore, to make up a little liable near his 
place of abode, and there to keep the lama 
and her young ones, until he Ihould be able 
to fuit his conveniency better. 

In the mean time he fattened the animal 

to a tree, and immediately fell to workj that 

B6 h 



34 T H E N E W 

is to fay, he cut down with his hatchet of 
flint a number of young trees, and fixed 
them in the ground, fo clofe, one befide the 
t;ther, that they formed a pretty flrong wall. 
While this was doing, the lama lay down 
through wearinefs, and the little ones, no \ 
way troubled at their being prifoners, were 
fucking quite unconcerned, and feafling 
themfelves at their eafe. 

What a pleafing fight was this to Robin*- 
fon ! Above a dozen times he ftopped from 
his work to look at the pretty little crea- 
tures, and thought himfelf beyond meafure 
happy in having Ibme animated beings to 
bear him company. From this moment his 
life feemed no longer folitary, and the joy 
v/hich he felt from this refledlion, gave him 
fuch tlrength and activity, that his liable 
was very foon finifhed : he then put the la- 
ma and her young ones into it, and clofed' 
up the lad opening with branches firmly, 
interwoven. 

What was his fatisfadtlon now I It is^ 
impollible for words to defcribe it. Be- 

fides 



ROBINSON C R IT S ». 35^ 

jfides the company of ihe lamaSju. which of 
itfelf was a valuable thing, he promifed 
himfelf many other great advantages, and 
with much reafon : for in time he might 
perhaps learn to make fome fort of cloath- 
ing with the wool of thefe animals ^ he might 
ufe their milk for food, he might make but- 
ter and cheefe of ir. It is true, he did not: 
yet know by what means he fhould at- 
tain thefc objedts, which were ftifl fo far 
diftant; but he had already experienced that* 
no man Ihould defpair of his &ill or per- 
formance, provided he gives his whole mind 
to the work, and applies to it with perfe- 
vering attention. 

There wanted flill one thing to complete 
his happinefs : he wifhed to be in the fame 
enclofure with his dear lamas, that he might 
have them always before his eyes when he 
was at home, and enjoy the fatisfadion^ of 
feeing them grow fond of his company. 

He puzzled himfelf a long time to- find 
how he fhould accomplifh this : at length, 
his determination was to breakdown one fide 



36 T H E N E W 

of his wall of trees, not grudging whatever 
•labour it might cod him, and to make ano- 
ther wall that would take in a larger fpace. 
This alteration, befides, would give him 
more room, and make him more at his eafe. 
But in order to be fecure from all accidents 
while he was working at his new hedge, he 
prudently refolved not to break the old wall 
until he had iinifhed the new. 

Thanks to his indefatigable pains, the 
work was finiihed in a few days, and then 
Robinfon had the fatisfadion of being in the 
fame habitation with his three domeftic com- 
panions. This, however, did not make him 
forget his firlt companion, the fpider, which 
he provided every day with gnats and flies. 
The fpider, foon perceiving that he ufed her 
as a friend, grew fo tame, that, whenever he 
touched her web, fhe would come out and 
receive from his hand the fly that he held to 
her. 

The lama alfo and its young ones foon grew 
fond of his fociety. As often as he returned 
home, they came jumping to meet him; they 

would 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

would fmeli about him to find whether he 
had brought them any thing, and gratefully 
lick his hand whenever he gave them frefli 
grafs or young branches to eat. 

After this he weaned the young ones, and 
then began to milk the dam regularly morn- 
ing and evening. His cocoa-nut Ihells 
ferved him for pails and milk pans, and this 
milk, which he ukd partly fweet and partly 
curdled, contributed not a little, by its agree- 
able tafte and nourifhing quality, to render 
his folitary life Hill more tolerable. 

As his cocoa-nut tree was ufeful to him 
in fo many refpeds, he was extremely de- 
lirous to find a method of producing more 
of them. But how was he to contrive it ? 
He had often heard of grafting trees, but 
the manner in which it was done had never 
excited his curiofity. *' Oh," faid he to 
himfelf, " how little is the advantage that I 
have reaped from the years of my childhood, 
when I had time and opportunity to have 
learnt fo much ! Ah ! if I had known my 
©wn intereft better, fhould I not have taken 

notice 



jS THE NEW 

notice of every thing that I faw or heard? 
And if my capacity did not allow me to ar-- 
rive at the height of learning which m.any 
men attain, I fhould at leafl have come near- 
it ^ and how ufeful would every thing that- 
I could have learnt be to- me at this prefent 
moment ! Oh ! if I could grow youngs 
again, how attentive would I be to every, 
thing that is executed by the hands or in- 
duftry of men ! There is not a trade nor an; 
art of which I would not have endeavoured i 
to learn fomepart." 

But of what ufe were thefe wifhes ? The 
misfortune was now pail remedy. It was^ 
therefore, his bufmefs to exert himfelf in 
fupplying by his own invention what he 
wanted in fkill ; and this, in effedl'j.was the-: 
courfe that he took. 

Without knowing whether he was right ' 
or wrong, he cut off the tops of two ot 
three young trees ; in the middle of the 
trunk he made a fmall flit, in- which he 
ftuck a young twig from the cocoa-nut rreev. 
he then covered round with thin bark th« 

placcu ' 



ROBIN 5 ON CHUSOE. J9 

f kce where he had made the flit, and waited 
with impatience for the refult of his labour^ 
This, too, fucceeded with him. After fome 
time the fuckers began to bud, and now he 
iiad found a method to produce a whole grove 
of cocoa-nut trees. 

Here was a frefh caufe for rejoicing, and 
for entertaining the moQ. lively gratitude to- 
wards our Creator, who has implanted in the 
nature of things fuch virtues and qualities, 
that living creatures are no where in want of 
means to preferve themfelves, and rendei 
their condition agreeable.. 

Both the old lama and the young were in a. 
Ihort time grown as tame as dogs. He began, 
therefore, by little and little, as occafion re* 
quired, to make them ferve for carrying 
burthens,. efpecially whenever he went out for 
any thing that would have been too much 
trouble for himfeif to carry.. 

Rich. Ay ; but how could he take them, 
with him when there was no way for theoi 
to go out of the enclofure ^ 

Mf.BilL I forgot to tell you, that,, in the 

new 



4^ T H E N E W 

new wall, at a part where it touched a clofe 
thicket, he had left an opening where a lama 
eould barely fqueeze itfelf out. This hole 
was not to be feen from without, and every 
evening Robinfon clofed it up with branches 
ftrongly interwoven together. 

It was delightful to fee Robinfon coming 
home to his habitatbn, and his lama walking 
before him. She was foon able to find' the " 
way as well as her maftcr, and when ihe 
came to the little door (lie flopped firfl to 
be unloaded, and then crept in upon her 
brliy, Robinfon following by the fame paf- 
fage. Then was the joy of the young la- 
mas complete ; they expreffed their fatis- 
fadlion by jumping and bleating, and would 
run firft to their mother to welcome licr 
hom.e, then to their mafler to carefs hrm 
alfo. B-obinfon, on fuch occafions, would 
mix his joy with theirs, as a father rejoices 
over his children when he clafps them in his 
arms once more after an abfence of fome 
lime. 

Mr, Rcfe. It mufl be confefTed, there is - 

fome- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 41 

fomething very mftaidtive and alFedling in 
this gratitude of animals towards a man who 
has done them a kindnefs. 

Mr. Bill. There are feveral examples of 
It which are extremely flriking, and would 
almofl induce ijS to believe that fome beafts 
are really endued with thought like men, if 
we had not, on the other hand, proofs of the 
contrary, 

Henry, Ay ; for inftance, the lion and the 
man mentioned in Sandford and Merton 
— what was the man's name ? 
Rich, Androcles, 

Henry, The fame. He had plucked a 
thorn out of the lion's paw. 

Geo, There was a good lion ! He was 
{0 fond of Androcles, who had done him that 
fervice ; and ever after, in return, he did the 
man no harm when he had it in his power 
to devour him. If they were all like him, I 
fhould like to have a lion myfelf. 

Rich, For my part, I like much better 
the dog that belonged to a Swifs. 
Harriet. What dog ? 

Rich. 



42 THE NEW' 

Rich. Have you forgot him ? The dog 
that faved the lives of two men. 

Harriet, Dear Richard^ tell us that ftorj^ 

Rich, There was once a man in Switzer- 
land, where thofe high mountains the Alps 
are. Well, the man climbed up to the top of 
one of them, which v/as prodigious high ; 
Oh, it was as high, as high — as if you were 
to put St. Paul's upon itfelf ten times over, 

Geo, You leave out one thing, brother ; 
he took a guide with him. 

Rich, Certainly, he took a guide — well, 
and the guide took his dog. Now, when 
they had reached the top of the moun- 
tain 

Geo, Yes, and the mountain was covered 
with fnow 

Rich, Pray hold your tongue — Well, then, 
the mountain was all covered with fnow. 
Isow, when they were almoft at the top, the 
gentleman flipped, and the guide going to 
his afliftance flipped too, and fo then they 
both flipped and flid until they were within 
a few yards of the edge of the precipice, 

from 



ff ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

from which they would have fallen down al- 
moft a mile before they touched the bottom. 
But then the good dog feized his mafter by 
the ikirt of his coat, and held him faft, fo 
that he could not flip any farther, and he 
held the gentleman until they both got up. 
I Geo. Well, now you mufl: tell us what 
the gentleman faid ; I have not forgot it. 
. Rich, Nor I neither. He invited the 
guide to come and fee him as often as he 
pleafed at his houfe, and charged him never 
upon any account to forget bringing his dog, 
as he intended, whenever he came, to give 
him a good belly-full. 

Harriet, And did the gentleman do fo > 

Rich, Yes, certainly : as often as the guide 
vifited him, he entertained him in the belt 
manner he could, and was always fure to give 
the dog a full belly. 

Harriet. That was well done. 

Mr, Bill. Well, my dear children, we 
have loft fight of Robinfon. Shall we Hop 
here for this evening ? 

Geg, 



4-4 T H E N E W 

Geo. Oh, dear papa, no. A little more 
of Robinfon, let it be ever fo little. 

Mr, Bill. By this time his bricks were 
hard enough to be ufed. He looked, there- 
fore, for fome chalky earth, with which, in- 
dead of lime, he intended to make mortar 
for his wall ; and he found fome. In the 
next place, he made himfelf a trowel of a 
flat flone, and, being refolved to have every- 
thing complete that belongs to a bricklayer, 
he went fo far even as to make a fquare and 
a plummet, but not in a bungling manner ; 
as perfect as pofiible. You know, I fuppofe, 
what thofe things are ? 

Eciw. Oh, as to that matter, we have feen 
them pretty often. 

Mr. BilL Having, therefore, finifhed all 
the preparatives requifite for his mafonry, he 
made his lama bring home the bricks that 
he had occafion for. 

Rich. But how was he able to put the 
bricks upon the lama ? 

Mr. Bill. Why, indeed, you would not 

ealily 



-i 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 4.5. 

cafily gucfs how he contrived if, therefore 
I think it beft to tell you at once. 

He had long obferved that it would be 
a very great advantage to him to know 
fomething of the ufeful rrt of weaving 
wicker panniers -, but he had taken fo little 
notice in his youdi x)f the manner in which 
bafket-makers v/ork, that he knew as much 
of this art, which, neverthelefs, is tolerably 
eafy, as he did of all the other ufeful arts, 
that is to fay, he knew nothing about it. 

However, as he had once fucceeded in 
making an umbrella by this fort of weav- 
ing, he frequently afterwards amufed him- 
felf in his leifure hours with trials of the 
fame kind, by dint of which he difcovered 
at length the whole myfcery of the art, fo 
as to be able to make a pretty tight pan- 
nier. Two of thefe he had woven on pur- 
pofe for his lama to carry. He faftened 
them together with a firing, and laid them 
upon the lama in fuch a mianner that they 
hung down one on each fide. 

Vol. II. C Geo. 



46 T H E N E W 

Geo. Oxh, papa! I ihould like to learn 
bafket-making. 

Mr, Bill. Wellj then, I will ipeak to a 
baf]<:et- maker, the firft time I meet one^ to 
come here and give you Ibme lefTons. 

Geo. Oh, that will be charm.ing ! And 
then I will make a beautiful little work 
bafket for Harriet. 

Harriet. And I will learn to make them 
too, papa, fhan't I ? 

Mr, Bill, By all means s it can do you no 
harm. In efFedc, we fometimes have an 
idle hour upon our hands, when this bal- 
ket-making would coiTiQ in quite k-^^QR- 
ably. 

Robinfon then fell to his bricklaying, in 
which he fucceeded tolerably well. He 
had now built up one of the fide walls of his 
kitchen, and laid the foundation of the 
other, when all of a fudden there happened 
fom^ething which he had never dreamt of, 
and which terribly difappointed all his 
plans. 

RtcL 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

Rich, I wonder what that accident 
was, 

Harriet, Oh ! T know it. The favages 
c anne and ate hina up. 

Geo, Mercy on us ! was it that^ papa ? 

Mr, Bill, No, it was not that. But it 
was foniething tiiat frightened him alnnoft 
as much as if the favao:es were come to 
roafl him alive. 

Rich. Dear vnt \ what was it ? 

Tvlr, Bill, It was night, and Robinfon 
on his bed of hay fiept foundly, with his 
iamas at his feet. The moon fhone out in 
all its fplendor, the air vvas clear and calm, 
and a profound filence reigned over all na- 
ture. Robinfon, fatigued with the toils of 
the day, w^as fallen into a fweet ilumber, and 
dreaming, as ufual, of his dear parents, 

when fuddenly but let us not clofe this

and gratitude to cur good Father vvho is in

NINTH EVENING.. 

71^ ^R. BILLINGSLEY having brought 
J. T J. the hiftory of the New Robinsoh 
Crusoe down to the end of the preceding 
evening, it now happened that bufinefs in- 
difpenfably called him aw^ay for feveral 
evenings fucceflively, and prevented him 
from refuming the ftory, much to the dif- 
appointment of his young family. 

They were quite impatient to know what 
this was that had happened to poor Robin- 
fon, and they would any of them have given 
their favourite plaything to be informed of 
the events of that dreadful night, concern- 
ing 



ROBINSON CRtTSOE. 49 

ing which Mr. Billingfley had fo long kept 
filence. Unfortunately, it was not in the 
power of any other perfon but their father 
to inform them, and he thought proper to 
fay nothing of it until he fhould have time 
to continue the ftory regularly as ufual. 

Their conje6lures were endlefs, and only 
ferved to puzzle them more and more. One 
guefied this thing, another that ; but none 
of their guelTes agreed entirely with the cir- 
cumllances which they already knew of this 
myfterious adventure. 

^'But why ihould we not know the whole?** 
faid fome of them, in a very piteous tone. 

"I have my reafons,"anfwered their father- 

The children were, by a prudent educa* 
tion, accuftomed to be fatisfied with this 
anfwer, and therefore prefTed no farther, but 
waited with a guarded impatience for the 
moment Vv'hen the caufe of their father's fi- 
lence fhould no longer exifl. Mean time, 
as it is eafy for a grown-up perfon to 
read the thoughts of children, Mr, BiU 
lingQey could clearly perceive what pafied: 
C 3 ia 



50 T H E N E W 

in their minds. The following refleffion 
was written^ as it were, upon the forehead of 
each of them : " Why does our papa refufe 
us this fatisfa(flion ? What reafons can he 
have for not gratifying our curiofity ?*' He 
thought proper, therefore, upon this occa- 
Hon, to convince them once more that he 
did not want the inclination to make them 
as happy as lay in his power, and to fliew 
them that he had reafons of importance for 
not continuing the flory. , 

" Prepare yourfelves," faid he, " to (qI 
off to-morrow morning very early on a party 
down the river for Greenwich. You have 
often wifhed to fee it, and to-morrow I pro- 
pofe to indulge you/' 

** Down the river ? — To Greenwich ? — In 
a boat ? — What I, papa ? — Shall I go ?-— 
And I ?" alked all the children with one 
voice ; and a general " Tes" having fatis- 
fied all their queftions, they ran, quite tran- 
Iported with joy, to communicate the news 
to their mama, and to make the neceflary 
preparations for their voyage. 

" To 



I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^l 

" To Greenwich ! to Greenwich ! Where 
are my half-boots ? Jenny, where are my 
gloves ? Quick ! the brufh ! the comb ! 
We are going to Greenwich! Quick! quick!" 
Nothing was to be heard all over the houfe^ 
but thefe exprefTions of joy and impatience. 

Every thing, therefore, was prepared for 
the next day's party ; and the yOung travel- 
lers, in the fulnefs of their joy, afked a thou- 
fand queftions, without waiting for a fingle 
anfwer. They were, at length, however, 
prevailed on to go to bed for that night, 
their impatience being fo great, .that they 
were already wifhing for the morning to fet 
out on their journey.. 

At length the morning appeared, and 
the whole houfe was in motion. Nothing 
was heard but knocking at each other's 
bed rooms ; fo that they were all very foon 
obliged to rife and drefs themfelves. 

When the whole party, old and young, 

were aflembled, and the former were al- 

moil devoured with careffes by the latter i 

Mr. Billingfley rubbed his eyes, and in a 

C 4 tone- 



52 T H E N E W 

tone of voice which breathed moil forrew- 
ful difcord to the accents of univerfal jo}?, 
he faid/^My dear children, if you would do 
me a favour, you would excufe me to-day 
from performing my promife." 

*^ What promife ? what promlfe ?" — and 
tach mouth that afked this queftion remain- 
ed open in anxious expedlation, accompa- 
nied with a fort of fright. 

Mr, Bill. The promife that i made to 
you of going to Greenwich to-day. 

The aftonifhment and confufion of the 
younger part of the company was complete. 
Not one could utter a fyllable. 

AIr» Bill. I have been thinking lad night 
that we fhould do vvrong to go on this par- 
ty to day. 

'The Children. Why fo, papa ? — — aad 
they could hardly fpeak for fobs. 

Mr. Bill. I will tell you, and then leave 
it to yourfelves to judge. In the firft place, 
we have had, for fome time paft, an eaflcrly 
wind (and, I find, it is in the fame point this 
morning;), which makes the river extremxly 

rough. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 
rough, and mud be very difagreeable to a. 
party that are going down. 

ne Children, But, papa, the wind may 
change ftill. 

Mr. Bill. Befides, I confidered, that, if 
we were to flop another month, we fhould 
fee many of the Eaft India fhips, that are 
to fail this year, dropping down to Dept- 
ford ; and I know two or three captains of 
them ; we might, perhaps> dine aboard of 
one, which would be very agreeable — would 
it not ? 

J'he Children, Yes, papa^ — but 

Mr. Bill. But I have flill a flronger rea- 
fon. You know, Charles and Arthur Stan- 
field, your firfl coufins, whom you havc^ 
never feen yet, are to come out of Che- 
fiiire fhortly, and fpend a month with us t 
would it not be infinitely better to v/ait for 
their comiing, and take them with usi" 
Would they not, as often as we fhould- 
fpeak to them of the agrceablenefs of our- 
party, figh and wifh that they had been: 
there too ? And, in that cafe^ would the

54 T H E N E W 

remembrance of our day's pleafure caufe us 
much fatisfadtion ? No; certainly not.. 
On the contrary, we fhould always be forry^ 
within ourfelves, that we had not done by 
them as we could wifli them to do with re- 
gard to us, were we a(5lually in their place 
and they in ours. Therefore, what fay . 
you ? 

A profound filence. 

Mr. Billmgsley goes on. You know, I ne*- 
ver broke my word with you ; fo that, if 
you infift upon it, we fhall fet off. But if 
you would, of your own accord, quit me of 
my promife, you would do me a kindnefs 5 
and you would do your coufins a kindnefs, 
and yourfelves. Therefore Ipeak — What is 
to be done ? 

*^We will wait" was the anfwer j and, con- 
fequently, the fine party of pieafure was put 
off till another time. 

It was eafy to be {ten that this vi6lory 
over themfelves had coft fome of them 
dear : thefe were far from being as chear- 
ful as ufual die reft of the day, Mr. Bil- 

lingfley 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55: 

llngfley took occafiorij therefore, towards 
evening, when they were ail afTembled, to 
fpeak to them in this manner : 

*' My dear children, v/hat has happened to 
you to-day, will happen to you frequently in 
the courfe of your lives. You will expedb 
to enjoy this or that earthly advantage 5: 
your hopes will appear as well founded as 
pofTible, and you will burn with impatience 
to realize them 3 but, in the very m.oment: 
when you think to touch this long-expecled 
happinefs, Divine Providence, which is fu- 
premely wife, will, in an inftant, difappoint' 
your defigns, when you fhall leall expend: it 5. 
and thus you will find your too fanguine 
hopes many, m^any a time fadly fruftrated*. 

" The reafons which your heavenly Fathers- 
will have to adt thus with you, will feldom 
appear to you io clearly and diftincliy as 
you have heard my reafons this morning; 
for putting off. our party to Green wicn ;. 
for God, being infinitely wife, looks to the. 
mofl remote futurity; and often, for our 
advantage, fufFers things to happen, the 
C 6- good: 



56 T H E N E W 

good effetSts of which we do not experience 
tintil long after, perhaps even in another 
world. 

" Now, if every thing were to happen per- 
fectly to your wlfli while you are young, and 
if you always obtained, at the exadl moment^ 
whatever was the cbje6t of your hopes, ob ! 
my dears, how much the worfe v/ould it be 
for you during the remainder of your lives ! 
How would your hearts be corrupted by 
fuch profperity j and how unhappy would 
your affedtions, thus corrupted, make you 
at a time when things fhould not go quiie 
to your liking ! And fuch a time will come, 
my dears ; it will come as certainly for you 
as it comes for all other men ; for hitherto 
there has never been a man in the world, 
v/ho could fay that things have always fue- 
ceeded with him completely, and according 
to the fulnefs of his wifhes. 

" In this cafe, then, what are we to do,my 
dear children ? — No more than this ; ae- 
cuftoin yourfelves, while you are young, to 
deprive yourfelves frequently of a pleafure 

which- 



ROBINSON CRirSOE. 57 

which you would have given the world t^ 
enjoy. This vidlory over yourfelves, of- 
ten repeated, will (Irengthen your under- 
flandings and your affections in luch fort, 
that, for the future, you will be able to fup^ 
port, with unfliaken fortitude, whatever a 
wife and benevolent God (hall appoint you 
for your good. 

" What I have faid, will teach you, my 
dear children, to interpret many inftances of 
our behaviour, which to you appear unac- 
countable, and which we, who are advan- 
ced in years, commonly adopt with regard to 
you. You have, no doubt, often been fur- 
prifed at our refufing you a gratification for 
which, perhaps, you longed ardently. 
Sometimes we have told you the reafons of 
our refufal ; that is, when you were capable 
of underftanding them : and fometimes, on 
the other hand, we have not told you them ; 
for inftance, when you were too young to be 
able to underftand them. And why did 
we do fo ? Often merely on purpofe to 
cxercife your patience and moderation, vir- 
tues 



58 THE NEW 

tues fo necelTary to all men, and to pre- 
pare you for the fubfequent accidents of 
your lives. 

*' You know now, alfo, why, for thefe 
few days paft, I have forborne the recital 
of Robinfon Crufoe's Hiftory. I might 
certainly have found, at lead, fufficient 
time to clear up to you the adventure with 
which I left off, and concerning which you 
have been, ever fmce, in a difagreeable un- 
certainty : but, you fee, I did not tell you 
another word about it, though you frequent- 
ly afked me, and it is always againfl my will 
that I refufe you any thing. Now, why did. 
I do thus, Harriet ?" 

Harriet, Becaufe, papa, you had a mind: 
to teach us patience. 

Mr. BilL Very right ! And mod cer- 
tainly, if ever you have caufe to thank me 
for any thing, it will be for accuiloming you 
thus to give up without regret any thing of 
which you have before ardently defired the 
poiTeflion. 

A few days m.ore palled without any talk 

of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

of going on with the ftory of Robinfon Cru- 
foe ; hut, at length, the hour fo earneftly 
longed for arrived, when Mr. BiUingfley 
was no longer prevented by bufinefs or other- 
wife fronn fatisfying the general wifh. He 
went on, therefore, without interruption, in 
thefe words : 

It was night, as I told you at my leaving 
off, and Robinfon was quietly ftretched on 
his bed of dry grafs, with his faithful lamas 
at his feet. A deep calm overfpread all the 
face of nature, and Robinfon, according ta 
his cuflom, was dreaming of his parents, 
when, all at once, the earth fhook in an un- 
common manner, and a rumbling noife was 
heard, together with dreadful cracks, as if 
many dorms burft forth all at once. Rubin« 
fon ilarted up in a fright, and jumped out 
of bed without knowing what was the mat- 
ter, nor where he was going. At this mo- 
ment happened a. dreadful fhock of the; 
earth, which was fucceeded by fevcral 
others equally violent. The rum-bling noife 
alfo continued,. which feemed to come from 

under 



6o THE NEW 

under ground. At the fame tiine arofe z 
furious hurricane^ which tore up trees, and 
even rocks, and agitated the very depths of 
the roaring fea. All the elennents Teemed 
to be at war with each other, and nature to 
approach her final difiblution. 

Robinfon, almoft frantic with terror, ran 
out of his cave into the fpace before it, and 
the affrighted lamas followed. Scarce were 
they out, when a piece of the rock, which 
refted over the cave, fell down upon the 
bed which Robinfon had juft left. Fear, 
now, lent him wings j he fled with precipi- 
tation through the fmall opening in his 
wall of trees, and the lamas, no lefs terrified', 
were clofe at his heels. 

His firft intention was to fecure himfelfup'- 
on a neighbouring mountain, on the top of 
which was a plain perfedlly open, that he 
might not be in danger of the falling trees. 
He was going to run thither, when fuddenly 
he beheld, to his infinite terror and furprife^ 
that very fame fpot of the mountain open 
with a huge gap, and vomit forth fmoke, 

fire;j 



KOBINSON CRUSOE, 6l 

fire, cinders, ftones, and a burning llream 
of what is called lava. He could fcarcely 
tell which way to run from this dreadful 
eruption, as the bui-ning lava rolled down 
the hill like a river, and great fragments of 
rock were hurled into the air, in every di- 
redlion, and fell as thick as hail. 

He ran towards the fea-fide ; but here he 
beheld a new fcene no lefs terrible. A dread- 
ful whirlwind, which blew from all quar- 
ters of the iky, had driven together a large 
quantity of clouds, and heaped them, as it 
were, one upon the other. Their own 
weight burfl: them at length, and the confe- 
quence was fuch a deluge of rain, as, in a 
momenta laid the whole country under 
water. 

Robinfon faved himfelf with difficulty by 
climbing up a tree j but his poor lamas were 
carried off by the violence of the flood. Ah 1 
how it went to his heart to hear their plain- 
tive bleatings ; and how willingly would he, 
at the rifk of his own life, have endeavoured 
to fave them, but that the rapidity of the 

torrent 



62 T H E N E W 

torrent had already carried them far beyond 
his reach 1 

The earth continued to fhake flill for a 
few nninuteSj after which there fell^ all at 
once, a dead calm. The winds fubfided ; 
the opening of the mountain ceafed by de- 
grees to vomit fire ; the rumbling under 
ground was heard no more ; the fliy cleared 
up, and all the waters ran off in lefs than a 
quarter of an hour. 

Geo. (fighing heavily) Ah ! thank God, 
ic is all over ! Poor Robinfon and ^t poo? 
lamas ! 

Harriet. For my part^ I was terribly 
frightened. 

Charlotte. What occafions thefe earth- 
quakes, papa l 

Rich, Papa has explained that to us 
long ago, but you were not here. 

Mr. Bill. Tell her, Richard. 

Rich. There are a number of great holes 
under the earth, like caverns, and thefe are 
filled with air and exhalations. Befides, 
tliere are within the earth all manner of 

thing_s 



K B I N S O N CRUSOE. 63 

things that cafily take Ere, as fulphur> 
pitch, nitre, and the like. Theie begin 
ibnietimes to heat and take fire, when moif- 
ture happens to accompany them. 

Geo, Moillure ? Can wetnefs, then, occa- 
fion any thing to take fire ? 

Rich. Certainly. Have you never feen, 
when mafons throw cold water upon burnt 
lim.e-ffones, how they begin immediately to 
boil and fmoke as if they were upon the 
lire, and yet there was no fire near them ? 
Well, in the famie manner things take fire 
under ground as foon as water penetrates 
to them I and then, when they burn, the 
air which is in thefe great caverns expands 
lb prodigioufly that there is no longer room 
to contain it, fo that, ftriving forcibly to find 
a paffage out, it fhakes the earth, until, at 
length, it makes an opening fomewhere, 
and through this opening it comes forth like 
a hurricane, drawing with it a quantity of 
burning and melted matter. 

Mr. Bill. And this matter, which confifts 
of ftones, minerals, and unduous bodies, all 

melted 



64 T H E N E W 

meked together, is what we call lava. I have 
fomewhere read that a man might make a 
little mountain for himfelf that would vomit 
fire. If you rtiould like that, we will make 
the experiment fome day. 

^he Children. Oh, yes, by all means, dear 
papa. 

Rich, x\nd how is that done ? 

Mr. Bill, You need only dig a hole in 
the ground where it is moifr, and put into 
it fom.e fulphur and filings of iron. This 
mixture will heat and take fire of itfelf, and 
then you have a burning mountain in mi- 
niature. We will make a trial of it the 
firft idle day. 

While Robin fon was coming down from 
the tree on which he had faved himfelf, his 
mind v/as fo depreiTed with the calamity 
which had juft fallen on him, that he never 
once thought of thanking for his frefh de- 
liverance that Being v/ho had before, more 
than once, preferved him when in the mod 
imminent danger of perifhing. His fitua- 
tion was, indeed, now, to the full as mife- 

rable 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

rable as ever ir had been. His cave, the 
only place of refuge that he had hitherto 
found, was, in all probability, a heap of 
ruins ; his dear and faithful lamas he had 
feen, with his own eyes, carried off by the 
fiood, and without doubt they muft have 
perifned ; all his paft labours were demo- 
lifhedj and his plans' for the future difap- 
.pointed I The mountain, it is true, had 
ceafed to throw up fire, but from the gulph, 
which was ftill open on the top of it, there 
ilTued forth a thick black fmoke, and it was 
very pofiible that this m.ountain might now 
continue to be always a volcano. In that 
cafe, how was Robinfon to enjoy one m.o- 
ment's fecurity ? Might he not reafonably 
dread a frefn earthquake, or a frefh erup- 
tion, every day ? 

Thefe melancholy ideas completely over- 
powered him. He funk under the weight 
of his miferies, and, inftead of turning him- 
felf towards God, the only fource of true 
confolation, he thought of nothing but his 

future 



66 T H E N E W 

future mifery, which appeared to him infi- 
nite both in weight and duration. 

Exhaufted with anguifh and difconfifort) 
he leaned againft the tree, and, from his 
pained bieafl, he uttered fighs^or rather deep 
groansj of diftrefs. He remained in this po- 
fition, the pidlure of defpair, until the dawn 
told the approach of day. 

Geo, (to Mr, Meredith.) I fee now that 
my papa was right. 

Mr. Mered. In what ? 

Geo. I was thinking lately that Robin- 
fon was altogether reformed, and that Pro- 
vidence mjght fafely order things lor his 
deliverance from the ifland 3 but in anfwer 
to that my papa obferved, that our hea- 
venly Father knew every thing beft, and 
that it was not for us to judge in fuch cafes. 

Mr. Mered. And now? 

Geo. Why, now I fee plainly that he had 
not the confidence in his Maker which he 
ought to have had, and, therefore, that God 
did well in not delivering him yet. 

Edw, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

Edw. So I think too. I mud own, I 
am far from liking him now fo well as I did 
fome time agOc 

Mr, Bill. Your obfervation, my dear 
children, is perfedly juft. It is true, we 
fee plainly that Robinfon has not that fimn, 
unalterable filial confidence in his Maker 
which he naiurally ought to have afrer fo 
many proofs of his wifdom and gocdnefs 
as he had experienced ; bur, before we 
condemn him on this head^ let us firil; put 
ourfclves in his place for a miOm-ent, and 
afk our own hearts if we iliould have acted 
better under the fame circumftances. What 
think you, Edward ? If you had been Ro- 
binfon, would vou hare had more coura^^e 
than he ? 

Edw, (hefttatifig.) I can't fay. 
Mr. Bill. Recollect the time when yoii 
had fore eyes, and we put bliflers behind 
your ears. Do you remem.ber how difpi- 
rited you were at times ? And yet it was 
but a fhort-lived pain ; it lafted but two 
days. I know, indeed, that you have more

fenfe now, and would bear the pain better ; 
but could you alfo bear with filial fubmif- 
fion every thing that Robinfon was forced 
to undergo ? — What think you, my dear ? 
Have I not fome reafon for doubting upon- 
that fcore ? 

Your filence is the befl anfwer to mf- 
quefdon. As, thank Heaven, you have 
never been in a fituation like that of our 
poor friend Robinfon, you cannot tell what 
would be your fentiments if you were; there- 
fore, all that we can do at prefent is to ac- 
cuftom ourfelves, in the flight misfortunes 
which we perhaps mufl experience, to turn 
our eyes towards Heaven, and be ever pa- 
tient and full of confidence. Our hearts 
will then be more and more frrengthened 
every day, fo as to bear with due refigna- 
tion even the greateft fufferings, if our hea-- 
venly Father ihall think proper to appoint 
them to us. 

At length the day appeared, and its new- 
born light, while it fpread joy over all na- 
ture, found poor Robinfon flill leaning 

againfl 



fM

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

againft the tree, in a fituation truly deplo- 
rable. Sleep had never clofed his eyelids^ 
one gloomy thought alone abforbed his 
whole foul i he had afked himfelf a thoufand 
times the forrowful quefcion, " What will 
become of me J" At length he fet himfeif 
in motion, and daggering as he walked, like 
a man who is half afleep, he arrived, after 
fome time, at the ruins of his habitation^ 
But what joyful emotions feized his breafl, 
when, all at once, as he came up towards 
the willow enclofure— what think you ?— 
his dear lamas, fafe and found, cam.e jump- 
ing to meet him! At firfl he could not 
believe his eyes, but his doubts were foon 
fatisfied. The lamas ran up to him, licked 
his hands, and exprefled their joy at feeing 
him again by bleating and fl^ipping about. 
. Robinfon's heart, which, until that mo- 
ment, had feemed infenfible and frozen, was 
now awakened. He looked at his lamas, 
then up to Heaven ; and tears of joy, gra- 
titude, and repentance for his want of faith, 
bede\ved his cheeks. He now patted and 
^ 2 carefTed 



«^ THE NEW 

.carefled his old friends a thoufand times, 
and, accompanied by them, went to fee 
what was become of his habitation. 

Henry, But how were the lamas faved ? 
Mr, Bill. We may fuppofe that the flood 
had carried them to fome rifing ground 
where the waters were not quite fo deep, and 
as they ran off afterwards as rapidly as they 
had fallen from the clouds, the lamas were 
very foon able to return to their habitation. 
• Robinfon then fcood in the front of his 
cave, and, to add to his confufion, found the 
damage her-e alfo by no means fo confider- 
able as, in the height of his defpondency, 
he had imagined it. The ciehng, which 
confifled of one piece of rock, had, it is 
true, tuinbled down, and in its fall brought 
fome of the neareft earth along with it; 
yet, after all, it appeared not impoffible to 
dear the cave of thefe ruins, and then his 
dwelling-place became twice as fpacious and 
convenient as it was before. 

To this muft be added another circum- 
Hance, which plainly dcmonftrated that Di- 
vine 



R0BIT5S0N CRU SOE. 7I 

vine Providence had ordered events thus, 
not to punifh Robinfon, but rather exprefsly 
for his prefervation : for when he had more 
clofely examined the Ipot where the prece 
of rock had been fufpended, he, to his no 
fmall terror, perceived it to be furrounded 
on every fide by a foft earth, and, confe- 
quently, that it could never have been firmly 
placed J it was, therefore, likely enough to 
fall down by its own weight fooner or later. 
Now this Divine Providence forefaw, and 
perhaps,, moreover, forefaw that the -piece 
of rock would fall precifely at a time when 
Robinfon was in the cave. But, as the alJ 
wife and good Creator had appointed to 
this man a longer life, he had, from the 
creation of the world, fo formed the earth, 
that exaflly at that time, and in that ifland, 
there ihould be fuch an earthquake. Even 
the rumbling noife under ground, and the 
roaring of the hurricane, how terrible fo- 
ever they had founded in the ears of Ro- 
binfon, were circumflances that contributed 
to fave him ; for, had the earthquake come 
D 3 on 



72 T H E N E W 

on without any noife, Robinfon, in all like- 
lihoodj would not have av/akened, and then 
the fall of the rock would certainly have 
put an end to his life. 
. Thus, nay children. Heaven took care 
of hinn at a time when he thought himfelf 
forfaken, and even made thefe dreadful ac- 
cidents, which Robinfon looked upon as his 
greatefl misfortune, contribute wholly to 
his prefervation. 

, This happy experience of heavenly mercy 
you will have frequent opportunities of 
gaining, if you widi to remark the ways by 
which Providence will condud you. In all 
jhe unfortunate fi tuations of life which it 
jmay be your lot to fall into, you will find 
thefe two things ever true ; namely, 

In the firfl place, men always reprefent 
%o themfelves the evil which happens as 
greater than it really is. 

Secondly, that all our misfortunes are fent 
to us by our merciful Creator for wife and 
good reafons, and that, confequently, in the 
end, they will ever contribute to our real 
happinefs*

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 



TENTH EVENING. 

J^R. BILLINGSLET goes (?;?.— Robin- 
fon, who for fome time pad had ufed 
the cuflom of joining prayer with his la- 
bour, began by throwing himfeif on his 
knees to thank God for his late deliverance; 
after which he chearfuUy fet about his work, 
which was to clear his cave of the ruins. 
It was but a flight taflc to remove the 
earth and the gravel, but there remained 
flill the great piece of rock, which had been 
under all. It is true, it was broken in two; 
but even in this ftate it feemed to require 
mo!-e than the ftrength of one man to dif^ 
lodge it. 

He tried to roll out the fmalleft of the 
two pieces, but in vain : the talk was too 
much for his ftrength. An attempt fo far 
from fucceeding difcouraged him once 
more. He did not know what to try next, 
D 5 Rich, 



74 T H E N E W 

Rich. Oh, I know what I fhould have 
done. 

Mr. Bill, What? 

Rich. I would have made a lever, or a 
crow, fuch as the men had the other day 
when they rolled a great beam into the barn 
yard. 

Geo. I was not by then. What is a lever^ 
or a crow, as you call it ? 

Rich. It is a long flout pole; one end 
they put under the beam or the ftone that 
they wifh to move, and then they place a 
little block or ftonc under the lever, but as 
clofe as poffible to the beam or whatever 
elfe is to be rolled along ; then laying their 
hands on the other end of the lever, which 
they prefs wich all their force upon the 
block, the beam is thus raifed up, and may 
be rolled without much trouble. 

Mr. Bill. I will explain to you the rea- 
fon of that another time : at prefent liften 
and hear what Robinfon did. ' _ 

After having meditated upon the matter 
a long time to no purpofe, the idea of the 

lever 



m 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

lever ftnick him too at lafl. He recol- 
ledled that when he was young he had fonne- 
times feen workmen make ufe of this in- 
flrument when they wanted to move 
very heavy loads, and he haftened to make 
a trial of it. 

This fucceeded. In half an hour he 
rolled the two pieces of ftone clean out 
of the cave, which four men with their 
hands alone could not have ftlrred from 
their places ^ and then he had the fatisfac- 
tion of feeing his dwelling twice as fpacious 
as before, and, what was of infinitely more 
confequence, quite fecure as far as the eye 
could examine : for now both the walls, 
and the cieling confilled of one hollow 
rock, in which there could no where be 
difcovered the fmalieft crack. 

Ed^jj. But, papa, what v/as become of 
his fpider ? 

Mr, Bill, I am glad you put me in m/ind 

of it. Poor fpider ! I had almoft forgot it. 

But, in truth, I can tell you nothing about 

it, unlefs that, according to ail appearance, 

D 6 if 



76 T H E N E W 

it was buried under the ruins of the deling 5 
at leafc, Robinlbn never law it again : how- 
ever, his other friends, the lamas, made liim 
amends for its lofs. 

He now ventured to turn his fteps to- 
wards the volcano, from which a black 
imoke ftiil continued to rile. He was 
afconifned at the quantity of m.elted mat- 
ter that had run from it 'on. all fides ; part 
of which was not cold yet. For this time,. 
therefore, he only admired, at a diftance, 
the grand, but dreadful fight of the fmo- 
king gulf, becaufe fear, and the lava, which 
was flill too hot, hindered him from ap- 
proaching nearer. 

Having remarked that the principal 
ftream of lava had taken its courfe towards 
the fpoc where his potatoes grew, he was 
much terrified at the idea that this torrent 
of fire might, perhaps, have laid wafte the 
whole place ; nor could he be eafy until he 
fatisfied himfelf on this head. He went, 
therefore, to the fpot, and found, to his great 
joy, the whole plantation fafe and found. 

From 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

From that moment, he refolved, at all ha- 
zards, to plane potatoes in many different 
parts of his ifiand, in order to prevent the 
misfortune of feeing himfelf deprived of fo 
admirable a fruit by fome unlucky accident 
or other. It is true, winter, according to 
his reckoning, was now jufl at hand -, '' but," 
faid he to himfelf, '^ who knows whether 
thefe plants are not of the fort that will 
fland the winter r" . 

Having put this defigii into execution-, 
he began again to work upon his kitchen. 
Here alfo the terrible convulfion of nature 
which had jufl happened, was the means 
of procuring him a great advantage j for, 
you mud know, that the burning moun- 
tain had, amongfl: other things, thrown up 
a confiderable quantity of limeftones. 
Thefe are commonly burnt in a kiln before 
lime can be made of them ; but Iiere that 
was not necelTary, for the burning moun- 
tain had already been as good as a limekiln 
to them. 

Robinfon, therefore, had only to gather 

a fmall 



78 T H E N E W 

a fmall heap of thefe ilones, to throw water 
upon therrij and then to ftir the heap well 
about. Thus the lime was flaked, and 
made proper for the mafon's ufe. He then 
mixed with it a httle fand, fell to work im- 
mediately, and had realbn to be pleafed with 
his own clevernefs. 

In the mean time, the mountain had 
ceafed fmoking, and Robinfon ventured to 
approach the gulf. He found the fides 
and the bottom covered with cold lava ; and 
as he could not perceive the lead fmoke 
come out any where, he had reafon to hope 
that the fubterraneous fire was entirely ex- 
tinguifhed, and that, for the future, he 
fhould have no eruptions to dread. 

This hope having given him frelli 
ftrength and fpirits, he turned his thoughts 
towards laying in a ftore of provifions 
againil the winter. With this intent he 
caught, one after another, eight lamias, in 
the fame m.anner as he had caught the firfl. 
Ail thefe he killed, except one ram, which 
he kept alive to be company for his three 

tame 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

tame lamas ; and he hung up the greateft 
part of the flefh in his kitchen to fmoke. 
But firfl he had let it lie fome days in fait, 
becaufe he had remembered to have Cctn 
his mother do fo at home, when fhe made 
bacon. 

Here was a pretty good flock of provi- 
fions j yet ftill he dreaded left he fhould 
fall Ihort if the winter was fevere and lafted 
long. For this reafon, he would have ta- 
ken more lamas, but he found his method 
would no longer anfwer -, for the creatures 
had, at length, taken notice of his manner 
of noofing them, and were, therefore, on 
their guard : fo that he was obliged to in- 
vent fome new way of taking them. 

This way he foon found : fo inexhaufiible 
are the refources of the human mind, if 
properly exerted, in providing for its wants, 
and encreafing its happinefs. He had ob- 
ferved that the lamas, whenever they per- 
ceived him near the fpring, ran fwiftly to- 
wards a neighbouring coppice, in their v.^ay 
to v/hich they pafTed over a little hill. The 
farther fide of this hill was hedged, as it 

were. 



§0 T H E N E W 

were, with fmall thickets ; and clofe be- 
hind this hedge there was a defcent as flcep 
as a wall, and about a couple of yards- deep. 
The lamas, in their flight, always jumped 
clean over the hedge, and landed at the bot- 
tom of the hill ; and this obfervation de- 
termined him to dig a deep hole on this 
fpot, where the lamas jumped down, that 
they might fall into it and be taken. His 
indefatigable labour finiflied in- a day and 
a half this new work of his invention. The 
pit he covered over with green branches, 
and the next day had the fatisfadlion of fee- 
ing two tolerable large lamas taken in it. 

He now thought himfelf fufficiently pro- 
vided with meat. He would have been 
puzzled where to lay it all up during the 
winter, if the earthquake had not furnifhed 
him with a cellar in every refpedl complete : 
for clofe by his cave another piece of the 
hillock had lunk about two fathom in 
depth, and thereby formed a fecond cavern, 
opening, as well as the firft, into his enclo*- 
fure. He had now his dwelling apartment, 

kitcherv 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8l 

kitchen, and cellar, all adjoining each other, 
and placed as conveniently as if they had 
been planned and laid out by art. 

There now remained three things more, 
which done, he was to count himfelf fully 
guarded ar\d provided againil the expedled 
approach of winter : hay was to be made 
for his lamas j a ftock of wood to be laid 
up for firing J and all his potatoes were to be 
dug up, and lodged in the cellar. 

Hay he had colleded in a pretty large 
quantity, and (lacked it up in his court- 
yard, as haymakers do here ; and v/hen- 
ever he put frefli hay on it, he trod it down 
fo hard that the rain could not eafily foak 
into it. But here experience taught him 
a litde more of haymaking, though at the 
cxpence of fome labour and trouble. 

You mufl know, he had not taken care 
to dry the hay perfedly. Whenever this 
happens, and it is at the fame time prefled 
down tightly in the flack, it begins to heat, 
next to fmoke, and at length it takes fire. 
This was a matter that Robinfon had never 

heard 



82 T H E N E W 

heard of when he was young ; for he had 
never niiich troubled his head about farm- 
ing bufinefs -, ' but in his prefent fituation 
he learned how ufeful it is to remark every 
thing, and to collefl as much information 
as polTible, even though we cannot fore- 
fee how far it may, one day or other, become 
ufeful. 

His furprife was great, indeed, when he 
faw, all of a fudden, his haycock begin to 
•fmoke ; but he was ftill much more afto- 
nifhed, when, on thrufting his hand into it, 
he found the infide burning hot. He could 
not perfjade himfeif but that the hay was 
on fire, though he could not poffibly con- 
ceive how the fire could get in there. 

He took down the haycock, therefore, as 
fafl as poffibki but was very much fur- 
prifed to find no fire, and to fee that the 
hay was every where extremely hot and 
inoift. He was, therefore, at lafl, con- 
vinced, (as was really the cafe,) that the 
moifhire alone caufed the hay to heat, 
though he could, in no wife, conceive how 

that fhould be. 

Rich. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

Rich. I mud own I find it hard to ima- 
gine how wetnefs alone can make any thing 
heat. 

Mr, Bill. My dear Richard, there are a 
thoufand fuch efFecls as this in nature ; and 
human reafon, which hath been refleding 
on them for many ages, hath clearly difco- 
vered the true caufes of many of them* 
:Thefe ufeful difcoveries are cornprifcd in 
a fcience, of which, perhaps, you do not 
know the name. It is called Natural Phi- 
lofophy. There you may find the reafon 
of this remarkable effedl of moifture, as 
well as many other appearances in nature 
that are extremely fmguiar. And if you 
continue to apply yourfeif properly to the 
fciences which you are learning at prefent, I 
will teach you alfo that of natural philofophy, 
which will give you inexpreffible pleafure. 
Here it would be to no purpofe to intro- 
duce it, becaufe you could not underfland 
iWJiat I ihould fay to you. 

Robinibn then dried his hay afreih, and 
made it up into a freOi haycock, which 
could Aand fecure againft both wind and 

rain. 



THE NEW 

rain. To render it ftill more fecure,- he 
topped it with a covering of reeds, fcarce 
inferior in firmnefs to our thatch roofs. 

For fome days following, he employed 
himfelf in gathering as much dry wood as 
he judged he lliould want. After this, he 
dug up his potatoes, and found them a ve- 
ry confiderable flock. Thefe he laid up ' 
carefully in his cellar. Laftly, he fhook - 
the lem-on-tree, and brought home as ma^ ' 
BY of the fruit as were ripe, to preferve them ' 
too againft the winter ; and now he was 
freed from all' apprehenfions of want during 
the bad weather. 

But though it was almoil the end of 
Odlober, the cold, which had made Ro* ' 
binfon fo uneafy, was not to be felt in the ' 
leaft. Inilead of that, the weather turned 
to rain, and it rained fo inceflantly that the 
air feemed ta be changed into water. He 
did not know what to think of it. For a ' 
fortnight together, he never put h-is foot 
outfide of his cave, unlefs to go to the cel- 
lar, the hayflack, or the fpring, to fetch " 

vi^ftuah: 



KOBINS©N CRUSOE. 2^ 

vicluals and water for himfelf and his la- 
mas. The reft of the time he was obliged 
to pafs hke a prilbner. 

How heavily the hours crept on ! No- 
thing to do, and all alone ! My dear chil- 
dren, it is impoffible for you to imagine a 
greater mifery ! If any body could have 
given him a book, or pen, ink, and paper, 
he would, with great chearfulnefs, have gi- 
ven one day of his life for every fheet of 
paper. " Oh !" faid he now and then to 
himfelf, with a heavy figh, " how filly was 
I in my younger days to look upon reading 
and writing as fomething tirefome, and idle- 
nefs as fomething agreeable ! The mofl 
tedious book in the world would now be a 
treafure to me, and I would prefer a fheet 
Gf paper^ with pen and ink, to the pofleirion 
of a kingdom." 

During this wearifome time, necefTity 
forced him to have recourfe to all forts of 
employments which he had not hitherto 
tried. He had been meditating a long 
time whether it would not be pofTible for 

him 



gfr . T H E N E W 

him to make an earthen pot and a lamp r 
things which would have rendered his fitu- 
ation imcomparably better. He ran, there- 
fore, in the middle of the rain, to look for 
potter's earth ; and, having found a fuffi- 
cient quantity of it, he immediately began 

to work. 

The making of earthen velTels did not 
fucceed with him all at once-: he made ma- 
ny inefFedual trials at firft; but, having no- 
thing elfe to do, as often as his work was 
finifhed, and not to his liking, he amufed 
himfeif with breaking it to pieces, and be- 
ginning afrefh. He fpent a few days in 
this manner, his work affording him amufe- 
ment rather than trouble, until, at length, 
. his pot and lamp were finifhed fo complete, 
that it would have been ill-nature to break 
them again/ He placed them, therefore^' 
in his kitchen, not far from the fire, to dry 
gradually. After this, he went on making 
other pots, pans, and pipkins, of different 
fliapes and fizes -, and the more he pra6lifed 
this work, the more ready he became at it. 
The rain continued, in the mean time, 

without 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8/ 
without interruption. Robinfon, therefore, 
fawhimfelf under the neceffity of inventino- 
other domeilic labours to keep himfelf from 
the unpleafant effects of having nothing to 
do. His firfl taflc was to nnake a fiihino- 
net. He had laid in, beforehand, a pretty 
good flock of packthread, which came nov7 
very feafonably into ufe. As he took time 
enough, and had the patience to try a thincr 
ten times or more, which did not fucceed 
with him at firft, he found, at length, the 
true method of making the knots, and he 
became as clever at the work as any woman 
or girl in this country who praftifes making 
nets or purfes : for he had invented alfo an 
inftrument of wood, which he cut with his 
knife of flint, fom.ething in the form of a 
fpit ; and with this he contrived to make a 
net, which, for goodnefs and real ufe, was 
little inferior to our common filhing nets. 

It next came into his head to try whe- 
ther he could not make a bow and arrows. 
The thought of this fet him all alive, when 
he confidered the many great advantages 
that a bow would procure him ! With a 

bow 



8S T H E N E W 

bow and arrows he could kill lamas, he 
could fhoot birds, and — what was by far 
more important — with thefe he could de- 
fend himfelf in his dwelling place, if ever the 
favages came to attack him. Ke was all 
impatience to lee the bow finifhed, and ran, 
notwithftanding the rain and the wind, to 
look for the proper wood. 

For it was not every fort of wood that 
was fit for the purpofe ; it fiiould be at the ' 
fame time hard and fupple, that on the 
one hand it might be bent without much 
difficulty, and on the other, when benf, 
might endeavour to return to its former ftate. 

Rich. It fhould be ^/^/zV, papaj fhould 
it not ? 

Mr. Bill, The very thing. I did 'not 
know that you remembered the fignifica- 
tion of that word, and, therefore, I did not^ 
chufe to make ufe of it. 

Having, therefore, found and cut apiece 
of this fort of wood, he carried it home, and 
began immediately to work upon it. But, 
alas ! how did he then feel the want of a 

proper ,

!i O B I N S O N CRUSOE, S9 
proper knife ! He was obliged to cut twen- 
ty times to bring off as much wood as we 
could cut at once with a knife of fteel. 
Though he worked from, the rifmg to the 
fetting of the fun at this tafk without the 
leaft intermiffion, lie was obliged to be eio-ht 
whole days about it. I know feme people 
who would not have had fuch patience. 

Geo. (to the other cJoildren) Papa means 
us now. 

Mr, BilL George, you have jufl gueiTed 
it i and do not you think that I am right ? 

Geo. Why, yes, papa. But, for the fu- 
ture, I will take care to go on with whatever 
work I once begin. 

Mr. BilL You will do well. Robinfon, 
at leaft, found the advantages of doing (o. 
He had the inexpreffible joy of feeing his 
bow finilhcd on the ninth day ; and now he 
wanted nothing but a ftring and arrows. 
If he had thought of it when he killed the 
lamas, he would have tried, perhaps, to 
make ftrings of their guts i for he knew that, 
in Europe, it is common to make them out.

offlieepsguts. For want, therefore, of catgut, 
he twifled a ftring of packthread, and made 
it as flrong as poffible. After this, he pro- 
ceeded to make his arrows. 

What would he have given for a fmall 
piece of iron to point his arrows with ! But 
wifliing was to no purpofe. As he flood at 
the door of hi.j cave, confidering how he 
might fupply the want of iron points to his 
arrows, he turned his eyes, by chance, on 
the lump of gold which lay there ftill on the 
ground as a thing of no ufe. " Go," faid 
he, fpurning it with his foot, " go*, ufelefs 
metal, and become iron, if you wifh that I 
Ihould value you !" And, with thefe words, 
he turned away from it, not deigning to look 



at jt again. 



By dint of thinking on the fubje6l over 
and over again, he, at length, remembered 
to have heard that the favages of fome na- 
tions make ufe of fiili bones and fharp ilones 
to point their lances and arrows; and he re- 
folved to imitate, them in this refpecl : at 

the 



ROBINSON C R U S O E. 9I 

tliQ fame time he formed the defign of maL> 
ing a lance or fpear. 

Thefe two things were immediately put 
into execution. He ran to the fea-fide, 
and was lucky enough to find fome fifh 
bones and iharp flints, exadly fuch' as he 
wanted.. After this, he cut a long, flraight 
ilafF for the fpear, and returned home wet- 
to the very (kin. 

In a few days the fpear and the arrows 
v/ere finiihed. He had pointed the fpear 
with a fharp ftone, and the arrows with ilrong 
fiih-bones i to the other end of his arrows 
he tied feathers, to make them fly the better. 
He then tried how his bow would fhoot : 
though it wanted a number of things, which 
he could not poffibly add to it for want of iron 
tools, he i^und it, however, tolerably handy for 
ihooting birds, or other fmall animals. He 
did not even doubt but he fhould be able, 
with this bow, to wound a naked favage 
dangcroufly, provided the favage would let 
him come near enough. He had flill bet- 
ter reafon to be pleafed with his fpear. 

E ^ His 



gZ T H E N E W 

His earthen pots and his lamp feemed 
now to be fuEciently dry. He refolved, 
therefore, to make ufe of them. In the 
firft place, he put into one of his new pip^ 
kins a lump of fat, which he had taken out 
of the lamas that he killed. This fat he in- 
tended to melt, and ufe as oil for his lamp. 
But he had the mortification to perceive 
that the fat, as foon as melted, foaked 
through the pipkin, and filtered out, drop 
by drop, fo that very little remained in the 
pipkin. He concluded from thence, that 
the lamp and pots would have the fame de-» 
fedl, and confequently never be of any ufe 
to him i a coniedure which experience very 
foon verified. 

What a difagreeable accident ! He had 
made himfelf fo happy in thinking that he 
Ihould foon fpend the evenings pleafandy 
by the light of a lamp, and be able, once 
more, to tafte a diOi of broth -, but now all 
thefe fine hopes feemed to vanifh in a mo- 
ment. 

Henry. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

Henry, It was certainly a great vexation 
to fee fo much trouble loft. 

Mr. Bill. Without doubt it was fo; and 
fome people, that I know, would have been 
provoked to fling all the work away, and 
never meddle with pot-making again. But 
Robinfon was^ by this time, pretty well 
pradifed in patience, and had taken it ftrong- 
ly in his head that a thing fhould never be 
done by halves, while it was pollible to fi- 
niih it completely. 

He fat down, therefore, in his ftudying 
corner (for fohe called one of the corners of 
his cave, where he ufed to fit down when he 
had a mind to exercife his invention), and 
there he rubbed his forehead. " Whence 
comes it," faid he to himfelf, '' that the pots 
in Europe, which are made of earth as well 
as mine, are, neverthelefs, much more com- 
padt, and do not foak through ? — Why, that 
is becaufe they are glazed— Hum ! Glazed ? 
Now, what may that be properly, and how 
is it done?— Aha! I think I know now^ 
Yes, it rauft be fo ! Have not I read fome- 
E 3 where^ 



94 T H E N E W 

where, that fand and feveral other fubflances, 
fuch as earthen vefTels, are of the nature of 
glafs, and might be turned into real glafs 
by a ftrong fire ? It muft certainly be fo 
that they manage it : they put the earthen 
ware into a hot furnace, and when it begins 
to melt, they take it out left it fnould be en- 
tirely changed into glafs. Yes, yes, that is. 
the whole art. I muft do in the fame man- 
ner." 

' No fooner faid than done : he kindled a 
good fire in his kitchen^ and when it was in 
full blaze, he put one of the pipkins inta the 
very middle of it. However, it was not 
loiig there before — crack it went, and fplit 

In pieces.-^ "- Heyday !'' faid Robinfon, 

** who would have thought it ?'' 

He fat down again in his ftudying cor- 
ner. ^^ What could have been the reafoa 
of this P*' faid he to himfelf.— '' Have I 
ever met with any thing fim.ilar to this be- 
fore ?— Eh 1 certainly I have. In winter- 
time, when we have put a tumbler full of cold 
water or beer on a warm ftove, did not the 

glafe 



ROBINSONCRUSOE. 95 

glafs break immediately ? — Has it ever hap- 
pened that the gkfs did not break ? Yes, 
when it was put on the ftove before it was 
quite hot, or when we put a piece of paper 
under it. Very well : I am pretty fure of one 
thing : ay, ay, that muft be the cafe. . I 
muft take care not to put it upon the fire 
all at once, but to let it grovv^ warm firft. I 
mufl take care alfo that the fire do not come 
to one of the ends of it — A lucky thought I" 
cried he, quite overjoyed, and ilarting up to 
make a fecond trial. 

This fucceeded rather better. The pip- 
kin did not fplit -, but, then, on the other 
hand, it was not glazed neither. 

" How comes this ?" faid Robinfon to 
himfelf. " And yet I thought the fire was hot 
enough. Vv^hat can it poffibly want flill ?" 
After meditating a long time upon the mat- 
ter, he thought, at length, he had hit upon 
the reafon. He had made the experiment 
with a fire which was not clofed up in a 
flove or oven, but burned in the open air. 
This fire lofl its force too foon^ and was too 
E 4 much 



96 T H E N E W 

much fpread on every fide to heat the ear- 
then ware fufficiently for glazing it. Ro- 
binfon, therefore, determined to ftick to his 
principle of not doing things by halves, and 
to conftrudt a proper oven or furnace like 
thofe in the potteries ; but for this it was re- 
quifite that the weather Ihould be more fa- 
vourable. 

For, you muft know, it rained ftill incef- 
fantly j nor did the fky, at lad, begin to 
clear up till after the expiration of two 
months. Robinfon thought now that the 
winter was going to fet in -, whereas, behold 
ye, the winter was pall ! He could fcarce 
believe his eyes, when he faw every appear- 
ance of fpring — the grafs green and tender, 
the trees budding out and bloflbming, and 
frefh flowers beginning every where to 
blow ; and yet it really was fo. The thing 
was beyond his conriprehenfion, though he 
faw it clearly before his eyes* " This will be 
a warning to nne," faid he, " never, for the 
future, to deny any thing haftily that I do 
not underftand. ■'

Ajrs, Bill. Did not he go to bed when he 
had faid fo ? 

Geo. Oh ! mama^ we are none of us the 
leail fleepy. 

Mr. Bill. I am not very pofitive whether 
he did or not -, my information fails m.e in 
that refpedl. However, as I find nothing 
elfe remarkable in this day's occurrences, 
as they appear in the old hiftory of Robin- 
fon's adventures on the iOand, I prefum.c 
that, after thefe words, he actually did go 
to bed. And we will do the fame, that, 
like him, we may rife to morrow with the 
fun. 



ELEVENTH EVENING, 

QEORGE, Papa, I fhouid like to be in 
Robinfon's place now. 
Mr. Bill Would you really ? 

E 5 Geo. 



f S T H E N: E W 

Gee. Yesi for now he has every thing, 
that he wants, and lives in a fine country 
where there is never any winter. 

Mr, Bill. Every thing that he wants, has 
3ie } 

Geo, Yes : has not he potatoes and meatj. 
and fait and lemons, and fifh and turtle, and 
oyflers> and do not the lamas give him. 
milk ? He can make butter and cheefe 
now. 

Mr. Bill, So he has too, for fome time 
pad, though I forgot to mention it. 

Geo, Well, and then he has a bow and 
arrows, and a fpear^ and a fnug place to- 
live in. What more could he wifh ? 

Mr, Bill. Robinfon knew very well the 
value of all thefe good things, and thanked 
God for them -,. neverthelefs, he would have 
given the half of his remaining life for the - 
arrival of a fhip that would carry him to his 
own country. 

Geo, Ay ! why what did he v/ant ftill ? 

Mr. Bill. Many things -, an infinite deal ,; 
of things, not to fay every thing. He want- 
ed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 991 

ed thofe bleflings without which there can 
be no true happinefs here below, as fociety, 
friends, beings of his own ipecies, whom he 
might love, and by whom he might be, in 
his turn, beloved. Far from his parents,, 
whom he had fo feverely afflicted -, far from 
his friends, whom he could not hope ever to 
fee again i far from men, from all men, 
from all the world s alas ! in this m.elan- 
choly, what joy could he tafte, had he even, 
the richeft abundance poflible of all the 
good things which this earth affords ? Try^ 
my little friend, try only once, but for one 
fingle day, to- be quite alone in a folitary 
place, and then, you will know what a- life of 
foiitude is !• 

Befides, Robinfon was far from having- 
his many other wants gratified. His cloaths 
were falling by degrees all to rags ; nor did 
he know how he was to have new cloaths 
when thefe fhould be pad ufe. 

Rkh. Oh ! as to cloaths, he might ver^; 
well do without them in an ifland where it 
was fo hot, and where there was no winter. 
E 6 Uarrkt.. 



100 T H E N E W 

Harriet, Oh fie ! Would you have h\m 
go naked ? 

Mr, Bill, It is true, he had no occafion 
for cloaths to protedl him from the cold ^ 
but he had much occafion for them to 
guard his body from the infeds with which 
this ifland fwarmed, particularly muflci- 
toes. 

Edw, What are thefe creatures, thefe 
muikitoes ? 

Mr. Bill, A fort of fiies, whofe (ling is 
much more painful than that of ours. la 
whatever country they are found, they tor- 
ment the natives exceedingly 5 for their 
flings produce almoft as painful fwellings as 
thofe of bees or wafps do with us. Robin- 
fon's face and hands were almofl always 
fwelled with them. Now, what muit he ex- 
peft to fuffer when once his cloaths were 
worn out 1 and that time was coming very 
fail. 

This, together with his earned and long-- 
ing defire to behold his parents, and fociety 
in general, once more drew many a figh 

from 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. lOJ 

from him, when {landing on the fea-fhore, 
and looking, with moiftened eyes, over the 
boundlefs -ocean, he could diftinguifh no- 
thing but the lea and iky. How did his 
heart fometimes flutter v/ith empty hope, 
when, in the diftant horizon, he perceived a 
fmall cloud, which his imagination repre- 
fented to him as a fhip in full fail 1 And 
when, at length, he difcovered his miilake, 
how the tears would trickle from his eyes, 
and his heart feem ready to burfl: as he re- 
turned home fiowly to his habitation ! 

Harriet, He fhould have prayed for the 
coming of a fhip 3 perhaps his prayers 
might have been heard. 

Mr, Bill. He did io^, my dear Harriet, 
He prayed night and day for his deliverance 
from the defert ifland 3 but he never forgor> 
at the fame time, to add, " Not mine, O 
Lord ! but thy will be done." 

Harriet. Why did he add that ? 

Mr. Bill, Bccaufe he was now perfe6l]y 
convinced that the SupremiC Being knows 
much better than we do what is for our in- 

tereHs, 



102 THE NEW 

terefts. He reafoned thus : " If it be the 

good pleafure of my heavenly Father to let 
me remain here longer, he certainly has 
very good reafons for it, though I cannot 
fee them ; confequently, I ought to pray for' 
my liberty, barely on condition that his wif- 
dom fhall think it to be for my advantage/' 
Leil'aveflel Ihould happen any day to 
pafs or call anchor near the ifiand, at a time 
when he was not near the fea-fhore, he re- 
folved to fix, on the neck of land which 
jutted out towards the fea, a fignal by which 
all who lliould come in fight might be in- 
formed of his diftrefs. This fignal was no 
more than a pole, on the top of which he 
feftened a banner. 

Edw. Ay ! Where did he get the ban- 
ner ? 

Mr, BilL I am going to tell you. His 
jhirt was then in fuch a flate, that it was 
impoffible to wear it longer. He took,, 
therefore, thelargeft flip of it, iliaped it into 
a kind of banner or flag, and fixed it on the 
pole that he was tc ftick' up. 

He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I03 

He would have been very glad to put up 
alfo, on his pole, a label, with an infcription, 
to give a clearer idea of his diftrefs j but 
how was this to be done ? The only way in 
his power was to cut out the letters with 
his knife of flint. Next to this the queftion 
was, in what language the infcription ihould 
be. If it were Englifh, there might come 
by fliips of other nations, as Dutch, Spa- 
nifh, or French, and the people might hap- 
pen not to underfland it. Luckily he re- 
coUedled fome Latin words, by which he 
could exprefs what he wilhed. 

Geo, But would feamen underfland that ? 

Mr, Bill. The Latin language, you 
know, is common in all countries ef Eu- 
rope, and moft men who have received 
any education, know, at leaft, fome- 
thing of it. Hence Robinfon hoped, that, in 
whatever fliip paflfed that way, there might 
be one or two, at leaft, who would under- 
ftand his infcription. He, therefore, put it up. 

Rich, What was it, then ? 

Mr, Bill. Ferte opera rnijero Robinfon ! Do 
you underfl:and, George ? 

Ceo. 



104 THE N E W 

Geo. Yes, papa. Help the unfortunate- 
Rohinfon I 

Mr. Bill. Kis greateft inconvenience 
now was the want of fhoes and ftockings. 
They were fallen to pieces, and the muf- 
kitoes did fo furioufly attack his naked 
legs, that he knew not where to fly from 
them. His face, his hands, and his (ttt, 
were fo fwelled by the ftings of thefe infedls,, 
fince the raining feafon, during which they 
had multiplied prodigioufly, that he feemed; 
no longer to be the fame perfon. 

How often did he fit down in his fludy- 
ing corner, to think of fome way to cover 
hinifelf! but always to no purpofe. He 
had neither inftruments nor ikill to pro-- 
vide himfelf with what he wanted, and 
what he found fo indifpenfably neceffary. 

Thelkins of the lamas that he had killed 
appeared the readied means whereby he 
might clothe himfelf; but thefe fkins were 
flill raw and ftiff, and unfortunately he, had 
never troubled himfelf concerning the man- 
ner in which taiiners and curriers prepared 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. T05 

the raw hides ; and even if he knew how to 
do this, he had neither needle nor thread to 
few the leather, or make it ferve for any 
part of his drefs. 

Neverthelefs, neceflity was preffing. He 
could neither work by day, nor fleep by 
night, the flies did perfecute him fo incef- 
fantly with their flings. Som.ething mufh be 
done, or fome fortunate accident take place 
to hinder him from periihing in the moft 
miferable manner. 

Henry, In faft, to what purpofe were 
thefe miferable infeds created, fmce they 
^re only a trouble and torment to us ? 

Mr. Bill. Why, I might, in my turn, afk 
you, to what purpofe were we created, you^ 
and I, and other men ? 

Henry. On purpofe that we might be 
happy in the world, 

Mr. Bill. And what could have induced 
our Creator to propofe this object to himfelf 
in creating us ? 

Henry. His goodnefs, which is fo great 
that he did not defire to be happy alone. 

Mr. Bill 



1C6 T tt E NEW 

Mr. Bill. Very well, and do you no! 
think that thefe infedts alfo enjoy a fort of 
happinefs ? 

Henry. Yes, that I can eafily imagine;. 
We fee how they rejoice when the fun= 
fliines and it is pretty, hot. 

Mr. Bill. Right; and does not this rea* 
fon give you to underftand to what purpofe 
they were created ? Nannely, that they alfo 
may rejoice upon the earth, and be as happy 
as their nature will permit them. Is net 
this purpofe perfedlly confident with infinite 
goodnefs ? 

Henry, Yes 5 only I think that the Su- 
preme Being might have created fuch ani- 
n^als alone as do harm to nobody. 

Mr. Bill. Be thankful to your Creator 
that he has done no fuch thing. 

Henry. Why ? 

Mr. Bill. Becaufe, otherwife, neither you 
nor I nor any of us would ever have ex- \ 
ifted. 

Henry. How fo ? 

Mr. Bill. Becaufe we belong precilely to 

the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I07 

the moft devouring and deflru6live fpecies 
of animals in the world. All the other 
creatures of the earth are not only our 
flaves, but we even kill them at our plea- 
furej fometimes to eat their flefh; fome- 
times to have their fkins; fometimes be- 
caufe they are in our way 5 fometimes for 
other reafons which we could not eafily juf- 
tify. How much more caufe, therefore, 
would the infers have to afl^ why that cruel 
animal man was created ? Now, what would 
you anfwer to a fly that Ihould afk you this 
queftion ? 

Henr;^ (hefitating). Why — indeed I don'c 
know. 

Mr. BilL Now, for my part, I would 
fpeak to him in thefe words : " My friend 
Mr. Fly, your queftion is very inconfiderate, 
and fhews that you have not a thinking 
head, and that you know not the art of re- 
flexion; otherwife you would eafily have dif- 
covered, with the fmalleft grain of thought^ 
that the Supreme Being hath, merely of his 
goodnefs, created fcveral of his creatures in 

fuch

fuch a manner that one is obliged to live 
upon others: for, if he hadnot done fo> 
he could not have created by one half fo ^ 
many fpecies of animals as he has, becaufe 
grafs and the fruits of the earth would have 
been fuiEcient but for a few fpecies of liv- 
ing creatures. To the end, therefore, that 
all nature might be animated — that there 
might be every where, in the water, in the 
air, and on the earth, living animals which 
fhould rejoice in their exiftence, and to the 
end that one fpecies of creatures might not 
multiply too much to the deftrudtion of 
another, it was necelTary that our wife and 
good Creator fhould deftine fome of his 
creatures to furnifh the fubfiftence of others. 
Thou thyfelf, friend fly, doft feaft on the 
blood of other animals, and even on ours. 
"Why lliouidft thou take it amifs if the fpi- 
der catch thee in her web, or the fwallow 
devour thee as a fweet morfel ?" 

What think you, Henry? Would not 
the fly, if it were wife, be contented with 
this anfwer ? 

Henry. 

m 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. IO9 

Henry, I don't know, papa. I am con- 
tented. 

Mr. Bill. Well, now we will return to 
our friend Robinfon. 

NecelTity forced him to help himfelf the 
beft he could. He took the fkins, there- 
fore, and cut out of them with his knife of 
flint, but not without a great deal of trou- 
ble, firft a pair of fhoes, and then a pair of 
flockings. He could not few either of thems 
he was obliged, therefore, to content him- 
felf with making eyelet-holes in them, and 
lacing them to his legs and feet with a 
firings which was no doubt fubjed; to great 
inconveniencies : for though he turned the 
hair outwards, he flill felt a violent heat in 
his feet. Befides, the fkin, which was ftiff 
and hard, bliftered his feet, and took the 
fldn off at the lead attempt that he made 
to walk, and fo caufed him very great pain. 
However, he chofe to endure this rather 
than the ftings of the mufkiroes. 

Of another piece of flcin, which was vc-- 
ry lliff and a little bent, he made a 

mafk. 



no T H E N E W 

raafk, cutting in it two fnaall holes for the 
eyesj and another for the mouth, that he 
naight be able to breathe. 

And, Iince he had begun this work, he re- 
folved not to quit it until he had finifhed 
with making himfelf a jacket and trowfers 
of lamas (kin. It is true, this talk was 
much more difficukj but have we any thing 
without trouble ? and what is there in which 
we do not fucceed at lall, with the requi- 
fite patience and application ? Thus he alfo 
accomplilhed his defign, which filled him 
with inexprefTiblejoy. 

The jacket was compofed of three pieces, 
which were joined together by ftrings. 
Two of thefe pieces ferved for the arms, 
and the third for the body. The trowfers 
confifted of two pieces, one before and one 
behind, and they were laced at die fides. 
When the jacket and trowfers were finilhed, 
he put them both on, with the refolution 
never to drefs himfelf again in his old Eu- 
ropean cloaths, which were half torn to 
pieces, except upon the birthdays of his fa- 
ther 



y 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. l\t 

tker and mother, which he celebrated as fo* 
icmn feftivals. 

His drefs was then the mofl fingular 
that can be innagined : fronn head to foot 
covered in ikins, with the hair outwards ; 
inftead of a fword, a large hatchet of ftone 
by his fide j on his back a pouch, with a 
bow and quiver of arrows ; in his right 
hand a fpear almoft twice as long as him- 
felf, and in his left a wicker umbrella, co- 
vered with leaves of the cocoa-nut tree : 
laflly, upon his head, inftead of a hat, a 
cap of wicker-work, rifing in a point, and 
covered in the fame manner with fkins, the 
hairs outward. Imagine to yourfeives what 
a figure all this muft cut: nobody that 
faw him accoutered in this extraordinary 
equipage, would fufpedb him to be a human 
creature ; nay, he could not help laughing 
at himfelf, when, being on the bank of a 
rivulet, he faw his image in the water in this 
drefs for the firft time. 

After this, he refumed his potter's work. 

The oven was foon finiihed, and then he 

Vol. IL F had 



112 -T H E K E W a 

had a mind to try whether, by force of an -^ 
exceeding great fire, he could not produce a 
fort of glazing on his pots. He put them, 
therefore, and his pipkins into it, after which 
he made up by degrees fo great a fire, that 
the oven was red hot from one end to the 
other. This violent fire he kept up until 
evening, fullering it then to go out by de- 
grees, and being very curious to know the 
refult of his labour. But what, think ye^ 
was the refult of it? The firft pot that he 
took out was not glazed, notwithftanding all 
that he had done, nor the fecond . neither, 
•uor, in Ihort, any of them. But, at lafi, in 
examining one of the pipkins, he perceived, 
with equal joy and furprife, that this, and 
this alone, was covered at bottom with a. 
real glazing. 

This was to him a riddle which he could 
by no means folve. *' What reafon in th^ | 
world could there be," fald he, " why this 
fingle pipkin is a little glazed, and not one^ 
of the other velTels, though they were all 
made of the fame earth, and baked in one 

and 



R B I iM S O N C R W 3 O E. Ilj 
snd the fame oven ?"- — Pie thought and 
thought again, but he was a long time be- 
fore he could fee the leaft glimpfe of any 
thing that feemed likely to expiain the myf- 
tery. 

At length, he recolledled that there had 
been a little fait in this pipkin when he 
put it into the oven. He could not help 
thinking, therefore, that the fait alone muft 
be the caufe of the glazing. 

Rich. But was it really the fait, papa, that 
produced this effedt ? 

Mr. Bill, Yes : what Robinfon now dif- 
covered by chance has been long known 
in Europe ; the addition of fait is the true 
caufe why many things turn to glafs in the 
fire : fo that he only need have rubbe.d the 
earthen ware with fait water, or barely have 
thrown a little fait into the oven when heated, 
and immediately all his pots w^ould have been 
properly glazed. 

This, therefore, he refolved to try the next 

day. And now the fire blazed under his .oven, 

and already he had rubbed fome of his \Qiich 

^ ^ with 



IT4. ^ T H E NEW 

with fait water, and put dry fait in others, on 
purpofe to make the two experiments at the 
fame time, when, in the midfl of his work, 
he was interrupted by an accident which he 
had dreaded a long time — he was taken ill. 
He felt pains in his breafl and head, and 
a great wearinels all over his limbs, and was 
threatened with the mod terrible fituation 
that a man can poffibly experience. 

*' Good Heaven !" faid he to himfelf ; 
** what will become of me if I cannot rife 
out of bed ! if there is no compaffionate 
being to take care of me, and come to my 
alTiftance in my illnefs 1 no friend to wipe 
off the fweat of death from my forehead, or 
offer me any refrelhment ! — Heavens 1 what 
will become of me !" 

Sinking under the weight of his diftrefs, 
as he faid thefe words he fell to the ground, 
quite exhauded. 

Ah ! it was in this moment of trial that 
he had more occalion than ever to poffefs a 
firm and filial confidence in his heavenly Fa- 
ther, who is every where prefent, and fu- 

premeiy 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II5 

premely good. Deprived of all human af- 
fiftance, forfaken by his own Hrength, what 
remained to prevent his dying in mifery ? 
Nothing but the afiiftance of God ; no other 
fupport had he to expedt in the whole 
world. 

He was on the ground in an agony of 
dillrefs ; his hands were clalped itrongly 
together i and, unable to fpeak, unable to 
thinkjhe looked fledfaftly up towards heaven. 
*' Oh, Lord ! Oh, Lord ! Mercy !" was all 
that he could utter now and then, fetching at 
the iam.e time moft heavy fighs and groans^ 

But this ftate of anxiety did not fufter 
him long to remain inadive. He muftered 
up what flrengih he had ilill remaining, in 
order,if poflible^to place near his bed whatever 
he fhould moft want for refrelhment, that he 
might not be entirely deftitute of it, in cafe 
the (icknefs abfolutely prevented him from 
rifing. He was barely able to carry a cou- 
ple of cocoa-nut Ihells full of water, and 
place them befide his bed. He next laid 
fome roafled potatoes there, and four lemoi^s 
F J which 



Vib T H E N Ir W 

which he had flill remaining, and then, not. 
able to flir an inch farther, he fell down with 
wearinefs on his miferable bed. 

U it had pleafed his Maker to take him 
our of the world by a fudden death, how con- 
tentedly would he have yielded up his life! 
He even prayed that it might be foi but very 
icon he refleded that this prayer was not 
leafonabie. " Am I not a child of God r" 
fald he to himfeif , *^ Am I not thd work of 
his hands >■ h he not rny father, and a rea- 
der, wife^ and almighty father ? How have 
I, then, the boldnefs to prefcribe to him what 
he fnculd do with me ? Doth he not know 
beil what is good for me, and will he not 
adt fo as to allot m,e that which is good ? , 
Yes, he will ; God is benevolent, merciful^ 
and almighty. Be at reft^ then, O my foul ; 
turn thee to thy Maker in thofe moments of 
difcomfort-^towards thy God— who delivers 
from all diftrefles ! He will affiit thee, he will 
afliU thee, whether in life or in death 1" 

After thefe words he was fomewhat en- 
couraged, and raiftng himfelf upon his knees, 

he 



R O 3 1 N S O N C R U~ S O K. II7 

ht prayed with all the earneftnefs pcfiible, 
faying, " I refign myfeif to thee, O my 
heavenly Father ; I refign myfeif to thy fa- 
therly guidance ! Dlfpofe of me according to 
thy good pleafure. I will bear contentedly 
whatfoever thou allotted me -, only grant m.e 
ftrength to bear — it is all that I afli of thee. 
O merciful father, grant me patience under 
my aiiliclions, and an unihaken confidence 
in thee. Hear this prayer, this only earned 
prayer of thy poor child who is in mlfery; 
hear it for thy tender mercy's fake !'* 

At the fame time he was attacked with ^ 
violent ague. Though he covered hlmfelf 
all over with the dried lama ikins, yet he 
could not keep himfelf warm. This cold fit 
lafted full two hours, and was fucceeded by 
a hot fit, which was like a burning fire through 
all his veins. His breafl, by the violent 
beating of his pulfe, heaved and fank like the 
breafl of a perfon that is out of breath with 
running. In this terrible iituation he had 
fearce flrength enough to lift the cocoa-nut 
f4 ihell. 



Il8 T H E N E W 

lliell, with the water in it, to his mouth, that 
he might cool his burning tongue. 

At length a violent fweat broke out all 
over his body in great drops, and that afford- 
ed him fome eafe. When-, at the end of 
about an hour, it abated, he recovered his 
fpirits a little, and then he was diftreft with 
the idea that his fire would go out if frelh 
wood was not put on. -He crept, therefore, 
weak as he was, vipon all fours,, and threw 
as much wood upon the hearth as would 
be fufficient to keep in the fire until the next 
morning -, for night was now approaching. 

It was the word: night that ever he paifed 
in his life. The cold and hot fit of his sgue 
followed each other without intermiffion. 
He had a violent and continual pain in hjs 
head, and could not clofe his eyes the whole 
night. All this weakened him fo much, 
that m the morning he was fcarcely able to 
crawl towards the heap of wood to replenifh 
his fire. 

Towards evening his illnefs encreafed 

afreih i 



It B' I N S O hJ C R U S E. Tl() 

afrefh ; he tried again to go as far as the 
hearth, but for this time he found himfelf 
unable. He was obliged, therefore, to give 
up all thoughts of keeping in his fire ; and 
this, in effedV, foon became a matter of in- 
difference to him, as he now expe^fted death* 
to approach in a Ihort time. 

This night was as refllefs as the laft. In- 
the mean time the fire went out -, the re- 
mainder of the water that was in the cocoa- 
nut ihells began to fpoil, and Robinfon wa^ 
no longer able to turn himfelf in his bed. 
He thought he felt the approach of deaths 
and his joy on this account afforded him fuf- 
ficient ilrength to prepare himfelf for his ialt 
journey with a devout prayer. 

He again humbly aiked forgivenefs of 
God for his fins, and then thanked him for 
all the blellings that he had v^uchfafed him 
—unworthy as he was — during, the whole- 
Gourfe of his life. But, particularly, he 
thanked him for the afflictions which had 
been fent him for his amendmiCnt, and he 
scknowledged fincerely bow wholefome they 



I20 T H E NEW 

had been to him. Lallly, he prayed for the 
con-;fort and happinefs of his poor parents ; 
sfter which, he recommended his immortal 
foul to the eternal mercy of his God and Fa- 
ther. — He then fettled himfelf, and waited 
for death with joyful hope. 

And, indeed, death fcemed to advance fafti 
his pains encreafed, his breafl began to rat- . 
tie, and his breathing became more and more 
difficult. Ah I behold the will^ed-for mo-= 
nient ! It feems to come at length. A pain^ 
fuch as he had not felt bt:fore» feized his 
bread ; he fuddenly flopped breathing, fek a 
convulfive fhuddering, funk down on his 
bed, and was deprived of fenfe and motion. 

All the young company remained fiient for , 
a pretty long time, ar^ by their forrow Shew- 
ed the refpecft that they bore to the m.emory 
of their friend whom they had never feen-« . 
*' Poor Robinfcn !" cried fome of them, 
%hing. " Heaven be praifed !^' faid others ; 
"-he is now delivered out of all his pain !'' 
And thus they feparated for that evening, ra- 
ther more quietly and with more appearance 
cf thoughtful nefs than ufual.

TWELFTH EVENING,

will you read us this evening ? 

Mr.BUL You all feem to expect, my

What fay ye ? Shall I go on with the ad- 
veniures of Robinfon Crufoe ?

Rich. Do not be in a hurry, Charlotte, 
He may have recovered. Don't you re- 
member that v/e thought him dead once be- 
fore ? And yet he was alive. 

Mr. Bill. We left Robinfon, after his 
convulfive- ihuddering, fallen into a fwoon, 
deprived of fenfe and motion, and, in fliortj 
more dead than^ alive : neverthelefs, he 
came to himfelf agai%. and recovered- his.

122 THE N^ E W 

The Children. Ah ! that is right — we are 
all of us glad that he is not dead- 
Mr. Bill, The firft token of his breath* 
ing' again was a deep figh. He opens his. 
eyes, looks round him to know where he is. 
At that moment he doubts his being alive ; 
but his doubts are foon removed. He, thea, 
falls into a fit of melancholy, and, in his 
prefent fituation, would have preferred 
death to- life. 

He feels himfelf very weak, but' free from 
all troublefome pain. The burning heat, 
which tormented him before, is now fuc- 
ceeded by a kindly fweat all over his body*. 
To encourage it, he covers himfelf well up 
with fkins, and before half an hour was at an 
end, he found himfelf con fiderably relieved. 
But now he was feized with a violent 
tliirft. The water that remained was no^ 
longer drinkable : luckily, he thought of hrs 
lemons : he put one of them to his mouth,, 
and fo weak was he that his teeth could 
fcarcely enter it -, but when he had fucked a- 
little of the juice^ he found himfelf greatly 

refreihed. 



K O B J N S ON CRUSOE. l^Z.J 

refrefhed, and his third quenched. He now 
compofed himfelf to reft, his perfpi ration 
ftill continuing, and enjoyed an agreeable 
flumber until funrife. 

How pleafing was the fenfe of his ex.- 
iftence at prefent, compared with what he 
had felt the day before ! The violence of 
his diforder was entirely abated 5 nothing re- 
mained of it but an exceflive weaknels. He 
found his appetite return already ; he took 
a roaftedpotatoe, and fprinkled it with a drop 
of lemon-juice,, to render it lefs infipid and 
more refrefhing. 

For two days paft he had taken no no- 
tice of his lamas ^ they now afforded a mov- 
ing fight : fome of them looked at liim, and 
feemed to alk if he were recovered yet. 
Fortunately thefe animals, as well as ca- 
mels, can do without drinking for feveral 
days, otherwife they would have been very 
badly off, having never wet their lips for two 
days. Befides, Robinfon being yet too 
weak to rife and fetch them water, they 

were

were likely to be deprived of it Hill for fome 
time. 

The oldeft of the lamas having come up 
clofe to him, he exerted the little ftrength 
that he had in milking her, that fhe might 
not go dry. Pier milk, no doubt, afTifted 
Ro.binfon's recovery ; for, after drinking ir, 
he found himfelfconfiderably better. 

After this, he fell afleep again, enjoyed a 
mod refrefhing flumber, and did not awake 
'■until funfet. He perceived that his appe^ 
tit€ was encreafed : he fatisfied it again with' 
fome potatoes - fprinkied with lemon-juice, 
and then v/ent to Deep once more. 

This calm, uninterrupted lleep, together 
with his good conftitution, contributed fo 
effedually to the recovery of his ftrength, 
that the very next morning he was able to.. 
fife and attempt to walk a few fteps, though 
he ftill ftaggered with weaknefs. 

He crawled out of his cave into the fpace 
before it. There he lifts up his eyes to 
Heaven. Some beams of the rifing fun, ,.;

piercing through the leaves of the trees that 
iurrounded him, Ihone agreeably on his 
face, and re-aniaiated him with their plea- 
fing warmth. He thought he telt himfeif. 
receive new life. " Eternal fource of be- 
ing !" cried he^ -^ God of my life ! what 
thanks fhall I render thee for giving me to 
behold, once more, thebright ftar of day, and 
by its light the wonderful v/orksof thy hands I 
Receive my gratitude, for that thou didft nqt. 
forfake me when all forfookme^ for that thou 
haft reftored me to life afrefh, doubtlefs, in 
order that I may have more time to devote 
to repentance, and that I miay not v/afte a . 
moment of my remaining life without for- 
warding that work, the only cne. thing need^ 
fitly that I may ever be found ready to take 
my flight towards the place of man's eter- 
nal deftination, where each fhall receive the 
rev/ard of his good or bad adionSa'* 

From thefe effufions of gratitude towai'ds 
his Creator, he naturally paiTed to the ad- 
miration of the creatures. His looks vv'an- 
dered, fometimj-S, over the immenfity of 

heaven's

heaven's azure vault; fometimes ov^r the* 
frefh and fmiling verdure of the trees and 
Ihrubs^ befprinkled with pearly dew ; fome- 
times on his lamas, which, by crowding 
round hinn, feemed to carefs him and ex- 
prefs their joy. He felt a pleafing emo- 
tion, hke that of a traveller, who, after a 
long ab fence, enters, once more, the bofom 
of his beloved family. His heart being 
moved with tendernefs^ and overflowing 
with the kindeft fentiments, which fought, = 
as itwei*e, to expand themfelves, he flied a 
flood of tearsi but they were tears of the 
pureft joy. 

The advantage of being able to take ths 
air, and' the ufe of milk mixed with fpring, 
water, together with the contentednefs of 
his mind, contributed to his perfe<5l reco- 
very. In a few days all his ftrength return- 
ed, and "he found himfelf in a capacity to be- 
gin again his former occupations* 

He went firft to examine his new-made 
earthen ware, and to fee how it had fucceed- 
ed. As foon as he opened the oven, what- 

aa: 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. \1J 

an agreeable furprife ! All his vefTels were 
as well glazed as if they had been the work 
of an experienced potter. In the height of 
his joy for this fuccefs^ he does not perceive 
that his ware is of no ufe to him ; he forgets 
that his fire is out. When, at length, he 
ricollected this circumflance, he flood mo- 
tionlefs for a while, and, hanging his head, 
fixed his eyes, fonnetimes on his pots, fome- 
times on his fire-place, and ended with hea\> 
ing a deep figh. 

Neverthelefs, he was able this time to 
moderate his vexation, and to contain it 
within due bounds. ^' The fame good Pro- 
vidence," faid he to himfelf, '^ which before 
provided you with fire, has always mors 
than one way at hand to provide you with 
it again, and you will not be deprived of it, 
if Heaven thinks fit." Befides, he was al- 
ready taught that he had not the rigors of 
winter to fear ; and though he was accuilom*- 
ed, from his childhood, to live chiefly oa 
meati yet he hoped to be able, and not irL-

fruits and the nnilk of his lamas. 

Charlotte, Why, he might have ufed his > 
fmoked meat for vidluals 3 there would: 
have been no neceffity for drefling it. 

Mr. BilL That is true 5 but how was he 
to have fmoked meat ? 

Ch(^rhtt£\ Oh ! I forgot that. 

Mr, Bill After all, he was not forry that 
he had made, the pots and pans \ they v/cre 
convenient to hold his milk, and the largeli. 
he intended for a very particular ufe, 

Fdch. What was that ? 

Mr, Bill, He thought, if his potatoes 
were accompanied with butter, he Ihould i 
reiifh them better than without. 

Rich, I fuppofe fo. 

Mr, Bin, Not being able to make a 
churn of wood, he had a mind to try whe- - 
"ther he could not churn butter in a large 
earthen pot. He gathered, therefore, as 
much cream as he thought would be fuffi- 1 
cient. He fhaped out alfo a round flat! 
piece of wood, in the center of which he ^ 

mads „ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I29 

made a hole to receive a ftick. This in- 
flrument he held upright in the cream pot, 
and moved it v/ith an inceffant motion up 
and down, up and down, until the butter 
was, at length, feparated from the butter- 
milk. He then wafhed the butter in clean 
fpring water, and made it up with a little 
fait. 

He was now^ once more, happy in the 
accomplifhment of hjs defign -, but, at the 
very moment when he was going to reap the 
fruits of his induflry and perfeverance, he 
recolleded that he mull think no more of 
potatoes, for want of fire to roaft them ; a 
circumflance which, in the w^armth of exe- 
cuting his defign, he had never once thought 
of He has butter, but he can makenoufe 
of it y he looks at it, he wifhes for it, he 
puts it from him, he grows forrowful. Dif- 
appointed in his hopes, he finds himfelfjuft 
as he was at firfl, in danger of wanting eve- 
ry thing. It is true, the oyfters, the milk, 
the cocoa-nuts, and flefb, either raw or dried 
in the fun, might afford him nourilhment j 

but 



I'JO T HE N E 'W 

but was It certain that no accident would 
deprive him of thefe refonrces ? And the 
moft deplorable of all was, that he could in- 
vent no means to render his unhappy lot 
■better or more fee u re. 

What fhall he undertake now P What- 
ever his hands, without the help of toolsj, 
were capable of performing, he has al- 
ready executed i and it feems now as if he 
had nothing left to do but to pafs the re- 
mainder of his life in idlenefs and fleepo 
Dreadful deftiny ! He cannot bear the 
thought of it. He was now becom.e fo ac- 
cuftomed to work, that he could not live 
without employing his time in fome ufeful 
occupation. In the latter part of his life, he 
would often fay, that his reformation was 
principally owing to this fingle circum- 
fiance ; that he was conflrained, when in fo- 
litude, and deprived of all affiflance, topro-= 
vide for his wants himfelf by perfevering 
labour ; and he would add, ** Ccnfliant em- 
ployment is the mother of a crowd of vir- 
tues, as habitual idlenefs is the fourcs of all 
vice," 



-R O B I N S O N C R U S O Eo t^t 

Rich, He was very rights when one has 
nothing to do, one thinks of nothing but foU 
lies and nonfenfe. 

Mr. Bill. It is even fo^ and, thereforej 
young perfons are advifed to accuftom them- 
felves early to employment. The charac- 
ter that v/e chiefly put on when we are 
young, as idleness or induflry, adlivity or 
flownefs, virtue or wickednefs- generally re- 
mains with us all our lives. 

Edw. We fhould apply that to curfelves, 
Mr. Bill. Do fo, my dear children, and 
condu6l yourfelves accordingly : you will 
never repent it. Our unfortunate Robin- 
fon turned and turned again on every fide, 
to try what he might undertake in order to 
avoid idlenefs. At length he found an em- 
ployment. Gan you guefs what it was ? 

Rich. Were I in his place, I know what 
J would have done. 

Mr. Bill. Ay ! Let us hear your plan. 
Rich. 1 would have undertaken to tan 
the lama fkins, that their fliifnefs might, not 
hurt me when I put them on. Befides, the

to fee them at worL 
,Mr:BilL "^ItlL 

Rich, Firft they put the raw hides in wa» 
ter, and let them fteep there for fome days j 
from thence they carry them to the kg, on 
which they fcrape them, to force out the 
water with which they are foaked. After 
fprinkling them with fait, they cover them 
up carefully to keep the air from them. 
This they c^Wjweating iht fkins. In fad, 
they do fweat whilft in this lituation : it is 
eafy to perceive a fleam ifTue from them. 
Thus prepared, they are eafily deprived of 
their hair, which is done by fcraping them 
again. After this part of the work, they 
put the fkins into what is called the tariy 
compofed of leaven, the bark of birch tree, 
and a fharp liquor made with oak bark. 

Laftly,

Laflly, they place them in the tan vat, vvhere 
they fprinkle them with a" liquor made alio 
of oak barkj and from hence they take them 
out to curry or drejs them ♦, in a word, to 
put the fini(l:iing hand to them. 

Mr. Bill. Very well, my little friend; 
but do you know for what ufe flcins thus 
prepared, by the tanners are intended ? 

Rich. Oh ! yes : they are made into 
fnoes, boots, coach-harnefs, and many other 



tnings.

Mr. Bill, Who. is it, then, that pre- 
pares this fort of leather ? 

Rich. The fkinner or fellmofio-er :- but 
we have never been in the worklliop of an/ 
who follow that bufinels. - 

Mr, Bill Robinfon was nearly ia the 
famepred-icament. - He had never been in 
the workfhop either of tanner or fellmon- 
ger, consequently he could not endeavour 
to imitate cither of them.

Edw, Then how does the fellmonger 
manage his (kins ? 

Mr. BilL He begins like the tanner, 
with this difference, that he does not fteep 
the fKins either in tan or in lime, (for this 
is alfo ufed by the tanners,) but he makes 
life of warm water, with bran and leaven, 
and afterwards a lee of aihes : — but we will 
go fome day and fee them at work. 

Rich, If he had known the bufmefs even 
as well as any fkinner, he could not have 
attempted to drefs ikins for want of bran 
and leaven, 

Mr. Bill, That is clear : fo that he was 
obliged to give up all thoughts of it. 

Edw, But how, then, did he intend to 
employ himfelf ? 

Mr, BilL His thoughts were employed 
r.ight and day about building a little boat. 

Rich. What ufe did he intend to make 
of it? 

Mr. BilL Do you afk what ufe ? To try, 
by means of it, to return amongft his fcl- ^

the

the folitude to which he was confined agalnft 
his will, and which was become more difmai 
to him ever fince he was deprived of fire. 
He had reafon to think that the continent of 
America was not far off; and he was de- 
termined, if he had a canoe, be it ever To 
flight, to face every danger, and land, if -- 
poffible, on this continent. Full of this 
idea, he hailened out one day to feek and 
make choice of a tree, which he might con- 
vert into a boat, by hollowing out the trunk 
of it. With this defign he traverfed feve- 
ral parts of the iiland where he had never 
been before, and remarked, in his way, k- 
veral plants that were unknown to him, 
and on which he refolved to make experi- 
ments, to find whether they would anfwer 
thepurpofe of food. Amongft others, he 
obferved fome ftalks of maize, or Indian 
corn, as it is called. 

Edw. What, that fort of corn of which 
you have two fine ears hanging up in the 
back parlour ? 

Mr, Bill. The fame. He admired the 
G z larofe 



136 T H E N E W 

largenefs of the heads, or, more properly 
fpeaking, the ears, on each of which he . 
reckoned more than two hundred large 
grains, clofely ranged, one befide the other, 
and refembling grains of coral. He had 
not the lead doubt but this corn might be 
ufed for food, or even for bread. But how 
was it to be ground ? How was the flour 
to be feparated from the bran ? How was 
it to be made into bread, or, indeed, into 
food of any fort, without the help of fire? 
Notwithftaading all thefe confiderations, 
he carried ofFfome ears of it with him, in- 
. tending to fow the grains. '' How do I 
know," faid he, " but 1 may reap confide- 
rable advantage from thefe in the end ?" 

A little further on he difcovered a fruit 
tree of a fpecies quite new to him. From 
this tree hung vaft numbers of large huiks, 
one of which he opened, and found in it ; 
about fixty nuts of a particular fort. Though 
they were not very agreeable to the tafle, 
yet he put one or two of the ripeft huiksin^ ., 

to his pouch.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. I37 

Rich, But what fruit might that be ? 

Mr. Bill. They were cacao-nuts, of 
which they make chocolate. 

Edw. Ah! now he may have chocolate 
for the future. 

Mr. Bill. Not fo fail. In the firft place^ 
he does not know that he has chocolate- 
nuts in his poiiciTion : befides, thefe nuts 
fhould be roafted, then bruifed, and ground 
up with fugar, and, we all know, he was as 
little provided with fugar as with fire. In 
order to improve the flavour of the choco- 
late, they, commonly add different forts of 
fpices, as cardamum, vanilla, and cloves : 
but thefe were unneceflary niceties to be de=- 
prived of, which gave him not the lead 
concern in comparifon with the want of 
fire. 

At length he came to another tree, which 
was as little known to him as the former. 
The fruit of it was as large as that of the 
cocoa-nut tree, but had neither hufk nor 
fhell : the whole was eatable and of an ex- 
quifite flavour. This tree was alfo quite 
G 3 differently 



138 THE NEW 

differently fhaped from the cocoa-nut 
tree. I: did not confifl, like the latter, of a 
trunk which rifes flraight up its whole 
height, and bears a topping of thick foliage ; 
but this had branches and leaves, like thofe 
of our fruit trees. He learned afterwards 
that it was the bread tree, fo called becaufe 
Its fruit ferves the natives for bread, fome- 
times juft as it grows, but more connmonly 
pounded and made into a fort of dough. 

He obferved, that the trunk of this tree, 
from its great ag'e, was already a little hol- 
lowed on one fide; and immediately he 
thought it would anfwer for the boat that 
he had in contemplation, if he could only 
find means to cut it dov;n and hollow it 
fufFiCiently. But thea ta cut down fo ufe- 
fui a tree, while, on the other hand, it was 
uncertain whether he ihould ever be able 
to make a canoe of it ! — this thought flar^ 
tied him. After weighing every thing for 
and againft it, in his own mind, for a long 
time, he careiliiiy marked the fpot, that ie

ROBINSON CRUSOE, I39 

might find it again, and went away without 
having deternnined upon any thing. 

In his walk he found, what he had long 
wifhed for, a parrot's neft. The difcovery 
gave him a great deal of pleafure. He went 
towards it without the lead noife, and was 
ftretching out his hands to clap them on the 
neft, when the young parrots, v;hich were 
ftrong and well fledged, took to flight, and 
efcapcd from him all but one, more flow 
than the reft, which could not get away, and 
remained his prifoner. He haftencd, there- 
fore, home to his habitation, noore pleafed 
than if he had found a treafure. 

Edw, But what great advantage did he 
expert from a parrot ? 

Mr, Bill, He hoped to teach him to pro- 
nounce fome words, that he miight have the 
fatisfadlion of hearing a voice v/hich imitated 
that of man. As to us who live in fociety, 
who enjoy the happinefs of feeing men every 
day, and hearing them, and converflng with 
them, we, perhaps, may look upon it as 
a very trifling and childifli fatisfadion 
which Robinfon promifed to himfelf from 
G 4 hearing

hearing the parrot's chatter i but if we place 
ourfelves'in the fame circumftances with 
him^ we fhall eafily be fenfible, that what to 
uSj in our prefent condition, appears but a 
Ihadow of pleafure, muft afford fubftantial 
fatisfa6lion to poor Robinfon in his ftate of 
folitude. 

When he came home^ he made a cage as 
well as he could, in which he lodged his 
new gueft, placed it on one fide of his bed, 
and went to reft with a mind as happy and 
rejoiced as that of a man who had gained a 
new friend. 



THIRTEENTH EVENING.

ne Children, Well, papa, we are now 
all in our places. What is to be the Tub- 
jea ? 

Mr, Bill, It is a queflion which has dif- 
turbed Robinfon's mind all night, and has 
not fufFered him to clofe his eyes a mo- 
ment. 

The Children, What could it be ? 

Mr, Bill. It is this. Shall he cut dowa. 
the bread tree which he faw the day before^ 
or leave it {landing as it is, uncertain whe- 
ther he fhould ever be able to make a boat 
ofitP 

Rich. I- lliould be far from meddllnp- 
with it. 

Edw, For my part, I v^ould cut it down, 

Mr,BilL Here are two oppofite votes, 
one for cutting down, the other for preferv^- 
ing the tree. Let us hear thofe who have 
not fpoken yet en the fabjedt. 

Geo. I am cf the flirne way of thinking 
with Richard. 

Charlotte . And fo am I, papa^ we muii. 
let the tree (land. 

G 5 Henry:, ' 



242 T H E N E W 

lltnry. No ; it muft be cut down -, the 
unfortunate Robinfon naud have a canoe, 

Harriet. Indeed I think fo too. 

Mr, Bill. The voices are divided, and 
equal on both fides. Let thofe who are for 
cutting down the tree conrie on my right 
handi and thofe who are of the contrary opi- 
nion on nriy left. Very well j both parties 
face each other. Let us now hear the rea- 
fons that each will advance in favour of his 
opinion. Richard fballfpeak firfl, and tell 
us why he is for faving the tree. 

Rich. Becaufe it bears a valuable fruit, 
and the fpecies is r^re upon the ifland. 

Ed'iv, It is but an old trees the advan- 
tage of gathering fruit frona it will not laft 
long. 

Rich. How can you tell that ? It has 
but a flight hollow in it as yet ; and how 
many trees do we fee, the trunks of which, 
tliough hollow, do not hinder thenn from 
bearing fruit for many years ? 

Harriet. Let Robinfon only graft a few 

flips 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I43 

flips of this tree, he will be fure to prcferve 
the fpecies. 

Geo. Ay ! Do they grow up and bear 
fruit fo foon ? Four or five years may very 
well pafs before he has any fruit. 

Henry, And is it not better to have a 
canoe, and return to the fociety of men, than 
to flay in his ifiand, though he were to feed 
ever fo plentifully upon the bread, made of 
the fruit of this tree ? 

Rich, Why, ay, if the canoe could be 
finifhed fo very foon. But how is he to 
cut down this tree ? How is he to hollow 
it out, with nothing but ailone hatchet? 

Edw, Let him work with perfeverance ; 
let him not be impatient :.! dare fay he will, 
accomplifhit atlad. 

Gee. But he has no fail. What voyage 
can he undertake in an open boat ?. 

Harriet, He may ufe oars. 

Charlotte, A- pretty notion indeed I Do 
not you remem.ber when we were- in a boat 
down the river, near Piirney, and one of the 
wateniieu's oars broke, he was obliged to 



a 6 



go 



144 THE NEW 

go aihore 2nd borrow another, as he faidwe 

could not be rowed home with only one ? 

Edw. Oh ! that was a large boat, and 
there were nine or ten of us in it. But Ro- 
binfon, in his little fkifF, wants nothing but 
a pair of oars to guide hinnfelf happily far 
away from his prefent folitary habitation. 

Mr» BilL You fee, my dear children^ 
the queftion is not fo eafy to refolve. None 
of the reafons that you have mentioned on 
both fides had efcaped Robinfon's attention. 
He had paiTed the whole night in refleding ^ 
for to examine whether it be more conve- 
nient to do a thing, or not to do it, is called 
refie^ling. Ever fince Robinfon had felt the 
bitter confequences of his hafly refolution 
to travel, he had made it a law with himfelf 
never to undertake any thing without firfl 
maturely refle6ling upon it j and in the 
prefent cafe, alfo, he determines to obferve 
that lav/. Having turned the queftion 
and examined it in every point of view, he 
found it came to no more than this : Vv'he- 
ther it be reafcnable to facrifice a flight, but

cevtain advantage to a great one, but un- 
certain ? Here he recollected the fable of 
the dog, which, fwimming acrofs a river with 
a piece of meat in his mouth, lofl it by en- 
deavouring to fnatch at the refledtion of it m 
the water. He remembered, on the other 
hand, the cuflom of hufbandmen, who fa- 
crilice grain which they might make ufe of, 
but do it with the hope of being richly repaid 
by a plentiful harveft. 

*' Yes," faid he to himfelf, '^ the dog's 
greedinefs was folly y he catched at a vain 
Ihadow, which it was impofilble for him to 
pofTefs. But the hope of the hufbandman, 
on the other handj is well founded, and his 
condudt fenfible -, he has in view a real ad- 
vantage,though, it is true, feme accidents may 
hinder him from obtaining it. 

*^ Am I not, therefore, in the fituation of 
the farmer ? With perfevering labour, may 
I not hope to fucceed, at length, in making 
a canoe out of this old tree ? And if my 
firfl undertaking fucceeds, does reafon forbid 
m^ to expedl that I may efcape from this

folitary ifland, and arrive, by means of my 
canoe, at fome place inhabited by men ?" 

This thought, fo flattering to his warmed 
wifhes, made a lively impreffion on him ; fo 
that he flarted up that moment, took his 
hatchet, ran to the tree, and cut into it. 

If ever he undertook a long and trouble- 
fome tafk, it was certainly this. A thoufand 
other men would have been difcouraged s 
the hatchet would have fallen out of their 
hands after the firil Uroke •, they would have 
looked upon the undertaking, if not extrava- 
gant, at leaiVas impoflible. But we have feen 
already, that E.obl'jron made it a rule never to 
fcffer himfelf to be turned from his purpofe 
when he had well confidered it ; he was,, 
therefore, unfhaken in his rcfolution of go- 
ing through with this enterprize. Were it^ 
to coil him twice the time and fatigue that 
it required, yet the thought of giving it up 
would never enter his head. From the fun'l- 
fjfins till about noon, he never ceafed work- 
ifng^^nd then his hand would have covered 
or fiildd up the hole that he had made in the- 

tiunk.

trunk by the thoufands of flrokes which he 
laid on it. From this we may form feme idea 
how long a time it will require him to cut 
down a tree of fuch a thicknefs, and to make 
a boat of it. 

Being convinced that it would be a work 
of fome years, he thought proper to r^-gulate 
his occupations, and divide his time, fo that 
each part of the day might have its own work 
allotted to itfelf. Experience had taught 
him, that, in a life of labour, nothing helps 
induftry fo much as regularity, and a metho- 
dical diftribution of the work to the different 
hours of the day,, I will give you an ac- 
count of the divifion that he made of his 
time and his occupations, each of which 
had its peculiar portion of the day to itfelf. 
He rofe at break of day, and went direcftly 
to the fpring, where he walhed his head, 
hands, bread, and feet. Having no linen to 
wipehimfelf dry^^he let the air dry his body, 
and aflitled it by running, as he generally 
did, flraight home to finifh drefling himfelf. 
He then went up to the top of the hillock 

at 



248 THE NEW 

at the foot of which his cave was fituatedr 
His fight being then hindered by no objcdt,^ 
he traverfed, at one view, all the beauties of 
nature that were comprifed in this vaft ho- 
rizon. The fight elevated his foul. In the- 
poflure, therefore, which he thought mod 
refpedful, and in the fincerity of his hearty 
he worfhipped and prayed to the Author of 
all Things ; and never failed particularly to 
entreat that he would make his parents hap-- 
py, whom, though he had forfaken, he ne- 
ver forgot. He then returned to his cave,, 
and milked his lamas, which were now en- 
creafed in number to a little flock. He 
breakfafted on fome of the new milk^ and 
the reft he put up in his cellar. Thefe 
were the cares that employed the firft hour 
of the day. 

Now, being provided with whatever was 
neceffary to his fecurity or his convenience 
in working, he went down, if it was low 
water, to the fea fide, where he gathered 
what oyfters he could find for his dinner ; if 
not, he repaired imo^ediately to the tree of 

which 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I49 

which he intended to make a canoe. His 
lamas generally followed him, and grazed 
about while he was ac work. 

About ten o'clock the heat was generally 
fo exceflive that he was obliged to quit his 
work. He then went to the fea-fide to look 
for oyfters, if he had not found any in the 
morning, and at the fame time to bathe, 
which he did regularly twice a day. Before 
noon he returned home with his flock. 

He now milked his lamas a fecond time, 
prepared a fort of cheefe from the milk 
which had curdled, and then laid out his 
dinner, which, being tolerably frugal, was 
foon done. It confined of new cheefe dip- 
ped in miilk, fome oyfters, and half a co« 
coa-nut. There was one circumflance of 
which he had no reafon to complain, and 
that was, that he had not by half fo great 
an appetite in this hot country as people 
generally have in cold clim.ates : yet, as 
he was accuftomed from his childhood to 
eating meat, he longed for it, and, in order 
to fatisfy his with as far as was poflible, had 

recourfe 



150 THE N E W 

recourfe to his fcheme of drying it in the 
fun. At dinner time, he amufed himfelf 
with his parrot; he fpoke to it, and fre- 
quently repeated certain words^with the hope 
of hearing it pronounce fome of them one 
day or another. 

Henry. What did he feed it with ?- 
Mr, Bill, Parrots, when they are wild>. 
generally feed upon cocoa-nuts, acorns, the 
feed of gourds, and other fuch matters ;; 
v/hen tame, they are fed with v^/hatever is 
fit for a man to eat : fo that Robinfon wa& 
very well able to keep his with chcefe and 
cocoa-nuts^ 

- After dinner, he commonly repofed him- 
felf, for an hour, either under the Ihade in 
the open air, or elfe in his cave furrounded 
by his lamas, and with his parrot at his fide, 
Somietimes, as he fat, he would fix his eyes 
upon thefe animals, and fpeak. to them (like 
a child that fpeaks to its doll), as if he ex- 
pected them to underftand what he faid.. 
So necefiary did he find it to communicate 
his ideas and his fentiments to living crea» 

turesj, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I5I 

ttires, that he often forgot the impoflibility 
of his being underftood by the animals which 
furrounded him. When his parrot, which 
he called Poll, repeated a word diftinclly, in 
the height of his joy he would imagine that 
he had heard the voice of a man. He for- 
got ifland, lamas, parrot, and all -, his fancy 
made him fuppofe himfelf in the mldft of 
human creatures ag-ain. But foon recover- 
ing from this pleafing illufion, and finding 
himfelf in a difmal folitude^, he would figh 
heavily, and breathe forth this fhort expref- 
fion of complaint, " Poor Robinfon !'* — 
About two o'clock 

Edw, How could he always tell what 
hour it was ? 

Mr, Bill, He did as hufbandmen fome- 
times do ; he obferved the height of the fun, 
and judged from thence that it was fuch or 
fuch an hour nearly. — About two o'clock 
he returned to the tree to work at his grand 
defign. He continued two hours each time 
at this laborious tafk, and then returned to 
the beach to bathe himfelf again, and to ga- 
iner 



152 THE NEW 

ther more oyfters. The reft of the day he 
fpent in working at his garden. Sometimes 
he fowed maize, or planted potatoes, hoping 
that, if he fhould ever have fire again, they 
might both be of great advantage to him. 
Sometimes he grafted from the bread tree; 
fometimes he watered the young graftsjfome- 
times he would plant a quickfet hedge to en- 
clofe his garden j fometimes he cropped the 
willows which furrounded the fpace before 
his cave; he bent and fixed their branches 
in fuch a manner, that as they grew thc7 
might form a kind of bower. 

Much to Robinfon*s grief, the longeft 
day was, in his ifland, but thirteen hours. 
In the middle of fummer it was night at 
feven o*clock. Whatever required day- 
light for the performance of it, muft be fi« 
nifhed before that tim.e. Therefore, as night 
drew on, that is to fay, about fix o'clock, 
if he had no other more important bufinefs 
upon his hands, he went through his exer- 
cife. 

Rich, What does that mean, papa ? 

Mr. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. I53 

Mr. BilL It means that he exercifed him- 
felf at (hooting with the bow, and throwing 
the fpear, that he might be able to defend 
himfelf if he (hould happen to meet with a 
favage or a wild beaft -y for he was never 
perfedly free from the dread of thefe. By 
degrees, he acquired fo great a degree of 
dexterity in both the exercifes above men- 
tioned, that he feldom milled a m.ark of the 
fize of a crown, though at a pretty good 
diftance from him. When night came on, 
he went home to milk his lamias for the 
third time, and took a moderate fupper by 
the light of the moon or ftars. 

Laftiy, he crowned the labours of the 
day by meditating at night upon his own 
conduct. Sometimes he went to fit upon 
the top of the hillock, from whence he 
could behold the ftarry vault of heaven at 
one view, and contemplate it with admira- 
tion. Sometimes, alfo, he took a walk upon 
the fea-fide, to breathe the air frefhened by 
the evening breeze. Then he would ail; 
himfelf—^* How have you fpent the day ? 

Having 



154 T H E N E W 

Having received frefh mercies, have 3^ou 
blefled the divine fource from which they 
flowed ? Has your heart been filled with 
k)ve and gratitude to your heavenly Bene- 
fa6lor ? In your trouble have you put your 
confidence in him ? In your gratifications 
have you forgot him ? Have you rejeded 
the evil thoughts that offered themfelves to 
your imagination ? Have you fupprefTed 
the extravagant wifhes that rofe in your 
bread ? In a word, are you become really 
better than you were ?" 

Whenever to thefe or the like queftions 
his confcience could return a good anfwer, 
and teflify that the ftate of his foul was 
comfortable, he fung a hymn to the praife 
of the Supreme Being who had aflifted hirn 
in advancing one ftep in the road to virtue. 
When, on the contrary, he had reafon to 
be not fo well pleafed with himfelf, the 
thoughts of having thus loft a day filled 
him with forrow ; for he counted the day 
loft when he had thought or done any thing 
which he could not approve at night* 

Whenever 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, I55 

Whenever this was the cafe, then clofe by 
the notch that he made every day upon the 
tree which fcrved hini by way of almanack, 
he made two notches croifing each other ; 
and this ferved to put him in mind of his 
faulty that for the future he might be better 
on his guard, and not fall into the fame 
error. 

Thus, my dear children, Robinfon la- 
boured to correal himfelf and to become 
better every day. Do you alfo fincerely 
refolve to form your hearts to virtue ? I 
advife you to follow the example that he 
now gives you. Like him, referve an hour 
privately every evening, to give an account 
to yourfelves in filence of the manner in 
which you have fpent the day i and, if you 
find, either in your thoughts, words, or 
a6lions, any thing which your confciences 
dare not avow, keep a book wherein you 
may mark down the fame, to put you in 
mind of it from time to time, tfvit, having 
before your eyes the fault of which you 
have once been guiky, you may ever afier-

wards take more care to avoid it. By thus 
labouring to improve yourfelves every day, 
you will alfo continually encreafe your own

My dear children, I doubt not that you 
will afford me every proof of your attention 
and docility, and this very night begin to 
to put in pradice the good advice which I 
have juft now given you.
