ring a Bkfling of my Pareuts, I took Shipping on 
tbe.firft of September, 1 65 i , 

Our Ship was hardly got clear of the Humher, but 
we were overtaken by a violent Storm, and, being 
extremely Sea-fick, I began to rcfleft upon my Fa- 
ther's rrood Advice, and the Happinefs of a middle 
Slate of Life which he propofed to me ; refolving, if 
ever I fhould be fo happy as to let my Feet again 
upon dry Land, that I would return to my Parents, 
and beg ther Pardon, and bid a final Adieu to my 
wandering Inclinations. 

Thefe were my Thocghls during the Storm 5 luit 
that was no fooner ov^^r, but my t^ood Refolutions de ._ 
creafed with the Danger, particularly when my Com- 
panioD, coming to me, afked me if I was not a little

on Shore ; but on the eighth Day there arofe fucH a 
ftrong Gale of Wind, as prevented our riding op 
the River, which ftill inereafmg, our Ship rede 
Porccaftlc in, having (hipped feveral large bcaa. 

It was not long before a general Horror feized the 
Seamen, and 1 heard the Mailer cry, Lord have 
Mercy upon ys, we.fhall be a)l loft ( For my I*art, I 
kept my Cabin, Ytry fick, till the dreadful Appre- 
h«n£[ons of fudden Death made me come upon Deck, 
and theje I %vas ternb'y sfFrighted indeed. 

' The &ea went Mountains high, and Nothing was 
to oe expe<Sed but unavoidable Dellrudlion. Two 
«»f the Ships had already cut their Mafts by the 
Koard ; two more had loft their Anchors, and were 
forced out to the Mercy of the Tempett, and we* 
t© fave our Lives, weie forced to cut away both; 

r Fore-maft and IVlain«maft.

ing but a jpTcih-water Sailor, was in a far worfe Cafe 
iWian any of them. Our Ship was very ftrong, but,

•or extreme Danger, and I muft freely own it is im- 
poflible for me to deictibe the Agonies I laboured 
under. 

Happy it was fof us that in the Storm they 
regarded our Signal, and with a great Deal of 
Hizard put out their Long- Boat, and by won- 
derful Providence faved our Lives, but with the 
greateft Difficulty ; foi we had hardly got into the 
Boat, but we faw our Ship fink to the Bottoin, 
and we had infaUibly been every Soul drowned, if 
tbey had not come in that vtry Nick of Time to 
our Afliftance. 

It was not without a great Deal of Danjs'cr and 
Difficulty that they recovered thtit own Ship ; 
however they made a ihift to land us at a Place 
caJkd Cromer^ near Winterton Light-Houfc, from 
whence we ail walked in a moil miferable drowned 
Condition to Yarmouth, where tbe good People 
furnifhed us with Nec«ilariss, either for London or 
HuU. 

I have often thought fince, that it was very 
.ftiange, that, after the fe great Misfortune^ at , fet- 
ring out, I did not (like tbe Prodigal) reram to 
my Father, who, having heard of the Ship's Mis- 
fortune, had all the Reafon in the World to think 
I was loJt. But my. ill Fate ilill pufhed me on in 
Spight of all the ftrong Gonvidions of Keafon, Con- 
fciecce, and Experience. 

After three Days Stay at Tar mouthy I met the 
young Man that invited me to go on Board with 
his Father. I found his Pace and his Behaviour 
v«ry much altered^, and I found likcwife he had 
told his Father who I wsS) and that I had taken 
this Voyage only for a Trial, in Order to proceed 
lanhei. ai^road hereafter.

12 LIFE ^^ Adventurf^^/ 

When the old Gentleman faw me, (ayS he, l^oun^ 
Marly you ought ne*ver to attempt to go to Sea any more-'^. 
for, diftnd upon it, you vevtr milt be profperout in a 
fcafaring Condition, You Jee ivhat ill Succefs Heaven 
has fit- hefore your Eytt, and perhapj our Misfortune 
■/nay tnjomt Meafure be o*wing to you. Pray, (added 
he,) tell me truly uton ivbat Metive you Jirjl undertook 
ihti Voyage. Upon this I told him the whole ; at the 
End of which he broke ont into the following Ex- 
clamation: 

OlAyi eternal Powers ! What great Offence hanse 
J committed that 1 Jhould take fuch a de/perate aban- 
doned Wretch into my Ship, that has brought all thsfe 
Mijeries and Misfortuves upon me !- After his Pafiion 
was a little abated, he proceeds, TouTtg Man, depend 
stfcn itt if you do not return and Juhmit to yew Parent s, 
ivhere'ver you ^a, the Anger of God twill certainly pxr- 
fue you^ and you ivill meet <wifh Nothing but Ruin and 
Dfafiir, until your Father s Words are fulfilled upon 
ycu. And fo he left me. 

And' now again I had fome Notion of returning 
Home J but that was quickly ovcr-ruled by a foo'iih 
Opinion, that, if I did, my Neighbours and Acqaainfi- 
iince would laogh at me. So ftrange is the Nature of 
"youih, thar, though iheyoftendofoojifh things with- 
out eiihcr Shame or Remorfe, yet at the fime Tini€ 
they are aftiamed to owr. their Folly, and repent. 

In {hort, I made the bcft of my Way to London, 
being at all Hazards refolved upon a Voyage; andj, 
being acquainted with the Captain of a Ship, a 
Voysge I foon beard of to the Coaft of Guinea, 
Having fome Money, and appearirg like a Gentle- 
man, I did not go on Board like a common Sailor^ 
but joon got fo far into the Captain's Favour, that 
he told me I ihould be his Mela-mate, aiid ih.cold 

have

Bave full Liberty to carry with me what Merchanv. 
dife I fhould think He, and to dilpole of it to my 
own Advantage. 

I was wonderfully pleafcd with this kind Offer, 
and concluded that now I had an Opportanity of 
making my Fortune; and, in Order to my Voyage, 
1 lent to my Friends for feme Money to fit rac 
cut J who accordingly pemitted me forty Pounds, 
which I laid out in Goods, according to his Direc- 
tions. He taught me to keep a Journal, and fevcral 
of the moft uieful Parts of Navigation. And in- 
deed, by his Alfiilance, and by my own f^Jeftry, in 
this Voyage I became both ^ Sailor and a Merchant. 
Part of this Voyage 1 was exccfiively fick of a tl'alen- 
ture, occafioned by the exiraorcinary ficat of the 
Climate, being i-n the Latitude of almoft 15 Dtgrees 
Noith of the Lire; however, I rtcovered, and ma- 
Bagcd my little Stock i'o well, that I brought over 
with me rive Founds and ni?ie Ounce* of Gold Dufl, 
which produced a: London near three hundred Pounds 
Sterling. 

Snon after my Return, my good Friend tlie Cap- 
tain died : Although this was a vtry great Grief to 
me, yet I refolved to go another Voyage with his 
Mate, who had got the Command of the Ship, 
This Voyage proved, a very unfu^cccfsful one. 1 cac- 
lied with me. about one hundred Pounds, and \th 
theRcit with the Captain's Widow, and fo to Sea vy? 
went. But, as vfe were failing towards the Canax^- 
IJlandsy we found we were chafed by a SalUe Rover, 
who, in Spite of all the Sail. we cc-»!ld make, in a 
Siorc Time came up with us ; and now there was no 
Pvtnv.dy bat to fight: or be taken. 

1 hey had j8 Guns, and our Ship but 121 how- 
ever, about three in the Afternoon, we canac to an 

Engagement \ 



X4. LIFE and Adventares ef 

Engagement ; many were killed on both Sides, bur, 
at length, being over-powered by their Numbers, we 
were forced to fnbmit, and a// carried into SaJ/u, 
Our Men were fent to the Emperor's Court to be 
fold ; but the Captain of the Pirates, taking a parti. 
cular Liking to me, kept me for his own Slave. 

It was in this miferable Condition that my Father's 
Words came afrefh into my Remembrance,^ and my 
^Thoughts were continually at Woik to make my 
JSrcape. My Patron entruiled me with the Manage- 
ment of his Garden and Houfe; and indeed I was 
not without Hopes but at Tome Tfme or other an 
Opportunity might oiFer : The woift of it was, I had 
no j«^rtal to communicate my Thoughts to ;. and fo,. 
for two Years, I could find Nothing prafticable. 

In Length of Time^ I found my Patron was grown 
Si" poor, that he could not fit out his Ship as ufual ; 
and then he ufeA^onflantly once or twice a Week 
to go out fifhing, taking me and a Morifco Boy to 
sow the Boat J and fo much pleafed was he with my 
JDexterity in fifhing, that he would often lend ma 
with a MooTy hie Kinfman, and the Boy, to catch 
i'iih ^r him. 

One Morning as we were at the Sport, there arofe 
fo thick a Fog that we loH our Way, and, rowing all 
^ii^ht, when it was light we found ourfeives at. 
leaft two Leagues in the Ocean ; however, we made 
a Shift to get on Shore. But,^ to prevent the like Mis- 
fortune for the Future, my Patron ordered a Ca'pcn- 
ifr to build a little Slate Room in the Middle of the 
Long Boat, with a Place beiund to fleer, and other 
Convenienc^s'to keep out the Weather. 

Id this he would often take i^s oat fifhing;. and,. 
one 'lime paticularly, he iivited three or four Per- 
fons of Diftindion to go along with him, and made 
ejitraordinary Preparations i^i their Ectertainment ;.

providing alfo three Fuzees, with a fufficient Quan*- 
tity of Powder and Shot, that they might have fo/ne 
Sport at Fowling, as they pafled along the Shore. 
The next Morning, the Boat being in Readincfs, on 
a fudden their Minds altered j however, my Patron 
ordered as to go and catch a Difti of Fifh, for that 
he w-as^ refolved his Guefts fhottid fup with hiro« 

And now it was that I began to think of my Deli* 
verance; and, inOrder to it, Iperfuaded the Moor to 
get feme Proviiion on Board, and alio fome Powder 
and Shoi to (hoot Curlews, which were very pJecti- 
ful in thofe Parts. I took Gare to provide privately 
whatever elfe I could think was the xaofl ncceffarjr 
for the prefent Expedition, refolving to make my 
Efca^pe, or periOi in. tne Attenvpt. 

When we were paH the Cattle, we fell to fifhiirg^ 
and I flood farther ioto the Sea ; and, when we wt»^ 
got at leaO a League, I gave the Boy the Helm, and 
fcized Af»/py by Surprise, and threw him over-board j 
Muley^ faid I, I ne'ver defigrttd you any! Harm; avdjeek 
Nothing but my oavn Redemption ; I kno'w you are Ms

mery Moment t nuiU Jhoct you through the Head : Upon 
which he inAantly turned about,_and Imake noJDoubt 
but he got fafe to Shore. 

This Aftion frighted the poor Roy exceedingly"; 
however, 1 foon ealed him of his Fear, by telling 
him, If he nvouU be a^ood Boy^ and f jo ear by Maho- 
met, and the Beard of his Fat her ^ to ferve me fatth^ 
J-uily^ I "MouLd be 'very kind to him', the poor Chil4 
feeoied wonderfully pleafed with my Promife, aad 
readily confented, and from that Tin»e 1 began to

We purlued our Voyage, keeping ftilUon the Bar-

I continued (aiHivg for five Days together, uutil I

think proper to fellow mc any farther.

fioYoonerdiid it begin to grow dark, but we heard foch. 
Howlings and Yeliings of wild Beafts and Monftcrs, 
that I muft needs own I was exceedingly terrified. 

I'oorXuty paflior.ately begged me not togo on-diore 
that Night. The Boy had a great deal ot Wit; for 
which, and fome broken Englijh wiiich he had learnt 
among the Captives of our Nation, I was mightily 
pjeafcd with him. Neverthelefs, the Howlings and 
BellowiPgs were fo very dreadful, that we had but 
Iftile Reft that Night ; and, to add to our Confufion, 
we difcovered one of the Monfters making towards 
us ; upon which I took up one of my Guns and fhot at ' 
kirn ; whether 1 hit him, or not, I cannot fay, bat he 
made towards the Shore, and the Noife of my Gun 
increafed the flupendous Noife of other Monfters. 

The next Morning I refolved to go on Shore, ani 
at all fiazards get fome frelh Water; the poor Boy^" 
would have taken one of the Jars and fetched me' 
fome ; but J refufcd, telling him we would both go*; 
together, and take the fame Fate ; and accordingly • 
we took our Arms, and two Jars for Water, and 
away we went. '

vages or fome wild Bcaft ; upon which I ran to\yards 
him, refolving to perifh, or preferve him ; but, as be 
came nearer to me, I faw a Creature hanging at his 
Back like one of our Hares, but fomcth:ng larger, 
which proved to be good and whoheforae Meat, an«, 
what added moft to our Joy, the Boy aflured me'

In this Place I began to connder that the Ca»ar)^ 
Jflands and Cape ^:e Verd could net be far oft ^ but^ 
having, no InHrument, I knew not in what Latitude 
v/e were, or when to Hand off to Sea for them ; my 
Hopes were to mett fome of the MngJiJh trading 
Veffels, that would confequently take us in, and 
jclieve us. 

The Place I was in, was doubtlefs that wild un. 
inhabited Country that lies becween the Emperor d, 
Morocco's Dominions and the Negroes i it abound* 
with wild Beafts of all Sous, and the Moon ufe it for 
hunting. From this I thought I faw Mount Teneriffg 
in the Canaries, and tried twice to lt:;cr my Courfc 
that Way, bat was a? often diiven back,, and com- 
|)elled to ftek my. Fortune along tae Shore.

Mouthy meaning one Mouthful, Upon which I took 
^y bigrpreft Gun,, and charging it well, fliot at him, 
and broke ore of his Legs j and then with a Siwt 
from my O'.her Gun I killed him. 

But the Fiefli of this Creature not being good for 
Food, I thought this was fpending our Ammunitioa 
in. vain ; indeed I thought the bkin, when it was 
dry, might be of forae Ufe, and fo determined to 
te4 it of, which nook up a whole Day to efFe£l.

From thence we went to the Southi.vardt refolving 
to live i"paringly an cur Provifions, and go on Shore

no other Profpeft but flarving. 

As we were failing pretty near the Shore, we could 
difrover <everal People upon it, looking after us :

into the CouDtry, and, in lefs than Half an Hour, 
brought me two Pieces of dry Fklh and fome Corn, 
which we kindly accepted; and, to prevent any Fears, 
they laid it down, and went and flood at a Dillance 
till we had fetched it on Boards and then came clofeL 
up to us again. 




But, while we were returning Thanks to them, be-

diredlly into the Sea, wantonly fwimming about, as 
if the Water had put a Stop to their Fury. At laft,

The Negroes having furnifked us with tTie befl Pto-

in eleven Days Sail, I came in Sijjht of Cape dt Verd,

Encouraged by this I fet op my Antient, and fired

when 1 found the Capta*^ of rhe Ship-^as very kind 
and compaiTionate to me ; to whom, in Return for 
his Friendftiip, I offered all I had, which he gene- 
roafly refufed, telling rae, His Chriftian Charity

towards me in allRefpefts. 

He bought my Boat of me, and gave mc his Note 
10 pay roe eight Pieces of Eight for it when wtf 
«ama to the Brafiis : He alfo gave me fixty for my. 
Boy Xury, from whom I parted with great Reluft- 
a-nce ; however, tb^Boy being willing, I agreed he 
ihould be fet at Libert*' after ten Years Service. 

We firrrved at the Bay of Ail-Saints after 22 Days 
Sail. The good Man would not take any Thing for 
my P^ffage. He gave me 20 Ducats for the Leopard's 
Skin, and 40 for the Lion's ; every Thing he caufed 
10 be delivered, and what I Would feU he bought* 
In (hort, I made 220 Pieces of my fmall Cargoe, and 
with this little Stock I began, as it were, to enter 
-a-new into the World. 

He recommended me to an honed Planter, witk

Manner of Planting and making Sugar; and obfer- 
vingthe great Advantages of thatBufinfels, I refolvcd 
to get the Money 1 had ieft behind me in England 
remitted, and to boy a Plantation. 

In ihort, I pur chafed a Plantation adjoining to an 
honeft Portugueze, born of Enghjh Parents, whom, 
ijpon all Occafions, I found a vt\y kind and ufeful 
Neighbour. Our Stocks at Ififft were both very low 1

my Neighbour. 

I was in fome Meafure fettled, before theCaptaia

would have me only fend for Half, left it fhould

And now my WeaUh began to ir.creafe a-pace % 
and, in this State,, I m'-ght have lived very happy, if 
my Ambition and roving IcGlination had not had 
too great Power over me. I had now lived foma 
Year* in i\i<i Brafils, and I not only learnt the Lan-

This I took to be f© fair a Propofal, that, upon Con-

But many Days we had not failed before we were 
overtaken by a violent Storm, which lalled 12 Days 
fucceffively ; when the Weather cljar«d> we foynd 
ourfelves i x Degrees in the Northern Latitude, 
upon the Coaft of Guinea-, upon which the Captain 
gave Reafons for returning, which 1 oppofed, cdun« 
felling him rather to ilandaway for Barhadoesy where 
I judged we might arrive in 15 Days, So altering our 
CourTe we fteercd Weftward, in Order to reach the 
Leenjoard'fJIands ; and here it was we were over- 
taken by a terrible Tempcft, 

In this great Diftrefs, one of our Men cried out. 
Land! Land! When, looking out that very Moment, 
we found our Ship was ftruck upon the Sand, and 
cxpefted we fheuld firk, and that we fhould be all 
immediately loft. We knew not where we were 
driven, and, what was worfe, were Certain the Ship 
could not hold out many Moments longer. . 

Whilil we were looking upon one another, expedl- 
ing Death every Moment, the Mate, affifted by tTie 
Crew, hauled out the Long-boat, and 11 of us com- 
mitted ourfelves to the Fury of the Sea and God's 
Mercy ; we foon Jound that this laft Effort was to 
no furpofe, for the Tempeft was fo violent, and tlie 
Sea ran fo very high, that it was impoffible for the 
Boat to live. When we had been driven about a 
League, comes a prodigious Wave a-ftern of ys 
and overfet us in an Inilant, fo that we had hardly 
Time to call upon God to receive our Souls. 

When Men are ftruggUng with the Pangs of Death 
they a:re commonly infenfible ; but the Cafe Wfs 
quite different with me ; for-, while I was over-

2 6 LIFE and Adventures of 

Land; i^^re, tired and almoft fpent, I fat down 
upon the bhore, contemplating the Manner of my 
prefent Prifervadon. 

After I had returned my Thanks to Almighty God 
for this wonderful Prefervatisn, I began to look about 
mc, to confider what Place I was in, and what was 
next to be done in Order to my future Subnftence. I 
could neither fee Houfe nor People ; wet and hun- 
gry, and Nothing to help me, not fo much as a Wea- 
pon to defend me againft the wild Beafts. In fhort, 
J had Nothing in the World but a Knife, a fhort 
Tobacco-pipe, and a Box half full of Tobacco ; 
and, what was worfe, Night coming on, I was under 
the mofl dreadful Apprehenfions of being devoured 
by wild Beafts that I heard bowling and roaring 
round about me ; fo that I had no Profpeft but to 
expcdl another Kind of Death more terrible than that 
I had fo lately efcaped. In this Diftrefs, I walked 
about a Furlong into the Country to feck frefh Wa- 
ter, which I luckily happened upon ; fo, taking to a 
Tree, I feated myfelf fo that I could not fall, and 
there I flept till Morning. 

It was Day. light before I left my Apartment in 
the Tree ; when, cominrg down, and looking round, 
I perceived that the Tempeft was ceafed, and that 
the Ship was driven to the Rock where I efcaped, 
and, looking farther, I faw the Ship** Boat lying 
about a Mile to the Right, where the Waves had 
call her up. 

I hoped to have got to tlie Boat, but the Water 
between that and the Shore rendered that imprafti- 
cable ; fo I turned agriin towa'ds the Ship, in HOpes 
to get Something from thence for my prefent Stxb- 
fiftence. 

At all Hazards I refolved to get to the Ship, and 
fo, flripping, leaped into the Waterjand, fwimmin^ 

round 



Robinson Crusoe. 27 

round her, I had the good Fortune to efpy a Rope 
hanging fo low down that I could reach it; by the 
H-ilp of which"^, with feme Difficulty, I got into the 
Forecaftle. Here I found that the Ship was bulged, 
her Head lifted up againft a Bank, and her Stern al- 
moft in the Water ; all her Quarter, and what was 
there, were free and dry ; and I found the Provifi- 
ons in good Order, and wanted Nothing but a Boat 
to carry what I had Oacafion for. 

Neeeffity, which is the Mother of Jnverition, put 
a Proje6l into my Head ; there were on -board feve- 
ral fpare Yards, a fpareTop-maft or two, and three 
large Spars of Wood ; with thefe I fell to work, 
flinging as many of them over-board as I could ma- 
nage, and tied them together that they might not 
dfive away ; when this was done, I tied them to- 
gether in Form of a Raft, and hid three or four 
ihort Pieces of Planks on them crofs-ways ; I found 
it would bear me, but a very little Weight befides ; 
and fo, to ftrengthcn my Raft, I cut a Top-maft into 
three or four Lengths, and added them to it ; and 
then I confidered what was moft proper to load it 
with, it being capable of car ying a tolerable Weight. 
At fiift, I laid upon it all the Boards I could get, 
and then I lowered down three of the Seamens 
Cheils, and filled them with Provifions of all Sorts ; 
I found Cloaths enough, but then I took' no more 
than my prefent Occafions required. 

My Concern was chiefly upon Tools to work with, 
and Fire- Arms and Ammunition ; and, accordingly, 
I foand, in my Search, the Carpenter'* Cheft ; and, 
in the great Cabin, fome Fire-Arms and Ammuni- 
tion, all which I put on- board my Raft, and fo, 
rith two broken Oars, ^c. I put to Sea. 

Though every Thing at firft feemed to favour my 
Oefign, yet, af;er I had failed about a Mile, I found

on a fadden the Fore-parts of my Raft run a-ground, 
fo that it was with the greateft DifRculiy imaginable 
1 kept my Cargo tight together; and, indeed, if I 
had not been extremely .diligent and careful, all had 
leen loft, ard funk into the 5ea : But, after fome 
Time, Providence To ordered it, that, at the Rifing of 
the Water, my Raft floated again, and fo I happily 
landed my EfFe^s. 

Not far from the Place where I landed, which 
was at the Mouth of a little Cave, I difcovered a 
\Qty high Hill, furrounded with a great many little 
ones, and thither I refolded to g9 and view the 
Country, and fee what Place was proper for me to 
fix my Habitation in ; and accordingly, arming my- 
felf with a Fowling-piece, a Piftol, and fome Am- 
munition, I afcended th-e Mountains, and there 
found I was in an Ifland, being furrounded by the 
Sea. It feemed to be a barren uncultivated Country, 
and only inhabited by wild Beads. 

Returning afterwards to my Raft, I got my Goods 
on-fhore, and, being very much afraid of the wild 
Beafts, I made a Sort of Fence or Barricade about 
it, which I thought might in fome Meafure fecure 
me againft the Dangers I was apprehenfive of; and 
fo that Night I (lept very comfortably, and the next 
Morring, when I awaked, I refolved to go again to 
the Ship to get fuch other Neceffaries in as I had 
mod Occafion for, before another Storm came, when 
I knew flie mull be dafhed to Pieces. 

in Older to this fecond Expedition, I mended ray 
Raft where I found it defedlive, and b- ought away 
from the Ship a great many other Tools, Cloaths, 
Ammunition, and whatever elfe I thought molt ne 
ceflary for my future Prefervation and Subfift ^ 
Then I n ede Hafte to Shore, fearing the wild I 
might come and devour what'I had already lar^ 



Robinson Crusoe. 

When 1 haJ landed all the fecond Cargo, I fell 
immediately to work to make me a little Tenr, and 
fortified it in the bcft Manjier I could, to fecure my- 
feif ae much as poiTibie againft any mddea Attempt 
either from Man or Beait : Afier this I charged my 
rire-Arms, blocked up the Doors, and laid the 3til 
I h-ad brought frcm the Ship upor the Gro'-ii-d, and 
llept as comfortably as though* I had been in my na- 
tive Country. 

Ba: ftill the Thoughts of my future Subfiftence 
and Prefervation wefc uppcrmoft in my Mird, 
HRQ therefore I went to the Ship as often as poiwhle, 
and brought away every Thing I thought could be 
of any Uk ; and, indeed, had fo ftored myfelf, that 
I judged 1 was tolerably provided for a donfiuerablt: 
Time. 

I had now been eleven Days in the Tfland, ard as 
many Times on-board the Ship ; as I was going ih-:: 
twelfth Tim.e, the Wind cegan to rile ; ho^vever, I 
ventured at low Water, and, with feme DiiBcuUy, 
reached the Ship, and, rummaging the Cabins, I 
found feveral other NecefTaries, and, amoi^g ether. 
Things, above 36/. Sterling, in Pieces cf Kight,; 
which, corJidering my pref^nt Circumilances, I con- 
cluded was of fmall Value :o me; however, 1 wrapped 
it up in a Canvas Rag, and, perceiving the Storm be- 
pan to increafe, with all that I was able 10 carjy wiih 
me I made the beft of my Way to the Shore. 

That Night I flept veiy contentedly in my little 
Fortification ; but, when I looked out in the Morn- 
ing, 1 found that the Ship was loft. I was very 
much concerned at this upon my Thoughts ; but, 
when 1 refleded I had done evtry Thing in my 
Power to recover what was ufefu'j to me, I comforted 
myfelf in the otft Manner J could, and fubmitced 
myfelf entirely tc the Will of Providence.

And now my Thoughts were wholly taken up 
how to defend and preferve myfelf fron-i the Sava- 
ges and wild JBeafts, which 1 was extremely appre- 
henfive might be in forae Part or other of this 
Ifland ; and at one 1 ime I thought to dig mc a 
Cave, af anorher to build me a Tent; at length, I 
rci'olved to do both, and accordingly contrived ia 
the following Manner. ^ 

I C0nfi<iered the Ground, where it was, was moor- 
ifti, and that 1 had no Conveniences of frefli Water; 
and therefore 1 determined to find out a Place more 
healthful and convenient ; and, to my great Comfort 
and Satisfadion, I focn found one that anfwercd my 
Expedation. 

The Place was a little Plain near a riling Hill ; 
the Front being as fteep as the Side of a Houfe. On 
the Side of this Rock was a little hollow Piece, re- 
fembiina the Entrance of a Cave ; juft before this 
Place I rtfolved my Tent fhould ftand. This Plain 
was a Hundred Yards broad, and twice as long, with 
a pleafent Deicent every Way t© the Sea-fide. After 
this I drew a Semi^^clc, containing about ten Yards 
in the Diameter; and, when that was done, I drove 
a Row of Stakes not above fix In<;hes from each 
other ; and, by the Help of rny Cables which I had 
brought from the Ship, and fuch other Materials as 
I made Ufe of, I made a Sort of regular Fortiiicatio-i* 
which I concluded v/as in a great Meafure impregna • 
ble againft any fudden Attempts either of Savagea 
or wild Beafts ; and, for my better Security^ I would 
have no Poors, but came in by the Help of a Lad- 
der^ which I made for that Purpofe. 

Inro this lictle Garrifon I carried all my Store and 
Ammjnition, and afterwards continued to work ; I 
ifot only made mc a little Cellar, but lik^vWife made 
njy Forti^cation llronger by Jhe Earth and Stones I

^og out of the Rock. One Day a Shower of Rain 
falling, attended with Thunder and Lightning, I 
was under terrible Apprehenfions left my Powder 
Ihould take Fire, and not only hinder me from kil- 
lingPowIs, which were neceflary formy Subfiftence,but 
likewife blow me up and my Garrifrn at once : the 
Quantity I had by me confided of 1501b Weight at 
leaft. Having thus eltablillied my ielf as a King of the 
Ifland, I went every Day with my Gun to fee what 
I could kill that was fit to eat, and foon perceived 
tkerc were great Numbers of Goats, but they were 
fhy ; however, watching then) very narrowly, I hap- 
pened to Ihcut a Ihe-Goat as fhe was fuckling her 
young one, which, not thinking her Dam killed, 
followed me Home to my Enclofure. I lifted the 
Kid over the Pales, and would willingly have kept 
it alive, but, the poor Creature refufing to ear, I was 
forced to kill it for my Subfiiience. 

Thus, enteiing into as odd a State of Life as ever 
befel any unfortunate Man, I was continually re- 
flefting upon the Mifery of my Condition; till, at 
length, confidering there was no Remedy, and that 
1 was obliged to make the beft of a bad xVIarkct, and 
withal refleding upon the many Turns of Provi- 
dence in my particular Prefer vation, I grew more 
fedate and temperate, 

It was, by the Account i kept, tne 30th of Sep" 
temker when f lirft landed onthis Ifland; about twelve 
'i)ays after, feafing ! fhould loie my Reckoning ©f

Ink, and Paper, I carved it with a Knife upon a large 
Port, in large Letters, fetting it up in the Similitude 
of a Crofs on the Shore where I landed, fy/'a;. Icame to 
Shore, Stpt. 30, 1650. Every Day I cut a Notch 
on the Sides of thi-. fquare Poll, and that for the 
Sabbath was as long again as ihe-Relt, and every

In this Manner I kept my Calendar, in weekly,

I made a more drift Search, (as I afterwards did,) I 
reed not have fet up this Mark ; for I found, among 
the Parcels belonging to the Gunner, Carpenter, and 
Captain's Mate, ihofe very Things 1 wanted, where 
I got not only Pens and Ink, but likewife Sea-Com- 
palTes, and other mathematical Inftruir.ents ; and, 
above all the Reft, three EngUjb Bibles, with fcveral 
other good Znglijh Books, which I carefully laid up, 
in Order to make Ufe of them at proper Intervals. 
But here I cannot but call to Mind our having a Dog 
and two Cats on board, whom I made Inhabitants 
with me in my Callle. But, notwithftanding I was 
thus plentifully fupplied, 1 dill wanted feveral other 
NeceiTaries, as Needles and Thready and more par- 
ticularly a Pick-axe and Shovel for removing the 
Earth, '^c. 

It was a full Yeai before I had finifhed my little 
Fortification ; and, after I had done that in the beft 
Mariner the Nature of the Place and my Circum- 
ftances would allow, I began to grow a little more 
familiar with my Solitude, and to confider of the 
beft Methods poflible to render my deiolate State as

Hopes that, when the Storm was abated, I might 
recover Something towards my prefent Subfiilerice, 
efpecially, confiJering, I obferved the Ship to lie, 
in a great Meafure, upright, and one Side of her 
perfedly dry ; upon which I fell immediately to 
wading ever the >ands, and with great Difricu ty and 
Danger I got on-board. To the i4th of this Month 
Ifpent in making Voyages backwards and forwards

Oct. 25. It blew a Sort of a Storm, and rained 
hard, fo that the Ship was dalhcd to Fieces, and No- 
thing of her was to be feen but the very Hull at low 
Water ; and this Day I thought it proper to facure 
the Eficjcts, I had preferved, from the Weather. 

Qci. 26 I wandered about to try if I could find a 
Place proper to fix my Abode ; and, accordingly, to-

our Englijh Pigeons ; I Ihot fome of thera, which 
proved excellent Food : And now it was a very pro- 
vidential Thing happened ; which was thus : 

Whilft I was rummaging among my Moveables, 
what ihould fall into my Hands but a Bag, which I 
fappofe might be made Ufe of to hold Corn for the 
Fowls in the Ship. I purpofed to make Ufe of it to 
hold fome of the Powder, and fo Ihook out the Dud 
and loofe Corn upon one Side of the Rock, not in the 
Icaft fufped\ing the CoHfequence. The Rain had fal- 
len in great Quantities a few Days before , and the 
Month after, to my great Surprife, I difcovered Some- 
thing fpring up very green and flourilhmg, and, as I 
came daily to view it, I faw feveral Ears of green 
Barley of the very fame Size and Shape of thofe in: 
England^ B 6 My

My Thoughts were very much confufed at this 
unexpeeled Sight ; and, I mui^ own, I had the Va- 
nity to imagine, that Providence had ordered this on 
Purpofe for my Subfiilenc^. Great were my Acknow- 
ledgment and Thank %lnefs to Almighty Godj for 
his Mercies to me in this defolate Place ; which were 
jnfinitely heightened, when, at the fame Time, I ob- 
ferved fome Rice Stalks, wonderfully green and floa, 
nfhing ; which made me conclude here muft confe- 
' cuently be more Corn in the Illand ; and, accord- 
ingly, I fpent feveral Days in fearching the Rocks ; 
vvnen at length it came into my Mind that f hadl 
ihaken the Bag on the very Spot where thofe Blades 
of Corn were growing. 

It was about the latter End of June before thefc 
Ears of Corn grew ripe, and then I laid them up ex» 
feeding carefully, expelling I fhould oneJDay reap 
the Advantage oT this little Crop, which I ufed all 
my Induftry to improve ; and yet it was four Years 
before I could eat any Barley Bread, and much long- 
er before 1 had any Benefit from my Rice. After this, 
with indefatigable Care and Induftry, I finifhed my 
Wall, of'iering itfo, that I had no Way to go in my 
Fortrefs but by a Ladder. 

Jpril 1 6. I finifhed my Ladder, and went up it, 
and puiled it after me as I always did ; aivd, in Truth, 
had fo well fortified my.felr, that I was, as I thought, 
indifferently well fecured againft any Surprife ; ue- 
verthelefs, as I was one Day fitting in my Cave, there 
happened fuch a fadden Earthquake, that the Roof of 
my ii'vtle Fortrefs, that I had finifhed with lo much 
Labour, came tumbling down upon my Head j upon 
which, with the greatelt Amazement, I ran to my 
Ladder, and got out of my Cave, and faw the Top 
of a vaft Rock fall into the Sea, and expeded every 
Moment the whole Ifland would be fwitllowed up.

In this Afiright I remained for fome Moments, 
tin I perceived the Fury of the Motion began to 
abate ; but it \yas not long before I was under new 
ApprehenfioDS, on Account of a violent Tempeft that 
attended it. This dreadful Storm continued for 
about three Hours, and then followed fuch a heavy 
Rain, that my Tent was quite overflowed ; upon 
which I concluded my Habitation was ill fituated, 
and determined, as foon as poflible, to build me one 
in a more convenient Place. 

April 29, 30, were fpent in contriving how, 
and in what Manner, 1 fhould fix mf new Abode 5 
and herein I was under the greateft Concern, having 
no Tools fitting for fcch an Undertaking ; however, 
I fpent feveral Days in whetting and grinding my 
Tools. 

May I. As 1 was walking along the Sea-fide, I 
found a Bairel of Gun powder, and divers other 
Pieces of the Ship, which the Violence of the late 
Storm had thrown on the Sand. I faw likewifc the 
remaining Part of the Ship, thrown up by the Tera- 
peft, very near tiie Shore, and refolved to get to her 
as foon as I could ; but at that Time I found itim- 
pradlicable. 

I continued to work upon the Wreck till the 24th, 
and every Day recovered Something that would be 
of Ufe to me, and got together fo many Planks, and 
fo much Iron, Lead, and other NecelTaries, that, if I 
liad had Tools and Skill, I might have built me a 
Boat ; which was a Thin^ I very much wanted. 

June 16. As I was ftrolling towards the Sea, I 
found a large Turtle: The 17th I fpent in cooking 
it: I found in her 70 Eggs, and the Flefh the molt 
delicious Meat that ever 1 tailed. The i8th, I Itayed 
within the whole Day, there being a continual Rain, 
wi;h Stordw of Wind and Lightning,

3 8 LIFE ^«^ Adventures of 

From the 19th to the 27th of June, I was very 
fick, and had got a terrible Ague, which often held 
me for nine or ten Hours with extreme Violence. 
On the 1 8th, I began to recover a little, but was 
very reftlefs in the Night, and was wcrfe ; as often 
as I laid my Eyes together, I was tormented with 
hideous Dreams and dreadful Apparitions. It is 
impoflible for me to exprefs the Agonies I was un- 
der by thefe repeated Admonitions, as I took them 
to be. My Father's Advice and Reproof came in 
my Mind, whether I wuold or not, and fhocked me 
exceedingly, and would often make me refledl that 
the Juftice ^of God followed me, and that fevere Pu- 
nifhment was juftly owing to my Difobedience and 
wicked Life. 

June 28, 1 flept pretty wellmbftPart of the Night, 
which refreftied me very much ; in the Morning I 
ate a Bifcuit and drank fome Water mixed with 
JRum ; I boiled a Piece of Goat's Fleih for my Din- 
ner, but ate very little, and at Night I fupped upon 
tiiree of my Turtle's Eggs ; after Supper I attempted 
to walk out with my Gun, but found myfelf too 
weak, and fo returned to my Habitation, 

Here Confcience flew in my Face, reprehending 
me as a Blafphemer and a Reprobate ; for faying, in 
my Agonies, What hwve I done ^ to be dijiinguijhed in. 
ail thii Scene of Mifery? Methought I heard a Voice 
anfwering me. Ungrateful Wretch! Dare you afk 
fiubat you hahje done? Look upon your pafi Lfe, and then 
fifk thyfelf Why thou ixjaji not dronuned in Yarm»uth- 
^Koad, or killed by the Sallee Rovers? Why not de- 
H}oured by wild Btofts in the Dejarts of Africa, or 
dro'voned here ^;ith the Reji of thy Companions? 

Struck dumb by thefe fevere Refleftions, and, 
fearing the Return of my Ague, 1 began at length 
to coiSider what was molt proper to be done, to

free myfelf from this Difte/nper ; and, having hea 
that the BrafJians ufe Tobacco for moll of theit 
Difeafes, I refolved to try this Experiment. 

I tried feveral Ways with the Tobacco : FirlJ, I 
took a Leaf and chewed it, which made me ycry 
fick, and alraoft ilupified me ; then 1 fteeped it in 
Rum, refolving to take a good Dofe of it when I 
went to Bed, and then I put fome into a Pan, and 
burnt ic, holding my Nofe over the Smoak as long 
as I could endure it wi':hout Suffocation. After thefe 
feveral Operations, I fell in:o a Sweat, and flept 
quietly and well for thirteen or fourteen Hours; 
and, when I got up in the Morning, [ found my Spi- 
rits revived, my Stomach much better, and I grew 
exceedingly hungry, which I had not been for fome 
Time pall : In ftort, I miffed my Fit the next Day, 
and found that I every Day grew (longer and bet- 
ter. 

The 30th, I ventared out with my Gun, and kil- 
led a Fowl not much unlike a Brand -Goofe, but did 
not eat of the Fleih, chufing rather to dine upon tvvd 
or three more of ray Turtle's Eggs. In the Evening 
I renewed my Medicine ; notwithftanding which, I 
had a little Spice of my Fit the next Day ; and, there- 
fore, on the 2d of July, I took my Medicine as I 
did at firfl ; and on the 14th, which was the Day I 
cxpeiled the Return of my Fit, the Ague left me, 
which wasnofmall Joy tome; and, indeed, the Good- 
nefs of God, on this Occafion, affeded me fo fenfir 
bly, that 1 fell on my Knees, and returned Thanks 
in a moil devout and folemn Manner. 

Ju/y 4, I walked out with my Gun ; but my Dif- 
teraper having reduced me very low I could go but a 
little Way at a Time ; for, the Experimenc having 
weakened me exceedingly, I was able to walk but 
a very ihort Wd/ at once. I bad now been in the

40 LIFE and Adventures of 

Ifland about ten Months, and all the while had net 
feen either Man or Woman ; and fo, growing bet- 
ter, 1 began to think ipyfeif fole Monarch of the 
Ifle; and, growing ii-differently well, I re'olved to 
take a Tour about the ifle, in Order to view the Ex- 
tent of my Dominions, and to make wha't Difcove- 
ries I could. 

On the 15th I began my journey ; and, among o- 
ther Things, I found a little Brook of running Water ; 
on the Banks of which were many pleafant Meadows 
covered with Grafs; I faw feveral Sralks of Tobacco, 
and other Plants I knew Nothing af ; among the Reft 
I found fome Sugar-Canes, leveral Plants of Aloe- 
Wands, i^c. With thefe Difcoveries I returned well 
fatisfied to my little Caftle, and flept that Night very 
comfortably. 

The next Day, going the fame Way, and farther 
than before, I found the Country full of Wood, and 
exceedingly pleafant and dfhghtful. The Melon* 
lay upon the Ground in great Quaotkies, andClufters 
ot Grapes hung upon the Trees. You may imagine 
I was glad of this Difcovery, yet ate ve?y fparingly, 
Idl I fhould throw myfelf into a Flux or a Fever, 

The Night coming on, I climbed up into a Tree, 
and, having fixed myfelf as fecurely as pollible, fiept 
vtry comfortably, though it was the firft Time I had 
ever lain out of my Habitation, When the Morn- 
ing came, I proceedf d witii the grcateft Pleafure a- 
"iibut four M'hs farther ; and, at the End of the Val- 
leys, 1 found a Spring of excellent Water, and the 
Country all rouno the moll beautiful I ever faw ; and 
now I refolved .0 lay in as much of the Fruits as 
poffible.

thither again, in Or ier to bring Home to my Caftie 
as much of the feveral Sorts pf Fruits as I could,

that I might have a Stock by ir.e againft I ihoula 
want it. And now I began to refittt that this Part 
of the Iflar.d was irfinirely the beft to inhabit in j 
but then I thought, at the fame Time, that, if I re- 
moved fiom my prefent Place of Abode, I fnculd 
Jofe the Profpeft of the Sea ; and fo, if Providence 
ihould order a Ship on that Ccail, I fhculd lofe all 
Poflibility of Deliverance. However, the Place was 
fo delightful, 1 refolved to build me a Kind of Bower, 
which took me up th« Remainder of July. 

H-ere it was I dried my Grapes, which I after- 
wards carried to ray old Habitation, for a Winter 
Supply. On the 14th of /iugujl, the Rain began 
to fall with gr^at Violence, which made me judge 
it proper to retire to my Caftle for Shelter. The 
Rains continued to fall, more or lefs, till the Middle 
of Oaoher^ and fon:jetimes with that Violence, that 
for feveral Days I could not llir out of my Cave, 
till I was confl rained to it by the pure Want oi Food„ 
I wenc out twice ; the firit Time i (hot a Goat, and 
the leeond Time 1 found another Turtle, as large as 
the former. 

September 30. Caftiog up the Notches on the Poft, 
which amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the 
Anniverfary of my Landing. And, after I had re- 
turned Thanks for my wonderful Prefervation in this 
delolate IHand, I went to my ^t^^ and flept vtry 
comfortably. 

Befoie I proceed farther in my Journal, I muft 
take the Liberty to put the Reader in Mind of the 
Barley and Rice : I had faved about thirty Stalks 
of the former, and twenty of the latter j and, con- 
cluding the Seafon to be proper, I dug op fome 
Ground with my wooden Spade, and lowed it; 
which at the proper Time grew up, aud anfweieu^ 
my Expectations.

clination ]&6. me again to the Bower I had built on 
the other Side of the liland, which I found whole 
and entire as I had left it, and the Stakes all growing 
much after the Nature of our Willows, which in 
Time made me a noble Fence, as I fhall have Occa- 
fion to obferve more particular!)' hereafter. 

And now I conceived that the Seafons of the Year 
might be divided into wet and dry, and not into 
Suaaraer and Winter, as in Europe ; as thus :

And, as the Wind continued ♦© blow, the wet Sear, 
fons would coDtinue either longer or Ihorter. After 
I had made there and the like Obfervations, I 
always took Care to provide Neccffaries, that I might 
Hay within during the Wetnefa of the Weather, and 
in that Time I took Care to make me fuch Tools 
as I mod wanted. 

The firft Thing I attempted was to make me a 
Bafket, which, after much Labour and Difficulty, I 
effefted ; but the two Things I moft wanted were 
utterly out of my Power^ n}i%. fome Calks to hold 
my Liquors, and fmall Pots to boil and flew my 
Meat, and alfo a Tobacco-pipe, for which I at laH 
found out a Remedy. 

After the Weather grew fair, my farther Refolu- 
tion of viewing the whole Ifland took Place ; ac- 
cordingly, taking my Dog and Gun, and other Ne- 
ceffaries proper, 1 fet forward ; and, having paffed the 
Vale where my Bower flood, I came within Sight of 
^he Sea, lying to the W, and, when it was clear Day, 

I could

I could difcover Land, but could rot tell \\hetherit 
was an Kand or a Continent; neiiher could X tell 
what Place thi: might be, only I thought it was ia 
America, and confequently th^t Part of the Country 
that lies betweeu the Spo.nijh Territories and the 
Brafih, which abuund with Cannibals, who devour 
human Kind. ' 

In viewing this Pare of the liland, i found it was 
mjch more pleafant and fruitlui than where I had 
pitched my Tent. Here weie great Numbers of 
Parrots, and with great Difficulty I got one of them 
jvhich I -carried Home with n.e, but it was a great 
while before, I could tame it and bring it to fp'.^ak, 
even fo much as to call me by my Name. 

in the low Grounds I found great Numbers of 
Hares and Foxes, and Abundance of FowK" of difFe- 
yent Kit ds, with great Quantities of Gr-pes and 
other excellent Fruits ; in this Expedition 1 d.ia not 
travel above two Miles a Day, being deftrous to n;ake 
what Difccveries I could. When I came to the Sea- 
fliore, 1 Vv-as' amazed to fee it exceedingly beautiful, 
a^d fo fu!I of exceilent Fiih. But though this Journey 
.^was fo delightful to me, yet my fecret inclination led 
^.e to my old Habitation ; {o, after I had fet up a Sort 
of Land-mark for my Guide for the future, »I con- 
cluded to return back by a different Way than that I 
came ; and, as I was making the bell of my Way, 
xxay Dog happened to furprife a Kid, which I refcued 
from him, and led it to my Bower, in Order to try if 
1 could raife a Breed, which at fome Time or othet 
I was fatisfied would be of great Ufe to me^. 

After I had been about a Month upon this Expedi- 
tion, 1 returned to ray little Caftle, and repofed my- 
felf with great Pleafure in my Hammock, and con- 
tinued a Week within to reft and refreili myfeif. 

And now I began to think of the Kid I had left 

in

ini rhe Bower, and refolved immediately to fetch it 
Id JDme. When I came there, I found it almoft 
Oreirved ; when, feeding it with Branches of fuch 
IioArubs as I could find, the poor Creature, in Gratitude 
3 gf its Deliverance, followed me, as naturally as my 
I Dg, quite Home to my Caflle, which I afceiwards 
^eaipc as one of my Domeftics. 

or The wet Seafon being come, I kept myfelf with- 
in ;; and, on the 30th of September, being the third 
Y<ear of my Abode in this Ifland, I paid my folemn 
Acknowledgments to Almighty God for ray Prefer va- 
tir&n, and entertained myfelf with a World of Re- 
fl';;£lions upon my prefent and former Condition ; and,* 
as 1 was one Morning fadly pondering upon my pre- 
fent State, I happened to open my Bible, when I 
fixed my Eyes on thtfe Words, I <u:ili ne'ver leave 
thee, nor forfake thee ; which I prefently took as di- 
reded to myfelf: and, I rauft own, the Expreflion/ 
gave me a great Deal of fecret Satisfaftion. / 

The Beginning of this Year I fixed my aily Ehh 
ployments as follow : The Morning I {pent in mj 
Devotions, and paying my Duty to God ; after I 
had done that, I went out with my Gun, to feek 
Provifion ; which, after I had got it, took me up fome 
Time in dreifing and cooking ; in the Middle of the 
Day I was farced to lie by, by Reafon of the cx- 
ceffive Heat ; and the Reft of the Time I fpent in 
making and contriving fuch Neceffaries as I flood 
mod in Need of. 

But now the Time for my little Harveft coming 
on, I had the defirableProfped of a good Cro|), but 
my Hopes were fadly dilappointed by the Goats 
and Hares ; who, having tafted the Sweetnefs c» my 
Corn, had cropped it fo clofe, that it had not 
Strength to (hoot up into a Stalk : To p-eveni this, 
r-was forced to make a Hedge round it ; but I had 

no.

no fooner done this, than I was infefted with Verml ti 
of another Sort ; my Back was no fooner turned, l^it 
whole Flocks of Birds came and dellroyed what j_^- 
others had left ; I let fly at thefe, and killed tl^ff^ 
of them, which I hung upon Stakes, as a Terrf^Ql^ 
the Reft ; which Project had fo good an Effeft, j)f 
they not only forfook the Corn, but that Part ot^^: 
Ifland for ever after. |^^ 

My Corn growing ripe, and Harveft coming on, 
I cut it down and carried Home the Ears ; and, aftt^r 
I had rubbed thsm, and threftied them in the be'll 
Manner 1 could, as near as I could conje6lure, the 
Produce of the Barley was about two Bufhels and a, 
Half, and that of the Rice much about the fame 
Quantity ; and now I plainly faw, by the Provi-i. 
denceofGod, Ilhould be fupplied with Corn, thoughf 
at the fame Time I wanted all Manner of NecefTariey 
for making it into Bread, which with the greateit 
Labour and Difficulty I afterwards fupplied. 

My Seed being thus increafed, my next Care was 
t» prepare more Land to fow it in ; and accordingly 
I/fixed upon two large Plats on the Back-fide of my 
Caftle, in which I fowed my Seed, and fenced it 
with a good Hedge, to defend it from the Vermin. 

In Ihovt, my Corn increafed to that Degree, that 
I thought I might now venture to eat fome of it ; 
but how to make it into Bread was Itili the Diffi- 
culty ; and yet even this I found the Means to fur- 
jnount at laft ; and fo, as in all other Emergencies, 
I found a Remedy beyond my Expeftation. 

After I had procured every Thing needful for 
making my Bread, which you may imagine was no 
fmall Satisfaftion, the Profpeft of Land, which 1 had 
feen from the other Side of the Ifland, ran ftill in my 
Mind ; but how I ihould come at it, I w^s utterly

at a Lofs to know ; I tried to recover the Ship's Boat, 
and then to make me a Canoe, but all in vain ; and 
here I could not forbear refleding upon the Folly o£ 
thofe who undertake Matters chat they are not able 
to go throogh with. 

I was in the Midllofmy Projeds, when my fourth 
Year expired fince I had been call on this Iflan'd ; 
nor did I forget to keep my Annivcrfary with that 
Solemnity and Devotion that I had done the Year be- 
fore; I began to think myfelf feparated from the 
World, and from all Opportunities of friendly Con- 
yerfation. I had Nothing to covec, being, as it were, 
&n Emperor or King of a whole Country, where I 
had Nobody to controul me, nor any Body to govera 
but myfelf. 

Thefe Thoaghts Liade me look upon the Things 
of this World with a Sort of religious Contempt, and 
rendered me eafy in my defolateand melancholy Con- 
dition ; for, having made God's Me?cies to me Mat- 
ters of the highefl Confolation, I relinquifhed all pen- 
five Thou^ts and difmal Apprehsnfions, and re* 
figned myfelf up entirely to God's Providence. 

My Ink was quite gone, and my Bifcuit almoft ex- 
haafted j my Linen was worn out, only ibme ©f the 
Sailors chicked Shirts remained, which were of 
mighty Ufa to me in hot Weather. My Clo2th$ 
and Hat were quite worn, but thofe I fupplied by 
the Help of my Goats-fkins, of which I firft made 
me a Sort of a Cap, and then aWaiftcoat, and open- 
kneed Breeches, with the Hair on the Outfide ; and 
thus being perfectly at Eiife in my Mind, I fpent my 
7'ime in contemplating the Bleffings of Heaven, and 
»Vas raviflied to think that one Time or other I 
^•^ould be delivered from my prefent Misfortunes,

to try to difcover the Circumference of my Domini- 
ons ; and, in Order to it, J put Provifions on-board, 
with Ammunition, and all other Neceffanes fit for 
the Expedition. 

It was the i6th of No'vemhery in the 9th Year of 
my Reign, that I began this Voyage, which was. 
much longer than I expefted, by Reafon I had many 
Difficulties to encounter I did not fufpedl ; and in- 
deed the Rocks were fo high, and ran fo far into the 
Sea, that I often refolred to turn back, rather .than 
run the Rifque of being driven fo far out to Sea as 
by no Means to be able to get back again. 

in this Confufion I came to an Anchor as near to 
the Shore as poffible, to which I waded, and, climb- 
ing up to the Top of a high Hill, 1 viewed the Ex- 
tent of my Dominions, and, at all Hazards, re- 
folved to purfue my Voyage. It is endlefs to relate 
what Dariger my Rafhnefs expofed me to ; I was 
driven by the Current fo far into the Sea, that 1 had 
hardly any Profped of getting back again ; not by 
all I could do with my Paddles, which I had made 
to fupply the Place of Sculls to help me ; and now 
had no Profpedl but perifliing at Sea when my Pro- 
vifions were fpent, or, if a Storm ihould arife, be- 
fore. However, by the lucky Chance of the 
Wind, or rather by the particular Providence of 
God, I was uiven back again to the Ifland, and, 
to my unfpeai.-able Joy, i came on-ihore; where# 
being exceedir.gly fatigued with Watching and 
hard Labour, 1 )j:d me down and took a little Re- 
pofe. After I i woke, and had dreffed myfelf »|/

Creek fit for my Purpofe, and, taking my Gu/

a great Confufion, 5nd, calHng my Eyes round, I 
faw my Parrot fi ting upon the Hedge; and then f 
knew it was ihe that called me, but was Ifrangely 
iurprized how the Creature came there, and why it 
fhculd fix upon that Place above the Reft. The Bird 
came to me as foon as I called it, and perched upon 
my Finger, as ufual, and feemed to fignify a great 
Deal of Joy for my Return. 

This Voyage had cured me of a great Deal of my 
rambling Inclination ; infomach that I began to lay 
^iide all Hopes of Deliverance ; fo I led a retired 
Life, and in a very contented Manner paiTed away 
near twelve Months, fpending my Time in making 
Inlhuments, and doing fuch Things as I found \vere 
moft abfolutely neceliary, both for my prefent an4 
future Subfiftence. 

My next Confideration was, my Powder growing 
fhort, what 1 Ihould do to kill the Goats and Fowls 
to live upon : I had Abundance of Contrivances in 
ray Head to try to catch the Goats alive, particularly 
the (he Goats with Young, and at length I had my 
Defire ; for, making Pit- falls, and baltirg them with 
fome of my Corn, one Morning I found in one of 
them an old he Goat, and in the other three young 
ones, one Male and two Females. 

The old one was too ftrong for me, and I could 
not tell how to mafter him ; but the Kids I made 
Shift to get to my Habitation. It was lome Time 
before I could make them feed, but after they had 
for fome Time been kept without Food, and I threw 
them fome frefh Corn, and gave them fome Water,

that they would follow me, andeatCorn <ut of my 
Hand. This having anfwered my Ends, I think, in 
about eighteen Monrhs Time, I had got a Flock of 
about twelve ; and in lefs than two Years forty- 
three ; and now I was not only provided with Goat*s 
Flefh, but with Milk alfo, which was another Blef- 
fing I had little Reafon to expeft. 

Being thus happy, and having almoft forgot all 
Hopes of Liberty, 1 lived as well as the Nature of 
iriy Condition could pofTibly allow: and, indeed, it 
was a very diverting Sight to fee me fit in State at 
my Dinner, all alone by piyfelf, like a King ; and it 
would have been a very pleafant Objedl to have feen 
rae in my Goat-lkin Drefs, and other fuitable Habi- 
liments. ■ 

My chief Concern now was about my Boat, which 
I was extremely unwilling t^lofc, it having coft me fo 
much hai-d Labour : I went by Land to the Place 
where 1 left it, but found there was no Way to bring 
it off, without running the fame Rifque I was fo lately 
cxpofed to, which I thought too dangerons for a fe- 
cond Experiment, and therefore I refolved upon Bro- 
ther Expedient, which was to make another Canoe, 
and leave it on the other Side of the Ifland. 

And here 1 think it may not be improper to in* 
form the Reader that I had two Plantations in the 
Jfland ; the firfl was my little Fort, or Caftle, where 
I had made ieveral Improvements; and the fecond 
was my Bower, or Country-Seat, where were my 
Grapes, and the Enclofures for my Goats, and feve- 
ral other Conveniences, that made it a VQiy pleafant 
and agreeable Retii«;ment.

To this Place it was that I ufed to go often to 
vie^v my Goats. And now 1 ftia'l relate a T'hing 
rhat give me the moft Difqoietof any Thing ;hat I 
had met with fince my firft coming into the Jfland. 

it may well be fuppofed that, aUer I had been (o 
long in this defolate Part of the World, Nothing 
could have been more amazing than to have leea 
any human Creature ; bur, one Day, as I was going 
to my Bo3^, as ufual, I perceived, on the Sand, the 
Print of a Man's naked Foot; and, had Ifeen an Ap- 
parition, 1 could not have been more terrified. I 
looked round me on all Sides, bat could not he^^r or 
fee any Thing ; I obferve^i the TrampHngs, and was 
convinced, from all Signs, that fome Foot had been 
there: and, in the deepeft Confufion, I returned back 
to my Habitation. 

That Night I never clofed my Eyes, and was full 
of the moft difmal Apprehcnfions that I ever had in 
all my Life. Sometimes T had the Folly to think 
it muft be the Devil.; at ofher Times I thought it 
rather fome Savage, that the Current had driven in, 
and, not liking the Place, was ftcretly gone off to 
Sea again. Happy was I, in my Thoughts, that 

^pone of the Savages had feen me; and yet, at the 
fame Time, I was exceedingly terrified left they 
Ihould have feen my Boat, and fo come in great 
Numbers, and find me out, and devour me, and all 
my little Stock, that I had been fo long in gathering. 
Thefe Thoughts afHi6.ed me extremely j and yec, 
after mature Confideration, I concluded it was my* 
bell Way to throw myfelf upon the Sovereign Go- 
vernor of the World, and to fubmit iatirely to his 
Mercy and providence. 

After a World of Fears and Apprehenfions, for 

three Nights and Days, l-yejntured out of my For- 

: ; I milked my Goats, at^d, after I had put every

52 LIFE ^;?^ Adventure^ of 

.Thing in Order, not without the greatefl Conflerna- 
tion, I went again to the Shore to make my farther 
Obfcrvations ; and, upon the Whole, concluded, that 
either the ifland was inhabited, or that lome Perfon 
had been on-ftiore, and that 1 might be furpriied 
before I was aware. 

This put feveral frightful Notions into my Head, 
infomuch that Sleep was an entire Stranger to me ; 
my whole Thoughts being taken up on Nothing but 
my Prefervation, I put my littie Callie into the bell 
, Pofture of Defence 1 was ab'e, and placed all my 
Guns fo that they might be lerviceable if 1 fliouid 
have Occafion to make Ufe of them. 

,1 divided my Goats into feveral Parcels ; ten Slie- 
Goats and two He-ones I put into one Part of the 
Ifland, and the other ten, with tvyo He-ones, in ano- 
ther ; and, whilft I was in Search of the latter, which 
was on the Weftern Part of the Ifland, I thought I 
difcovered a Boar, but at too great a Diftance to make 
out what ftie was. Being come to the Shore, upon the 
S. W. Part of the Ifland, I was convinced that they 
were Savages, feeing the Place covered over with the 
Skulls and mangled Limbs of human Bodies. 1 ob- f 
fervcd likewife a Sort of a. Circle, in the Midft of | 
which I perceived there had been a Pire ; about this 
I conjedured thefe Wretches £at, and unnaturally 
facrihced and devoured their Fellow-Creatures. 

The Horror and Loathfulnefs of this dreadful 
Speftacle confounded me fo, that, though I was latis- 
fied thefe Savages jiever came into the Pyrt of the 
Ifland where! was, yetfuch an Abhorrence of them, 
had feized me, that for two Years I confined my^.tM 
to my Caftle, my Country-Seat, and my Inclofures ;! 
and thus my Circumftences remained for feme Time 
uwiifturbed. But ftill my grand Intention remained, . , 

which' I

which was, to try if I could deftroy fome of thoie 
Savages, and fave a Vidim that I might afterwards 
make my Servant. 

Many were my Projedls and Contrivances to bring 
this about ; at length 1 canne to this fettled Refolu- 
tidn, to lie privately in Ambufh, in fome convenient 
Place, and let fly -upon them-witn my Gurs firll, and 
then with my Piftols, and Sword in Hand ; and (o 
much did this Propofal pleafe my Fancy, that I 
fully refolved to put it in Practice the firil Opportu* 
nity ; and, accordingly, I foon found a Place conve- 
nient for my Purpofe ; but, at the fame Time, J had 
feveral Checks of Confcience, and Reafonings with 
myfelf, concerning the Lawfulnefs and Juftice of the 
Attempt; and, after along Debate, I concluded to 
lay afide the Defign. 

Whilll I was cutting down fome Wood one Day, 
to make Charcoal to drefs my Meat and do the 
Family NecefTaries, I perceived a very large Cavity ; 
and, going towards it, I could perceive two iarge Eyes 
i^aring upon me ; upon which I made flafte out, ex- 
tremely terrified, not imagining what it could be 
that looked fo frightfully : However, after I had re- 
covered from my Surprize, I went again into the 
Cavity, refolving, at all Hazards, to fee what ic was ; 
and, when I came near enough to difcern ii pcrfedly, 
what ihould it be, after all, but a monftrous He-Goat 
lying on the Ground, and gafping for Life, thrcoghi 
mere old Age. 

•The Creatcre was not able to fta.id, and fo I let 
him lie undillurbed, and employed rnyfeif in view- 
ing the Place, and making Obfer.vations. At t;he far- 
ther Side of it I obferved a Sort of an Entrance, 
bat fo low, as to oblige me to creep on my

Place was dark, and fo I fuipended my Enicrpr.^e

A^vcr I had pafied the ftrait Paflage, I found the 
Koof rofe higher up ; and, fure, when I got far- 
ther in, no Mortal ever faw a more bea^utiful Sight ! 
The Walls and the Roof refleaed a Thousand Lfghts 
from my two Cand'es 5 and, indeed, it feemed to me 
the moft delightful Grotto I bad ever heard of. In^ 
fnort, J could find no Fault but in the Entrance, and 
which 1 thought would be very necellary for my 
Defence and Secu'ity; therefore I determined to 
mzike the Place my principal Magazine; and, ac- 
cordingly, I carried thither, with the utmoft Expedi- 
tion, fome Arms and Ammunition, judging it ira- 
poiuble for me to be furprized by the Savages in that 
-Faiinefs. 

, I think I was now in the 23d Year of my Reign, 
afid tolerably eafy in my Condition. By this Time 
my Parrot had learnt to talk Englijh very well, aad

that J was often forced to deftroy fome of them, left

Terrified with this unufual Spedlacle, and being 
under dilmal Apprehenfions thatchefe Savages vyould 
find me ouc, and deltroy me, I went direftjy Home 
to roy Caflle, and Ihut myfelf up as fail as I could, 
and put royielf into a Pollure of Defence ; ancf af- 
terwaids I got up to the Top of the Rock, ant^, view- 
ing with my Profpe^iive-Glafs, I could difcern no 
lels than nine naked Savages fitting round a Fire, and 
eating (as I fuppofed) human Fle(h, with their two 
Canoes haukd on Shore, waiting lor the Tide to carry 
them back again. 

Nothing can exprefs my Detellation of fo horrid 
a Sight ; Efpecially, when I found they were gone, 
and I had been at the Place of Sacrifice, and faw the 
Limbs and Flefh of human Creatures Jie torn and 
jnangled upon the Ground : In Ihort, my Indigna- 
tion againlt them rofe fo high, that, let the Confe- 
quence be vvhat it would, I determined to be reven- 
ged upon the flril that fhould come thither, though X 
loft my Life in the Attempt.' 

I found afterwards that they did not come over 
to this liQand very often ; and, as near us I can re- 
member, it was a V'ear or more before I faw any 
more cf them. But, before I proceed farther, I 
have another Account that will deferve the Reader's 
Attention. 

It was the i5th of May^ according to my wooden 
Calendar, after a very terrible Storm, when X was 
alarmed with the Noife of a Gun, as fired from z 
Ship in Diilrefs ; upon which I immediately took 
my Glafs, and we.it up to the Top of the Rock, 
where I had not been a Moment but a Flame of Fire 
gave Notice of another Gan ; and then I was con- 
firmed in my Opinio/?, that it could bf Nothing leh 
than a Ship in i^iftrefs ; which, with my G!ais, I 
foon difc^v«red to be true ; and that the Wreck was

upon thofc hidden Rocks, where I was in great Dan- 
ger of being iofl in my Boat. 

I made a F>re upon the Hi!! by Way of Signal-, 
a«d they faw it, and'anfwered it with feveral Guns. 
The Weather was very hazy, and fo I could not, at 
that Time, difcover either at what Dillance the Ship 
lay, or what ihe was ; but, the Weather clearing up, 
I law a Ship caft away fome Diftance at Sea. 

I had feveral Notions concerning them, as is natu- 
ral in fuch Cafes ; but, confidering ferioully the 
Place where they were, and all other Circumilances, 
I could not conceive any Poflibility but that they 
muft be all loft ; and, indeed, to the laft Year of my 
being in this Ifland, I never knew of any that were 
fave<i nut of this Ship j I only faw the Body of a 
Boy which was'drrven on Shore, but I coul<inot dif- 
cover by him of what Nation they were. ^ 

The Sea was now very calm, which tempted me ** 
to venture to the Wreck, not only in Hopes to get 
Something I wanted, but like wife, if there was any 
Body left alive in the Ship, to endeavour to fave 
iheir Lives This Refolutioh fo far prevailed, that 
I went Home immediately, and got every Thing 
ready for the Voyage: and accordingly, after a 
great Deal of Labour, Hazard, and Difficulty, I at 
length got to the Wreck, which I beheld with the 
greateft Pity and Concern. By her Built I found {he 
was a Spaniard^ and had endured a terrible Conflift 
before fhe was loft. 

When I was come rear to her, I faw a Dog on- 
board, who no foojjer faw me but he fell to yelping 
and nowling, and I no fooner called to him, but the 
poor Creature jumped into the Sea, and fwam to me,

Boat, together with two Chefls and a Cafk of P^am ; 
and, after a great Deal of Toil and DifRculty,. I got 
fafe back to the Ifland. 

I repofed myfelf that Night in the Boat, and, the

in thi two ChtHs feveral Things I wanted, particu- 
hrly fome Shirts and HandkercliieFs ; I found alfo 
three Bags of Pieces of Eight ; all which I would 
willingly have given for five or fix Pairs of Englifo 
Shoes and Stockings. 

After I had Howed all this new Cargoe in my 
Cave, I made the beft of my Way to my Caftle, and 
found every Thing as I left it, fo thai I had Nothing 
to do but to repofe myfelf, and take Care of my 
Domeftics. And now, wanting Nothing that was 
requifite for the Support of Life, I might have lived 
very quiet, had not the Apprehenfian of the Savages 
difturbed me ; upon which Account I feldom went 
far abroad, if I did, it was to the Eaflern Part of 
the Jfland, where I well knew they never came : 
And for two Years I lived in this anxious Condition, 
my Head being always full of Projefts how I might 
get away from this defolate Place. 

As I obferved before, though 1 was tolerably fecure 
againft the Reach of Want, and had all the Diver- 
fion the Nature of the Jfland would allow, j^i the 
Thoughts of my Deiive-ance were ftiU uppermoft, as^' 
the Reader will eafily perceive by the following Re- 
lation, in which I fhall give a fhort Account of the 
Schemes rind Projefts 1 made for my Efcape. 

As I lay in my 3ed one Night in March, the 24th 
Year of my Sclitude, I ran through all the Accounts 
of my Life, from my very firfl Remembrance to 
the prefent Time, and found all along that the Pro- 
vidence of God bad been exceedingly kind and mer- 
ciful to me, and, when I coniidered, more pariicu- 
lirly, how many Dangers I had pafTed, it could not 
but make me devoutly thankful to my great Deliverer,' 
Without whofe Allii^ance I muil iaevitabJ/ have p««

i^ftcr I had thus briefly debated with Vyfelf on my 
prefent and former Condition, I began next to con- 
fider the Nature of thefe Savages, and the Country 
that they inhabited, how far it was to the Place from 
whence they came, and what Boats they had to 
bring them over hither, and at the fame Time had 
fome Notions to go over to their Side, to fee what 
Difcoveries I could make. 

i had Notions, that, if by any Method I could get 
upon the Continent, 1 might, in Time, meet with a 
Ship to carry me to Europe, for here I looked upoa 
myitlf to, be the mod miferable Man living, and 
preferred even Death itfelftomy Stay in this defo- 
late Ifland. Whilit my Thoughts were thus confu- 
fed, I had no Notion of any Thing but my Voyage 
to the Continent; and, indeed, fo much was I in- 
flamed with thefe Notions, that I in a gre^t Mea- 
fure forgot my Duty to God, and was reduced almod 
to a State of Defperation ; and, after maay Thoughts 
and Strugglings iji my Mind, I came at length to this 
Conclufion, 'viz. That the only probable Way I had 
to efcape, was to get one of thefe Savages j which I 
could find no other Way to bring about, than by 
ventu ing jny Life to fdve him from the Jaws of hi» 
Devourers, which I thought muft infpi'e him wiiK^ 
Gratitude to his Preferver. 

Thefe were my fixed Refolutions;butI thinkit wa» 
at leail a Year and a Half before I could iind an Op- 
portunity of putting them in Execution. To the beft 
of my Remembrance it was the 23d Day of ^W/, 
early in the Morning, when 1 was turprifed with the 
Signt of five Cashes, all on Ihore together, on my 
Side of the Ifland, and the Creatures that belonged 
to them all ianded and out of Sight. 

At firft I thought all thefe Boats muft bring too 

many to be auackcd by one Ferfon^ and was in a

ever, being impatient to fee Something of rheir Ma- 
nagement, 1 tooK my Guns, and went fecretly to the 
Top of the Hiil, v/here, by the Help of my Pro- 
fpeaive-GIaTs, I obferved no lefs than thirty fitting 
round a Fire, and feafting upon what Meat they had 
dreffed : What it was I could not diftinguifh ; but 
they were all dancing around tl>e Flames, and ufing 
many frightful and barbarous Geftures. 




Whilft T v-3 looking earnelUy on thefe W< arches, 
I could, Ji cern thern dragging l'^ milerabl^ jCrea-

before I faw one of them knocked Hown, and thfee

Whilft the other miferable Creature flood expeft- 
ing every Moment the Fate of his Companion, in- 
fpired with thse Hopes of Life, he gave a fudden Start 
, from ihem, and ran with- great Swiftnefs towards my 
Caitle. I was under great Apprehenfions that he 
would fly to my Grove for Protection. I was glad 
to lee he had the Heels 'of them, and, from hii Swift- 
nefs, concluded he would prefently lofe Sight of them, 
asji fave his liife. There was a little Creek juft before 
him, -where 1 was afraid the poor Vidim would be ta- 
ken if he could not fwim ; butit happened that he fwam 
very wtil and foon got orer, and ran again with his 
former Strength and Swiitnefs. Two, of the three 
that followed him, fwam over after him, biit the other, 
that cGuid not fwim, returned back to his Companions. 
■^And row, cr never, I thought it was my Tinte to 
Iprocure a Savage for my Companion. Accordingly, 
V^^th ail the Speed 1 could, 1 came down frooi tke 
fCock, took up my two Guns, refolvjng to fave the 
Victim if poliible ; ard, in Order to it, came a nearer 
Way, and put myfelf between the Puriuers and ,he 
Pu.'fued, beckoning to the latter to fiand llilj, who, 
you muft imagine, was not a little furprifcd at me. 
The fifft Purluer ycnocked down with the Stock ,of 
my Piece, and the other, who I perceived was prl- 
paring his Bow and Arrow to ihoot me, I let fly at, 
and killed him dead upon the Spot. 

The poor frighted Indian was amazed to fee the 
li?jre and hear tl!e Noife of the Gun; however, I 
made Signs to him to come to me, which at length 
he did, but not w;thouL a gri?'X De^Ji of Fear and 
.Tiembiing,, being a'^aid, 1 beieve, [ Ihould kill 
him too. I did all I could to convince him of his 
JMiftake, and at length fo far convinced him, by the 
Signs I made him, that he came to me, and threw

it upon his Head ; which was a Token, it feems, of 
his Refolution to be my Slave for ever j upon which 
I took him up, made much of him, and encoura- 
ged him in the beft Manner I could. 

liy this Time 1 fav/ that the Savage, I had knocked 
down, began to recover, and was fitting upright, 
which made my new Slave as much afraid as before, 
but I foon prevented his Fright, by prefenting my 
Piece at him; but my Savage oppoied my Ihooting 
him, making a Sign to me to lend him my Sword, 
which hung by my Side, and no fooner had I grant- 
ed his Requeft, but away he ran to his Enemy, and, 
vtry dexteroufly, at one Blow, cut off his Head ; 
and, as a Token of Triumph, brought it to me, to- 
gether with my Sword, and laid it at my Feet. 

The greateft Aftonifhmentmy new Servant was in, 
was, how I killed the Savage, at that Diftance, with- 
out a Bow and Arrow; and, to fatisfy himfelf in that 
Matter, he made Sigus to me to let him go and \itw 
the Body, which I granted ; after he had turned 
him, and viewed the Wound the Bullet had made in 
his Breaft, he took up his Bow and Arrows, and 
came back to me again, making Signs to me to give 
hira Leave to bury him, which; with my Conlent, 
he performed with wonderful Dexterity. 

When I perceived he had done, 1 ca led him away, 
and carried him diredly to my Cave, where I gave 
him Visuals, and then pointed to him to lie down 
upon fome Straw, and take a little Rell. He was %. 
very handfome well-proportioned Fellow, and in all 
Kefpefts the mod beautiful Indian I ever faw. 

1 think he had not llept above an Hour, before he 
came out of the Cave to me, as I was milking my 
Goats, and again threw himfelf at my Feet, and put 
my other Foot upon his Head, as a farthei Token 
that he intended to be my Slare for ever. 

That 



Robinson Crusoe. 

That Night we ftayed in the Cave ; but, early tha 
next Morning, 1 made Signs to bim to rife and go 
with me ; and, withal, made him to underftand ihat 
his Name was to be Friday^ it being on that Day 
I faved his Life, and that I intended to give him fome 
Cloaths to hide his Nakednefs. As we pafled by the 
Place where the Savages were buried, he pointed 
diredly to the Graves, and let me know by his Gef- 
lures that he intended to dig them up* and devour 
them, upon which I let him lee I was extremely dif- 
pleafed at ir, and made him come away, which he 
did with the greateft Reverence. 

In our Way to the Caftle, we went to the Top 
of a Hill to view if the Savages were gone, and, 
Ending they were, we refreflied ourfeives for that 
Night, and the next Morning I relolved to arm 
myfelf, and take my Man with me, and go to view 
the Place where they committed their Barbarities. 
V\ hen we came upon the Spot, it is impoflible to 
•expref^ the Horriblenels of the Sight ! Here lay 
the Fleih and Entrails, and there the mangled 
Limbs, of human Creatures ; ir\ {hort, it filled me 
with the greateft Horror and Deteftation. Friday 
gave me to underlland that there were three there 
lacfificed, and, if I had not refcued him, he had 
been the fourth. I made him gather up the Frag- 
ments, and lay them in a Heap, and made a Fire 
upon them, and burnt them to Afhes ; and ftill I 
found my Man had a Hankering after fome of the 
Flefh, which I refented with the utmoft Abhor- 
rence, and made him underftard, that, ifevfrl 
found him guilty of any fuch Inhumanity, I would 
certainly (hoot him. 

After this we went to my Caftle, where I cloath- 
ed my Man as well as the Nature of the Place and 
my Circumllances would adroit. He fccmtd at

iirft a little aneafy and aukward in his new Drefs^ 
but, after he had worn them four or five Days, he 
grew familiar with them, and feemed extremely well, 
fatiified. Now my next Concern was, how I might 
lodge him well, and yet be eafy myJelf ; and, in Or- 
der to this, I erected him a little Tent between my 
two Fortifications, fecured my Arms every Night, 
and made every Thing io fafe, that it was impoifible 
for me to be furprized j though I mull at the lameTime 
own there was no Netd of thefe Cautions ; for never 
IWan was bleifed with a Servant thatloved and obeyed 
him wi'h greacer Tendernefs, Fidelity, and AfFeftion ; 
which endeartd me to him extremely, arid induced 
me to think how I might beft acquit myelf to him. . 
I had not bten above two or three Days in my 

. Caftle, when 1 firft propofed to bring him off from his 
barbarous Inclinations to human Fiefh ; in Order to 
which I ufed feveral Inticements ; till the poor 
Creature, who had the moll dutiful and tender Re- 
gard to every Thing I commanded him, and indeed 
did not want good benie, was perfef^ly Weaned from 
his vicious Inclination, and had as deep and fixed an 
Abhorrence of any fuch barbarous Proceedings as 
myfclf ; he fell upon his Knees, made all Signs of 
his Averfion be poiTibly could, pronouncing many 
Things I did not underftand ; only, in the Main, 1 
found that his only Apprehcnfions were from the Fear 
1 fliould fhoot him ; for the Thoughts of the Gun, 
and the Manner of the Execution it did, were flill in 
his Mind, and he could by no Means be reconciled 
to it ; he would never fo much as touch it with his 
Finger, for feyeral Days, and, I believe, if I had not 
prevented it, he would have paid it a Sort of Adora- 
tion : Ke would go, as often as my Back was turned, 
and talk to it in his ovv'n Dialeft ; the Intent of which 
was, to defire it not Co kill him.

I bad killed a Kid, which we brought Home, and 
the next Day I gave him feme of the Fleih, both 
boiled and roafted, with which he was fo much de- 
lighted, that he gave me Si^ns (which I perfedlly un- 
derftood) that whilft he lived he would never more 
eat any Man's Flefti on any Account: And row I 
began to think it high Time to fet my Servant to 
work, elpecially conlidering I had now two Mouths 
to feed inflead of one. I found him extraordinarily 
quick and handy in every Thing I fet him about, and 
he had the Senfe to make me underftand that I had 
more Labour on my Hands on his Account than I 
bad for myfelf, and that he would fpare no Pains nor 
Diligence in any Thing I fhould command or direft; 
and, indeed, the FeUcw's Honefty and iimple Inte- 
grity grew fo confpicuous, I really began to love him 
intirely ; and, for his Part, I am well afi'ured there 
was no Love loft. I had a Mind to know if he had 
any Inclination to his own Country ; and,having taught 
him as much Englijh as poffible, I afked him fevcral 
Qu'eftions, which he anfwered very pertinently ; par- 
ticularly, I afked concerning the Nature and Diftance 
of his Country, and their iVIanner of fighting, ^r. 
The Fellow had a very good natural Genius, and 
would often anfwer my Quefiions with very quick 
and furprizing Turns ; and, when I fpoke about Re- 
ligion, he heard me with the greateft Reverence and 
Attention, and would often furprile me with inripor- 
tant and unexpeded Queftions ; and, in Truth, I 
fpared no Pains to inftrud him according to the beft 
of my Knowledge. I alked him, who made him 
and all the World ? As loon as he underttcod me, 
he anfwered. Old Benamuckee; but all that he coold 
fay of him was, -that he was very old, much older 
than the Sea and Land, the Moon and Stars, and 
that he lived a creat Way beyond them ail.

When I had enquired into the Manner of ferving 
their God, I proceeded, aceordihg to the beft of my 
Knowledge, to irftruft him in the Principles of the 
Chriftian Religion, and laid before him feversl of 
the chief Truths upon which it was grounded ; lo 
which he gave the greateit Attention, and would 
aik very pertinent QuetHons, by Way of Informa- 
tion : In Ihort, I foon perceived this poor Creature 
every Day .improved by my inftruftions ; and my 
Endeavours to inflrud him were a great Help to 
myfelf, and brought thofe Things fre(h into my 
Memory which the Length of Time had almolt d«^ 
xaced ; fo I had the greateil Reafon to biefs Provi. 
dcnce for fending him to me in this State of So- 
litude. His Company allayed the Thoughts of my 
Miiery, and made my Habitation more comforta- 
ble than it had been ever fince my firfl coming to 
the liland. It brought into my Mind daily Notions 
©f Heaven and heavenly Things, and filled me with 
a iecret Joy that I was brought into this Place, 
which I once thought the mott miferable Part of the 
iJniverfe. 

By this Time Friday began to ipeak tolerable 
Englljh, though a little broken. We converfed with 
great Familiarity ; and I took a particular Pieafure 
to relate to him the feveral Accidents and Adven- 
tures of my Life. I foon made him anderftand 
that wonderful Myftery, as he conceived it, of the 
Gun-powder and Ball, and taught him to fhoot, 
which he foon learnt in the greateil Perfedion. I 
ave him a Knife, which he was very proud of; 
ikewife a Belt, and a Hatchet, which he hung to 
his Girdle, which, with the Reft of his Accoutre- 
ments, made him look like Don i^ixote^ when he 
went to engage the Wind-mills. After this, I gave 
him a particular Dcfc;iption of Europe^ aind :Oid Eng-

alio gave him an Account of my being ihipwrecked, 
and cairied bim and fhewed him the Ruins -of the 
Ship's Boat, wh;ch, though it was almoft rotten and 
fallen to Pieces, yet 1 could perceive he took parti- 
cular Notice of; which mads me afk him the 
Reafon why he pocdered fo much. O Mojier^ (faid 
he,) me fee like Boat ccme to Place at my Nation. It 
prefently came ioto my Mind, that this mull be forae 
European Boat that was forced in there by Strefs of 
Weather, aftet the Lofs of the Ship, which put me 
upon Enquiry, what Sort of a Boat it was, and what 
cajue in it? 

Friday replied, with great Warmth and Ardour, 
^Jiijhr, ive Janje White Mam Jrom droixn : Upon 
which, I afked him if there were any White Mans, 
as he called them, in the Boat ? Tes, yes, (faid he) the 
Boat fully *veryfull, of White MaJis: HjDW many, frida^ ? 
laid I : Whereupon he numbered his Fingers, and 
counted kventeen. Then I alked him, what became 
of them all, and whether they liveid or not. He re- 
plied, Tes^ Mafer^ they all li've, thty be li've ^mong my 
Nation, Upon which it came into my Thoughts, 
that thefe mufi be the Crew that belonged to the Ship 
that was cart away upon my Jlland; who, rather 
than be devoured in the Ocean, had committed them- 
felves to Pjovidence, and were driven on-fhore among 
the wild Indians, The Notion I had of their Cru-

and they were only thofe whofe Misfortune it was 
to be made Prifoners of War. 

Some Time after this, upon a very clear Day, my 
Man and I went up to the Top of a very high Hill, 
on the Eaft Side of the Illand, from whence I had 
once before feen the Continent in /America ; 1 could 
not diredlly tell what was the Matter, for Friday fell 
to jumping and dancing as if he were mad ; I aflced 
him the Reafon of his Joy. OJoy! faid he, Glad! 
7 here fee my Country y there my Nation y there limes White 
Mans allgether. Upon which I could not help think- 
ing, but that, if he could by any Means get Home, 
he would forget all I had done for him, and perhaps 
bring his Countrymen into my Ifland to deftroy me : 
But, to my Shame I fpeak it, my Jealoufy was very 
ill-grounded, for the poor Fellow was ofaquite dif- 
ferent Difpofition,. and, as I found afterwards, would 
have freely loft his Life, rather than have left me, or 
done mc the leaft Inuiry. 

Soon after this, I ^afked him if he had not a De* 
fire to go into his own Country ? Tes, faid he, m 
much O glad to he at my oivn Nation ; me gOy if you go, 
me no ^0, if you ji ay, I gOy Friday y faid 1, 'what Jhalt

that's out of my Power, neither will I venture among 
them : No, you ihail go and leave me alone, as i 
was before I faved your Life. 

Never was any Creature more Thunder-flruck 
than Friday was at thefe Words, efpecially when I 
told him he would be at Liberty to go as icon as the 
Boat was ready to carry him j he put o-n^ of his 
Hatchets into my Hand, faying, Only kill Friday ;

fpoke this, the Tears ran down (o plentifully, that I 
had much ado to refrain from weeping myfelf ; I 
comforced him in the belt Manner I could ; teliing 
him, if he was willing to flay with me, I would never 
part with him as long as I lived. 

In Ihort, the Fellow's Honefty and flncere Beha- 
viour foon convinced me of the Unreafonablenefs of 
my Jealoufy, and he became more dear to me than 
ever. Indeed, I thought that, if ever I could get to 
the Continent, and join thofe white Men Friday had 
mentioned, it might be the Means to further my 
Efcape ; in Order to this Friday and I went into the 
Woods to look out a large Tree to build a Canoe, 
which we efFedled in above fix Weeks, and with 
much Trouble and Pains got her into the Water. X 
was very wf 11 pleafed at the Launching this little Man- 
of- War of mine, which Friday managed with grfat 
Dexterity, and affured me it was in all Points large 
enough to carry us over, and, if I thought proper, 
he was ready to venture with me. 

I liked the fi#Ilow's honell Propofal, but, at the 
fame Time, I thought if 1 could procure a Maft and 
Sail it would be better; which, with the greatefl: 
Difficulty imaginable, in about three Months Time, 
I made a Shift to patch together ; and, after that, I had 
my Man Friday to inftrud in the Art of Navigation, 
which before he knew Nothing of. 

f was now entered in the Twenty-feventh Year of 
my Reign, or rather of my Captivity, and kept the 
Anniverfary of my Landing with greater Solemnity 
than ever, haying received fuch repeated Signals ^

of the divine Favour, in my Deliverance, Preferva- 
tion, and Profperity. 

I now wanted for Nothing, and yet my Mind was 
ftill intent upon my Deliverance; and, in Truth, I 
had a (Irong IniprefTion upon me that.I fliould rot 
be another Year in this Ifland ; but I full continued 
my Hufbandry, and made the neceffary Prepara- 
tions for my future Subftlience. The Rain-Seafon 
carrine on, we were forced to continue for she moft 
jfart within Doors, having fi ft made all necefTary 
Preparations for the Security and Safety of my new 
Boat, till the Montki' of No'vember and December, 
at which Time I fully determined to fail over to 
the Continent. And, no fooner did it begin to draw 
near, but I began to make Preparations for my in- 
tended Expedition, and, in a Fortnight's Time, I 
propofed to open my little Dock, and let out the Boat 
for that Purpofe. 

One Morning, as I was bofy in making Prepara- 
tions for my Voyage, Friday, whom I had fent to 
the Sea-Hde to look for a Turtle, came running in a 
terrible Fright ; fays he, / have had N^ivs : Tender 
are three or four Canoes upon the CoaJ}, and they come to 
iaok for poor Friday, and ivil/ eat you as nvell as me ; 
and therefore ijoe muji refolnje to fght for our Lives. 
Says Friday, trembling, Me iviil fight as luell as I 
can J but 1 am afraid they are too many in Number for 
us ; but 1 njuill obey your Orders, and lofe the lafi Drop of 
my Blood for you . 

"Without farther Difputes, we fell to loading our. 
Arms, and making every Thing re^ady for the On ^ 
fet: When we had double-loaded them, and put 
every Thing in the beft Pofture that could be, I 
took my Profpeftive Glafs, and went up to the 
Top of a Hill, to try what 1 could difcover ; and 
• I foon perceived there were nineteen Savages, and 

three

three Prifoners, which, I concluded, by their Manner 
of a£ling, were to be devoured. 

This difmal and inhuman Spedlacle filled me with 
the utmoft Horror apd Detestation, and the more fo, 
as 1 faw a »vbite l\iian, who, by their Actions and' 
Preparations, I found was to be the next Sa^crifice : 
This made me make all the Speed I could, having 
fully determined to deliver him or perilh in the At- 
tempt; fo I g?LWQ Friday Orders to follow me, and to 
do every Thing he faw me do. 

When we came to a proper DittartCe undifc^vercd, 
I gave the Word to Friday to fir«^ &s 1 did the very 
fame Moment. We took our Aim fo well, that, be- 
tween us, we killed four, and wounded three or four 
more. ' No man can imagine the Confternation and 
Confufion thefe Savages were in upon this nnex- 
peded Accident ; however, not to give them any 
Refpite, we took up fome other Arms, and let fly a 
fecond Time, killed two more, and wounded f&veral 
Others, which added fo to their GOnfufion, that they 
ran yelling and howling about like mad Creatures. 
Friday (faid I) take the charged Mnjkety and fcllonv 
7ne ; fo, fhewing ourfelves to them, and at the f;ime 
Time giving a great Shout, we went diredly to the 
Vidim, ana immediately cut the BiJfitSs from hia 
Hands and Legs, and, lifting him up, I alked him, in 
the Portfigutfe Language, what he was : He told me, 
in Latin, he was a Spaniard and a Chriftian ; and, 
afte: leturning the belt Acknowledgments he could 
for his Deliverance, he was about to give an Ac- 
count of his Misfortunes, but I prevented ,,him, tel- 
ling him, That <v:ould be better at another Time \ and

give the Man his Due, no one could behave himfelf 
with greater Courage. In fhort, we (b managed the 
Matter, that, of twenty -two Savages, not above three 
or four got into one of their Canoes, and thofe I 
refolved to purfue and endeavour to deftroy too, 
ifpoffible; accordingly, I leaped into one of their 
Canoes, and ordered Friday to follow me; but, I was^ 
no fooner got in, than I law another poor Creature 




bound Hand and Foot for the Slaughter. I prefen^ly 
helped him up, but iie was fo faint and weak that 
he could neither ftand nor fpeak, b'lt groaned faoly, 
thinking he was now to be facrificed Tbade Fruky

had looked upoil a' ) more fully, you cannot ima- 
gine the poor , ow*s Tranfport ; at length, 
when he had a^ ..le recovered himfelf, he told 
me it was his Father ; and, in Truth, he gave fuch 
uncommon Teftimonies of his Duty and Affection, 
that I mull needs own I was very much aff'eded with 
it. 

In (hort, with a great Deal of Difficulty, we got 
both my new Guells Home to my Caftle, whence I 
made them a handfome Tent, and treated them in 
the bed Manner my Circumftances would allow. 

And thus, like an abfolnte King, I governed my 
little Dominions; and, finding that my new Sub- 
jedls were very weak, I ordered Friday to kill one 
of my Kids, and ftewed and boiled the Fle(h, and 
made them fo me very good Broth, and dined with 
them myfelf. After Dinner, I ordered Friday to go 
to the Field of Battle, and fetch Home the Arms ; 
and then I bade Friday alk his Father whether he 
thought it poflible for the Savages to out-ride the 
Storm, or, if they got Home, whether he thought 
they would not return in great Numbers, and en- 
deavour to deftroy us. His Anfwer was, That, if 
they did reach their own Country, which he hardly 
thought poflible, yet the Strangenefs of theit* being 
attacked would certainly make them tell the 
People that they were deilroyed by Thunder and 
Lightning, and that whoever went into the Ifland 
would certainly be deflroyed by the Hands of the 
Gods, and not of Men ; and that the Ifland was 
enchanted ; and that the Gods fent Fire from above 
to deftroy all thofe that fliould prefume to land 
in it.

Wolve.8 and Bears were driven out of the Woods, and, 
though there were more than, 20 of us together, they 
fetupon us many Times, and, indeed, it was not with- 
out the greateil Hazard and DifHcuky we prtferved 
ourfelvcb from being devoured, the particular Rela- 
tion of which would be too long to trouble the Rviad- 
er With. 

In our farther Paflage, through France^ we met 
with Nothing uncommon or remarkable ; we get 
fafe to Paris^ and, after a Ihort Stay there, we went 
to Calais^ and landed.at Dc^jer the u^ih of January^ 
in a very coid Seafon. 

When I came to London, I found my Bills of E.y- 
change all arrived., and the Money r^-^dy to be 
paid at Sight, which when I had ieceivcd, it came 
into my Mind to return to Lijbou^ and from thence 
to the BraJiL, to look after my Plan'ation ; bat, upon 
fecond Thoughrs, 1 concluded it beft to fell i", and 
on thii Account 1 th( ught it proper 10 write to my 
Ccrefp'ondent at L'Jhon^ a»id deiire his Advice and 
Afiiltance, who reaoiiy gave me his Promife to do ail 
* he could for me ; and, in* "I ruth, as I afterwards 
found, he acquitted h mfelf to me in every Particu- 
lar wjth the greacell Jullice and Integrity. 

In "fiiOrt, he fold m/ Eftate for me to the bed Ad- 
vantage, and reraitted>o me^ for it Bills for three 
Hundred and twenty I'ieces-of- Eight, a Sum much 
greater than 1 expededi' And r^ow I began to think 
it higii Time to fettle myfelf, Prcvxcence having 
mace fuch a plentiful Provifion for me, that I want- 
ed Nothing to make myfelf as happy a&l^juld

Having caft my Anchor, and for the prefent o'mX 

Adieu to all foreign Adventures, I had no other

to me: and, in (hort, I left my Farm^ left off Houfe- 
keepir.g, and, in a few Monihs after, returned to 
London; but there 1 could find Nothing to entertain 
me and divert ray Melancholy. It was now the Be-

whom J had bred up to the Sea, was returned from 
his Voyage, Captain of the Ship he went out in ;

perceived it was> a great Ship burning in the Midcle 
of the Sea; I immediately ordered five Guns to be 
fired, that the poor people might perceive that there 
was Deliveraoce at Hand, who confequently might 
rifk their Lives in their Boats; nor was it long 
before the Ship blew up. 

We hung out our Lanthorns, and, aboat eight in 
the Morning, when it began to be li^ht, we iaw 
two Boats making towards irs, and we made a Signal 
for them to come on-board, and- took them all up, 
being, Men, Women, and Children, in all fixty-fcur. 
It was a Trench Ship of 300 Tons, bound from 
Canada^ and, by the Negligence of the Steerfman, it 
was fet on Fire in the Steerage ; io that, in all Proba-

Never were People, certaihly, fo overjoyed as thefe 
poor Creatures w^re. Among the Paifcngjers there

to the higheft Degree. After a litle ; tay, we got 
what we coaJd from the Savages, made bold with 
two of their Canoes, and io came all of us over to 
the Ifland ; where we had no iooner lanced, but we 
found the EngUJhmm had quarrelled wich or.e another, 
and had attempted to muider and deftroy their Fel-

And now it was that an Accident happened, that 
not only obliged us to lay afide all private Animcfities, 
but likewife to provide for our mutual Security. 

One Night, as 1 lay in my Bed, I was difturbed 
with UDuiual Fears and ApprehenCons. 1 got tip, 
and related the Matter to one of my Spani/h Friends, 
who anfwercd, Such Hints rjoere not to be Jlighted \ 
and advifed me to look out carefully ; adding, ^hat 
certainly there "joas fome Mifchief upon the Stocks. Ac- 
cordingly, we went up to the Top of the Mountain, 
whera we difcovered a Light, and heard the Voices 
of feveral Men, which terrified us exceedingly. Wc 
could not tell what to conjedure, and therefore 
fent out old Friday as a Spy, to try if he could learn 
xvho, and from whence, they were j he returned in a 
very fhort Time, and brought us Word, That they 
*were t^wo different Parties, of different Nations ; and 
thaty after a bloody Battle, they had landed there, by 
mere Chance, in Order to denjour their' Pri/oners ; and 
that he believed^ as fotrn as it njoas light, a bloody Bat- 
tle 'A)ould enfue. Old Friday had hardly ended his 
Relation, but an unufualNoifc gave us to underftand 
that the Engagemert was begun; and Nothing could 
be more bloody and obftinate, nor Men of more in- 
vincible Spirits, nor more adlive and ready in their 
Way of Fighting, ' 

We were undoubtedly. Sir, in a great Confterna- 
tion, left they fhould run into our Grove, and de- 
flroy what we had, and fo refolved to put ourfelvcs 
upon our Defence, and fhoot the firft that fliould ap- 
proach ; and, as we apprehended, io it happened ; 
for three of the Army that was vanquilhed came 
diredly to the Place for Shelcer: But thefe I would 
not I'ufFer to be ilain, bur had them furpriztd and

wards. The two Parties being gone oiF, and the 
Coaft clear, we went to the Place of Battle, where 
we found two-and-lhirty dead upon the Spot, with 
feveral Bows and Arrows, and other Sorts of Wea- 
pons, which r ordered t^ be carefully picked up and 
carried into our Armouiy. ^ 




This difmal Spedacle had thatEfFid upon the three 
troubkfome Englijhmen, that much of their turbu- 
lent Temper began to abate, and they began to be 
good Friends, and to think unanimoully what was 
beft to be dene for our mutual Security and Prefer- 
yai-ion. And, accordingly, ail Hands were at Work 
to ftrengthen the Fortifications of our Caftle, and 
provide a proper Security for all our Provifions ; and, 
indeed, we did both with all the Cautioa that the 

Nature 



94 LIFE and Adventures cf 

Nature of our Circumftanceij would allow. Atii. 
thus fot two Years we fived in a very comfortable 
Retiriement, having neither feen or heard any Thing 
of the Savages for all that Time. 

Bat now there happened another Quarrel, whkh 
ihight have proved of very bad Confequence, if it 
hai not been prevented ift Time. The three wicked 
Englijhmen being the Aggreilors, T ordered them to 
bedifErmed, «nd left the Cafe to be determined by 
the other two Enghjhmen, who fcntenced them to be 
hanged, alledging, among other Things, that they 
had a De£gn to murder us, and O'-^y deferred i^ ti 1 
a proper Opportunity ; upon v' ich I alked Aikins^. 
who was the Ringleader, wh -^ had done to them 
to ^Icfcrve to be murdered, i he had to fay for 

himfelf, why we fhould noi. . lediately kill him, 
who had formed fuch a villair ^^ Deftji^n to murder 
us? In Truth, the EngLJhmin ^t6i veiy hard to 
hang one of them for an ) -j'.e to the Others; 
but this I would by no Me fent to, upon the 

Confideraiion that I owed iny l^ae to an Englijb- 
man^ fo you. Sir, my only Preferver j however, to 
put it out of their Power to do us any farther Mif- 
chiei^, we determined, that, for tlie Future, rhey 
ihoold have no Arms of any Sort ; and that, if they 
did again attempt to give the Society any Manner of 
Diilufbance, then we would immediately Ihoot 
them like wild Beafts. After this I ordered them 
f»me Frovifion for their prefent Subfiftence, and ap*- 
pointed them a Place in a remote Part of the Iflaild^ 
where they might plant, and make what Improve; 
mer.ts Lhey thought proper. 

They had lived fix Months in this fcparate Station", 
and had got in tbeit firft H jrvcft; which, that Seafon^

a new, and, what was worfc, were but very indif- 
ferent Workmen at the beft. Thefe Fellows, grow- 
ing defperate and weary of working, took a new 
Whim into their Heads, which might have been of 
fatal Confequence. Nothing would ferve them, 
but they muft needs make a v oyage to the Conti- 
nent, to try if they could feize fome of thofe Sava- 
ges, and make them Slaves to do their Drudgery; 
and, indeed, the Projed was not fo prepofterous, if 
they had not been aftuaced by wicked Notions and 
D'lgns. 

One Morning they came to their Limits, defiring 
to fpeak with us ; which being granted, they told us 
they \yere tired of that State of Life, and, if we 
would give them one of our Canoes, th^y would go 
and feek their Fortunes abroad, and never trouble 
us more. You may be fare, Sir, we were not a lit- 
tle glad to be freed from fuch troublefome Com- 
panions ; however, we reprefented the Danger of 
it ; but, finding Nothing would change their Reiblti- 
tion, we confented they fhould have one of our 
Canoes, and at the fame Time gav€ ^hem foroe 
FirC'Arms, Ammunition, and Provilion ; and, as 
foon as they had fitted out their Boat, they merrily 
failed away, the 'Spaniards at the fame Time calling 
after them and wiftiingthema good Voyage. And, 
in Truth, Nothing could be farther from our 
Thoughts, than the PofSbility of feeing them any- 
more; yet, fcarcely a \fanth had pafled, but one of

aftd then our Wonder ceafed. Our next Enquiry was 
into the Nature and Manner of their Voyage, and 
the Reafon of their lo fpeedy Return ; of all which 
one of them gave the following Relation : 

After two Days Sail, we reached Land ; but, finding 
the Inhabitants Savages, and coming with their Bows 
and Arrows to give us an unwelcome Reception, we 
thought it proper to make the btft of our Way, fleer- 
ing N&rthivard, In our Paffage we difcovered feve- 
ral little Iflands which feemed to be inhabited ; at , c 
of which we refolved to go on-ftiore at all Hazards ; 
which accordingly we did, at one that lay moll to the 
Weji i here we found the Natives very courteous 
to us, giving us what they could procure. Among 
thefe hofpitable Indians we (laid feveral Days, enqui- 
ring by Signs what Nations lay near them, and were 
informed that there were feveral favage Nations that 
lay nigh to them, that were accuftomed to eat Man- 
kind, but, for their Parts, ihey were not accuftomed 
to eat fuch Sort of Diet, except fuch as they" took in 
^aLtle. Wejenquired how Jong it was fince they had 
had a Battle, and whether they had any Prifoners ; to 
which they made /^nfwer, by their Signs, that it was 
about two Months, and their King had now "two 
hundred Prifoners, which he referxed for the Slaugh - 
ter. Mighty defirous we were to fee thofe Prifoners ; 
which ihey miftook, and thought we wanted fome for 
our own Ufe, and made Signs, that, at the next Rifing 
of the Sun, we Ihould have fome j and, accordingly, at 
the very TimQ they brought us eleven Men and five 
Women, juft as Cows and Oxen are brought 
to a Sea-port Town ; a Sight that gave us all a great 
Deal of Horror, and what to do we could not tell ; 
to refufe them, we knew would be an unpardonable 

Affront, 



Robinson Crusoe. * ^ 

Affront, and to difpofe bf them v/e knew i:i6t'lio\v>' 
However, we refolved to accept of them, and gave 
them in R>-*turn a few Fiihes that we had in the Ca- 
noe ; fo, taking our Leave, we failed to the next 
Ifland, where we fet eightof the Men at Liberty ; 
with the Rett we made the beft of our Way to our 
Ifland ; and, though we treated them all as well as 
we could, we could by no Means convince them> 
but that they were to be killed and devoured. 

Thus, Sir, ended the Narrative of thefe three 
Defperadoes; whereupon lafked him where their new 
Family was, chufmg to fee them ; they told me, they 
were,at their Huts ; fo we all Went to fee them. 

Wrien we came to the Hut, we found three well- 
proportioned Men, and five Women> ill naked and 
bound, four of them might be from twenty-four to 
forty, but the other was a comely Maiden of about 
feventeen ; they were all very agreeable, and their 
Behaviour feemed to be very modeft. Their naked 
Appearance, with the Mifery of their Condition, was 
no very agreeable Sight. I ordered Fridays Father 
to go try if he could learn any Thing from them, 
and, if he could make them iin^erflanf]imr,~to at- 
fure them that they ihould not be facrificed ; but they 
not being of his Nation, he could only make one of 
the Women underftand, and that was partly by 
Signs ; when they were told by the woman, iheir 
Interpreter, that they were not to be killed, no^one 
can exprefs their ftrange Geftures, by which they ex- 
preffed their Joy, and, when they were afked whe- 
ther they were willing to be Servants, they made 
joyful Signs to exprels their Readinefs. 

But now, Sir, having Women among us, which I 

thought might fomeTime occafion Quarrels, I afked 

the three En^lijhmen, how they propofed to difpofe of 

their Families ; adding, that I was not going to lay

concluded -to draw Lots "for the Choice, which, be- 
yond Expeilation, they did with Regularity andEx- 
adnefs. The only Thing that is to be obierved, is, 
that the poor Women (till old Friday convinced them 
to the contrary) were under terrible Apprehenfions 
that, as the Englijh took them away as their Lo:s di-' 
reeled, they were immediately to be murdered. , ^ 
But thefe Frights and Terrors being removed, the 
^Englijhy with their new Wives, went to work, and 
in a very, Ihort Time had finilhed feverar^Huts 
proper for their living. 

And now, Sir, I lay before you aScene quite diiFe- 
rentfrom any Thing that has been related. OneMor- 
riing, very early, there came five Canoes of //2-^/«/7jon- 
fhore, on their old Account of devouring their Pri- 
foners ; all that we could do was to lie concealed till 
their bloody Ceremony was over, and to take proper 
.\ iVleafures to defend ourfelves in Cafe of Need. But, 
'^oiwithuaft^ttfg^l ctirCatitions, there happened an 
unhappy Difafter, that had like tohaveoccafionedthe 
utter Defolation of the Ifland ; for, after the Savajges 
were gone ofi^, my Spaniards and 1 looking out to 
makf Obfervations, we found three Savages that had 
gorged themfelves lying faft afleep upon the Ground. 
What to do with them we could not tell ; to murder 
them we thought would not be juftifiable according 
to the Law of Chriftianity , having no previous Quar- . 
rel with them ; at laft we thought it adv»feable to 
fecure them alive, and fetthem about Ibme Work or 
other, till we could difpofe of them ; and accord- 
ingly we took them Prifoners, and carried them firft 
to1)ur Caftle, and then to the vtioEngUJhi whofoon,

a ftrid Guard over them, one of them got away 'uuf*

to them, without charging their Guns, which was a 
very wrong Step ; for, when they were come up, they 
found four of them alive, two (lightly wounded, and 
one not at all Upon which they were forced to take 
the But-end of their Mufkets, and knock them on the 
Head, and took him that was not wounded and bound 
him, and laid him at the Foot of a Tree hard by, and 
then made all the Hafle they could towards the Cave 
to fee if all was well there ; and, finding every Thing 
fafe, they came back to the Tree where they left the 
ln.-iu7i boui.d, and found, to their great SurprizCi 
he was gone. Now they w.re in greater Fear atid 
Confufion than before ; bu% while they were con-

came up to them, bringing with ihcm that very ///- 
i/iart the Englijhmen had left bound under the Tree, 
whom the Bpaniardi had releufed in their Way. 

This great Reinforcement fo much encouraged the 
two inji^lijhmeny and fo great was their Indignation 
for the Lofs of their Huts, that they could Hay no 
longer; but, taking the Spaniards ^'nh them, ali well 
arrticd, away they went in Pu fuic of the Reft of the 
Savages ; but, from a rifing Ground, they perceived 
thst they were got on-board their Canoes, and were 
gone out to Sea, too far to be come at, which gave 
them new Matter for Fear and ApprehenliQn,'left 
they fliouid go Home dire£lly, and inform their Bre- 
thren of all that had happened, and incite them ta 
come over vyith a greater Power, and deftroy the 
whole Ifiand. And, as we judged, fo it happened ; 
for, in Jefs than feven Months, they carr.e over with 
twenty- five Canoes, and landed upon us with two 
Hundred and fifty Me n^ all well armed with- Bows 
and Arrows and other formidable Weapons. 

You may imagine^ Sir, we were vr no fmall.Con- 
fternation, upon the Approach of thefe unwelcome 
Guells ; nor were we wanting to make the bed i^ re- 
paration we could to defend ourfelves ; we armed 
our faithful Slaves in the beft Manner we could, nor 
would our Womeu be perfuaded from fighdng along 
with OS, as vhey relblved to conquer or 'die v/ith

In ifiort, we were forced to interpofe with our

As foon as poffible I drew up my little i^f my- up on 
a riling Ground, where, by the Light of the Moon, 
we could obferve the Savages in a great Deal of Dif- 
order; upon which, we concluded it would be beft to 
fall upon them now, and, if poffible, to give them a 
Volley undifcovered J which we did, by the Guidance 
of the two Engl:pme7iy who knew the G round :per- 
fedly ; after this we gave them three Volleys more, 
and then rulhed in upon them with our Swords with 
fuch irrcfiilible Fury, that they gave Way, and, 
making a difmal Screaming and Howling, they be- 
took t.f emfelves to their Heels. Many of them were 
killed in the r light; but indeed we were fo exceed- 
ingly tiied with fighting thefe two Battles', that we 
did not then purfue them to their Canoes, in which 
we concluded that they would immediately get to 
Sea; but, ihere happening a dreadful Storm, they 
were prevented in that, and many of their Canoes 
were loft into the Bargain. 

After we had taken fome RefieOiment, and a little 
Repofe, we refolved, as foon as it was light, to go 
to the Place of Battle in Order to make wl.atObfer- 
vations we could ; and, coming at length to a full 
View of the Remainder of their Army, we found 
them lying in a miferable PoUurfc ; and, when wc 
came within Muflcet-Shot, 1 ordered two Gniis to be 
fired, in Order to t y if they had any Notion of co-

Point; however, after mature Confid^ration, itwa« 
determined to deftroy their Canoes ; which when the 
Indians faw, they made the mpft hideous Out-cries j 
but to no Purpofe, for we either burnt or difabled 
them all, after which they ran about a long Time, 
and, as they had no Arms, nor Materials to make 
any, fo, notwithflanding their Numbers, we were 
the lefs apprehenfive of being furprized by them. 

Jndeed our Stock of Provifions was fo very fmall, 
that we came to a Refolution to drive them up in^o 
forae remote Corner of the Ifland, and to kill as 
xnany of them as we could catch, in order to leir«:n 
iheir Number, and then give them fome Corn to 
plant, Purfuant to this Refolution, we purfued them 
with our Guns, killing every Day one or more, tiU 
^ length their Number was fo reduced, that we 
concluded, if poffible, to take one of them alive, 
which at laft, with fome Difficulty, we effefted ; and, 
afing him kindly, we brought hin\ to old Friday^ 
who told him if they woqld fubmit and do what 
they, were commanded, they fhould be ufed well^ 
otherwife they fliould be all flain, and bid Jiim go 
and aiTure his Companions fo, who were in a mpf^ 
miferable (tarving Condition. 

The poor Creatures, who were now reduced to 
thirty-feven, received this Offer with all the Joy 
imaginable, fo wefent the^n fome Food, which they 
^te.with great Thankfulnefs, and made all the Pro- 
jDifes w< could defire; and, to give them their Du,e, 
they have never broke any of them to this Day.

T/he End of the Spaniard 'j Relation, 

A Continuation of the Life of Robjnfm 
Cf'ufoe. 

TH E R E is no Doubt to be made but that the 
Spaniard gave me a faithful Account, which 
was exceedingly agreeable to me, and no lefs fur- 
prizing to the ycung Priell, and to all the Rell that 
heard it ; Nor were thefe People lef'e pleafed with the 
Necefibries I brought them, which were a great Help 
to them in perfecting their Habitation. Wil, Atkivs 
was grown a very fober Man, and had built his Hut 
with great ingenuity ; Nothing indeed, confidering 
the Circumftance and Nature of the Place, could be 
finiilied with greater Curioiity, kept more neat, or 
have better Convenience; for the Habitations of the 
Englijhmcn were by much the moft commodious in 
the Ifland. As to Religion, they had little araotig 
them, and the Men only taught their Wives to fpeak 
Englijh\ they were all fruitful enough, and bore each 
a Child once a Year, fome of which were now iix 
Years old, and very fi:rong and healthy. 

When I enauired of the Spaniard concerning their 
Manner of living among the Savages, they gave me 
a very deplorable Relation of it, adding, that they 
had hardly »ny Hope* of Support or Deliverance,

Many were the Methods they took to inilrudV the 
Savages, but to no Purpofe ; for they, ignorant as 
they v/ere, would give no Ear to the inllrudions of 
thofe to whom they owed their Lives. At the Return 
of their Friend, who they thought had been devoured, 
their Joy was great, efpecially when they faw the 
Loaves of Bread which 1 fent them ; but, when they 
heard the Errand, and perceived the Boat, their 
Tranfports were inexpreflible. This was the Account 
.1 had from them, and now it follows 1 (hould in- 
form thePveadcr in what Conditional left them. 

As it was generally agreed that they (hould have 
no moreDillurbance from the Savages, fo I told them 
X had made this Voyage chiefly for their Sakes, and 
tfeat 1 was not come to remove them, but rather to 
i:|iat)liih and fix them upon the Ifland; and, for that 
End, I had brought them all Sorts of Necelfaries and 
Artificers, with other Perfons, that would not only 
add to their Number, and confequently to their De- 
fence, but would likewife be a mutual Help and 
Support to them.. They were all together when I 
talked to them in this Pvlanner. I a(ked ihem, one 
by one, if they had intirely forgot their former Ani- 
fliofities, and would engage in the ftridcd Friend - 
ihip ? to ^\).\Q\iAthins replied, they had had Afflidtioias 
enough to make them all fober, and Enemies enough 
to make them all Friends; adding, that he had mofl 
juiUy. deferved the Treatment he had received from 
the Spaniardsy and jhat he was only to be blamed. 
Upon which the Spaniards replied, that ^nce JViU. 
Jikins had, upon all Oecafions, behaved. himJelf io 
valiantly in their Defence, all that was pall Ihould 
be forgotten, that he (hould have his Arms, and 
be made the next Commander to the Governor. 

Upon th^fekind Declarations of mutual Love and 
Triendihip, we concluded to dine together en the

and, after that, 1 diftributed to every one of the.-ft 
his Portion of the NeceiTaries I had brought over, 
and then divided the Ifland into three didindl Colo* 
nies, making my old Habitation the Metropolis^ 
which the Spaniards inhabited. 

The young Man, whofe Mother was ftarve4 to 
Death, as before- mentioned, and the Maid, vvho'was 
indeed a pious virtuous young Woman, feeing the 
good Difpofuion of Affairs, dro.iped their Reroluticti 
of going to the Eaji-Indiesy and both defired I would 
pemit them to ftay on the 1 (land, and enter them 
among my Subjefls, which I readily agreed to; and 
the young Woman was afterwards married, as will 
appear by the Sequel of the Story. '; '^''- '■ "' 

And now I come in Courfe to fpeak of the young 
French Prieft, whofe pious Behaviour, and excellent 
Difcouifes were extremely agreeable, and deferve 
a particular Obfervation. Said he to me one Day, 
iince, under God, I owe you my Life, I fhall take 
Care to employ it to do as much Good, and yoii as 
much Honour, as I can ; and this I conceive may 
beft be done in my' Attempt to fave as' many oi" 
thefe poor Peoples Souls as I can ; but at the fame 
Time 1 fhall take Care not to advance any Points 
in Religion but what you (hall approve of, 

I was mightily pleafed with the Modefty of hi« 
Expreffionr, and told him he fhould not want my 
Affiftance to further his good Intentions. To which 
he replied, he (hould always have a grateful Regard 
to my Favours, and would make it his principal 
Concern to behave himfelf in all Points as became 
a peaceable Man and a good Chriftian. - '

but herein he quickly undsceived me^ telling me, His 
Meaning -was nol that I JhouU feparate them, but rather 
link the?nfajier together^ by marrying them. The Piety 
and Sincerity of the Man gave me a great Deal of 
Satisfaction, infomuch that I piomifed him I would 
inftantly go and difcourfe with them, and ufe my 
beil Endeavour with them, that every Thing might 
be done according to his Defire. 

When we came to the Englijhmen, I firft put them 
in Mind that 1 had done every Thing for them that 
was needful, in Order to their future Prefervation in 
this Life ; and now my only Concern was the Pre- 
fervation of their Souls eternally. I aiked them con- 
cerning theif Manner of living with the Savage- Wo- 
men ; adding how fc:indalous it was to live in fuch an 
open and continued Courfe of Fornication. To which 
Atki.is replied, that he believed the favage Women 
they lived with to be the moft innocent Women in the 
World, and that they would never forfakethem ; and, 
to confirm me they were fincere, he told me, J f there 
was a Clergyman in the Ship, they would be married 
to them with all their Hearts ; I told them there 
was a Clergyman in the Ship, and advifed them to 
go and coniult the Women, and 1 would take Care 
to have the Ceremonies performed To-morrow Morn- 
ing in due Form'; which they all agreed to, and fo it 
was accordingly done to their mutual Satisfadlion. 

In (hort, the Men inftrudled their "Wives as well as 
they could in the Nature of the Thing they were go- 
ing about, and laid them down, as far as their Capaci- 
ties would allow, fome general Heads of the Chriftian 
Religion ; efpecially Atkins, who, though he had been 
by much the moft corrupt and viciousj yet his Edu- 
cation had been far better than any of the Reft. After

good Ccnfequences that could be expected. 

The Affairs of the Wand being thus fettled, I W5S

it IS between the Englifliman yo-u call Jack-of-all-

I was agreeably furprized at the mentioning this 
Match, which was very fuitable, the Fellow being, a 
very adlive indullrious Man, and the Woman a dif- 
creet, neat, cleanly, Houl'ewife ; fo the Match was 
concluded, and they were married the fame Day, 

As to the Iharing out the, Land, I left it to IVilJ. 
Atkina^ who, indeed, difcharged the Truit with great 
Fidelity. As to their Laws and Government, i ad- 
vifed them earneftly to love one another, and to make 
v^/hat farther By-Laws they fhoiild think proper, for 
their general Good and Benefit. 

At our Return we called aiJtkinsh Houfe, where 
we found the new-married Women in a clofe Con- 
ference v/hh Athns's Wife, who had been baptized : 
Said j4t/iins,,* When God has Sinners to reconcile to 
himfelf, he is never without an Inlhu^^or j for this 
young Woman, whom Providence has fent among us, 
has Senfe and Religion enough to convert a whole 
Nation of Savages.* The young. Woman blufhed, 
and was going to rife, but 1 bade her fit ftill; telling 
her, I hoped God would blefs her good Endeavours- 
and lo, taking out of my Pocket a Bible, I gave it to 
Atkiniy which he received with Marks of Gratitude 
and Satisfadion. After feveial religious Difcourfes, 
I defired the young Woman to give me an Account 
of the Anguiih fhe felt, when fhe was llarving to

give them a Broad-fide; which he did fo efFedually, 
that thirteen or fourteen of their Canoes were over-

where, though the People are fierce and treacher- 
ous, yet for fome Time they treated us well, and 
gave us Commodities. I made it my chief Bufinefs 
to go on-fliore as often as I could to make Obfer- 
vations ; and indeed the People traded with us with 
fo much feeming Civility, that fome of the Men 
lefolved one Night to ilay on-fhore in a Tent, which 
they had made for that Purpofe j for my Part, I, 
with fome of the Reil-, thought it more fafe to lie 
in the Boat. 

About two o'clock in the Morning, we were 
alarmed with the firing of Guns, and our Men's cry- 
ing for Help, or they fhould be murdered. 

The Occafion of this Fray, as we afterwards un- 
derftood from them that efcaped, was this. An 
old Woman, that fold Milk, brought with her a 
young Woman that fold Herbs, whom when the 
Sailors faw, they laid hold on her, and carried her 
in amccg the Trees ; upon which the old one made 
fuch a prodigious Out-cry, that both Men and 
Women came to their Affiltance. At the Beginning, 
the Fellow that began the Fray, was killed with a 
Lance, though at hrft we did not know what was 
b-^come of him. 

A, Night or two after we refolved to go on-(hore, 
and try if we could find out the Man that was mif- 
fing. An Hour beibre Midnight we landed at the 
Place were the A£iion began ; but, it was fo dark, 
we could difqovefl^^cthing, till the Boatfwain fell 
iJ^y.er'-one of the dekd Bodies. We concluded to Hay 

there

there till Morning, when we difcovered two-ahd- 
thirty. dead Bodies lying on thje^ Ground, whereof 
two were not qaite.dead. Having made this Dif- 
covery, I thought 1 had feen enough, and fo was 
preparing' to return ont- board. But the BoatTwain 
and the Rell,. which were about'twenty, refolved to 
go to the IndVan To^n, to try if they could find 
what was become t)f Tew Jeffreyi,.l\it\i Companion. 
I oppofed this Rtfolution, as too dangerous to be 
undertaken; but all I coold fay'fignified Nothing, 
they refolved to go^^let the, Confequence be what it 
would. It was not without Difficulty that they 
found the Town, which confilled of about two 
Hundred Houfes, where the People being all in a 
profound Sleep, the Sailors concluded to divide 
themfelves into three Bodies, and to fee the Town 
on Fire in three Places at once, to kill all that 
{hould attempt to efcape, and to plunder the 
Reft. 

Having made this Refolution, to work they went; 
they had not gone far, before the firft Company 
found their Companion Tow J^J^^J^^y ilripped ilark- 
naked, with his Throat cut from Ear to Ear, hang- 
ing by one Arm upon a I'ree. In a Houie, adjoining 
to this Tree, they found ftUeen or fixteen Indians, 

They immediately fct Fire to the Houfe, and at 
the fame time to feveral Others in the Town ; fo 
that, in a very little Time, the whole Place was all 
in Flames ; and no fooner did the affrighted Crea- 
tures run out to fave themfelves from the Fury of 
the Flames, but the Sailors either drove them back 
ag^in into the Fire, or killed them without Mercy. 
All this while they never fired a Gun, left the Noife 
of that fhould awake the People too iaft for them 
to deitroy.

By this* Time the Town was all in Flames, and the 
Light of the Conflagration made me very uneafy, siid 
likev/ife furprized the Captain and theMen thatwciC 
with him on-board, who knew Nothing of the Matte.-. 

But, when he faw the Smoak, and heard the Guns

thirteen Men refolved to go to ;he Afliftance of 
them let the Confequence be what U woyld ; and, 
indeed, though I was fenfible of the Danger we 
raw, yet I had no Power to lUy behind.

the People not to be uttere(^. I got into the Center^ 
in Order to put a Stop to their fartfier Barbarity, and 
b dered fome of the Men to follow me ; but I had 
hardly fpoke the Word, before the Boatfwain-, with 
four© the Men after him, came up to us, all coVered 
^ iviih Blood and Duft. When they faw us, and knew 
* who we were, they gave a great Halloo, in Token 
that more Help was come Noble Captain^ faid he, 
thefe Hell-hound: haife barbaroujly murdered Tom ^&{^ 
freys, and in Re^verige nve njoill kill them all. 

When mv Nephew faw his Man hanging by the 
Arm, with his Throat cut from Ear to Ear, he grew/ 
exttemely enraged, and declared that not a Man in 
the 1(1 jnd ought to be fpared : Upon which, away 
ran the Boatfwain, with eight more, to finiih the 
Tragedy; which being out of my Power to prevettt, 
i got to the Boat, with only the Supercargoes and 
io went on-board, fending back the Pinnace, to 
affill the Menj if any Thing fhould happen. When, 
i got to the Boat, the Fire was aimoll extinguiihed 
and the Out-cries abated ; but I had been but a lit- 
tle Time on -board, befoie 1 heard another Volley 
given by the Sailors, as a Signal of Vidtory, which 
was occafioned by their falling upon and deflroying 
the Houfes and Perfons that lay between them and 
the Sea, and fo they came ftroUing down to the Pin- 
nace, which lay ready to receive them. Not a Man 
had received any particular Hurt, the poor Indians 
being unprepared, amazed, and confounded. 

I was extremely angry with them for theirCruelty^ 
but particularly with the Captain, who, inftead of 
perfuading them to Reafon, rather prompted them 
to farther Mifchief ; nor could he fay any TJ^ing to 
excufehimfelf ; but that he was a Man fubje<f'. to Paf- 
Con, and that he could not bear the Sight of one of his 
Men fo b'arbaroufly murdered. As for the Reft, they 

only 



II 8 LI F E ^z«i Ad ventures (?/ 

onlyboafted of their Revenge, and, according to all 
their Accounts, they deflroyed one Hundred and Mty 
Men, Women, and Children, and burnt the whole 
Town to Afnes into the Bargain ; and, however our 
Men might value themfelves upon this bold Exploit, 
yet J always looked upon it with Deteilation, and 
gave it the Title of 9 ^^ M^r;v o/' Madagafcar. 

When we were under Sail, the Boatfwain would 
be often magnifying and defending the bloody Ac- 
tion, which I as often difpraifed and condemned ; 
bidding them depend upon ic, God would never blefs 
their Voyage after luch unparallelled Barbarity. And, 
as I foretold, foit happened ; for, when we came up- 
on the Per/tan Shore, we loft five of our Men, who, 
venturing too far on the Shore, were either killed, or 
taken and made Slaves by the Arabians. Upon this 
Misfortune I again reprehended them, advifing them 
to repent. Upon this the Boatfwain faid, You are al- 
ways difturbing us; and, as you are but aPaffenger, 
we are not obliged to bear it; and therefore if you do 
not forbear for the Future I fliall leave the Ship, nnd 
not fail with fuch dangerous and ungrateful Company. 

All this I heard very patiently, being fenfible, as 
Cafes then ftood, I had no Remedy ; and, indeed, I 
thought all had been over and forgotten : But fo it 
happened, we were now in the Road of Bengal, 
where, going one Day on-fhore with the Super- 
cargoe, one of the Men came, and told me, * I 
need not trouble myfelf to come on-board any more, 
for that he had Orders from the Boatfwain, and the 
Reft of the Officers, not to bring me on-board any 
more.' ..... 

This infolent Meffage much furprized me; how- 
ever, I #ade the Fellow no Anfwer, but went to the 
Supercargoe, and defired him to go on-board imme- 
diately, and" acquaint the Captain, that he might pre- 
vent 



Robinson Crusoe. h^ ^ 

vent the Mutiny which I had Reafon to apprehend : 
But, before this could be done, theMatter was efFe<5l- 
ed ; for I was hardly gone out of the Boat, but the 
Boafwain, Gunner, Carpenter, with all the inferior 
Officers, rap to the Quarter-Deck, defiring to fpeak 
with the Captain ; and then the Boatf^vain began to 
rail againft me exceedingly, telling him, That if I had 
not gone on-pyore myfelfy thsy bad rejoiced to ha<ve compelled 
me to it. And farth^, he had the Infolence to add, 
* That if I had not quitted the Ship, though they had 
had all the Refpeft imaginable for their Captain, and 
would ferve him with their Lives ; yet they would 
all have left the Ship immediately.' Upon which the 
Reft cried out, Om and Ally one and AIL 

Though my Nephew was a Man that wanted neither 
Courage nor Refolution, yet this unexpefted Beha- 
viour fhocked him exceedingly; he expoftulated with 
them, telling them the Danger and the Injuftice of 
fuch a Proceeding, but all would not do; they had 
fully refolved, that, if 1 came on-board, t'.ey would 
all leave the Ship ; upon which, faid he, * \{ this 
be your Refolution, I will go and acquaint him 
with it.' And fo he came up to me, and told me all 
that had paiTed. I am very glad to fee you. Nephew, 
faid I, and am glad it is no worfe ; for in Truth I 
expedled they would have rebelled againft you ; I 
only dcfire you to fend my neceflary Things on- 
fhore, and I will find my Way to England as well as 
I can. Though this vexed my Nephew to the Kearr, 
yet, finding there was no Remedy, he took his 
Leave of me and went on-board, and fent me my 
Neceflaries; and fo this Matter was over in a very 
few Hours. And now I think 1 was at leaft a Thou- 
fand Leagues farther diftant from England, than I 
was at ra) little Kingdom. My Nephew left me 
two Servants to attend me, who engaged to be with

me till my Return i I took Lodgings in the Houic! 
of an Englifly Woman, where were feveral Merchants; 
and indeed I liked the Company and Entertainment 
fo well, that I condnued here fevieral Months, coo- 
iidering what Courfe I had beft take. I had fome 
valuable Englijh Goods, a Thoufartd Pieces-of-Eight, 
and a Letter of Credit for more if I fliould have 
Occafion. The Goods 1 foon dtfpofed of to Ad- 
vantage, and bought here feveral good Diamonds^ 
which I could eafily carry about with rtie. 

One Morning, a Merchant, with whom 1 was very 
intimate, came to me, and faid, Countryman I havd 
a Propofal to make to you^ which 1 dd hot queftioR 
will be to both our Advantages. To be fhort, Sir* 
v/e are both in a remote Part of the World, and far 
removed from our native Country, and yet wie are 
in a Place where Men, that underftand Bulinefsj 
may get Money. Now if you will put a Thoufand 
Founds to my Thoufand Pounds, we will buy a good 
Ship, you Ihall be the Captain and I the Merchant, 
and we will go upon a trading Voyage. 

This Propofal foon gained upon me, fuitingexaftly 
with my rambling Inclination; but it required fomii 
Time before we could get a Veffel to our Mind, or 
Sailors fit to man her out. In a little Time we pro- 
cured both, and fo we failed away for Chintt^ and had 
a very profpcrous Voyage^ having not only gained a 
large Sura of Money, but withal ^ot a good Infighl 
into the Traffic of thofe Countries. 

Our next Voyage was to the Spicfe-Iflands, which 
proved likewife very fuccefsful ; and, not long after, 
the Merchant and I made up Our Accounts to our 
mutual Satisfaction. We found ourfelves very rich ; 
arid now our only Concern was how to difpofe of our 
Money. Whilft we were confidering what was beft 
to be done, it happened that d^ Dutch Ship of about 

%oo 



Robinson Crusob. 121 

200 Tons came into Port. The Men pretended they 
were (o ill, that there were not Hands fufficient to ma- 
nage ihe V^efi'.I, and the Captain being defirous to 
go to Europe^ public Notice was given that the Ship 
was to be fold ; which no fooner came to our Ears, 
but we bought her and would h^vc entertained fome 
of her Men, but they were not to be found, for, as 
foon as they had received thtir Dividend, they all 
went privately to the Moguls Country ; as in Truth 
they had Reafon enough ; for this praended Captain 
was only the Gunner, (the real Captain and three 
of his Men being killed by the Malagam^) who ran 
away with the bhip to the Bay of Bengal^ leaving 
the Mate and five Men more on-{hore, of which yow 
will hear more in the Sequel of the Story. 

After we had bought the Ship, and fitted her with 
all Neceffaries for her Voyage, with fome Difficulty 
and Expence we picked up fome Sailors of different 
Countries, and manned her tolerably well, refolving 
upon another Voyage to the Spice-Jflands. In this 
Manner we traded backward and forward for five or 
iix Years, with very good Succefs, and were now in 
the feventh Year going to China j but in this Voyage 
we went with contrary Winds, which beat us up and 
down ; and no fooner were we got clear of tbefe 
rugged Seas, but we found our Ship had fprung a 
Leak, which obliged us to put into the River Cam- 
bodia^ which goes to Siam. 

One Day as I was on-fhore, refreihing myfelf^ 
there came to me an EngUjhman, that was Mate to an 
Ea/i'Indiaman, that rodc in the fame River : Sir, faid 
be, you may very well wonder at my Bufinefs, who 
am a perfed Stranger to you ; but, notwithdanding 
that, I have Something to impart to you, that con- 
cerns you very nearly, and it is the imminent Danger 
yon are in that has brought me to you* Danger! 
f faid 



1X2 LIFE and Adventures of 

laid r, r know of no Danger, unlefs that our Ship it 
a little leaky, and that I intend fhall be redlified a* 
i'oon as pofiible. J believe, faid he, you v/ill find 
other Em I'lcyment. The Town of Cambodia is a- 
bout lo Leagues higher, and 3 Leagues on this Side 
lie 3 Dutch and 2 Englijh Ships, and will you ven- 
ture up farther into the River, without confidering 
whether ycu have Force enough to fight them ^11 ? 

I knew not what he meant by this Difcourfe, and, 
turning fhort upon him, Sir, faid I, I know no Rea- 
ion I have to be afraid either of the Dutch or Englijh ; 
1 am no Interloper, and what Bufinefs then can they 
have with me ? Well, fays the Man, if my Advice ii 
of no Weight with you, you may take your own 
Way; however, i am very forry you Ihould be fo 
much an Enemy toyourfelf: I will be plain with you, 
unlefs you put to Sea immediately, you will be at- 
tacked by fiver Long-Boats full of armed Men, and 
yourfelf hanged for a Pirate, if you are taken ; and. 
Sir, 1 thought fuch a Piece of Intelligence deferved bet- 
ter Treatment. Sir, faid I, you fhall not find me un- 
grateful; let me beg ycu therefore to explain your- 
felf, End I will pat to Sea immediately. Why then, 
in fhort, the Matter is this: You know s^ry urell 
that your Captain, with three of his Men, were kil- 
led by the Malaganst and that you, or foroe Others 
that were on-board, ran away with the Ship, and 
are turned Pirates. Now, Sir, this is the Subfiance 
of what I have to fay, and I can only farther aflure 
you, that, if they can lay their Hands on you, the/ 
will execute y«u without Ceremony. 

Sir, faid I, though no Man came more honeflly by 
the Ship than I did, yet, as you reprefent the Mat> 
ter, I think I ought to be upon my Guard, and I 
heartily thank ycu for your Information. Come, faid 
he, it is no Matter for Ceremonies; if you value 

your 



Robinson Crusoe. 123 

your own Life and the Lives of your Men, get but to 
Sea as faft as you can. I am very well fatisfied, fiid 
I, in your Sincerity and the Service you have done 
me, pray therefore tell me what Recompence I fhall 
make you? Only take me with you, (aid he, and, if 
you find what I have told you to be true, I refer 
royfelf for a Recompence to your Generofiy. 

So reafonable did this appear in every Particular, 
that we went immediately on- board together, where 
we were no fooner entered, but my Partner welcom- 
ed me with the joyful News, that they had flopped 
the Leak. I am glad of that, faid I ; bui come, let 
us make all the Hade we can to weigh Anchor ; but» 
whilfl we were bufy in that, a Sailor called 10 the 
Captain, and told him, there were Sloops coming 
after us ; upon which the Captain, taking his Profped- 
ive-Glafs, and looking out, faw £ve Sloops, full of ^ 
irmed Men, in full Chace after us; upon which he 
immediately fcnt one of the Sailors to give us Notice. 
Very well, faid I, I am fully convinced there is 
Something in it ; and fo I went upon the Deck, arid 
told the Men, That we were in Danger ol having 
the Ship ffized, and being executed as Pirates ; ^ad 
aiked them, if they would faithfully itand by u$, and 
by one another.' To which they unanimoufly re- 
plied, They would iland by us, and fight for u; to 
the laft Drop of their Blood. Then I a&ed the 
Captain, which Way he thought was beft to defend 
ourfelves; who replied, he believed it was the fafeil 
to keep them off with our great Gum ; and accord- 
ingly the Gunner was ordered to load the Guns wi(h 
Small-fhot, and to bring them to bear before and 
aft; and thus, the Deck being cleared, we were in 
all Points prepared for an Engagement. 

We flood out to Sea, but fiill the Boats followed 

us y^ry clofe. Wc could perceive the two foremoil

^ were Engli/h, which were a-head cf the Dutch by 
two Leagues ; hereupon we fired a Gun, and hung 
out a Flag of Truce, in Order for a Parley ; but, find- 
ing they bore down upon us with all the Si^il they 
could, weiiredupon them with Ball, and then bade 
them keep olF ac their Peril. But all this fignified 
Nothing ; for, depending upon their Number?, t^^ey 
were abfolutely beni upon Mifchief, We madeftve- 
ral Shots at them as they came forward, killed feve- 
ral of their Men, ard funk one of their Boats, and, 
manring oat our Pinnace, we faved three of their 
Men from diowning, who were broughc on-board. 
After a very hot .'^tlion, we got out fo far to Sea 
that they could not purfue us without Danger ; and 
fo, changing our Courfe to the Eaflward, we got 
quite out of the Courfe oi European Ships. 

When we were got out to Sea, enquiring more 
particularly into the Meaning of all this, the Dutch* 
men let us into the whole Secret, telling us, that the 
Felicw, w« bought the Ship.of, was an errant Thief^ 
and that he ran away with the Ship; that the Cap- 
Cftia was treacheroufly murdered, and that he and 
four more were forced to the Woods for Safety ; and 
that, at length, by Means of a Dutch YeSii in its 
Way to Chinay that came in accidentally to take in 
fcefh Water, they were preferved. He farther told 
us. That they were informed that the Fellow fold 
the Ship at 5^;7^a/, and (he was turned Pirate and 
had taken feveral Prizes. 

After mature Corfideration, we concladed it beft 
for us to return to Bengal^ where, being known, we 
might beft'prove how we came by the Ship, and 
where we were fure to meet with iome Juftice, and 
not be hangtd firfl: and judged afterwards : Bat, upon 
fecond and more deliberate Thoughts, we all agreed

aard, and cHerefore we determined ta change our 
Cou:(e. and Tail towards the CoaH of China, and 
there difpoie of the Ship, ar>d then get another, and 
make the btll of our Way to Europe This being ge- 
nerally^ agreed to, we fteered away //. iV. E. but, meet- 
ing with contra-ry Winds, which blew hard againft 
us, our Voyage grew very troublefome and tedious, 
and our Provifion? were almoft exhaufled ; and, what 
was ftill woffe, v/e wereapprehenfive, that the Ships, 
whofe Boats we had handled fo rudely, might be in 
the Road before us, which in Confequence muft be 
fatil to us. Upon thefe melancholy Confi-ierations 
we again refolved to change our Courfe, and try if 
pofiibly we could not make feme Harbour belonging 
to the Portugueje. With this Refolution we fee for- 
ward for the Bay oiTonquin, in Order to fail from 
therce to Macon, a Town once pofTened by the Portu^ 
gue/e, and where there are lUl! many European Families. 
We came in Sight of this Place early next Morn- 
ing ; but, confKlering our former Circumltances, we 
put into a imall River, till we had enquired what 
Ships were in the Road, and how Matters ftood ; and 
indeed this prudent Step was the Occafion of our 
happy Dtliverancei for next Morning there came ia 
two Dutch Ships, and a third without any Colours j 
and in the Evening two Enghjh ones. 

The River where we lay was but fmall, and the 
Country wild and barbarous, and the Inhabitants all 
Robbers, having no Correfpcndence with any other 
Nation; and, a.iiong other barbarous Cultonis, they 
have this particularly ; When any Ship is driven on 
their Conll, they imniedlately feize lier, and make 
ill her Men Slaves ; io that here w« round oorfelves

this was doing, the Inhabitants, who, 1 believe, had 
never feen a Ship upon the Careen befce, and lot 
perceiving our Men, who were at Wok, pre- 
lently imagined that the Ship had been caft away, 
and lay upon the Ground ; and accordingly they fur- 
Tounded us with five or fix large Boats full of armed 
Men, with a Refolution to plunder the Ship, and 
cany the Men away Slaves to their King ; but, when 
they faw cur Men at Work upon the Ouifide of the 
Ship, they looked upon us with the greateft Confu- 
sion imaginable ; neither could we imagine what 
their Deiign was : However, to prevent the word, 
we handed down fome Arms, and indeed it was well 
we did, for, in lefs than a Quarter of an Hour, ihey 
came icouring upon us with all their Force. 

Indeed, we lay bat in an ill PoUuie to receive 
them, and, befoie the Men could come on-board, 
they had feized one of the Sailors ; but the Fellow 
foon difengaged hirofelf, and killed the Pagan that 
lirft laid hold on him j however, this was little lo the 
Purpofe, confidering their Numbers, and, I really be- 
lieve, if it had not been for a lucky Accident, we 
had been all loft. The Thing was this ; the Car- . 
penter, who was flopping the Hole in the Ship, had 
two Kettles, the one full of boiling Pitch, and 
the other with Rofin and Tallow, ts'c. And, as two 
or three Infidels were entering the Boat, the Car- 
penter's Mate faluted thehi with a Ladle-full of boi'- 
ing Liquor, which had t'uch an EiFed, that, being half 
naked, it made them roar and leap into the Sea, 
which the Carpenter perceiving, he took his Mop, / 
and, dipping it into the Pitch-kettle, fo fprinkled it / 
among them, that they all ran frighted away, crying 
and howling in a mofl terrible Manner. 

I mufl own I was extremely pleafed at the O^' 

Defs of this Adventure ; however, we loft no l/^^

to put the Ship in a Pofiure of Defence, and, as foon 
as we could, we put to Sea again, having refolved .*o 
put into the firll: trading Port we came near. Af:er 
fomc Days Sail, we came within Sight of 8hore, and, 
ftanding in, a Boat came off 10 us, with an old For. 
tuguefe Pilot on-board, who offered us his Servici: ; 
we very gladly accepted it, and fent the Boat back 
again: In fhorr, the old Man went with us, and, as 
we failed along, I afked hijn, if there were no Pi^ 
rate« in thofe Seas. He told me, he had only heard 
of one, that was feen in the ]^<s.y of ^fam, about 
9 Month a^o, nor was Ihe built for a Runner neither, 
but only a Ship that the Men had run away with, 
the Captain having been murdered by ihe Malagans-, 
and, I can tell you this, if fome Dutthnen^ thatcaiiie 
pretty near them the other Day in the River Camhp^ 
diUy had laid their Hands upon them, they would 
have hanged every one of the Rogues upon the Yard- 
Arm, without any farther Ceremony. 

Being fenfible that this old Pilot could do us no 
Harm, [ told him how the Cafe flood wiih us, and 
defired him to cany us to Naaqum^ where neither 
Engitjh nor D%tch Ships canie. Said the o!d Tr^Jan, 
You have taken the right Courfe to ileer to the 
North ; and, if 1 mipht advife, I would have you fell 
the Ship at China: i5uc» faid i, in doing char, 1 may 
betray innocent People. No, replied he^ I know the 
Dutch Commanders, and will take Care they fnaJlbe 
tightly informed of the whole Matter. Whiill thefe 
Things were under Debate, we.vfailed diredtly for 
Nanquin, and, in about 13 Days Time, we came to 
an Anchor in the Entrance into the Gulph, where w^ 
were in for jned that two large /^z/^c/:? «>hips were go -.e

toW OS there wasa little Harbour about 40 Leagues to 
iJie Southward, and, if we could get thither, no 
Dutch or Englifif Ships ever came thither, and there 
we might be fafe. This Advice was generally ap- 
proved, and thither, by the honeft Pilot's Diredion, 
we arrived^n Safety, afcer five Days failing ; -we went 
diriftly into the Port, and landed to oar unfpeakable 
Joy and Satis fa<f\icn. 

Being new fafe on-fliore, our Pilot- foon got us a 
Lodging and a Warehoufe for our Goods, and then 
brought US acquainted with three Miffio«ary-Pneft«i 
ihat were there converting the People toChriftianity. 
After we had fettled a Sort of a Cortefpondence with 
ihem, our next Concern was to difpofe oi our Goods, 
which we did fomeTime after, to our full SatisfadiOD, 
to an eminent Merchant of Japan. We were i©oo 
Leagues farther from Home than wc were at Ben^ 
gal, and, having difpofed of our Ship, all the Hopes 
we had, were, thar. at the next Fair, wc might per- 
h;;ps purchafe another Veflisl that would cany os and 
our Goods where we pleafed. Upon thefe Hopes 
we refolved to continue here ; and, to divert our- 
ielve?, we cock feveral little Jcurreys into the Coun- 
iry, and (pent ten Days to fee the City of Nanguin, 
w^hich was leguiarly built, and tolerably well forli- 
iieo : Az car Keturn, we found one of the Priefts go- 
ing to Pfquin, who folicired us with great Earneftnefs 
to uear hun Cunipany thither, which we both agreed 
to do. We were 25 Days in our Journey through that 
iniJerable Courtry, and had an Oppoitunity in out 
Fafi'age to fee two or ih:cc of the Clfine/e Efquires, 
with their Manner of travelling there, which was' 
the nioit lidicuious Sight I ever faw, and rattier me- 
rited our Scorn and Contempt than Admiration. 

At length we arrived at the great City of Pequin^ 
where we had fcarcely been a Week, before the old

preparing to go by Land to Mufco'vyy and thnt if we 
"plbafed we might take the Opportunity. This was 
very good News for us ; and fo we went to work as 
fall as we could to difpofe of what Goods we had at 
the Port, and to buy fiich Others as we thought 
would turn to the moft Advantage. We fet out of 
Pe'piin, in Company with about five hundred of fe-

two D^ys we pafTed through a Gate in the great 
\Vall, faid to be one Thoufrnd EngMJh Miles in

forty of thefe ftarving Wreiches in a Body ; who no 
iboner perceived us, but one of them blew a Horn, 
«t thd Sound of which forty or fifty more came up 
immediately. Hereupon, one of tiie Scoub Mer- 
chants ordered us to advance, and attack thenci with- 
out Delay: They let fly a few random Arrows at 
us, that fell Oiort, and did us no Manner of Harm ; 
and, when we came near enough to lire upon them 
with our Piilols, they ran away with the greatellCon- 
fufion. So our Battle with thefe thievifh Tartars 
ended without any Blood-fhed on our Side. We ftjil 
travelled atleall a Month more through theEmperpr 
, of China's Country, till at Tength we came to the Ci- 
ty of Naum, which is a llrong Frontier of the Chinefe 
Empire, being often diilurbed in our Paflage by 
Uraggling Tartars. We ilayed at Naum but one Day, 
and then continued our Journey, paihng feveral Dc- 
iarts and great Rivers ; and, on the j 3th of Aprilf we 
came to the Frontier ofMu/co'vy; and^ as wepaffed, 
we found the Garrifon was filled with Chriftian Sol- 
diers, for the Benefit of Travellers and Commerce; 
but the common People were all Pagans, the moil 
miferable Wretches I ever beheld. Whilft we Hop- 
ped to refrefh at one of thefe Towns, I had an Op- 
portunity to obferve them at the Worfhip of one of 
their Idols, which was the moft ugly Reprefentation 
that ever 1 beheld in my Life^ I cannot defcribe ic 
to you without Horror : However, we found Means 
to dellroy it before weleft the Place, for which we 
had like to have paid very dear ; for the next Day 
they came to the Governor to demand Satisfadion for 
jihe licfs of i-eir Idol, and, if we had not deceived 
them, and got oir by a Stratagem, we had been all 
dellroyed.

ROBINSON CRUSOE'S 
VISION 

O F T H E 

ANGELIC WORLD. 

VOL. III. 



1. OOLITUDE is a noble Refiner of the MihS, and fills it with 
^ the brighteft L eas of Heaven and heavenly Things. Men, 
in a religious Solitude, may be truly faid to enjoy themfelvex, and 
are never alone when they are alone. They are delivered from the 
Snares and Temptations of the VVcrld j and, when they converfe 
with themfeives, are certain they do not converfe with an Ene- 
my. 

By Solitude I do not mean that Men /hould utterly renounce all 
Converfation, and retire into Cells and Monafteries ; this I look 
upon to be an unneceflary, and perhaps a finful, Reftraint : But 
that Solitude, which I am now recommending, is a Retirement of 
the Soul and Miad, in Order to a nearer and more refined Con- 
verfation with Heaven. In iuch a religious Solitbde the truelt 
Peace and Tranquillity aie to be found and eftabli/hed, even that 
eternal Peace of God, which paffes al! Underftonding, and is the 
only fure Foundation of Content upon Earth and of everlattmg 
Happinefs in Heaven. 

II. Herejiy, in the ftrifteft Senfe of it, fech as is prized by 
good Men and pretended to by all, is another large Step towards 
the angelic World. Honefty is beft feen in its own native Simpli- 
city, and wants no fine Speeches, or theEmbellifhmer.t of Words, 
to fet it off. Honefty, in general, is, doing to Others as we 
would they fliould do unto us j it is keeping a Confcience void of 
Oifence towards God and towards Man. An honefl Man does 
not only all the Afts »f Jufticc which the Law obliges him to, 
but likewtfe all the frendly, kind, and gen-.-ous, Afts, that fall 
in his Power; he has always Solomtns Maxim uppermoft in his 
Thoughts, ^tat agood Namt i$ bttur than Lifcj and is a f redout

Ointminff ivhicb wbett a Man bat ottee loji^ be ba: Nothing ivottb^ 
keeping, 
^Jiil, The next Step to the ange'ic World is the patient fufFcring 
• of Afftclion, which fliould always be looked upon as a Rod, in 
the Hands of God, to chaftife us for our Sins, Many Times in» 
jured Innocence may be abufec', but we often find, in the End, 
that the more it is deprcfisd Jie higher it rifes, while the Juftice 
of God fecrctJy purfucs the OpprefTor, and then feldom leave* 
him till it overtakes him to his Deftrutlion. The whole Sub« 
fiance of fuffering under unjuft Perfecution, and bearing up under 
it with Chriftian Fortitude and Refignation, is very well exprcfled. 
In the following Verfes, by a Gentleman that was undtr the Mls* 
f^rtune of an unjuft Perfecution.

They miftike very miich, who think that an honeft moral Life 
deftroys the Cojnpofure of the Mind, and renders it unfit for So- 
ciety ; it rather tnfpires us with innocent Mirth, which a wicktd 
Man is utterly incapable of pnjoying. 

I.ei tke angelic World^ ct Happimfs, 
Be lohat it iv'-U, ''tis heji defer ib''d by Peace: 
No Starmican bnrt'w:thout, or Storms ivhbinf 
No Fear, no Danger^ there, becaufe no Sin. 
^lis ail a bright tjjential Happinefs, 
Becauje be dive! Is therein luhpfc Name is Peace, 
They are much in the 'vv'rong who think Rpiigion or ftri£l Mo- 
rality d'fcorr;pofrs the Mind, and renders it unfit for Society 5 for 
it is rather that which infpires us indeed with innocent Mirth, 
without that counterfeit Jov that vicious Men appear with ; and, 
indeed, Wit is as confiftent w«th Religion as Religion is with 
Gocd-M.inners j nor is there any Thing in the Limitation of Vir- 
tue and Religion that fliould abate the Pleafure of it, but, on the 
contrary, incrcafe it. 

But, on the other Hdtid, manv Men, bv their own Vices and 
Intemperance, difqn^lify themfelves for Cbnverfaticn^ heing of 
cynical, niorcfe, fu-]y, and rude, Tempers, though they boall 
thclnfekes orherwife.' For fome, abounding too much in Pride, 
think they are above Others, and, in ihis Cafe, Self-conceit is 
the Bane, of human Society : For how fhall any Man receive any 
Advantage from the Converfation of Others, who believes himfclf 
qualified not (o !e -m :^j;y Thing from them ? This confirms a Man 
to be a FfcC)', for it !; isipoflible he fhould be fo, if he were but 
once convinced of his Folly. 

• If FgAs tculd th.ir own Ignorance difcern, 
■■ ^bcv^d be v'j longer Fools, becaufe they'd learn. 
Satyr ha: a' great Deal to remark on the Converfation lof fach j 
asL their vain Repetitionr, Catch- word"!, Laughings, and Gef- 
.tures J particularly of the French, Spanijh, and Scotch, Fools. 
Converfation is immoral where the Difcourfe is indecent, immo- 
deft, fcandalous, llanderous, and abuf.ve : And this is too much 
pra£tifcd by Beaus, Fops, Atheifts, and conceited Perfons, who, 
inftead of appearing Wits and Gentlemen by it, prove themfelves 
theReverfe in each Particular. What Wifdom is there in Men's 
giving themfelves the Liberty to t?.lk Blafphemy, in Defiance of 
Heaven, the Majefty of which I'-y art glad to own with their 
lateft Breath? Or, rather, how greas r3 vheir Folfy, and hov7 
much is it expofed, by aftronting their beft Friend, even Gcd him- 
fejf, before Men, whofe Notions are unceruin, i»nd yet wh« 
are found trembling whtnthe Fear cbpieth ? 

As 



Robinson Crusoe. 137 

As to Tfforming tbefe Errors, we knovf how much the Laws 
^ave provi ed againft them j but let me for cnct prevail with a 
Man to examine his Vire, difleiSl its Parrs, and view its Anato- 
my, how difagrceable muft it be to him as a Man, a Gentlemao, 
and a Chriftiaitj how dcfpicable in its higheft Fiuition 5 how de- 
ftrudive to his Senfes, Eftate, and Reputation ; ar;d h. w bealily 
in its pub'ic Appearance ^ Uich a Man would certainly be ou: of 
Love with Vice, and the Reformalicn would be Halt Lroaght to 
pafs. 

Now, as to atheiftical Difcourfe, how •mpty, and yethow pre- 
vailing, is fuch miferahle Sophiftry upon weak Judgements ! and 
this is evident in the following Lines upon the Syftc:m of Promt-' 

The great Promethean y^rtij}, Poeft fay, 

Firfi made the Modei of a Man in Clay ; 

Contri'v d the Form o'ih' Parts, and, ivhen heiaddont, 

Stole vital Feat from the prolific Sun : 

But not a Poet tela us, to this Day, 

IVho made Prometheus firft, and ivbo the Clay\ 

Who gave the great Prolific to the Sun, 

And tvktre the JVcrk produBive ivas begun. 
There are fome, according to the Philofophy of Epicurus, who 
-fancy ihe World was made by a ftrange fortuitous Conjunftion of 
Atoms, without any pre-exiftent Influence or immediate Power, 

7hus fome have dreamt of Atoms flrangely burV d 

Into the decent Order of the World, 

And fo by Chance ccmbin'd ; from 'whence began 

The Earth, the Heav''n, the Sea, and Beafij and Man, 
But, let them fay what they will of the divine Power, it k 
certain their fecrst Thoughts redeft upon them in the veiy Aft, 
and give the Lie to their Arguments, as in the following Lin«». 

Nature pays Homage ivith a trembling Bonu, 

And confcious Men but faintly difalloiv\ 

The furit Irepxdation -acks the Soul, 

Ami, luhile he f.iys, No God, repjies, Thoo Fool ! 
The great Scandal fuch Difcourfe gives to Virtue, ought, me^ 
thinks, to be puniihed by the Judges : Make a Man once ceafe to 
bilicve in God, and f.e has N&thmg left to limit his Soul but 
mere f'hilof( phy. Ar.d how incongruous is this to Government, 
that a Man ihoujd be puniiTien for Drunkennefs cr Swearing, and 
jet have the L'bcrty to afl'ront, and even to deny, the Maielly of 
Heaven ! If a Man gives the Lie to a Gentleman in Company, 
or perl)<^ps fpeaks a Word virhout any ofr'enfivc Meanini;, he flies 
■into a PalTion, quarrels, fights, and pnh^j^ inu*>krs him, or af^

terwards profecutes htm at Law with the utmoft Violence and Op- 
prcflion : But, furely, it is a very vulgar Error, incur Behaviour, 
not to /hew our Relentmcnt when we hear the Honour and Ef- 
fence of God flighted and denied, his MajefVy abufed, and Reli- 
gion bantered and ridiculed in common Difcourfe. Etudes, it is 
an Affront upon ourfelves ; for, either the Ptrfon thinks we are 
Atheifb, -like himfelf, or ventures to impofe us, accounting us 
either as Fools, that know not when we aie put upon, cr Cow- 
ards, that dare nor refent it ; and therefore fuch Difcourfe ought, 
for Good-Manners Sake, to be avoided, which carries in it fo ma- 
ay deftruftive Confequences both to our Souls and Bodies. 

The next Thing to be refrained from is obfcene Difcourfe, which 
is the Language only of Proficients in Debauchery, who never 
repent but in a Jail or an Hofpital, and whofe Catcafes ftink 
as bad a: their Difcourfe; until tht Body becomes too nafty for 
the Soul to fiay any longer in it. For, if Cuilom has made thefe 
Things uncommon, or rias concealed, or at kail baniOied, them 
from the Voice of Convfrfaticn, it is certainly a Sin agair.ft Cuf- 
tom to expofe them again. No Man can juftify his lewd Dif- 
courfe, but he," at the lame Time, throws away his Cloth j for, 
to cover feimfelf with his Hands, and uncover himfeii with his 
Tongue, are Contradi£lions in their own Nature, and one con- 
demns the other. And why is net the Ear as liable to be offend- 
ed as the Eye, fince both are but the common Organs of the Un- 
derlVandirg ? 

Nor is Falfe-Tallcing lefs to be avoided: For Lying -rs the 
Sheep's Gloathing hung upon the Wolf's Back ; it is the Pha- 
rifee's Prayer, the Whore's Blufh, the Hypocrite's Paint, the 
Murderer's Smile, the Thief's Cloak ; it is Joab's Embraces 
and Judas's Kifs ; In a Wo:d, it is Mankind's Darling, and 
the Devil's diftingui/hing Chara£ler. Some add Lies to Lies, till 
they not not only become imp>-. bable but even impolfible too. 
Others lie for Gain, to deceive, delude, and betray; and a 
third So!t lie for Sport, or Fur., as the Boys call it, which be- 
trays fuch an Emptinefs in it, at, not only to merit the Contempt 
of ai! Perlons, but alfo to make that Pcrfon be difbelieved even 
when he fpcaks the Truth. And then, iudfeed, they can lie no 
longer ; for he, that Nobody believes, can never lie any more, 
becdufe Nobody can be ceceived by him. There are other Liars, 
who are perf'nal and malicious, who foment Difterences, »nd 
carry Tales trom one Houfe to another, in Order to gratify their 
own envious Tempers, without anv Regard or Reverence for 
Truth, (a Thing of no Value or Eiie^m to them in their Dif- 
courfe,) till, at iaft, they are like the Jack-Pudding or the 

Stage-player,

iromortai Souls, come at laft penitently to own that they have 
played the Fool, 

IV. Religion. I doubt, indeed, that there is n-iuch more 
Devotion th^n Religion in the World, more Adoration than Sap- 
plication, and more Hypocrily than Sincerity : And it Is very 
irelancholy to conHdtr, what Numbers of People tnere are fut- 
ni/hed with the Power of Reafon and Gifts of Nature, v;ho are 
neverthclefs abandoned to the grofTcii Ignorance and Depravity ! 
But it would be uncharitable for us to imagine that they will cer- 
tainly be in a State of Damnation after this Life j for how can 
we think it confi{?ent with t!ie Goodnefs of an infinite Being to 
damn thofe Creatures, when he has not furniihed them with the 
Light of his Gofpei ? Or how can fuch proud, conceited, and 
cruel, Perfons prefcribe Rules to the Juftice and Mercy of God 1 

The Moors of Barbaf-y are Mahometans, whofe Religion is 
confined to the Birarn and Ramazan, the Feaft and Faft, the 
Mofque and the Bath; reading the Alcoran, on one Hand, and 
performing the Wafhing and Purification, on th-j other, makeup 
their religious Exercife. Among thefe appear no generous Tem- 
per, no Compaf^ion, to be found. 

When 1 was among the Natives of Jfrica, I perceived many 
of them without the lealt Notion of a Deity. At the Brajils, the 
Natives had Abundance of Religion, but w<re bloody and ctueJ j 
being guilty of Murder, human Sacrifices, Witchcrafts, and con- 
juring. The Eaji-lndtar.i are generally Pagans or Mahometan?, 
having fuch a Compound of favage Cuftoms with them as render 
them notorious for Fraud and Theft ; end, though the Sub- 
jefts of the Great- Mogul and the Inhabitants of Ceylcn live un>- 
der fevcre Difcipline, yet it is a very hard Thing to find 'them 
^onciL As to the CZj/wf/e Religion, it is a Foundation, or what 
ve may call an Element, of light Morality and Superftition, 
hu>-'dled together in a Rhapfody of Words without Ccnfiftency j 
and, indeed, with very iittle Rcfoning in it: Their Idols are 
made according to their Priclls Inventions. The Per/tans worfhip 
the Sun i the Tartarian form themfelves Idols of Eeafts ; the 
foimcr i think, of the two, is the bcft, becaufe it aftitt^s all 
Things round it.

p?r to be confecrated, ipfo faBo turned into an Oratory, and tb« 
devout People flocked to it to expiate, by their Prayers, the Dif- 
honour done to the Lord God, by ckrowing his precious Body into 
fo vile a Place. 

As to the Religion in Pc/artd, they deny Chrift to be the 
Meniah, or that the Mcfliah was come in the Flefli ; and, as to 
their Proteftants, they are the Followers of Leiius Socinus, who 
denied our Saviour's Divinity, and have no Concern about the di- 
vine Infpiration of the Holy-Choft. 

In Ma/ts-zy? their Churches are built of Wood, and^indeed they 
have wooden Priefls, though of t'le Greek Church. They pray 
as much to St. Nicbolasy as the Papifts do to the Virgin Marj, 
for ProteiSbion In all their Afflidlions. 

As to the Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in b*-. 
lieving Confubftantiation iiiflead of Tranfubftantia- ion ; but, like 
them, they are much more pleafed with the external Gallantry 
and Pemp of Religion than with the real and true Pra£lice of it. 
None can be more jealous of rtieir Hier.irchythan the Ecclefiaftics 
of this Church, who are afraid to reform farther, left, as they- 
give a Stab to the Perquifites' and Vails of God Almighty's Ser- 
vice in the Roman Church, modern Reformation might give the 
like to them ; and therefore they fet a Pale about the Church, 
perfecuting and invading like the Reft. But what Charity can 
there be where there is no Peace ? And what is Religion when; 
there is no Charity ? 

In France I found a World of Priefts ; the Streets were every v. 
where crouded with them, and the Churches were full of Women j 
but certainly never was Nation fo full of blind Guides, ■ fo ignorant 
of Religion and fo void of Morals were thofe to whom they con- 
i fefs their Sins. And as for the Huguenots, fome ran- away fur 
their Religion, and yet left it behind theaa ; while thofe behind 
are mere Hypocrites, neithei Paplfts nor Huguenots, for they go 
te Mafs with Papifts there j and, while they call themfelves Pro- 
teftants, bow down to the Houfe of Rlmmon. 

Now it feems fl^range, that, while all Men own the divine Be- 
ing, there /hould be to many different Sentiments of paying him 
Obedience in the Chriftian Church j 1 know not what Reafon to. 
aflign for this, except it be in their diflerent Caoacities and Fa- 
culties : Let three Men read the fame doftrinal Article j fuppofc 
it to be of the Trinity, or any other j why, •ne thinks certain- 
ly he has found out the Myftery, goes on with his Enquiries, «"'^ 
brings every Scripture and PafTage that he thinks correfpond '*'™ 
his fiift Notion : Another comes to the fame Scripturr, ^^^ '^

quite different from the former, or at leaft very remote from-them : 
The third Man reads over the fame Text, perhaps with Indiffe- 
rence to the Subflance, and, whether he attains to a right or 
a wrong Information, he comes away with as much Uncertainty 
as he went. Now thefe three Perfon? are enough to fill the WotM 
with Difputes about Religion. The firft two, equally p-jfitive in 
their different Opinions, fall out and part; condemn, cenfurf, re- 
vile, and (if they have an Opportunity) perfecute, one another 
with their Adherents; while the third Man laughs at them all 
for being a Parcel of Fools, in falling out about fuch Things a» 
neither of t!»-jm can be certain of. 

And, indeed, on this Account, we have perceived, in all Chrif- 
tian Countries, what mortal Feuds have been about Religion, 
what Wars and Bloodflied have molefted Europe^ till the general 
CefTation of the German Troubles at the Treaty of IVifipbalia. : 
And, fince thofe Times, what Perfscution, in the fame Coun- 
try, between the Se£ls of Lutherans and Calvinifts! And, /hould 
I take a Profpeft of Hom.e, what unhappy Divifions are there 
between Chriftians, in this Kingdom, about Epifcopacy and Prcf- 
kytery, the Church ^f'EngUfid Men and the Diflentcrs ; and 
where they withftand one another, like St. Paul and St. Peter, 
even to the Face j which is as much as to fay, they carry on the 
Difpute to the utmoft Extremity. 

It might be a Queftion, why there are fuch Differences in reli- 
ligious Points, and why thefe Breaches are fo hot and irrcconcile- 
•ble ! All the Anfwer lean give to this is, that we enquire more 
concerning the Truth of Religion than any other Nation in the 
World, and the anxious Concern we have about it makes us more 
jealous of every other Opinion and tenacious of our own : And 
this is not becaufe we ve more furious, cenforious, and rafli, 
than other People ; but the Truth is, we are more concerned 
about them ; and, fenfible that the Scripture is the great Rule of 
Faith, the Standard of Life and Dcilrine, we have Recourfe to 
ourfelves, without fubmitting to any pretended infallible Judge 
upon Earth. 

There is another Queftioti pertinent to the former : What Re- 
medy can we apply to this Malady ? And to this I muft negatively 
anfwer. Not to have us be lefs religious, that we might diffet Icfi 
about it, but to be more humble and more charitable ; and this ii 
ftriking to the very Root of all religious Differences ; for, cer- 
tainly, were they to be carried on with a peaceable Spirit, will- 
ing to be informed, our Variety of Opinions would not have the 
Name of Difference, nor Hiould we feparate a Communion and 
Charity, though «e difagreed in foitie Articles of Religion,

Nor is this a kjs ufeful Queftion to ftate j namely, Where will 
nr unhappy religious Differences end ? Tr> which, I hope, I may 
nUvcr, in Heaven : There all un-chriftian and un-brother]y 
differences will find a Period : There we fhall embrace many a 
(inner, that here we think it a Diflionour to converfe with j and 

i perceive many a Heart, we have broken here with Cenfures, Re- 
proaches, and Rcvilings, made whole again by the Halm of the 
amc Redeemer's Blood. Here we fhall perceive there have been 
ither Flocks than thofe of our Fold ; and that thofe, we have cx- 
icommunicatcd, have been taken into that fuperior Communion j 
and, in a Word, that thofe contradi£ling Notions and Principle?, 
which we thought inconfilient with true Religion, we (hall then 
find reconcileable in themfclves to one another and to the Foun- 
tain of Truth. If any Manalkme, Why our Differences can- 
not be ended on Earth ? I anfwer. Were we all thoroughly con- 
vinced that in Heaven they would be reconciled, we fhould put an 
End to them before J but this is impoffible to be done j for, as 
Man's certain Convictions of Truth are not equal to one another, 
or to the Weight or Signification of fuch Veracity, fo neither can 
a general Effeft of this Affair beexpe£!ed on this Side of Time, 
Before I conclude the Subjeft, I fhall beg Leave to difcourfe a 
iiltJc of trte wonderful Excellence of negative Religion and ne- 
gative Virtue, The latter fets out, like the Pharifees, with, Gcd^ 
I tbank tbet '. It is a Piece of religious Pageantry, the Hypocrite's 
Hope J and, in a Word, it is pofitive Vice j for it is either/ 
Maik to deceive Others, or a Mift to deceive ourfelves. A .'.'lan^ 
that is cloathed with Negatives, thus argues : I am i^ot fuch a 
E)runkard as my Landlord, fuch a Thief as my Tenant, fuch a 
Swearer as my Neighbour j neither am 1 a Cheat, an Atheiil, a 
irakifh Fellow, or a Highwayman : Noj I live a fober, regular, 
f^'e'ired, Life j I am a good Man, I go to Church ; Gody I tbank 
U bee I Now, though a Man boafts of his Virtue in Contradict- 
/ ion to the Vice mentioned, yet no one can be in a more dange- 
I roue State than this Man ; for he is (o full of himfelf, fo per- 
' fuaded that he is good and religious eaougti already, that he has 
no Thoughts of any Thing, except it be to pull off his Hat now 
and then to God Almighty, and thank him that he has no Occa- 
fion for him ; and he has the Vanity to think that his Neighbour* 
uft imagine well of him too. 

For my Part, I think that the general Slander of a prejudiced 

ge and a State of univerfal Calumny is to be prefeuxd, vkhere 

Mind is free from the Guilt that any villainoully charge ; for 

ha Man, though the World fpits upon and contemns him and 

atcas his D^llru^ion, looks forwud vith Coaifcrt, 



r44 LIFE atjd Adventures^ ^c. 

I know, at the great and J3il Day, when the. Secrets of all 
Hearts fhall be difclofed, that we /hall then be thoroughly en- 
lightened, and plainly fee how much we have bren deceived ia 
the Notions of Virtue and Vice, Religion ?nd Irreligion, in the 
Chara£lers of our Neighbours. And I really believe that we fhall 
fe« many of our Neighbours, placed at the Right-hand of a right- 
eous Judge, whom we have bafely opp-effed with Shndcrs, and 
whom, in this Life, we have cenfurioully placed at our Lef band. 
And this ought to be the Support of a good Man, as the royal 
Pfalmift fays, when his Enemies have him in Derifion. Scandal 
indeed is much worfe than Slander j for the firft is founded upon 
real Guilt, the other attacks Innocence. Nothing is a Scandal 
I b.ut what is true,«and Nothing a Slander but what is fatfe ; and 
' therefore he, tHat fortifies himfelf aRainft Reproach, muft do it 

with a certain Re^rve of real and folid Virtue. 
\ We live in a State of univerfal Calumny, and how is it poflible 

' that we fhould have any Profpedl of ^he angelic World, while we 
harbour fuch a curfed Gueft among us i* He, that v/ill therefore 
' qualify himfelf to take a View of Eternity, muft lirft fortify him- 
felf againft all the little Attacks of Scandal and Reprcacti, which 
caa be no other Way effefted than by the Ruks of folid Tirtue. 

It would take too long Time to inform the Reader how thefe 

Notions of the angelic World came into my Head. When I came 

«o put thefe Things together, I muft own I was filled with a juft 

-^-^ Vntempt of the World, and began to think that there was no 

reaTTjfofpeft of Happinefs on this Side of the angelic World ! 

THE END.
