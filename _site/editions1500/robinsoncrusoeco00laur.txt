A TALE OF SHIPWRECK AND A DESERT ISLAND. 



CHAPTER I. 



THE SHIPWRECK. 



In a family memoir which I compiled some two years 
since, entitled "Our Collett Ancestors," reference was 
made to a member of the family — John Collett, born about 
1720, the second son of Richard Collett and Elizabeth 
Cobb his wife, stated to have been "wrecked in the 
^ Doddington,' East Indiaman." I have so often found 
traditions of this character to have no foundation in fact — 
a similar story being told regarding another member of 
the family, Richard Collett the son of the Rev. Peter Collett 
of Rye and Denton, who was variously stated to have been 
lost in the "Kent," East Indiaman, burned at sea — a 
memorable wreck which took place in the year 1825 — and 
alternatively to have been killed at the Siege of 
Seringapatam, which occurred in 1799 — neither of which 
proved to be correct — that I made it my special object in 
the present case so far as possible to verify the facts. 
I should explain that Richard Collett, whom I have alluded 
to above, very probably took part in the attack on 
Seringapatam, because he was attached to a regiment — the 
2nd Bombay Native Infantry — engaged in the siege, but 
it is quite clear he could not have been killed upon that 
occasion because, as a matter of fact, according to the 
official records, he died three years later, in the year 
1802, at a place called Cannanore, in the Bombay 
Presidency. Obviously also he could not have been lost 
in the wreck of the " Kent," East Indiaman, as this event 
did not occur until 1825, three-and-twenty years after his 
death. Among my papers I have a pamphlet containing 
a narrative of the disaster to the '• Kent," written by 
Major MacG-regor, of H.M. 31st Regiment, one of the 
survivors. When all hope seemed at an end the Major 
threw over a short note addressed to his father, 
enclosed in a bottle, intimating their impending fate, and 
this bottle, thrown overboard in the Bay of Biscay on 1st 
March, 1825, wa^.p^ck^d-up(>n'the;coast of Barbadoes on 
the 30th September, 1 8 26^nineteen- months afterwards — 
and returned to him. 



In an old register of shipping at Lloyds I found 
an entry of the Ship " Doddington," subsequently stated 
to have been lost in 1755, and with the aid of the authorities 
of the British Museum I succeeded in unearthing a little 
pamphlet, entitled : 

"An Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the 
* Doddington,' East Indiaman, 

And of the adventures of those on board who 
survived the Shipwreck. 

From the Journal of one of the Surviving Officers.

a singular title, of a curiously comprehensive character. 
Narratives somewhat similar in their general terms, and 
evidently owing their origin to the same source, were 
also found amongst the records of the Royal Geographical 
Society. 

The facts which this little memoir reveals are of so 
novel and interesting a character, introducing as they do 
a member of the Collett family as one of the unfortunate 
victims, that I feel I shall be justified in reverting once 
more to family history, and in compiling this little 
narrative, which I hope I may not inappropriately 
designate "Robinson Crusoe" Collett. 

The " Doddington," East ludiaman, under the command 
of Captain Samson, sailed from the Downs, bound 
apparently for Madras, on the 23rd April, 1755, in 
compaoy with the Ships " Pelham," "Houghton," 
"Streatham,^' and "Edgecourt," all vessels in the service 
of the East India Company. They very soon parted 
company. The "Doddington" was clear of the Channel 
in about seven daj^s, and on the 20th May reached 
" Bonavista," one of the Cape de Verde Islands, putting 
next day into " Prior Bay," where she found the " Pelham " 
and the " Streatham," already arrived two hours previously, 



and was soon followed by the "Houghton" — the 
" Edgecourt '' not arriving until the 26th May. In 
modern charts we find the name of "Boavista" — not 
"Bonavista" — marked as one of the principal of the 
Cape de Verde Islands, but I believe the names are 
identical, and "Prior Bay" is evidently "Porto Praya," 
a commodious harbour in the adjacent island of Santiago, 
which I believe in olden times formed a customary port of 
call for our East Indiamen. 

The following day the vessels, having taken in water, 
proceeded upon their voyages, leaving the " Edgecourt " in 
the roads. They soon again parted company, and after a 
fine voyage of seven weeks the " Doddington " doubled 
the Cape of Good Hope, and steering due East for 
twenty-four hours continued her course in a north-easterly 
direction. 

At a quarter before one o'clock on the morning of 
Thursday, the 1 7th July — that is apparently shortly after 
midnight — the vessel suddenly struck upon a rock. Those 
on board— the officers and crew — there is no reference to 
passengers — suddenly awakened by the shock, started up 
in consternation and rushed upon deck, but only to realise 
the " alarming terrors " of the situation. The men were 
"dashed to and fro by the violence of the sea, 
which rolled over them," the vessel "breaking to pieces at 
every stroke of the surge." The Captain was washed 
overboard almost among the first, and was seen no more, 
and the ship was soon shattered to pieces. The vessel 
had struck on a barren uninhabited rock in Latitude 
33deg. 44m. South, distant 250 leagues East of the Cape 
of Good Hope. 

In the morning it was discovered that twenty-three 
persons, the sole survivors, had managed to reach the shore. 
These included Mr. Evan Jones, the chief officer ; Mr. 
John Collett, the second mate ; Mr William Webb, third 
mate ; Mr. S. Powell, fifth mate ; and Mr. Yets, 
midshipman. Also Eichard Topping, the carpenter ; Neal 
Bothwell and Nathaniel Chisholm, quartermasters ; Daniel 
Ladova, the steward ; and a number of seamen and 
" matrosses," which latter I understand to be gunners or 
artillerymen, who worked the guns. These twenty-three 
persons were all that survived of 270 souls on board Avhen 
the ship struck. You will not fail to notice that John 
Collett, to whom I have dedicated this memoir, was second 
officer of the ill-fated vessel. 



6 



The first care of the survivors was to search " among the 
things, which had been thrown up from the ship upon the 
rocks," for anything to aiford them covering, in which they 
succeeded beyond their hopes. The next thing they felt 
the want of was fire, and this was not so easily supplied. 
Some of them attempted to kindle two pieces of wood by 
rubbing them together, but without success ; others went 
exploring among the rocks hoping to pick up somethino^ 
that might serve for a flint and steel. After a long search 
they found a box containing two gun flints and a broken 
file. This was a "joyful acquisition," but still they had 
nothing that would kindle from a spark, and until some- 
thing like tinder could be procured the flint and steel were 
useless. Further search was therefore undertaken " with 
inexpressible solicitude and anxiety," and at length a cask 
of gunpowder was found, but to their great disappointment 
it proved to be wet. Upon close examination, however, 
a small quantity was found at the bottom which had not 
suffered damage, and some of this they *' bruised on a linen 
rag," which served them for tinder, and a fire was soon 
made. Round this all the sick aad wounded gathered, 
while the rest went in search of other necessaries, without 
which the rock could afford them but a " short respite from 
destruction." In the afternoon a box of wax candles and' a 
cask of brandy were brought in. " of which every one 
thought it advisable to take a dram." Subsequently others 
of the party returned with the information that they had 
discDverei a cask full of fresh water, which they considered 
of even " more consequence than the brandy." Mr. Jones, 
the chief officer, foun I some pieces of salt pork, and others 
arrived soon after driving before them seven live hogs 
which had come ashore. Casks of beer and water and 
flour were seen at a distance upon the rocks, but it was not 
possible to get at them at the time. The approach of 
night made it desirable to provide shelter. Mr. Collett, 
the second mate, with several of the hands, therefore set 
to work to construct a tent out of some canvas that had 
been thrown ashore, and this was successfully effected ; but 
unfortunately the tent, for want of sufficient material, was 
too small to hold them all. The island was very much 
frequented by a "kind of water fowl, something larger 
than a duck, called a gannet," — more correctly, I believe, a 
species of goose, — which resorted to the higher portions of 
the rock, and in this elevated position the tent was erected, 
"to avoid its being inundated," and all the sick and wounded 



were carried up to it and a fire kindled. " But as they had 
passed the day without food, so they passed the night 
without rest. * * * The night was so tempestuous that 
the wind blew away the fire, and before it could be scraped 
together again the rain put it out." 

In the morning — Friday, 18th July —those who were 
able continued the search among the rocks for such articles 
as had been washed up from the wreck, but to their great 
mortification they discovered that the casks which they 
had seen the night before, with the exception of one of 
Beer and another of Flour, had all been ** staved to pieces " 
against the rocks. These two casks were fortunately 
secured, but they had hardly been safely landed when the 
tide flowed up and put a stop to further work that day. 

The company was now called together to eat their first 
meal, and some "rashers of Pork were broiled for dinner." 
"The sitting down thus desolate and forlorn," continues 
the account " to a repast which they used to share in 
"convivial cheerfulness — which naturally arose from the 
" consciousness of present plenty and the hope of future — 
" struck them with such a sense of their condition, that 
" they burst into passionate lamentations, wringing their 
" hands and looking round them with all the wildness of 
" despair. The groans of the sick and wounded, destitute 
" of skilful aid and medicines, were," says the writer, who 
was himself terribly bruised and had his left arm 
broken, "one of the most affecting scenes he had ever 
"witnessed." "In such tumult of mind our thoughts 
" hurry from our object to another, to fix if possible upon 
"something that may afford comfort; and one of the 
" company recollecting that, as the carpenter was among 
"them, they might build a sloop, if they could procure 
" materials and tools, mentioned this as a subject of hope 
"to the rest. Every one's attention was immediately turned 
*'to the carpenter, who declared that he had no doubt, but 
' ' that he should be able to build a ship that would carry 
* ' them all to some port of safety, if tools and materials 
"could be found. At that time there seemed indeed no 
" rational prospect of procuring either, any more than of 
" being able to victual a vessel, if they had one ready built. 
"Yet no sooner had they placed their deliverance one 
" remove beyond total impossibility, than they seemed to 
"think it neither improbable nor difficult. They began 
" to eat without further repining, and from that moment 
"the boat engrossed their whole conversation, and they 



"not only debated upon the size and manner of rigging 
"her, but to what port they should steer — whether to the 
"Gape or Delagoa? As soon as they had finished their 
"repast, some went in search of tools and others to mend 
" the tent. No tools however were found that day." 

We can fully appreciate and sympathise with these 
unfortunate people's feelings — their sense of utter despond- 
ency and despair at starting, and the hopelessness which 
supervened when once some practical scheme for relief and 
rescue suggested itself. It will be unnecessary for me to 
point out that the association of Mr. John Collett, the second 
officer of the vessel, with these disastrous incidents, has 
suggested the title of this narrative, which I have 
designated " Robinsox Crusoe" Collett. 



CHAPTER II. 



THE DESERT ISLAND. 



I shall now continue the account very much in the terms of 
the original narrative. The orthography, and even the 
language, I am bound to say, are occasionally of a very 
erratic character — very quaint and very old-fashioned — but 
with suitable modifications and corrections, the record of 
their adventures and privations proceeds as follows : 

Sunday, I9th July. "Secured four butts of water, one 
cask of flour (' flower' it is called), one hogshead of brandy, 
and one of the smaller boats, which had been thrown up 
by the tide in a shattered condition. But found no tools 
except a scraper." 

Sunday, 20th July. " Had the good fortune to find a 
hamper, in which were some files, sail needles, gimlets, and 
an azimuth compass card. Also found two quadrants, a 
car[3enter's adze, a chisel, three sword blades, and a chest 
of treasure. This search was made early in the morning, 
as there had been a prodigious surf rolling in all the day 
before, by which it was reasonable to suppose something 
would be thrown up. At ten o'clock all assembled to 
prayers, and did not go out again till after dinner, when 
they found most of the packets of letters belonging to the 
King and the Company "—the East India Company — 
" which were carefully dried and laid by." The discovery 
of the chest of treasure led to serious trouble afterwards. 

"The same day, while searching about the beach, they 
found the body of a " gentlewoman," which proved to be 
that of Mrs. CoUett, the wife of the second mate, who was 
then at a little distance from the spot. The mutual 
affection of this couple was remarkably tender, and Mr. 
Jones, the chief oflicer, immediately stopped aside to Mr 
Collett and contrived to take him to the other side of the 
rock, while his companions dug a grave in which they 
deposited the body, reading over it the burial service from 
a French Prayer Book, which had drifted ashore from the 
wreck. Having thus paid the debt of humanity to the 



10 

dead, and coDcealcd from Mr. Collett a sight which would 
seriously, if not fatally, have affected him, they found 
means after some days to disclose by degrees what they 
had (lone and to give him the wedding ring, which they 
had taken from her finger. He received it with great 
emotion, and afterwards spent many days in raising a 
monument over the grave, b}^ piling up the squarest stcmes 
he could find, on the top of which he fixed an elm plank 
and inscribed it with her name, her age, the time of her 
death, and some account of the fatal accident by which it 
was occasioned." It seems strange, and quite out of the 
usual order of things, that the second mate of a vessel 
should have his wife with him on board, but such is the 
narrative as handed down to us, and there is no reason to 
question its accuracy. There is no mention of any other 
female on board, although we might have supposed the 
vessel carried passengers. 

Monday. 2\st July. "Secured some more water and 
pork, and found some timber, planks, cordage, and canvas. 
The latter were secured with great joy for the boat, though 
as yet many implements were wanting, without which it 
was impossible for the carpenter to get on with his work. 
He had just finished a saw, but he had neither hammer 
nor nails. It happened however that one of the seamen — 
Henclrick Scantz, a Swede — having picked up an old pair 
of bellows brought them to his companions, and told them 
that he had been by profession a smith, and tnat with 
these bellows and a forge, which he hoped they would be 
able by his direction to build, he could furnish the 
carpenter with all the tools he would require, nails 
included, as plenty of iron might be obtained by burning 
the timber which had come on shore from the wreck. 
This assurance was received with a transport of joy. the 
smith immediately applyins: himself to mend the bellows, 
and the three following days were spent in building a tent 
and a forge, and in bringing together the timber and 
planks for the use of the carpenter, who was meantime 
busy in getting ready the few tools he had, with a view to 
beginning the boat as soon as possible." 

Thursday, 24th July. "The carpenter assisted by 
Nathaniel Chisholm, the quarter-master, began to work 
upon the keel of the boat, which they had determined 
should be a sloop, 30 feet long and 12 feet wide. This 
day also the smith finished his forge and laid in a quantity 
of hi' for fuel. From this time the carpenter and smith 



11 

continued to work with indefatigable diligence, except 
when they were prevented by the weather ; the smith 
having fortunately Jound the ring and nut of a Bower 
anchor, which served for an anvil, supplied chisels, axes, 
hammers, nails, as these were wanted, and the carpenter 
used them with great dexterity and dispatch — until 
unfortunately one day he fell sick." 

" As the lives of the whole company depended upon the 
carpenter, it is needless to say ihey watched his recovery 
with the utmost impatience and anxietv, and to their 
unspeakable joy he was so far recovered on the 2nd August, 
as to be able to return to work." 

" In the meantime the stores, which they had saved from 
the wreck, were so nearly exhausted that they were placed 
on an allowance of two ounces of bread a man per day; 
and no salt pork, the latter being reserved to victual 
the boat. Water also fell short. In this distress they 
had recourse to several expedients ; they dug a well 
in hopes of finding a spring, but were disappointed ; and 
they also attempted to knock down some of the gannets that 
settled on the top of the rock, in which they had better 
success ; but they found the flesh very rank, of a fishy 
taste and as black as a shoe. They also made a raft or float, 
called a " Catamaran,'' on which they went fishing, with 
such hooks and lines as had come ashore. They also 
killed some seals, but all those who ate of them were 
taken very unwell. When driven to great distress, they 
killed one of the hogs saved from the wreck, but they 
were generally successful in fishing on " the float." 

" It happened on one occasion that Mr. Collett the second 
mate, and Mr. Yets, the midshipman, were very near 
being driven out to sea on one of these "floats," when 
they would inevitably have perished. On the 20th August, 
they had been fishing all the afternoon till about 4 o'clock, 
when they weighed and endeavoured to return, but the 
wind suddenly freshening up to the westward, they found 
that instead of gaining headway they drove out to sea 
very fast. The people on shore perceived their distress, 
but were unable to assist them. At last they sent out 
another float with '* killicks" — a small anchor I believe — 
*' and ropes, which they hoped would enable them to ride 
out the gale, till the wind became more moderate ; but the 
surf was so great that it upset the float, and the men who 
had started to their assistance were obliged to swim back. 
In the meantime they saw their friends still driving out to 



12 

sea at a great rate, and were just giving: them up to 
inevitable destruction. v,'htTi the carj-ienter sent word, that 
he could ^lal^e the little boat so tight that she ''should 
not take in water faster than one man coiild bale it out." 
This gave tliem fresh hope, and everyone was ready to 
venture out for the deliverance of their friends. The 
carpenter dispatched the boat in about a quarter of an 
hour, and she soon overtook the float and took Collett and 
Yets on board. But the water gained very fast upon them 
notwithstanding their utmost efforts, and by the time she 
came in, she was so full of water that in a few minutes 
more she must have sunk." 

"As they were now afraid of venturing any more on the 
raft, the carpenter went again to work on the little boat 
and put her into complete repair. Their success in fishing 
was very uncertain ; sometimes they took great quantities 
and sometimes they took none. The sujiplies they obtained 
on shore were equally precarious ; the gannets Would 
sometimes settle in amazing numbers, like a cloud, and 
sometimes they would totally disappear for several days 
together. This made them very desirous of finding some 
way of preserving the supplies they caught, that they 
might lay by the suiplus of a fortunate day, to serve them 
when neither gannets or fish were to be had. They 
made several attempts to cure both fish and fowl by 
smoking it, but this proved nearly fatal to them all. The 
smith had mended a copper vessel for the experiment, and 
they immediately set to work, without knowing that their 
process of saltmaking would dissolve the surface of the 
copper into "verdi grease," and that the solution or rust of 
copper was poison. Salt it is true was produced, but the 
quality that made it poisonous abounded to such a degree 
as to make it intolerably offensive to the taste, and it 
had to be thrown away, while those who had volunteered to 
taste it were seized with cold sweats and violent cholic, 
which effectually served to convince them of the danger 
they had escaped." 



CHAPTEE III. 
AN ADYENTUEE WITH SAVAGES. 



Wednesday, Srd September. ''These unfortunate peojile 
liad now been inhabitants of this desert rock ever since the 
17th July, nearly seven weeks, and during this time they 
had often seen a great smoke on the distant mainland, 
which made them very anxious to send the boat to see if 
assistance could be obtained. On this day BothweJl, the 
quarter master, and Eosenbury and Taylor, two seamen, 
set out on a voyage of discovery, and at night the people 
on shore made a large fire on the highett part of the rock 
as a sigual to them." 

" W hile they were awaiting the return of the boat they 
were all thrown into great consternation by an accident 
which happened to the carpenter, who unfortunately cut 
his leg with an adze in such a manner that he was in great 
danger of bleeding to death, they having no surgeon 
among them, nor anj^thing suitable to apply to the wound. 
At length with much difficulty the blood was stanched, 
and the wound healed without any bad symptoms 
intervening." 

Saiurday, 6ih Sejjttmier. "The weather having been 
fair for 40 hours they impatiently awaited the return of 
the boat. At noon they became very uneasy at having 
seen nothing of her, but just as they were sitting down to 
dinner, they were agreeably surprised by two of their 
people, who came running over the rocks announcing her 
approach. They all started up overjoyed at the sound, 
and ran to see her arrive, in the hope that^ she had 
succeeded in her object ; but they soon distinguished that 
she was rowed only by one man, who i^lied both oars. 
They concluded, therefore, that the other two were either 
lost or detained ; but presently they saw another get up 
from the bottom of the boat, where apparently he had 
been lying down for rest. And then the boat came forward 
somewhat faster, though still but slowly. Dinner was 
entirely forgotten, and after they had waited an hour on 



14 

the beach with the utmost inipatieace, the boat arrived. 
The two men were Rosenbury and Taylor, who, the 
moment the^^ stepped on shore, threw themselves on their 
knees, and in a short but earnest prayer returned 
thanks to God for having once more set them safe upon 
this place, which, barren and desolate as it was, they now 
looked upon as a refuge from a situation of much greater 
distress. Having exerted their utmost efforts to bring the 
boat in, their strength completely forsook them, and they 
were not able to rise from the ground without assistance." 

"As soon as they had been earned to the tent by the 
assistance of the rest, everybody was busy to procure them 
refreshment, for they found that the boat was quite bare 
of provisions and water. They dressed them some fish 
with as much haste as they could, and perceiving that they 
were quite exhausted with their exertions, and with want 
of rest, they left them, when they had eaten their food, 
without asking any questions, and they immediately fell 
asleep. The behaviour of these honest sailors to their 
messmates was an uncommon instance of hearty kindness 
and generous self-denial ; the impatience of their curiosity 
must have been both increased and justified in proportion 
as they were interested in the account that was to gratify 
it ; yet even this curiosity, in which life itself was 
concerned, they had the kindness and the fortitude to 
repress, rather than delay the refreshment of others for its 
gi'atification." 

The account which was given by the two adventurers 
when they awoke was to this effect : " About three o'clock 
on the day on which they set out, they got round a point 
about six leagues east of the rock. As they approached, 
it had the appearance of a double point, which encouraged 
them to hope that between the two points they should find 
a harbour ; but in this hope they were disappointed, for 
they found a considerable surf all along the coast About 
five o'clock, having seen signs of natives on the land, 
they ventured to pull in for shore, but the moment they 
got into the surf the boat upset. By this accident Bothwell 
was drowned, and the other two reached the shore in an 
exhausted and feeble condition, and were left destitute of 
every kind of provisions except a small keg of brandy. As 
6')on as they had recovered their strength they crawled 
along the shore to seek for the boat, having no other prospect 
of shelter from the wild beasts, which might be expected 
to be abroad at night. After some trouble they found her, but 



15 

they were too weak to get her up, and darkness coming on 
they were obliged to lie down upon the sand with no other 
covering than the shelter of a tree, and in this condition 
they passed the night. As soon as the morning dawned 
they went again to look for the boat, which the surf had 
driven from where they left her. As they walked along 
the coast they saw a man and advanced towards him, upon 
which he ran away into the woods, which grew very thick 
near the beach, ^oon afterwards they discovered the body of 
their companion Bothwell, which had been washed up 
upon the sand a considerable distance from the water, and 
torn to pieces by some wild beast. This terrified them 
exceedingly, and having found the boat, the dread 
of passing another night on shore determined them 
immediately to return. In this attempt they were 
prevented by a fresh gale, which sjirang up, and before 
they put back, the boat upset with them a second tim.e, and 
drove with them along the shore. After much struggling 
and swimming they once more got safe on land ; but as 
they had now been fasting ever since three o'clock the day 
before, they were faint with hunger and fatigue It 
happened that they met with a fruit resembling an apple, 
which they eagerly gathered and ate, without knowing 
either its name or its quality. By good fortune it did 
them no harm, and being somewhat refreshed by the fruit, 
they made shift to haul the boat on shore, and turning it 
upside down, they crept under it to sleep, being thus 
sheltered from the sun and secured against the wild 
beasts. Those who know the irresistable power of sleep 
after long watching and excessive labour will not conclude 
that their first slumber was short, because their situation 
was incommodious and insecure. They waked however 
before the morning, and peeping under the edge of the 
boat could discern the feet of wild beasts, which by their 
claws they concluded to be tigers " ("tygers" they called 
them) " passing to and fro round the vessel. This was a 
sufficient motive to remain in their resting place till 
daylight, when they looked out again and saw the feet of 
a human being. After this discovery they came from 
under the boat to the great astonishment of the poor 
savage, and two other men and a boy who were at some 
distance. When they " — that is the savages — " had got all 
together, and were a little recovered from their surprise, 
they made signs to the sailors to go away, which they 
endeavoured to do, though they were able to move but 
very slowly." 



16 

*' Before they had gone far from the boat a considerable 
number of natives ran down upon them with lances. 
It happened that Rosenbury had picked up the mast of 
the boat, and a pistol which had been washed on shore ; 
and being thus armed, when the Indians came down upon 
him, and being besides unable to run. he imprudently 
turned about and, exerting all his strength, advanced 
towards them in a threatening manner, supposing that they 
would have been seized wdth ^^^iiic and have retreated 
into the woods." 

"He was mistaken however, for instead of running away 
they surrounded him and began to whet their lances. 
Taylor thought it was now time to try what could be done 
by sup2^1ication ; he therefore threw himself on his knees 
and in a piteous tone cried out for mercy ; but Rosenbury 
took refuge in the water. The savages immediately came 
up to Taylor and began to strip him. He suffered them 
quietly to take his shoes and his shirt, but when they 
attacked his trousers he made some resistance, and by his 
gestures entreated they would not leave him quite naked, 
upon w-hich they desisted. Thej^ then made signs to 
Rosenbury to come to them, who was all this while 
swimming about in the sea ; but he refused, signifying 
that they would kill him. They then pointed to Taylor, 
intimating that they had not killed him. Thereupon he 
came forward, and having first thrown them his pistol and 
all his clothes except his shirt, he ventured to put himself 
into their hands. When he came up they offered him no 
violence ; only held the boat's mast and the lustol to him 
by way of deriding the f oUy of his attempts to frighten them. 
They seemed very much pleased with the clothes, which 
they divided among them as far as they would go. They 
then began to rifle the boat, and having taken all the rope 
they could find, and the hook by which the rudder hung to 
the stern-post, they began to knock the stern to pieces for 
the iron which was about it. Next to knocking the poor 
wretches on the head, this was the most fatal thing they 
could do, and, rough as the jioor sailors were, they burst 
into tears at the injury offered to the boat, and entreated 
the savages to desist with such agony of distress that they 
suffered the boat to remain as they found it. Encouraged 
by this appearance of forbearance and kindness, and urged 
by hunger, they asked by signs for something to eat. This 
request was also granted, and having given them some roots 
they again made signs for them to depart ; upon which 



17 

they once more launclied their boat and got in it, but the 
wind blowing from the west they could not put oS. The 
natives perceiving that they were willing to comply with 
their request, though not able, coyered them with the boat 
to sleep under, and left them as they had found them. 
The next morning the weather being fine, and the wind 
easterly, they launched the boat a third time and returned 
back to the rock." 

The unfortunate death of Bothwell on this expedition 
reduced their number to twenty-two. They had now been 
on the rock nearly four months, and had the boat been lost 
upon this occasion, or had it been detained or destroyed by 
the savages, their prospects of relief or rescue would have 
been seriously a:ffected. It seems almost a miracle that 
the two men should have got back safely to their 
companions. What became of the body of poor Bothwell 
is not related. Probably his remains had been too 
seriously mangled by the wild beasts to admit of burial, 
even if the means had been available of carrying it out. 



CHAPTER ly. 



THE ''HAPPY DELIVERANOE." 



" From this time until Sundaj^ 28tli of September, the 
carpenter and smith continued to Tvork upon the boat, and 
their companions were busy in getting in from time to time 
what was thrown up from the wreck, particularly cordage and 
canvas to furnish rigging for the boat, and some casks 
of fresh water. The latter they were very solicitous 
to keep, as their escape in the boat scarce depended as 
much upon fresh water as upon the sails themselves. On 
this day after they had been at prayers, a duty which was 
regularly and publicly performed every Sunday, the officers 
discovered that the chest of Treasure had been broken 
open, and the greater part of the contents taken away and 
concealed. It may perhaps be thought strange that people, 
whom danger had made so punctilious in their religious 
duties, should at the same time be guilty of theft ; but it 
should be remembered that as soon as a ship is lost, the 
sailors lose their pay and the Captain his command ; and 
every distinction and subordination that subsisted on 
shipboard is at an end. Whatever is cast ashore from the 
wreck is by the sailors considered as common property. 
The men, therefore, who secretly took what they considered 
their share of this treasure, were not in their own opinii)n 
guilty of dishonesty, but intended only to secure what they 
feared the officers would monopolize. The latter, however, 
when they discovered what had been done, and found that 
nobody would own they knew anything about the matter, 
wrote out the form of an oath which they proposed to 
administer separatel}' to each, the officers to take it first. 
But to this the majority objected; for though **they 
might not consider they had committed any crime by 
taking the treasure, they knew it would be not only 
immoral, but impious, to swear they had not taken it." 
The minority being thus helpless in the matter, the affair 
was suffered to rest without further enquiry or 
remonstrance." This is what may be called ** yielding to 



19 

circumstances" ; obviously there could be no " immorality " 
nor "impiety" in swearing they had not taken the treasure — 
on the part of those who had not done so. We may conclud e 
therefore, that those who objected to take the oath were 
really the guilty parties, and were simply actuated by their 
knowledge of the fact. The whole proceeding and its 
apology savours very much of what one may term " desert 
island " morality. It is to be noticed that those who had 
plundered the chest did not offer to restore any portion of 
what they had taken, although, even according to their own 
argument, their companions were obviously entitled to a 
share " 

" On the 6th October thej found a fowling piece ; this was 
a joyful acquisition, and though the barrel was much bent 
it was soon made serviceable by the carpenter and used 
with great success in shooting the birds, which previously 
they had no means of taking except by knocking them 
down with a stick." It does not say where they got the 
powder and shot. 

"On Friday, October 1 0th, they perceived the gannets, 
which had of late forsaken them, hovering about the rock 
in great numbers, and were in hopes they would settle to 
lay their ^^ggs, in which, to their great joy, they were not 
disappointed. From this time the}^ were constantly supplied 
with eggs in great plenty until the beginning of January, 
when the season of lajdng came to an end." 

" On Sunday, lath October, Mr. Collett, Mr. Webb, and 
two others ventured out once more on " the float," but the 
wind springing up very fresh the float broke loose, and 
drove with them to the other side of the rock. The wind 
still rising and the sea running very high, it was impossible 
for the boat to put out ; they were therefore obliged to 
remain all night among the seals on the rocks, without any 
shelter or refreshment. ' ' But in this situation — trying as it 
was — they derived great comfort from reflecting how much 
more dreadful it would have been, if instead of being- 
driven on to the rocks, they had been carried out to sea." 
It was noon the next day before the wind abated, and then 
the boat ventured off ; but as the waves still ran high, the 
boat could not take in more than two at a time, and they 
had to leave the "float" behind. Eainy weather now 
supervened, which proved very acceptable, as they con- 
trived to save some of the water ; but they were still in 
great want of bread, having lived many days on short 
allowance. As a last resource, they attempted to build an 



20 

oven, for though they had no bread, they had some barrels 
of flour — " flower " they called it. In this they succeeded 
beyond their expectations, and were able to convert their 
** flower " into tolerable biscuit. But even the biscuit in 
course of time became eo nearly expended, that they were 
obliged to limit themselves to a few ounces a day — " without 
brandy " — of which only a small quantitj^ remained, and 
this they " reserved for the carpenter." They were also so 
short of water that they were allowed but half a pint a 
day " 

*' In this condition nevertheless they happily, in a great 
degree, preserved their health and vigour, and on the 

16th of FEBETJATIY THEY LAUNCHED THEIR BOAT AND CALLED 

HER THE 'HAPPY DELIVERANCE.' On the 1 7th they got their 
little pittance of stores on board, and on the 18th they 
SET SAIL FROM THE ROCK, ou which they had lived just seven 
months, and to which at parting they gave the name of 
* BIRD ISLAND ' It was ouc o'clock in the afternoon when 
they weighed anchor and stood for the river St. Lucia, 
about 300 leagues distant." 

"When they embarked they were two and twenty in 
number, and had on board 2 butts and 4 hogsheads of 
water, two of the hogs that had come on shore from the ship, 
one firkin of butter, about 90 pounds of biscuit, and about 
ten days' salt provisions at 2 ounces a man per day, but 
the latter was said to be quite rotten and out of condition." 
It seems strange to read of two live hogs still surviving 
after seven months upon this desolate rock. One almost 
wonders what they had lived upon. *' The joy which they 
felt at putting off from this dreadful * seat of famine and 
desolation ' was too great to be expressed ; but it was of 
very short continuance, for as soon as they got to the mouth 
of the little channel, which led to the island, the ' grapnails ' 
came home, and they were instantly driven on the 
rocks, where their boat, which had cost seven months 
incessant labor, and was the foundation of all their hopes, 
struck so often, and with such violence, that they were 
thrown into the greatest consternation, and expected every 
moment she would be broken to pieces. It was a great 
aggravation of their distress, that no effort of theirs could 
contribute to extricate or relieve them, so that they could 
only gaze at each other in despair and wait — helpless and 
inactive — for the moment of destruction." 

" In this condition, however, it pleased Him, whom the 
winds and waves obey, to relieve them. A swell of the sea 



21 

lifted the boat from the reck, on which she was beatirg, and 
carrying her over the bar, left her in four fathoms of water. 
Here they immediately anchored, and commenced to repair 
their damage, but this was not effectually completedtill noou 
the next day." For twelve days, accordirg to their account, 
until the 2nd March, they incessantly persevered, but 
without makingmuch headway owingto the strong opposing 
current. In the meantime their provisions became very 
nearly exhausted, and they had the double prospect of 
shipwreck and starvation staring them in the face. In 
this predicament they came to the conclusion to let the boat 
drift with the current, in the hope that they might thus 
reach the Cape. 

'' The very next day however the wind, which till then 
had been easterly, suddenly blew a strong gale from the 
west ; so that the wind now counteracted the force of the 
current. The gale continued all that day and the following 
night, and the next morning, Thursday, 4th March, it 
blew a perfect hurricane. They now endeavoured to '• lie 
to," but they shipped such heavy seas that they were in 
constant danger of being swamped, and were, therefore, 
compelled to sail steadily under topsail only. By this 
means they were driven before the gale at a great rate, 
until next morning about 3 o'clock, when the weather 
again became fine." 

''This course they continued till Wednesday, the 10th 
March, when the wind shifting to the eastward they 
anchored in 12 fathom water, at a distance of about 
half-a-mile from the shore. In the evening many of the 
natives came down to the water side, hallowing and making 
signs that they should land, which thej many times 
attempted to do, but found it impracticable. In the 
morning the natives appeared again, repeating their signals, 
and driving down great numbers of cattle, but the "poor 
wretches" on board were still tantalized by the sight of 
plenty, which they could not reach, for no place to land 
could be found." 

"On Sunday, the 14th March, two of the people, having 
had nothing to eat for a couple of days, begged to be 
allowed to land, saying they would rather take their 
chance of losing their lives amongst the savages, than die 
of starvation in the boat. One of them had only just 
sprung ashore when a shark suddenly seized the blade of 
one of the oars in his mouth, and nearly wrenched it out 
of the sailor's hands " — a rather close shave. 



22 



"On Monday, the 15tli March, they determined at all 
events to make an attempt to get the sloop into the river ; 
having- waited until it was high water they sent the little 
boat ahead to sound, and following her at a proper distance 
they at length ventured over the bar, and having happily 
received no damag3, they anchored in two-and-a-half 
fathoms of water." 

" The natives now came again to the shore, and the people 
on board got together some brass buttons, small bits of 
iron, nails, and copper hoops, as the most likely commodities 
to exchange for mutton and beef. The copper hoops they 
bent into bracelets to be worn on the legs and arms, such 
as are worn by all the natives of this coast, who have 
trafficked with Europeans, and are called "Bangles." With 
these baubles, which are prized by these poor savages, 
perhaps with as much reason as gems and gold are prized 
by those who hold their simplicity in contempt, the 
poor famished adventurers hastened on shore, and soon 
made the natives understand what they wanted, and what 
return the}' would make. This it is said they did by 
"kneeling down and knawing the grass and holding their 
hands up like horns, and making a noise like that of 
bullocks, sheep, &c." Two bullocks, each weighing 60()lbs. 
weight, were soon after driven down to the beach with 
great expedition, and bartered for about one pound weight 
of copper hooks, and 4 brass buttons. Provisions of all 
kinds were promised " in great plenty " at the same rate — 
particularly milk — which they sold at a very low rate, 
2 or 3 gallons for a single button, and a small grain that 
resembled Guinea wheat. This grain they attempted to 
bake into biscuit, but could not succeed ; however they 
found an excellent substitute by boiling it with their meat, 
which answered the same purpose as bread, and made very 
good food." 

" They continued on shore at this place nearly a fortnight, 
and found the natives an honest, open, harmless, and 
friendly people, ready to do any kind office that lay in their 
power, and always dividing what they brought from the 
chase, though it was ever so little, as far as it would go, 
with looks and gestures that * ' strongly expressed that 
pjleasure wliich no selfish gratification can j^roduce." Their 
manner of living and appearance were said to be " the 
same that have so often been described by those who have 
described the people called Hottentots," who inhabit the 
Cape of Good Hope, except that as " these had not been used 



23 

to any commerce witli Europeans they were more innocent, 
benevolent, and sincere" — a ratlier severe commentary on 
the effects of contact with civilization. " During their stay 
the Doddington people frequently went up into the country 
to the native villages ten or twelve miles distant, where 
the natives lived in huts, covered with rushes forming 
a kind of thatch, and very neat within. Their chief 
exercise was hunting, their arms being lances and two short 
sticks with a knob at the end, with which, after having 
wounded their game with the lance, they knocked it down. 
The river was very full of Manatees or sea-cows, which 
they found no ways mischievous. They mostly came en 
shore in the night, and their chief food was grass. The 
natives were in the habit of catching them asleep, and killing 
them to eat. They had a few elex)hants teeth, which they 
offered very cheap, but the people had no room for them 
in their boat. The natives wore little or no clothing in the 
day-time, and at night only a bullock's hide, which they 
dried thoroughly and made very supple. Their chief 
ornaments were a piece of a bullocks's tail, which hung 
dangling down to their heels, with a few small shells tied 
to it ; they also wore small pieces of the skin tied round 
their knees, ancles, and arms. Their hair they plaistered 
up with a great quantity of tallow or fat, mixed with a 
kind of red earth, and they rubbed their bodies all over 
with grease. They were prodigously active and dexterous 
with their lances ; they often saw them throw a lance over 
40 yards and hit a small head of corn. They have another 
method of exercising themselves in the day, and 
commonly when they meet or part from one another — 
that is by dancing or jumping all round a ring, and making 
a most hideous noise, sometimes hallowing and sometimes 
grunting like a hog ; then running backwards and forwards 
as hard as they can, flourishing their lances." 

" It was a remarkable circumstance that among these 
peoj)le, who were all black and woolly haired, there was a >outh 
of about twelve or fourteen 3'ears of age, who was quite 
white, and had regular features, with fair light hair. The 
people of the sloop observed that he was treated as a 
servant, being sent on errands, and sometimes not permitted 
to eat till the rest had done. They also took notice that 
he disappeared a few days before they left the coast, and 
therefore they suspected the natives were afraid they 
might carry him off with them, nor, indeed, was one of the 
natives themselves to be seen on the morning they went 
away." 



CHAPTER V. 



THE END. 



"On Monday, the 29tli March, having" laid in great plenty 
of provisions, they got over the bar ani made sail for 
the River St. Lucia, where they arrived on Tnes lay, 6th 
April, having found the current more favour ible than 
before, and no other occurence having happened that was 
worth relating." 

" Having got into the River St. Lucia and anchored in 
in 3 f ithoms of water, the party went on shore, but they 
found thg peop'e very different from those with whom they 
last traded. When the brass buttons and bits of old iron 
were offered them they refused them ; and taking up some 
sand from the beach they poured it out of one hand into 
the other, by which they apparently intended to intimate 
that they wanted strong liquors, though the sloop's people 
did not at first understand them ; and if they had understood, 
they had no strong liquor for them. They made signs 
also that they wanted some brass rings big enough to serve 
as collars ; but in this too the strangers were equally 
unable to gratify them. Among other things they 
offered them was a brass handle of an old chest, and a piece 
of the ''bunten" they had made their colors of. These 
happened to be acceptable, and were exchanged for two 
large bullocks, and six good fowls. They also vouchsafed 
to purchase some of the buttons with pumpkins, potatoes, 
and other herbs and fruit." 

" The natives of this part of the coast, by their frequent 
dealings with Europeans, had learned to be cleanly in their 
persons and food, dressing their hair up very neatly and 
laying aside the grease and garbage with which savages 
usually anointed and adorned themselves ; but at the same 
time they had learned to be proud, crafty, deceitful, 
and dishonest" — further painful results of contact with 
civilization. "Our adventurers stayed with them until 
Sunday, the 18th April, and then getting all on board 
their little craft, they weighed anchor and made sail." 



25 

*' Hitherto they Iiad been united by adversity in tlie bond 
of friendship, but with the near prospect of deliverance 
their niinds became less pliant and tender, and their 
different peculiarities of temper and opinion were indulged 
with less restraint. As they were sailing down the river a 
dispute arose about the time and manner of crossing the 
bar, which was then very near, and it was carried so high, 
that some of them hauled down the sails and let go the 
"grapnail" close to a bank of sand; nine of them then 
hoisted out the little boat and went on shore, swearing that 
they would sooner take their chance of getting to Delagoa 
by land than be drowned in attempting to get over the 
bar. Those who remained on the sloop were by this 
accident reduced to very great distress ; for being prevented 
by the delay they had suffered, from getting over the bar 
at high water, and the wind and tide both setting out of 
the river at a great rate, they were very soon forced on the 
breakers, where there was then but 8 feet of water — and 
the vessel drawing 5 feet, she must inevitably have been 
grounded and beaten to pieces before the tide changed. 
Contrary to all expectation, however, and from some 
unknown cause, in less than half-an-hour the surface of 
the water became smooth, and by the vigorous efforts of 
those on board the vessel was brought safely out of the 
river." 

•' From St. Lucia they '' took a new departure," and 
anchored in De la Goa roads at 4 o'clock in the afternoon 
on Wednesday, the 21st April, having again narrowly 
escaped shipwreck on some breakers the night before." It 
is but right to explain that the dates assigned in the 
original narrative are obviously often inaccurate. The 
fact of it being leap-year perhaps made it additionally 
confusing. " At Delagoa they found the " Rose " galley, 
Capt. Chandler, trading for beef and ivory, and most of 
them begged a passage by this boat to Bombay." 

" After they had continued here about three weeks, three 
of the men who had deserted them at St. Lucia, were 
brought up the river in a small boat of the country, and 
reported that they had left the remaining six on the other 
side of the Bay of Delagoa, waiting for a boat to bring 
them across." 

" On board the sloop there was, among other things, the 
remainder of the chest of Treasure belonging to the East 
India Company, wnich had been broken open upon the 
ruck and plundered, upon the assumption that on the loss 



26 



of the ship it became common property. The officers who 
had secured what remained, and who till now had no 
means of recovering the rest, told Capt. Chandler what 
had happened, and proceeding with him in his pinnace, 
well-manned and armed, on board the sloop, they secured 
all the money, j^late, and packets they could find. The 
people on board the sloop, as soon as they left, fearing that 
they might be taken into custody, weighed anchor and 
disappeared during the night. On the 25th May, the 
•' Kose " galley, having on board the officers and remainder 
of the crew of the " Doddington," weighed anchor and 
proceeded to Madagascar, with the object of completing 
her cargo. The natives of Delagoa had," it is said, " sold 
Capt. Chandler 100 head of cattle, but stole them away 
again, and refused to restore them without a fresh 
Consideration " — a novel system of trade, based apparently 
on what one may term " double entry." 

*' Soon after they had put to sea they made a sail, which, 
when they came up with it, proved to be the sloop '' Happy 
Deliverance," which had since taken in the other seamen 
that were left behind at St. Lucia. Of these unfortunate 
men three had since died, and two were in such a condition 
that they died the next day — having," as the account 
says, " after their lives had been so often preserved — almost 
to a miracle — foolishly sacrificed them to voluntary 
hardships and fatigue in a fit of unreasonable petulance and 
causeless disgust." Two of the people on board the sloop, 
being convinced that no harm was intended them, then 
came on board the " Rose." One of them was the carpenter 
Eichard Topping, " to the honour of whose ingenuity be 
"it recorded, that the sloop which he built upon a desolate 
" rock, with the fragments of the ship, fitted together with 
•'such tools as the pieces of iron casually thrown on 
** shore would supply, he now sold to Capt. Chandler for 
" 2500 Rupees, nearly equal to £500 sterling money." The 
Rupees must have declined very sensibly since that time, 
if this is correct. In the early part of the present century 
the standard value of a Rupee was two shillings — but at 
the present moment it is very considerably less even than 
that. It is but right to say however, that some of the other 
narratives give a very different version of this transaction. 
They state that the sloop was sold for 500 Rupees — a 
considerably modified sum, and it is quite impossible to 
hazard any surmise as to which is correct. Even this latter 
transaction however is qualified by the statement that the 



sloop '* was sutsequently seized at Bombay for the 
proprietors." Who the ^proprietors of a vessel, built upon a 
barren rock from wreckage washed ashore, would be, it is 
rather difficult to suggest? "From this time the sloop 
pursued her voyage in company with the galley, and both 
arrived at Madagascar on 14th June, after a voyage of 
twenty-two daj^s." 

" Soon after they had anchored they found the ship 
* Carnarvon,' Capt. Hutchinson, arrived there on a voyage 
from London to China, and as the treasure and packets 
which had been saved from the ' Doddington,' were to be 
delivered at Madras, at which port the ' Carnarvon ' was to 
call, the officers went on board the ' Carnarvon,' and leaving 
Madagascar on the 1st July, they delivered them 'by God's 
providence ' with other private effects to the Company's 
agent at Madras, on the 1st August, 1756." 

Thus terminates the narrative. It does not say what 
became of the remainder of the party on board the ' ' Eose 
Galley" and the sloop. For the graphic and interesting 
account of the shipwreck and the subsequent adventures of 
the survivors we are avowedly indebted to Mr. Webb, the 
third mate of the vessel. It is singular that the names of 
Webb and Collett should be associated in those early days — 
some generations later the connexion was a very much 
closer one. The " Doddington Eock " and " Bird Island " 
will be found in any map of South Africa, slightly to the 
eastward of Algoa Bay. 

It only remains for me to say that the name of John 
Collett appears constantly throughout the narrative as 
most prominent among the survivors. In every incident — 
in every adventure — in every e:ffort for their rescue, Mr. 
John Collett, the second mate, always took a leading and 
conspicuous part. In my account of "Our Collett Ancestors " 
it states that John Collett was " wrecked in the 
' Doddington,' East Indiaman." It does not say he lost 
his life. Possibly he may have subsequently succumbed 
to illness brought on by the hardships he endured, or by 
the exposure during those long weary months upon the 
desolate uninhabited rock. I cannot say — I have told my 
tale as I have found it— after the lapse of a century and 
a half — a singular record of the almost forgotten past — a 
memorable episode in a family history. 



28 

It is a strange but peculiar circumstance that after I liad 
concluded the above, another account of the loss of the 
"Doddington" came to light in the " Gentleman's Magazine " 
for July, 1757, compiled from the journal of Mr. Evan 
Jones, the chief officer, in which some additional details 
are given. He makes especial reference to the loss of John 
CoUett's wife : " Mr. Collett lost his wife in the ship ; after 
she struck, he went down and brought her on deck in his 
arms, but the ship falling uj^on her broadside, and the 
decks falling in, he was separated from her, and never saw 
her afterwards." He then relates how her body was washed 
ashore and buried upon the island. 

In reference to John Collett's own fate all further question 
is set at rest. Alluding to the arrival of the sloop at Bombay, 
he says: ''Mr. Powell" — that is the fifth mate — "came 
there in her; all the rest went to Madras in the " Car- 
narv^on." except Mr. Collett and three others," whose 
names he mentions, " who died of fevers on board the 
"Rose Galle3^" And so indeed my forebodings proved 
only too true ! He was " wrecked in the ' Doddington,' 
East Indiaman," but he did not "lose his life in her." 
After enduring all the perils and hardships and horrors of 
shipwreck, and a terrible domestic bereavement — just at 
the time when his own rescue seemed at hand— he succumbed 
to the consequences of the trials he had endured, and died 
of fever — a victim to his privations — a martyr to his duty 
— and a worthy example to those who survived him. Such 
was the melancholy end of poor John Collett.
