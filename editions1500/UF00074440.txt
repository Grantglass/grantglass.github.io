entirely true story, but it is not. It is, no
doubt, however, founded in part on the real
adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the son
of a shoemaker in Scotland. The following
brief account of him is given by Wilson,
- the biographer of De Foe:

1719, nearly one hundred and seventy years
ago. The author called it "The Life and
Stmngs Surprising Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe, of York, Mariner: who lived eight-
and-twenty years all alone in an uninhabited
island on the coast of America, near the
mouth of the great river Oroonoque; hav-
ing been cast on shore by shipwreck, where
in all the men perished but himself. With
an account how he was at last strangely
delivered by Pirates. Written by himself."

They gave their books very long titles
in those days. But the people soon found
that this was a very interesting book, de.
spite its long title. No publisher wanted
to print it at first, but as soon as it was
publishul, a large number of copies were
sold, and publishers have been printing it
and selling it ever since.

It was at first thought by some to be an

father>> mesiness, which was that of a shoe
maker. Being a spoiled child, he soon dis
covered a waywardness of temper that gave
much uneasines to his parents; whilst an
early propensity to the sea rendered his
employment irksome. At length an inci-
dent occured that put him upon indulging
his humor; for, being brought under church-
eensure for irregular conduct when he was
eighteen years of age, rather than submit
he suddenly left home, and was never been!
of for six years. It is supposed that he was
with the buccanecis in the South Seas. In
1701 we find him again at Largo, but the
same intractable person as ever, being en-
gaged in constant broils with his family.
As the sea was his favorite element, he did
not continue long in Scotland, but, going
to London. engaged with Captain Dampier
 

upon a cruising expedition to the South
Seas. This was the voyage that rendered
his subsequent history so interesting to the
lovers of romance

"Being appointed sailing-muster of the
Cinque Ports galley, a companion to the
St. George, commanded by Dnmpier, he left
England in the spring of 1703, and, after
various adventures, both vessels reached
the island of Juan Fernandez in the follow-
ing February. After staying some time to
re-fit, they sailed again in quest of booty;
but a violent quarrel arising between Sel.
kirk and his commander, Stmdling, which
settled into a rooted animosity, the former
resolved to take the filst opportunity of
leaving the vessel. This occurred at the
beginning of September, 1704, when her
crazy state obliged Stradling to return to
Juan Fernandez for fresh repairs; which

being completed, Selkirk bade a final adieu
to his comrades at the end of the same
month. Upon this island he lived by him
self four years and four months, until he
was released by Captain Woodes Rogers
in the month of February, 1709."

It has been said that this wild fellow
wrote a story of his adventures and gave it
to De Foe, and that De Foe made the story
of Romxsox 01111503. from it, but this is not
believed to be true.

Whether the story is founded upon that
of Selkirk or not, it is one that every body
finds f uil of interest. The picture of Crusoe.

of York. in the year 1632.
' My father's right name

'\ was Kreutzuaer, and he
had come to England from
' Bremen. My mother's re-

: lations were named Robin-
son, so I was named Robinson Kientznaer.
The English people called i: Crusoe, and
after a while we came to write it so.

My father was not rich, but he had
become well to do by trading, and he
wished me to stay at home and be happy;
and all the more because both he and my
mother were getting old, and further, be.
cause one nf my elder brothers had been

   

killed in the war with the Spaniards, and
the other'had gone away from home and
had not been heard from; but I would be
satisfied with nothing but going to sea;
and my inclination to this led me so
strongly against the will of my father, and
against all the entneaties of my mothe)
that there seemed to be something fatal in
my penehity, tending directly to:7 the life
of nnsei y which "as to befall me.

One morning, my father called me into
his'chamber, where he wassick with the
gout, and talked to me very seriously
about it. He told me that if I staid at
home, I had a prospect of raising my
fortunes and living a life of happineu.
 

He said that it was only the very wealthy
on the one hand, or the very desperate on
the other, who went abroad in search of
adventure. Mine was the middle state,
which he-had found by experience was the
but state in the world. This was the
state of life that was envied both by kings
and beggars. This condition of life was
what the wise man meant when he prayed
that he might have neither poverty nor
riches.

 

Much more he told me to (lisuade me
from going to sea, and he ended by saying
that though he should not cease to pray
for me. if I did take this foolish step,
God would not bless me.

1 was deeply affected by what my father
said, and I resolved not to think any more
of going abroad. But in a few days my
good resolutions were all given up audI
began to think of running away from
home in spite of the entr'eaties of my

ever, as no opportunity presented itself, I
still remained at home, though I refused
to engage in any business or to learn any
trade.

One day, being at Hull, I met one of my
companions who was going by sea to Lon-
don, and he invited me so strongly to go
with him that I consulted neither father
nor mother any more, nor so much as sent
them word of it; but leaving them to hear
of it. as they might, without asking God's
blessing, or my father's, without any con-
sideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour, God knows, on the Is}.
of September, 1651,I went on board a ship
bouml for London.

Never any young ndventmer's misfor
tunes, I believe, began sooner or continued
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner
got out of the Iquzbcr than the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a
most frightful manner; and, as I had never
been at sea before, I was most incxpreesibly
sick in body, and terrified in mind. I
began now seriously to reflect upon what 1
had done, and how justly I was overtaken
by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning
my duty. All the good counsels of my
parents came now fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to
the pitch of hardness to which it has come
since, rcproachcd me with the contempt of
advice, and the breach of my duty to God
and my father.

I thought that every wave would swallow
us up, and that every time the ship fe'l
into the hollow or trough of the sen, it
would never rise gain. In this agony of

father and the tears of my mother. How- , mind I made many vows and resolutions,

it into a ship again while I lived; that I
would take his advice, and never run my-
self into such miseries as these any more.

Ihad these wise and good thoughts as
long as the storm lasted, and, indeed, for

some time after. But the next day, the
wind abated and the sen. grew calmer, and
a fine evening followed. My seasickness
and my fears disappeared, and with them
all my thoughts of home and duty. The
sun rose clear the next, morning, and his
beams shining upon the sea, which was
quite smooth, there being little or no wind,

looking with wonder upon the sea that was
so rough and terrible the day before, and
could be so calm and so pleasant in so little
:1 time after. And now, lest my good re
solutions should continue, my companion
who had enticed me away comes to me.

" \Vell, Bob," says he, clapping me upon
the shoulder, " how do you do after it? I
warrant you new frightened, wer'n't you,

"A capful d'you call it i" said I; "'twas

To make short. this sad part of my story,
we went the way of all sailors; the punch
was made, and I was made halfalrunk with
it; and in that one night's wiekednes I
drowned all my repentance, all my reflee

merchant to a slave, I was perfectly over-

my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable; which I thought
wasnow so effectually brought to pass,
that I could not be worse; for now the
hand of heavrn had overtaken me, and I
was undone. But alas! this was but a
mate of the misery I was to go through.

As my new patron, or master, had taken
me home to his house, so Iwas in hopes
that he would take me with him when he
went to sea again, believing that it would
some time or other be his fate to be taken
by a. man--of-war, and that then I should
be set at liberty. But this hope of mine
was soon taken away; for when he went
to sea, he left me on shore to look after his
little garden, and do the common drudgery
of slaves about his house.

future: and having lying by him the long

I, is my chance to get my liberty.

My first contrirance was to speak to the
Moor and ask him if we ought not to take
along some food for our dinner; for I told
him we must not presume to eat of our
master's bread. He said that was true; so

As long as the swinIIIIiIIg Moor could

which way I had gone. But as soon as
I thought the boat was out of his sight,
I turned her head to the south-east.

slain, and forty for the lion's skin, which I
had in my boat, and caused everything I
had in tlte ship to be punctually delivered
tome; such as the case of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees'-
wax, for I had nradc candles of the rest; in
a word, I made about two hundred and
twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and
with this stock I went on shore.

I soon learned that the planters of that
country lived well and became rich, so I
bought land and became a planter, raising
sugar and tobacco. \Vhen the Portuguese
captain sailed, I sent by him an order for
the .money which I had left with the
English captain's widow, and gave him irr-
m-uctions to invest it in Lisbon in such

utensils and things as I wanted; which he
did, and brought them to me on his run

I was now very prosperous and happy,
but I was not to remain so. I often talked
to the planters about me of my voyage to
the coast of Guinea, and how easy it was to
trade with the natives for gold-dust, or
even for slaves, which were very dear in
the Brazils.

One (lay some of the planters came to
rue and proposed, that, as there was noth-
ing we needed so much as slaves to work
our plantations, they would fit out a ship
to go to the coast of Guinea for slaves, and
that I would take charge of the affair. Al-
though I was very well situated where I
was, I accepted their proposal, providing

 

they would take care of my property while
I was gone. In short, I obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason;
and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out,

make me nearly senseless.

I held on to the rock, however, until the
wave receded, and the next run I took I
got to the mainland. exhausted and bruised,
and, indeed, more dead than alive.

But I was now landed, and safe on
shore, and began to look up and to thank
God that my life was saved. I walked
about the shore, lifting up my hands, and
my whole being, I may say, wrapt up in
a contemplation of my deliverance; mak-
ing a thousand gestures and motions, which
I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my
commdes that won; drowned, and that

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel,

done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that, in a wold, I had a dreadful dc-
liverauco; for I was wet, had no clothes to
shift me, nor anything either to eat or
drink, to comfort me. Keither did I see
any pmspeetbct'ore me, but that of per~
i'hingr with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts; and that- which was particu-
afi'ectiug to me was, that Ihad no
mn, either to hunt and kill any ere:-
ture for my sustenance, or to defend my-
self against any other creature that might
dcsile to kill me {or theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about. me but a knite,a to-
bacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in :1 box.
This was all my provision; and this threw
me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a
while I ran about like a madman. Night
coining upon me, I began, with a heavy
heart, to consider what would be my lot if
there were any ravenous beasts ill that
country, seeing at night they always come
abroad for prey.

All the remedy that offered to my
thoughts, at that time, was to get up into
a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny,
which grew near me, and where I resolved
to sit all night, and consider the next
day what death I should die, for as yet I
saw no prospect of life. I walked about
a fin-long from the show, to see if I could
find any fresh water to drink, which I did
to my great joy; and having drunk, and
put a little tobacco in my mouth to pre-
vent hunger, I went to the tree, and get:
ting up into it, endeavourml to place my-
self so that. if I should sleep I might not
fall. And having cut me a short stick.
like a truneheon, for my defence. I took up
my lodging: and being exccwively fatigued,
8)

 

I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably that at least I might save some necessary
as, I believe, few could have done in my things for my use.

When I came down from my apmtment
in the tree, I lunked about me again, and
the filst thing I luund was the heat, which

condition, and found myself more refieshed
with it than I think I ever was on such an
occasion.

 

"'hen I waked up it was blond day-
light, the weather clear, and the storm
abated. so that the sea did not rage and
swell as before; but that which surprised
me more was. that the ship was lifted off
in the night from the sand where she lay,
by the swelling of the tide, and was driven
up almost as far as the rock which I at fiist
mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the wave dashing me against it. T his
being within about a mile from the shore
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upn'ght still, I wished myself on board,

lay, as the wind and sea had tnssed her up,
upon the land, about two miles on my right
hand. I walked as far as I could upon
shore to have got to her; but found aneck,
or inlet of water between me and the heat
which was about half a mile broad; so I
came back for the present, being more
intent upon getting at the ship, when: I
hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.

A little after noon I found the see very
calm, and the tide ehhed so far out, that I
could come within a quarter of a mile 0!2*

the ship. Am'. here Ifound afresh renew-
ing of my grief ; for I saw evidently, that if
'n'e had kept on board, we had been all
safe; that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as
to be left entixely destitute of all comfort
and company as I now was.

This forced the tears to my eyes again.
As them was little relief in that,l rewlved
if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled
off my clothes, for the weather was hut, and

 

took to the water. But when I came to the
ship my (lillieulty was still greater to know
how to get on boawl, for as she lay high out
of the waster, there was nothing within my

 

leach to lay hold of. I swam around her
twice, and the second time I espied a small
piece of rope hanging down the {ore-chains
so low, that with great diflicnltyI got, hold
of it, and by the help of that rope got up
into the forecastle of the ship.

I found that the ship was bulged, and
had a. gneat deal of water in her hold; but
that she lay so on the side of a hank of
hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low,
almost to the water. By this means all her
quarter was free, and all that was in that.
part was dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to sealeh, and to see what was
spoiled and what was free. And, first, I
found that all the ship's provisions were
dry and untouched by the water, and being
very well disposed to eat,I went to the
bread-mom and filled my packets with his-
cuit, and ate it as lwentabont other things,
for I had no time to lose. I also found
some rum in the great cabin, of which 1
tool: a large dram, and which I had, indeed
need enough of, to spirit me for what was
before me.

Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to
furnish myself with many things which I
foresaw would he vcry necessary to me. It
was in vain to sit still and wish for what
was not to he had; and this extremity
roused my application. "'0 had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of
wood, and nspare top-mast or two in the
ship I resolved to fall to work with these,
and I flung as many of them overhoanl as I
could manage for their weight, tying eveiy
one with a rope, that they might not drive
away. When this was done I went down
the ship's side. and pulling them to me. I
tied four of them together at both ends, as
well as I could. in the form of a raft, and
laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them, cro'sways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not
able to bear any great weight, the pieces
being too light.

So I went to work, and with the carpen- '

ter's saw I cut a spare topmost into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a
great deal of'labor and pains. But the
hope of furnishing myself with necessaries
encouraged rue to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another
occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear
any reasonable weight. My next care was
what to load it with, and how to presen'e
what I had laid upon it from the surf of
the sea: but I was not long considering
thia

I that laid all the planks or boards upon
it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I first got three
of the searneu's cheSIS, which I had broken
open and emptied,and lowered them down
upon my raft; the first of these I filled
with 1)I'U\'i<IOH<--\'iz., bread, ricc, three
Dutch che s, five pieces of dried goat's
flesh (which we lived much upon), and a
little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some {owls which we
brought to sea with us, but the fowls were
killed. There had been some barley and
wheat mgether; but, to my great rliSSap~
pointnreut,I found afterwards that the rats
had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors,
I found several cases of bottles belonging
to our skipper, in which were some cordial
wines; and, in all, about fire or six gallons

of arrack. TheseI stowed by themsulvas,
there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor- any room for them.

"'hile I was doing tire, I found the. tide
began to flow, though very calm; and I had

 

the rrlortification to see. my coat, shirt and
waistcoat, which I had left on the shore
upon the sand, swirn away. As for my
brooches, which were only linen, and open-
kueod, I swan: on board in them and my
stockings.

However, this put me upon rummaging
for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than what I wanted for pre-
sent use. for I had other things which my
eye was more upon ; as. first, tools to work
with on shore; and it was after long
searching that I found out the carpenter-'323'

chest, which was indeed a very useful prize
to me,and much more valuable than aship-
lading of gold would have been at that
time. I got it down to my raft, whole as
it was, without losing time to look into it,
for I knew in general what it contained.

 

"'3'"?

 

)Iv next care was for some ammunition
and arms. There were two feuding-pieces

in the cabin, and two pistols. These I
secured filst, with some powder-horns, and
two old, rusty swords. I knew there were
three barlels of powder in the ship and,
with much search,I found them; two of
them were dry' and good, and these I got
to my raft, with the arms.

And now I thought myself pretty well
erighted, and I began to think how I
should get to show with all my things,
having neither sail, oar, nor Iudder and
the least putt of wind would have overset
my raft. But the sea was calm, the tide
was setting towanl the shore, and what
little wind there was, blew in that direc-
tion. I found, however, two or three
broken cam, and with these I put to sea.

The raft. went very well; but I found
that the tide teak me some distance from

the point where I had landed before, '0?
which I perceived that there was an HI-
dI'aft of the water. This led Inc to think
that there might be a creek or river them;
and so I found them was.

I steered my raft toward it as well as I
could. At the month of the little clock I
came \eI_\ neaI suffering a second ship-

and nearly upset. I held all the things in

higher, it floated safely off. I landed at

lhigh tide, when the water covered the

bank, and when it receded, the raft was

. high and d ry.

I was, I yet knew not; whether on the
continent or an island; whether inhabited
or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not.

There was a hill not above a mile from
me, which lose up very steep and high,
and which Stunned to overtop some other
hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, north-
ward. I took out one of the fowling
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn
of powder; and thus armed, I traveled for
discovery up to the top of that hill. where.
after I had with great labor and ditliculty
got to the top, I saw my fate, to my great
affliction--vim, that I was in an island
environed every way with the sea no
land to be seen except some rocks, which
lay a great way off, and two small islands
less than this which lay about three
! leagues to the west.
 

 

I found also that the island I was in was Ac my coming back, I shot a! a great.

fowls of many sorts, making a confused
screaming and crying, every one according
to his usual note, but not one of them of
any kind that I knew. As for the creature
I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk, its
color and beak resembling it, but it had no
talons or claws nrore than common. Its
flesh was can-ion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came
back to my raft, and fell to work to bring
my cargo onshore, which took me all the
rest of the (lay. "'hat to do with myself
at night I knew not, nor indeed where to
rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast
might devour me, though, as I afterwards

 

found, there was really no need for those
fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded
myself round with the chests and boards
that I had brought on shore, and made a
kind of hat for that night's lodging. As
for food, I yet saw not which way to sup-

! ply myself, except that I had seen two or
5 three creatures, like hares, run out of the
I wood where I shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that Imight
yet get a great many things out of the
ship, which would be useful to me, and
particularly some of the rigging and. sails,
and such other things as might come to
land; and I resolved to make another v0)"
age on board the vessel, if lumible. And
as I knew that the first storm that blew
must necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things apart, till I
got everything out of the ship that I could
get. ThcuI called a council--that is to
say, in my thoughts--whether I should
take back the raft; but this appeared im-
practicable; so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down; and I did so,
only that I stripped before I went from my
hrrt, having nothing on but a chequered
shirt, a. pair of linen drawers, and a pair of
pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before. and.
prepared a second raft; and, having had
experience of the first, I neither made this
so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet
I brought away several things very useful
to me; as, first, in the carpenter's stores I
tound two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two
of lratchcls, and, above all, that most useful
thing called a grinds-tone
PA

All these I secured, together with seve-
ral things belonging to the gunner, palticu-
larly two or three 1ron crows, and two
barrels of nmsknt bullets, seven muskets.
and another fowling piece, with some small

 

quantity of powder more; a large hag-full '
of snmll shotand :1 great roll of sheetlead; l
but this last. was so heavy I could not
hoist it 11p to get, it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore.
top sail, a hannnock, and some brdding;
and with this I loaded my second raft, and
brought them all safe on shore, to my very .
'It emnfort. '
I was under some apprehension during
my absence from the land, that at least my
provisions might be devoured on Show;

:1

 

but when I came back, I found no Sign of '

any visitor; only there sat a creature like a

 

wild cat, upon one of the chests, which,

when I came towards it 11111 a": ' r. litt'l'
distance, and then stood still. She sat ':
composed and unconcerned. and looked fld.
in my face, as if she had a mind to be
acquainted with me. I presented my gun
to her, but, as she (lid not understand it,
she was perfectly uneonrernul at it, nor
did she otter to stir a '; upon which I
tossed her :1 bit of l1ise1n., though, by the
way, I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great; however, I spared her a bit,
I say, and she went. to it, smelled at it, and
ate it, and lmked (as pleased) for more;
but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she 111arehed ofi'.

Having got my second cargo on shore--
though I was obliged to open the barrels of
powder, and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heavy, being large tasks--I went
to work to make me a little tent, with the
sail, and some poles which I eat for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought
everything that I knew would spoil either
with rain or sun ' and I piled all the empty
chests and up in a cilelc round the
tent, to fortify r. from any sudden atte111pt,
either from man or beast.

When I had done this, I blacked up the

water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the
bread, and wrapped it. up, parcel by parcel,
in pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and,
in a word, I got all this on show also,
though at several times.

The next day I made another voyage, and
now, having plundered the ship of what
was portable, I cut up the cable. in pieces
that I could lift, and gathered all the iron
work that- I could more. I cut up the
yards and made a raft to take it all ashore,

I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring against wild beasts and savages, by build-ing a dwelling. and I ifsolved to make me
both a tent- and a cave, and I set about
finding a more healthy and suitable spot
than where I then was.

I consulted several things in my situa-
tion, which I found would be proper for
me: fiist, health and fresh water; Secondly,
shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly,
security from ravenous creatures. whether
man or beast; fourthly, a view to the sea,
that if God sent any ship in sight, I might
not lose an_\' advantage for my deliverance,
of which I was not. willing to banish my
expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I
found a little plain on the side of arising
hill, wlmse front towards this little plain

could come down upon me from the top.
0n the side of the rock there was a hoi'ow
place, worn a little wa ' in, like the en-
trance or door of a care;.bnt. there was
not, really any care, or way into the rock,
at all,

On the flat of the green, just below this
hollow place, I resolved to pitch my tent.
This plain wru not above a, hundred yards
I)road, and about twice as long, and lay
like a qzeeu before my door; and, at the

end of it. descended irregularly every way,
down into the low ground by the sea-side.

Before I set up my 3:" I drew a half-
cilele before the hollow puree, and in this
half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the gmund till
they stood very firm, the biggest end being
out. of the ground above five feet and a

) half, and sharpened on the top. The two
l'mws did not stand above six inches from
one anotaer.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I
had cut in the ship, and laid them in rows,
upon one another, within the rim-lo, be
tween these two rows of stakes up to the

top, placing other st:
leaning against. them, about two feet and a

fence was so strong, that neither man nor

h'om it. leaning to the rock, and thatched I
or covered it with honghs of trees, and
such things as I could get to keep out the
min, whiehI found at some times of the
year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought
all my goods into this pale, and into this
care which I had made behind me. ButI
must observe, too, that at first this was a
confused heap of goods, which, as they lay
in no onler, so they took up all my place.
I had no room to turn myself; so I set my
self to enlarge my care, and worked far-
ther into the earth, for it was a loose,
sandy lock, which yielded easily to the
labor I bestowed on it; and so when I
found I was pretty safe as to beasts of
prey, I worked sideways, to tha right
hand, into the rock; and then turning to
the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out on the oub
side of my pale or fortification.

And now I began to apply myself to'
make such necessary things as I found I
most wanted, particularly a chair and a
table; for without these I was not able to
enjoy the few comforts I had in the world.
I could not write, or eat, or do several
things with so much pleasure without a
table.

I had never handled a tool in my life;
and yet, in time, by labor, application, and
contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted
nothing but I could have made it, espe-
cially if I had had the tools. However, I
made abundance of things, even without
tools; and some with no mole tools than
an adze and a hatchet, which, perhaps,
were never made that way befoxe, and that
nth infinite labor. For example, if I'

 

 

 

wanted a board, I had no other way but to
out (Iowa a tree, set it on an edge before
me, and how it flat on either side with my
axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dul) it smooth with my
adze. It is true, by this method I could
make but one board out of a whole tree;
but this I had no iemedy for but patience.

I'Iowerer,I made me a table and a chair,
in the fixst place; and this I did out of the
short pieces of boards that I brought on
my raft from the ship. But when I had
wrought out some boards as above, I made
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and
an half, one over another, all along one
side of my care, to lay all my tools, nails
and iron-work on; and, in a word, to sepa-
rate everything at large into their places
that I might come easily at them; also I
knocked pieces into the wall of the rock,
to hang my guns and all things that would
hang up; so that had my care been to he38

 

 

seen, it looked like a general magazine of
all nccmary things; and I had everything
so mady at my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order.

  

As long as my ink
lasted I kept a jourv
nal of all that happened to me, of which I
will now give a part, for much that I wrote
at that time I have aheady told, and need
not repeat.

 

September 30, 1659.---I, poor, miserable
Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, dur-
ing a dleadful storm, in the oiling, came on
shore on this dismal, unfoxtunate island,
which I called "The Island of Dcspair;"
all the lost of the ship's company being
drowned, and myself almost (lead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afilicb
ing myself at the dismal circumstances I
was blought to; \'i'/.,I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to;
and, in despair of any iclicf, saw nothing
but death before me: either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, or perish by
starvation.

and was no more to be seen, except the
wreck of her, and that only at low water.
I spent this day in covering and securing
the goods which I saved, that the rain
might not spoil them.

Oct. '26.--1 walked about the shore
almost all day, to find out a place to fix
my habitation, greatly concerned to secure
myself from any attack in the night, either
from wild beasts or men. Towards night
I fixed upon a proper place, under a lock,
and marked out a semicircle for my cu-
campment, which Iiesolved to strengthen
with a work, wall, or fortification, made of
double piles, lined within with cables, and
without with turf.

From the 26th to the 80th, I worked
very hard in carrying all my goods to my
new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceeding haul.

Nov. 1,--On this day I made a strict
division of my timc,fixing the houls which
I would devote to my several duties, via:
every morning, to walk out with my gun
for two or three hauls, if it did not min;
then to employ myself to work till about
eleven o'clock: then to eat what I had to
live on; then to lie down and sleep, the
weather being very hot; then to work
again. The working pad of this day was
wholly employed in making my table.

' NW. 17.--This day I began to dig behind

my tent into the rock, to make mom for
my further conveniency.

Nola--Three things I wanted exceed-
ingly for this work, viz, .u, pickaxe, a
shovel, and a wheelban-ow, or basket; soI
desisted from my work, and began to con~
eider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I
made use of the iron news, which went
proper enough, though heavy; and the
next thing was a shovel, or spade. This was
so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I
could do nothing effectually without it; but
what kind of one to make I knew not

.Nou. 18.--The next day, in semehiug
the woods, I found a tree of that wood,
or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call
the iron-tree, for its exceeding haidness ; of
this, with gicat labor, and almost spoiling
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home,
with dilficulty enough, for it was exceed-
ingly heavy. The excessive hardness of
the wood, and having no other way, made
me a. long while upon this machine, for I

   

worked it by little and little into the form
of a shovel or spade; the handle exactly
shaped like cans in England, only that the
board part having no iron shod upon it at

I was still deficient, for I wanted a
basket, or a wheelbarrow. A basket I
could not make by any means, having no
gsuch things as twigs that would bend to
i make wicker-ware--at least, none yet found
out; and as to the wheelbarmw, I fancied
I could make all but the wheel: but that
I lmd no notion of; neither did I know
{how to go about it; besides, I had no
poyible way to make imn gudgeons for ihe
spindle or axis of the wheel to run in; so

This was not so difficult to me as the

I seldom failed, and very seldom failed

ROBINSON CR USOE.

 

And now, in the managing my household
attairs, I found myself wanting in runny
things, which I thought. at first it was im-
possible for me to make; as, indeed, as to
some of them it was: for instance, I could
never rrrake a cask to be hooped. I had a

small runlet or two, as I observed before;
but I could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it; [could never put. in the

 

heads, nor join the staves so true to one an-
other as to make them hold water; so I gave
that also over.

In the next place, I was at a. great loss
for candles; so that as soon as it was dark,

 

which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I remembered
the lump of bees'-\va.\' with which I made
candles in my African adventure; butI had
none of that. now. Tire only remedy I had
was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved
the tallow, and with a little dish made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I
added a wick of some oakum, I made nu-
a lamp; and this gave me light, though not
a clear, steady light like a candle.

In the middle of all my labors, it hap-
pened that, rummaging my things, I found
a little bag, which had been filled with corn
for the feeding of poultry. \Vlrat little re-
mainder of corn had been in the bag was
all devourcd by the rats and I saw nothing
in the'lmg but husks and (lust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use,
I shook the husks of corn out of it on one
side of my fortification, under the rock.

It was a little before the great rains just

i now mentioned, that I threw this stuff away,

taking no notice of anything, and not so
much as remcmlmring' that. I lnrd thrown any-
thing there, when, about a month after, I
saw some few stalks of something green
shooting upon the ground, which I fancied

' mightbe some plant I had not seen. But I
was surprised when, after a little longer

time, I suv about ten or twelve cars come
out, which were perfect green barley, of
the same kind as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonish-
ment. and confusion of my thoughts on this
occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no re
ligious foundation at, all; indeed, I had
very few notions of religion in my head,
nor had entertained any sense of anything
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a
43

 

chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God, without so ruuch as inquiring into the
end of Providence in these things. But
after I saw barley grow there in a climate
which I knew was not proper for com, and
especially that I knew not how it came

there, it startled Inc strangely, and I began .

to suggest that. God had miraculously caused
this grain to grow without any help of seed
sown.

This touched my heart a. little, and
brought tears out of my eyes, and I began
to hlea myself that such a. prodigy of
Nature should happen upon my account;
and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still, all along hy the
side of the rock, straggling stalks of rice,
and which I knew, because I had seen it
grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn,
you may he sure, in their season, which
was about the end of June; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all
again, hoping in time to have sufiicient to
supply me with bread. But it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow
myself the least grain of this corn to eat,
and even then hut sparingly; for I lost all
that I sowed the first season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it
just lxefore the dry season, so that it never
came up at all.

Besides this barley, there were twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved
with the same care, and whose use was of
the same kind, or to the same purpose,
viz, to make me bread, or rather food;
for I found ways to cook it up without
hnking, though I did that also after some
time.

But to return to my Journal :--

AIn-r'116.--I finished the ladder; so I
went up the ladder to the top, and then
pulled it up after me, and let it down on
the inside. This was a complete enclosure
to me; for within I had room enough. and
nothing could come at me from without,
unless it could first mount my wall.

 

The very next day after this wall was
finished, I had almost had all my labor
overthrown at once, and myself killed.
The case was thus :--As I was busy in the
inside of it, behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightened with a most dreadful surpris-
ing thing indeed; for, all on a sudden, I
found the earth came tumblingr down from
the roof of my care, aud from the edge of
the hill over my head,aud two of the posts
I had set up in the cave cracked in a flight
ful manner. I was heartily scared; and for
fear I should be. buried in it, I ran fonvanl
to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe
there neither,I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill, which I expected
might roll down upon rue. I was no sooner
stepped down upon the firm ground, than
- I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake:M

for we ground I stood on shook three
times, with such shocks as would have
overturned the strongest building that
could be supposed to have stood upon the
earth; and a great piece of the top of the
rock, which stood about half a mile from
me, next the sea, fell down with such a

hurricane of wind. The sea was lashed to
foam; and trees were torn up by the roots,
and, in short, it was a dreadful sun-m.

In about three horns the wind abated,
but the rain continued all nightand all the
next day. As there wen: no more shocks,

I perceived also the very sea was put fear that it would {all upon me.

chopping and cutting knotty hard wood,
they were all full of notches and dull;

when I came to it, I found a small barrel,
and two or three pieces of the wreck of the
ship, which were driven on shore bythe
late hurricane: and looking towards the
wreck,I thought it seemed to lie higher
out of the water than it rrsed to do. I
examined the barrel which was driven
on shore, and soon found that it was a bar-
rel of gunpowder; but it had taken water,
and the powder was caked as hard as a
stone; however, I rolled it farther on
shore for the present, and went on to look
for more.

When I came to the ship,I found that
the earthquake or the hurricane had cast it
so close to the shore that I could walk
quite to it at low water. The wreck was
also much broken up, and many things
were washed ashore.

This wholly diverted my thought: from
moving my lrabitatiou,aud I busicd myself
mightily to make my way into the ship,
which I found was filled with sand. This
I could not do, but I rwlved to pull her

brought them on shore also with the tide.

the crow made way into the body of the
wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break
them up. I felt also a roll of English
lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy
to move.

May 10, 11, 12, 13, l4.-- Vent- every
day to the wuwk; and got a good deal of
pieces of timbex, and boards, or planks, and
two or three hundredweight of iron.

May 15.--I carried two hatchets, to try
if I could not cut a. piece off the mil of
lead, but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to
drive the hatchet.

M53] 16.--It had blown hard in the
night, and the wreck appeared more broken
by the force of the water; but I stayed so
long in the woods, to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me going to the
wreck.

I continued this work every day to the
15th of June, except the time necessary to
get food, which I always appointed, during
this part of my employment, to be when
the tide was up, that I might be ready
when it was ebhed out; and by this time
I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-
work enough to have built a good boat, if
I had known how; and also I got, at seve-
ral times, and in several pieces, near one
hundredweight of the sheetlead.

June 16.--Going down to the sea-side, I
found a large tortoise, or turtle. This was

the first I had seen, which, it seems, was
only my misfortune; for had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every
day.

June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. I
found in her threescorc eggs; and her flesh
was to me, at that time. the most savory
and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life,
having had no flesh, but of goats and
fowls, since I landed in this horrzblo place.

l was now overjoyed to find. I took it to
my table and read from it a long time, and
having taken a dose of tobacco steeped in
rum, I went to bed.

The next; day I had the fever, but not so
bad, and J uly 3d I missed it for good and
all. I was, however, so weak for many
days that I could do but little more than
sit at the mouth of my care and try lo_

It was the 15th of July that I began to?
take a more particular aurve ' of the island
itself. I went up the creek first, where, as
I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I
found, after I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not float airy higher; and
that it was no more than a little brook.
On its banks were many meadows covered
with grass, and on the higher paflsIforind I
tobacco growing. There were many other
plants that I had never seen before. I

On the next. day I went farther the same
way, and, much to my jo_v, found melons
upon the ground in great abundance, and'
grapes hanging in great clusters from the.
branches of the trees I staid there all i
that night, sleeping in a tree as when I

first; landed. In the morning, I traveled on 1 .

some four miles farther. Here I found a '
delicious valley, where everything appeared
so fresh and green that it; looked like a
planted garden. I'Iere were orange, lemon,
lime and cocoa trees, but few of them bore
fruit. I gathered some. green limes, and,
mixed with water, I found their juice very
refreshing. I resolved to lay up a store of
all for the wet. season.

In order to do this,I gathered a great
heap of grapes in one place, a laser heap
in another place, and a great parcel of

 

limes and lemons in another place; and
taking a few of each with me. I traveled
home, but before I got thither, the grapes
were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken
them and bruised thenr,the.v were good for
little or nothing. As to the limes, they were
good, but I could bring but a few.

 

The next day I went back, having made
me two small bags to bring home my har-
' m; but I was surprised, when, coming to
my heap of grapes, I found them all spread
abroad, trodden to pieces, and dragged
about, some here, some there, and abund-
ance eaten and devoured. By this I con.
cluded there were some wild creatures
thereabouts, which had done this; but;
what they were I knew not. However, I
tool: another course: for I gathered a largequantity of the grapes, and hungr them
upon the out branches of the trees, that
they might cure and dry in the sun; and
as for the limos and lemons,I carried as
many back as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I I

equally safe as where now I was situate, if
possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of
the isiaud.

This thought ran long in my head, and
I was exceedingly fond of it for some time,
the pleasantness of the place tempting me;

contemplated with great pleasure the fruit- but when I came to a nearer view of it, I
fllllle:\SS of that valley, and the pleasautuess considered that I was now by the sea-side,

of the situation; the security from storm
on that side of the water, and the wood;
and concluded that. I had pitched upon a
place to fix my abode, which was by far
the wont part. of the country. Upon the
whele,I began to consider of removing my
habitation. and to look out for a place

 

where it was at least possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage,-
aud that the same ill fate that brought
me hither, might bring some other Im-
happy wretches to the same place ; and to
enclose myself among the hills and woods
in the centre of the island, was to ant-ici-
pate my bondage, and to render such an
affair not only improbable, but impoxiible;
and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove.

However, I was so enamored with
this place, that I spent. much of my time
there for the whole mnaiuiug part of the
month of July; and though, upon secom'
thoughts I resolved as above not to lemove,
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and
surlounded it at a distance with a strong
fence, being a double hedge, as high as I
could reach, well staked, and tilled between
with hrnshwood ; and here I lay very
secure, sometimes two or three nights to
gether, always going over it. with a ladder
as before; so thatI fancied now I had my
country house and my at. east house.

The 3rd of Augustfl found the grapes I
had hung up were perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins of the
sun ; so I began to take them down from the
trees, and it was ve happy that. I did st.
for the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I had lost the better part52

of my winter's food; for I had above two
hundred large bunches of them. No sooner
had I taken them all down. and carried
most of them home to mycavc, butit began
to rain; and it rained, more or less, every
day, till the middle of October, and some.-
liincs so violently, that I could not stir out
of my cave for several days.

In this season I was lunch surprised with
the increase of my family. I had been con-
cerned for the loss of one of my cats, who
ran away from me. and I heaml no more
tidings of her, till, to myastouishment, she
came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. Iafterwanl came to be so
pestered with cats, that I was forced to
kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and
to drive them from my house as much as
possible.

judgment upon me, and praying to him to

. and having not tasted the least mfieshnu-nt

for twelve hours, even till the going down
of the sun, I then ate a biscuit-cake and a
bunch of grapes, and wont to bed, finishing
the day as I began it. I now set olI every
seventh day as the Sabbath day.

My ink gave out about this time, and I
gave up my journal. After a time I learned
how to divide the rainy season from the
dry season, but at first the lack of this
knowledge came near costing me dear, for
I sowed my grain before the dry season.
and not a stalk came up. Fortunately I
had not sown it all, and I sowed the few
grains left before the rainy season and it
grew very well, though it was several years
before I had enough to make a crop.

AftcrI had found, by experience, the ill
consequences of being abroad in the rain,
Itonk care to furnish myself with provi
sions before hand, ti at I might not be
obliged to go out, and I sat within doom
as much as possible during the wet months
 

In this time I found much employment,
and very suitable also to the time, for I
found great occasion of many things which
I had no way to furnish myself with hut.
by haul labor and constant application;
particularly, I had tried many ways to
make myself a basket, but all the twigs I
could get for the purpose proved so brittle
that they would do nothing.

It came into my mind that the twigs of
that tree from whence I cut my stakes that
glew might possibly be as tough as the
sallou's, willows, aml osiers in England,
and I resolved to try. Accmdingly, the

next day I went to my c<ailitl'_\'-liouse, as I
called it, :md cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose asmuch
as I could desire. During the next season,
I employed myself in making, as well as
I could. a gloat many haskets, both to

 

carry earth or lay up anything, as I had
occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them suffi-
ciently Servicahle for my purpose; and
thus, afterwards, I took cam never to he
without them; and as my wicke'ware
decayed, I made more, especially strong,
deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to have any
quantity of it.

I now resolved to travel quite across to
the other side of the island, so, taking a
hatchet with my gun and dog, and a. larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual,
and putting a great bunch of raisins and
two biscuit cakes in my pouch, I began

As soon as I came to the seashom, I was
surprised to see that I had taken up my
lot; on the wonst side of the island, for
here, indeed, the shore was covered with
innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other
side. I had found but tluee in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number
of fowls of many kinds, some of which I
had not seen before, and many of them
very good meat, but such as I knew not
the names of, except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased,
but was very sparing of my powder and
shot, and therefore had more mind to kill
a she-gmat, if I could, which I could better
feed on; and though then: were many
goats here, more than on the other side of
the island, yet it was with much more
difliculty that I could come near them.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I did, after some painstak- much pleasanter than mine; but yet I had

not the least inclination to nemove, for, as
I was fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I seemed all the while
Iwas here to be as it wen: upon a jour-
ney, and from home. However, I trav-
eled along the shone of the sea. towards
the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and
then setting up a gieat pole upon the show
for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again.

I took another way going home, and
became bewildele and lost, so that I had
to go back to my post and start again. In
this journey, my dog surprised a kid, which
I caught and led by a string till I came to
my bower, where I left him, securely tied.
I cannot express my satisfaction when]
came to what I called my home and threw
myself in my hammock. I had been gone
a mouth, and it all appealed so comfortable
that I resolved n' ' ~ to leave it for so long
a time again, while I remained on the
island. _

It. was now that I began sensibly to feel
how much more happy the life I now led
was, with all its miserable circumstances,
than the wicked, abominable life I led all
the past part of my days; and now having
changed both my sorrows and my joys;
my very desires altered, and my delights
were perfectly new from what they were
at fiist coming.

Before, as I walked about, either on my
hunting, or for Viewingr the country, the
anguish of my soul at, my condition would
break out upon me on a sudden, and my

of losing it all again by enemies of several
sorts, which it was scarcely possible to keep
fmm it ' as, first the goats, and wild crea>>
tures which I called hares which, tasting
the sweetueqq of the blade, eat it so close
that it could get no time to shoot up into
stalk.

This I saw no remedy for, but making
an inclosure about it with a hedge, which 1
did wi:h a great deal of toil, and the more,
because it mquired a great deal of speed;
the creatuws daily spoiling my corn. How-
ever, as my arable Land was but small,
suited to my crop, I got it totali/ well

shooting some of the creatures in the day

tying him up to a stake at the gate. when:
he would stand and bark all inglit long: so
in a little time the enemies folsook the
place, and the corn grew very strong and
well.

But now I had even greater trouble to
keep the birds {mm eating all of the
ripening grain. I finally shot three of
them, and hang them up as mareerows.
This had the ell'ect I desired, and kept the
birds away. In the latter cud of Decem-
ber I reaped my corn.

I was sadly put- to it for a scythe or

was to make. one, as well as I could, out of

However, as the sun baked these two out after I had done with it, I found a
very dry and haul, I lifted them very hmken piece of one of my eartheuwzue ves-
gentlv up, and set them down again in two sels in the fire. burnt as hard as a stone.60

and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised
to see it, and said to myself that certainly
they might be made to burn whole, if they
would burn broken.

This set. me to study how to order my
fire so as to make it burn me some pots. I
had no notion of a kiln, such as the pottezs
burn in, or of glazing them with lead,
though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkius, two or three

 

pots, in a pile, one upon aunther,aud placed
my firewood all round it, with a heap of
embers under them. I plied the fire with
fresh fuel round the outside and upon the
top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did
not clack at all; when I saw them clear
red,I let them stand in that heat about
five or 5' hours, till I found one of them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run;
for the sand which was mixed with the
clay melted with the violence of the heat,
and would have run into glass it I had
gone on. So I siacked my fire gradually till
the pots began to abate of the red color,
and watching them all night~ that I might

not; let. the fire abate too fast, in the monr
ing I had three very good (I will not say
handsome) pipkins, and two other earthen
pots, as hard burnt as could be desired. and
one them perfectly glazed with the running
of the sand

After this experiment, I wanted no sort.
of earthenware for my use; but I must.
needs say as to the shapes of them they
were very indifferent, as any' one may sup-
pose, when I had no way of making them,
but as the children make dirt pies, or as a

i woman would make pies that never learned
l to raise paste.

I now thought to dig out a stone, and
make myself a mortar; but, after searching
a long while I could find no stone hard
enough,as all the rocks on the island were
soft and crumbling. I got instead a gleat
block of hard wood, and with much labor
I rounded the outside, and then, with the
help of fire, made a hollow place in it, as
the Indians in Brazil make their canoes.
Then I made a heavy pestle of iron-wood,
and laid them both by till I had my next
crop of corn to grind or pound into flour.
With some muslin taken from the ship,I
made some very good sieves.

The baking part was the next thing to
he considered, but I managed this also.
I made some hollow earthen vessels, which
served as hearths. In there I built hot
files. Then, rakingr the ashes and ember-
otf clean, I put. in my loaves and covered
them with earthen jam

All the while these thinSS weie doing,
you may be sure my thoughts ran many
times upon the land which I had seen
from the other side of the island; and I
was not without secret wishes that. I was
 

on shore there, fancying that I might find
some way or other to convey myself far.
ther, and perhaps at last find some means
of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance
for the dangers of such a condition, and
how I might fall into the hands of sav-
ages, and perhaps such as I might have
reason to think far worse than the lions
and tigers of Africa; that if I once came
into their power I should run a hazard of
being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard that the people of the
Caribbean coasts were Cannibals, or men-
eaters, and I knew by the latitude, that I
could not be far off from that shore. All
these thingS, I say, which I ought. to have
considered well of, and I (lid cast up in
my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none
of my apprehensions at first, and my head
ran mightily upon the thought of getting
over to that shore.

Now, I wished for my boy Xury and
the long-boat, with the shoulderof-iuutton
sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa; but this was
in vain. 'I'heu I thought I would go and
look at our ship's boat, which was blown
up upon the shore a great way, in the
storm, when we were first cast away. She
lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite, and was turned, by the force of the
wares and the winds, almost bottom up-
ward, against the high ridge of rough
sand, but no water about her as before.

If I had had hands to have refitted her,
and to have launched her into the water,
the boat would have done well enough,
Mud I might have gone back into the
rhmzils with her easily enough; but I

 

 

might have easily foreseen that I could no
more turn her and set her upright upon
her bottom, than I could remove the
island; however, I went to the wood, and
cat lovers and rollers, and brought them to
the boat, resolved to try what I could do.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece
of fruitless toil, and spent, 1 think, three
or four weeks about it; at last, finding it
inrposible to heave it up with my little>>
strength, I fell to digging away the sand,
to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to thrust
and guide it right in the fall.

But. I was unablo to stir it, or to getunder it, much less to move it. forward to-
wards the water; so I was forced to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the
hopes of the boat, my desire to vt-nttue
over for the mainland increased.

only thought possible, but easy, and pleased
myself extremely with my thoughts of
making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the NegIoes
or Indians; but. not at all considering the
particular inconveniences which I la)r
under more than the Indians did, viz,
want of hands to move it into the water
when it was made.

, I went to work upon this boat the most
like a fool that. ever man did, who had any
of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it;
not but that the ditliculty of launching my
boat came often into my head; but I put
a stop to my inquiries into it, by this
foolish answer which I gave myself: "Let
me that make it; I warrant I shall find
some way to get it along when it: is done."

This was a most pIeposteI-ous method;
but the eagerness of my fancy prevailed,
and to work I went, and felled a cedar-

with my axe and hatchet. Afterthis, it
cost me a month to shape it to something
like the bottom of a boat. It cost me
near t-lnee months more to clear the inside,
and work it out so as to make an exact
boat of it. This I did, indeed, without the,
by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint
of hand labor, till I had brought it to be a
very handsome perhglln, and big enough
to have carried six-and-twenty men.

"'hen I had gone through this work, I
was extremely delighted with it. The
boat was really much bigger than ever I
saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of
one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke
it had cost, you may be sure--for there
remained nothing but to get it into the
water; and had I gotten it into the water,

for that was calm enough, but of starving
from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tor-

had a great jar of fresh water, that is to
say, one of my eanhen pots; but what
was all this to being driven into the vast
ocean, where, to be sure, there was no
shore, no mainland or island, for a thous-
and miles at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the
providence of God to make the most mis-
erable condition that mankind could be in
worse. Now I looked back upon my deso-
late, solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world, and ad the happinesu
my heart could wish for was to be there

with eager wishes. "0 happy desert!"
said I, "I shall never see thee more. 0
miserable creature! whither am I going 2"

I still worked hard to get my boat out

sprang up from the S. S. E,which cheered
my heart a little, and especially when in
about half an hom more, it blew a pretty
small,g "entle gale. By this time,I had

I and should never have known how to have
{steered towards the island, if I had but
'ouce lost sight. of it. But the weather
continuing clear, I applied myself to get
up my mast again, and spread my sail,
standing away to the north as much as
possible, to get out of the current.

I made such good headway that I soon
found an eddy which carried me about a
league on my way back. The wind eon-
tinuing fair, I continued to near the island
and soon got. to land. When I was on
shore, I fell on my knees and gave God
thanks for my deliverance. After which, I
drew my boat into a little cove under some
trees and laid me down to sleep, being
quite spent with the fatigue of the voyage,
which I resolved not to repeat.

I was now at a great log which way to
get home with my boat. I had run so much
hazard, and know too much of the case, to
think of attempting it by the way I went
out; and what might be at the other side I
knew not, nor had I any mind to run any
more ventures. So I resolved, on the next
morning, to make my way westward along
the shore, and to see if there was no creek
where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
so as to have her again, if I wanted her.
In about three miles, coasting the shore. I
came to a very good inlet or bay, about a
mile over, which narrowed till it came to a
very little rivalet or brook, where I found
a ver conv cnient harbor for mv boat.

along with me

I had now enough of rambling to sea for

some time, and enough to do for many days
to sit still and ;eflect upon the danger I

 

had been in. I would have been very glad
to have had my boat again on nry side of
the island ; but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about. As to the east
side of the island, which I had gone round,
I knew well enough there was no ventur-
ing that way; my very heart: would shrink
and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it ; and as to the other side of the
island, I knew there was a current- there
quite as dangerous.

{began to think now what. I should do
for goat's flesh when my powder should be
all gone. To make provision for this, I set
traps, and caught some young kids, which
I turned, keeping them in alarge enclosure,
securely fenced about. It would have

attended by my sen'ants! Poll, as if he
had been my favourite, was the only per~
sou permitted to talk to me; my dog. who
was now grown very old and crazy, sat
always at my right hand; and two cars,
one on one side the table, and one on the
other, expecting now aml then a, bit from
my hand, as a mark of special favor.

I wanted the use of my boat very much,
but I was very loth to run any more risk
at; sea. One day I resolved to go by land
to the little hill on the other side where I
had observed how the shore lay and the
current, set, and so I started, following the
edge of the shore. IIarl any of the people
of England met me at that time, I should
either have frightened them or raised a
great deal of laughter.

I had a great, high shapelefi cap, made
of goat's skin, with a flap hanging down
behind, as well to keep the sun from me as
to shoot the rain ofl' from running into my
neck; nothing being so hurtful in these
climates as the min upon the flesh under
the clothes.

I had ashort jacket: of goat's skin, the
skirts coming down to about the middle
of the thighs, and a pair of open-knced
breaches of the same. The breaches were
made of the skin of an old lie-goat, whose
hair hung down such a length on either

and in ii kind of a frog on either side of
this, instead of :sword and dagger, hung
a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side,
one on the other. I had another belt not
so broad, and fastened in the same manner,
which hung over my shoulder; and at the
end of it, under my left arm, hung lwo
pouches, both nmde of goat's skin too, in
one of which hung my powder, in the
other my shat. At my back I carried my

most necessary thing I had about me next
to my gun.

When I reached the hill, I found the sea
quite still, which eonvinmd me that the
current was formed by the ebb and flow
of the tide. Still I resolved to leave illo
boat for use on that side of the island,and
to make me another host: to use on my
home side.

It happened one day, about noon, going
towards my boat, I was exceedingly sur-
prised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be
seen on the sand. I stood like one thun-
der-struck, or as if I had seen an appar<

cables, and everything I could think
of to make it strong, having in it seven
little. holes, about as big as I might put
finy arm out at. In the inside of this, I
thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
continually bringing earth out- of my care,
and laying it at the foot of the wall, and
walking upon it; and through the seven
' holes I contrived to plant the muskets like
caunon,so Icoahl fire all the seven guns in
two minutes' time. This wall I was many
a weary month in finishing, and yet never
thought myself safe till it was done.
Then I planted the ground without as

"'hile I was doing this I. thought much of
the safety of my goals ; so I made astrong
 

enclosure in a retired part of the island,
and removed to it ten she-goats and two
hegoats and left them there.

One day as I wandered more to the west
part of the island, beirrgorr a lrill,I thought
I saw a boat far out at sea, but. I was not;
sure. Orr coming down from the hill, I
was confounded and amazed to see the
shore spread with skulls and other bones of
human bodies. There was a place where
a lire had been made, and a circle dug in
the earth, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their inhuman
feast \Vlrerr I recovered fnrm rrry horror
at such a sight, I began to thank God that
I was cast ashore upon a part of the island
that was not visited by the cannibals.

In this frame of tlrarrkfulrress, I went
home to rrry castle, and began to be much
easier now, as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever 1 was before: for I
observed that these wretclres never came to
this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or
not expecting, anything here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the covered,
woody part of it, without finding anything
to their purpose. I knew I had been here
now almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of human creature there
before; and I might be eighteen years
more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
I did not discover rrryself to them, which I
had no manner of occasion to do; it lrcirrg

concealed where I was, unless I found a

after this. \I'lrerr I say rrry own circle, I

breaded upon, in my thoughts, for the 1 ing to the top of the hill, which was frommy castle, as I called it,
about three miles or

more, to see if I could

observe any hunts upon the sea, canning near

the island, or standing over towards it; but

I began to tire of this hard duty, after I

had for two or three months constantly

kept my watch, but came always back

without any discovery.

I began to think, too, that it was not
for me to judge these wretches, and for a
year, I gave up watching for them. This
I did, however: I removed my boat and
hid it securely on the east end of the
island, and I kept myself more retired
than ever.

I believe the reader of this will not
think it strange if I confess these anxie-
ties, these constant fears I lived in, and
the concern that was now upon me, put
an end to all invention, and to all the
oontrivances that I had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon
hands than that of my food. I cared not
to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood
now, for fear the noise I should make
should be heard; much less would I fire
a gun for the same reason; and, above all,
I was intolerably uneasy at making any
fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at
a great distance in the day, should betray
me. For this reason, I removed that part!

I was so filled with indignation at this
sight, that I began to ponder how I could

them, and if they had come, I should cer-
tainly have attacked them. But more than

meantime, an event happened
intensely excited me.
There had been a storm of wind all day,

with a great deal of lightning and thunder, .

and a very foul night it was after it. As
I was heading in the Bible, and taken up
with very serious thoughts about my pres-
ent condition. I was surprised with the
noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea.
This was, to he sure, a surprise of a differ-
ent nature from any I had met before; for
the notions this put into my thoughts were
of another kind. I started up in the
greatest haste, and, in a trice, clapped my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and
pulled it after me; and, mounting it the

the sound, knew that it was from that part
' of the sea where I was dr'w en out with the

current, in my boat. I manodiately con'
sidered that this must be some ship in dis-
tless. I had the presence of mind, at that
minute, to think, that though I could not
help them, it might be they might help
me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, and, making a
good, handsome pile, I set it on fire upon
the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed
fleely; and though the wind blew very
hard, yet it burned fairly out, so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as
a ship, they must need see it, and no doubt
they did; for as soon as my fire blazed up,

I heard another and then several

In the morning I saw to my great sor-

meats, so fastened on the top that the salt
water had not hurt them. I found some
very good shirts, which were very welcome

suppose they mightall weigh near a pound.

Upon the whole, I got very little bythis
voyage that was of any use to me; for as
to the money, I had no manner of occasion
for it; for it was to me as the dirt under
my feet, and I would have given it all for
three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly
wanted. ,I had, indeed, got two pails of
shoes now, which I took off the feet of the
two drowned men whom I saw in the
wreck, and I found two pairs more in one
of the chests, which were very welcome to
me. I found in

fetched it.

After this event, I lived easy enough for
near two yams, but I thought constantly
of how I should get away from the island.
One night I dreamed that. one of the \'ic-
thus of the cannibals ran away from them
and came to me. "Now," thought I, in
my dream, "I may venture to the main
land, for this savage will be my pilot."
After this dream, I watched every day for
the cannibals, determined to capture one of
their victims.

I had watched thus for a'uouta yea! and
a half. when I saw one morning no less
than five canoes on shore, and there were
about thirty of the savag 'lancing around
a fire. While I looked, I saw two miseu
ahlc wretches dragged from the boats.
One was knocked down immediately and
cut up for their cookery, while the other
was left standing by himself till they
would be ready for him.

This poor wretch, seeing himself a little
at libelty, and unbound, started away from
them. and ran with incredible swiftuessalong the sands, directly towands me. I
was dreadfully frightened, when I perceived
him run my way; and especially when, as
I thought,I saw him plusucd by the whole
body. However, my spirits lx'gau to ne-
co'.'er when I found that: there was not
above three men that followed him: and
still more was I encouraged, when I found
that. he outstripped them exceedingly in
running.

There was between them and my castle,
the creek; but he made nothing of it, but,
plunging,y in, swam thmugh in about. thirty
smokes, landed, and ran with exceeding
strength and swiftness. \Vheu the three
pensons came to the creek.l found that two
of them could swim, but the third went no
farther, and soon after went softly hack
again. It came very warmly upon my
thoughts that now was the time to get me
a sen'ant, and perhaps a. companion. I
inunediately ran down the ladder, fetched
my two guns, and getting up again with
the same haste to the top of the hill,I
crossed towards the sea; and having a
very short cut, and all down hill, clap'd

him that. fled, who, looking back, was at
fiist perhaps as much frightened at: me as
at them. But I beckoned with my hand to
him to come back; and, in the mean time,
rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my
piece. I was lath to fire, because I would
not have the nest hear. Having knocked

: _ this fellow down, the other stopped, as if

he had been frightened, and I advanced
towards him. But as I came nearer, I per-
ceived he had a bow and anew, and was
fitting it to shoot at me: so I was then
obliged to shoot at him first, which I did,
and killed him at the that shot. The poor
savage who tied, but had stoppednras so
frightened with the fire and noise of my
piece that he stood stock still. I hallooed
again to him, and made signs to come fon

would be my slave forever

But there was more work to do. The
savage that I had knocked down began to
come to himself, and sat up on the ground.
My savage motioned for me to give him my
sword, and when I gave it to him he ran
quickly and cut. oil' his head at asingie
stroke. 'When he had done this, he comes
laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again. But that
which astonished him most, was to know
how I killed the other Iudinli so far off.
"'hcu he came to him, he stood like one
amazed, looking at him, turning him first
on one side, then on the other. He took
up his bow and arrows and came back; so
I turned to go away, and beckoned him to
follow me.

Upon this he made signs to me that he
should bury them with sand, that they
might not be seen by the rest, if they fol-
lowed; and so I made signs to him again

to do so. He fell to work; and in an in-
stant. he had scraped a hole in the sand
with his hands, big enough to bury the
first in, and then (hugged him into it, and
covered him; and did so by the (Cher also.
Then calling him away, I carried him, not
to my castle, but quite away to my care,
on the {author part of the island. Here i
gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to
rat, and n draught. of water, which I forind'
he was indeed in great distress for, and
having refreshed him, I made signs for
him to go and lie down to sleep, so the
poor cmnturc lay down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, with
stmight, strong limbs, tall and wellshaped;
and, as I reckon, about twenty-six yems of
age. He had a very good countenance, not
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to
have something very manly in his face.
His hair was long and black, not curled
like wool; his forehead very high and
large; and a. great vivaeity and sparkling
sharpness in his eyes. The color of his
skin was not quite black, but very tawny.
His face was round and plump; his nose
small, not flat like the Negroes; a very
good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth
well set, and as white as ivory. After he
had slept about half an hour, he awoke and
came out of the cave to me: forI had been
milking my goats. \Vheu he espied me he
came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the ground, with all the pos-
sible signs of an humble, thankful disposi-
tion, making a great many antic gestures
to show it. At last he lays his head flat
upon the ground, close to my foot, and
sets my other foot upon his head, as he had
done before.

I let him know that. I understood him
and was very well pleased. In a, little
time I began to speak to him, and teach
him to speak to me; and, first,I let. him
know his name should be Fumav, which
was the day I saved his life. I called him
so for the memory of the time. I likewise
taught him to say Master, and then let him
know that was to be my name; I likewise
taught him to say Yes and No, and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him
some milk in an earthen pot, and let him
see me'driuk it. before him, and sop my
bread in it. ; and gave him a cake of bread
to do the like, which he quickly complied
with, and made signs that it was very good
for him. I kept there with him all that

koned to him to come with me, and let
him know I would give him some clothes;
at. which he seemed very glad, for he was

 

stark naked. As we went by the place
where he had buried the two men, he
pointed exactly to the place, and showed
me the marks that he had made to find
them again, making signs to me that we
should dig them up again and eat them.
At this I appeared very angry, made as if
I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come
away, which he (lid immediately, with
great submission. I then led him up to90

castle, I fell to work to drew my man,
Friday. I gave him a pair of linen
(liaweis, and made him a jcrkin of goat's
skin, and a very good cap of hare's skin,
and he was mightily pleased to see himself
clothed like his master.

I then made him a little tent between
my two fortifications, and. I fixed all my

doors so that I could fasten them on the ,

upon any occasion wlmtsoovcr. The many
testimonies he gave me of this put it out
of doubt, and soon convinced me that I
needed no precautions for my safety on his
account.

I was greatly delighted with him, and
made it my business to teach him every-
thing that. was proper to make him useful,
handy, and helpful; 'but especially hmake him speak, and understand me when

I spoke. And he was the aptest scholar
that ever was; and particularly was so

intending to kill a kid out of my own
flock, and bring it home and dress it; but
as I was goiIIg,I saw a she-goat lying down
in the' shade, and two young kids sitting
by her. I catched hold of Friday and
made signs to'lIim not to stir; immediately
I presented my piece, shot, and killed one
of the kids. The poor creature, who had,

at a distance, indeed, seen me kill his
enemy, but did not know nor could

imagine how it was done, was sensibly
surprised; tIenIhled, and shook, and looked
so amazed that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot
at, or peIceive I had killed it, hut ripped
up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was
not wounded; and, as I found presently,
thought I was resolved to kill him; for he
came and kneeled down to me, and embrac-
ing my knees, said a great many things I
did not undeIstand; but I could easily see
the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him
that I would do him no harm ; and taking
him up by the hand, laughed at. him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did; and while he was wondering, and
looking to see how the creatune was killed,
I loaded mya <<run again BI' and-Ly I saw:

what I \Iould do, I called him tome again,

under the parrot, to let iIIIn see I would
make it fall. I fired, and bade him look,
and immediately he saw the paITot fall.
He stood like one frightened again, not-
II'ithstanding all I had said to him; and I
 

believe, if I would have let him, he would
have worshipped me and the gun. As for
the gun itself, he would not so much as
touch it for several days.

When Friday tasted the stewed kid he
let me know that he liked it wry much.
The next day I roasted a piece, and when
Ndny came to eat it he expressed great
satisfaction, and made me understand that
he would never eat human flesh any more.
I. taught him to heat and sift the corn and

to make bread, and in a short time he was
able to do all my work as well as I could
do it myself. and we lived very happily.

Ihad a mind once to try if he had any
hankering inclination to his own country
again; and having taught him English so
well that he could answer me almost any
question, I asked him whether the nation
he belonged to never conquered in battle.
At which he smiled, and said, " Ya, yes
we always fight the better."
   

Master--lbw came
you to be taken pris-
oner, then ?

Friday--They more many than my na- I

Friday--They run, one, two three, and
me, and make me go in the canoe; my
nation have no canoe that time.

Mrster---\\'ell, Friday, what. does your

they carry them away and eat them ?

E'irlay--Yes, my nation eat mans too.

Mayer--Have you been here with
them?

E-iday--Yes, I been here (points to
the N. W'. side of the island, which, it
seems, was their side).

By this I understood that. my man,
Friday, had formerly been among the
savages who used to come on shore on

the farther part of the island, (In the said
man-eating occasions that he was now
brought- for' and some time after, when
I took the c rge to can'y him to that
side, being the snne I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me
he was there once, when they eat up
twenty men, two women and one child.
He could not tell twenty in English, but

 
 
  

 

'he numbered them, by laying so many

stones in a row, and pointing to we to tell
them over.

I asked Friday a thousand questions
about his country, and he told me all he
knew. He said his sort of people were
called Caribs; but further west there were
white-bearded men like me, and that they
had killed "much mans;" by all of which,
I knew he meant the Spaniards whose
cruelties in America had spread over the
whole country, and were remembered from
father to son. As the time passed away,
I talked much to Friday about God and
the Saviour, and Iverily believe that he
became a better Christian than I was.
When he could understand me well I told
him of the countries of Europe, and how
I came to be on the island. ""helr I
showed him the ship's boat which was
now falling to pieces on the shore, he told
me that such a boat had come ashore in
his country with seventeen white men in it,
and that these white men were then living
with his people.

It. was after this some time, that being
upon the top of the hill, at the east side of
the island, Friday, the weather being very
serene, looked very earnestly towards the
main land, then fell to dancing and cried,
"Oh, joy! oh, gladl there see my country."
 

That set, me to thinking whether Iconld
not make the voyage with Fridny, or send
Friday alone to see if the white men were
still ihcre.

"'11011 I proposed to Friday that he
should go over alone to see his people, he
felt very badly, and said he would like to

Friday could manage her, turn her, and

However, I had a farther design that he

After all this was done, I had my nran
Friday to teach as to what belonged to the
navigation of my boat; for, though he
knew very weh how to paddle the canoe,
ha knew nothing of what belonged to a
sail and a rudder; and was the most
amazed when he saw rue work the boat to
and again in the sea by the rudder, and
how the sail gibbed, and filled this way or
that way, as the course we sailed changed.
However. with a little use I made all these
things familiar to himI and he became an
expert sailor, except that as to the corn-
pass I could make him understand very
little of that.

By the time I had the boat finished the
rainy season was upon us, and we had to
keep within doors. When we began to go
out again, I sent Friday down to the shore
one day to find a turtle. In a short time
he came flying over my outer wall in a

great fright, crying out to me, " 0, master!
0, master! 0, bad i" "\Vhat's themattw,
Friday?" said I. "Oh! yonder, there,"
says he; " one, two, three canoes, one,
two, three 2" " ""ell, Friday," says I, "do
not be frightenet ." So I heartened him
up as well as I could. However, I saw
the poor fellow was most terribly scared,
foruothingrau in his head but that they
were come back to look for him, and would
cut him in pieces and eat him; and the
poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely
knew what to do with him. I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was
in as nurclr danger as he, and that they
would eat me as well as him. "But," said
I, "Friday, we must resolve to fight them.
Can you fight, Friday?" "Me shoot,"
says he; " but there come many great runn-
her." " No matter for that," said I, again ;
"our guns will fright them that we do not
kill." So I asked him whether, if I re-
solved to defend him, he would defend
me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid
him. He said, " Me die when you bid die.
master."

I loaded the two fowlingpieccs with
swan shot as large as small pistol-bullets.
Then I took four nurskets, and loaded
them with two slugs, and five small bullets
each ; and my two pistols I loaded witn a
brace of bullets each. I hung my great
sword by my side, and gave Friday his
hatchet. \thn I had thus prepared my-
self, I took my lwislmcti\'e~glmss, and went
up to the side of the hill; and I found
(prickly by my glass that there were one-
and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and
three canoes; and that their whole busi-
am seemed to be the. triumphant banquet
 

upon these three human bodies. I ob-
served also that they lauded, not where
they had done when Friday made his
escape, but nearer to my creek, where the
shore was low, and where a thick wood
came close almost down to the sea. This,

very cheerful, and told me, as before, he
would die when I hid die.

In this fit of fury I gave Friday one pis~
tol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol
and the other three myself; and in this

 

with the abhorrcnee of thcinhuman errand

such indignation that I came down again
to Friday, and told him I was resolved to

asked him if he would stand by me. He

I came to the skirt of the wood on the side
which was next to them, only that one cor-

l'IereI called softly to Friday, and show-
ing him a great tree which was just at the
corner of the wood, bade him go to the tree,
and bring me word what they were doing.
He did so, and came immediately hack to
me, and told me that theyr were all about
their fire eating the flesh of one of their pris-
onerig and that anotherlay hound upon the
sand a little from them, whom he said they
would kill next; and this fired the very
soul within me. He told me it was not
one of their nation, but one of the bealded
men whom he had told me of, that came to
their conntryin the boat. Iwns filled with
honor at the very naming of the white
bearded man; and going to the tree, I saw
p'oinly a white man, who lay upon the

beach of the sea with his hands and feet '

tied with flags. or things like rushes.

I had now not a moment to lose, for

the ground, all close huddled together, and

and on my side I killed one, and wounded
two. They were, you may be sure, in a
dreadful consternation; and all of them
that were not hurt jumped upon their feet,

which way to look. Friday kept his eyes

were wounded, that they ran about yelling
and screaming like mad creatures, all
bloody, and most of them miserably
wounded.

"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the
discharged pieces, and taking up the mus~

 

close upon me, that, as I had hid him, he
might observe what I did; so, as soon as
the first shot was made, I thiew down the
piece, and took up the {coding-piece, and
Friday did the like. He saw me cock and
lament; he did the same again. " Are you
ready, hidayi" said I. "Yes," says he.
"Let fly, then," said I, "in the name of
God!" and with tliatI fired again among

upon which I rushed out of the wood and
showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me,
I shouted as loud as I could, and bade
Friday do so too, and running as fast as I
could. which by the way was not very fast,
being loaded with arms as I was, I made
directly towards the poor victim, who was

I cut the flags that bound the poor \'ic~

wngue, what he was. He answeied, in
Latin, Christianus; but was so faint and
weak that he could scarce stand or speak.
I gave him a drink {mm my bottle, and a
piece of bread which he quickly ate. Then
I asked him what countryman he was, and
he said Espagnole; and being a little
recovered, let me know how thankful he
was. "Seignior," said I, in as good
Spanish as I could make up, we must
fight now. Take this sword and pistol, if
you have any strength left." He took
them thankfully and, as if they gave him
new vigor, he flew upon his munderers like
a fury. A powerful savage once threw
him on his back atxd was wringing my
sword out of his hands, when he wisely

Those that were in the canoe worked

lhard to get out of gunshot, and though
l Friday made two or three shots at them, I

did not find that he hit any of them.
Friday would Iain have had me to take one
of their canoes, and pursue them; and,
indeed, I was very anxious about their

lescapc, icst, carrying the news home to

their people, they should come back per-
haps with two or three hundred of the
canoes, and devour us; so I consented to
plusue them by sea, and running to one of
their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Fiiday
follow me. But when I was in the canoe
I was surprised to find another poor crea

Spaniard was, and almost (lead with fem",

he had wally little life in him.

rushes, and would have helped him up;

still, that he was only unbound in order
to be killed. .When Friday came to him,
I bade him speak to him, and tell him of
his deliverance ; and pullingout my bottle,
made him give the poor wretch a. dram;
which, with the news of his being de-
livered. revived him, and he sat up in the
boat But when Friday came to hear him
speak, and look in his face, it would have
moved anyone to tears to have seen how

his hands; and I gave him some rum out
of my bottle to rub them with, which did
them a great deal of good.

 

Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again,
wrung his hands, beat his own face and
head: and then sung and jumped about
again like a distracted creature. It was a
good while before I could make him speak

myself.

I had Friday ask his father what he
thought of the escnm of the savages in

nation to destroy us. His opinion was
that they could never live out the storm,
but, if they did, that they were so dread-

being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that
he believed they would tell the people

them all cry out so, in their language, one

to conceive that a man could dart fire, and

I understood since, by other hands, the
savages never attempted to go over to
the island afterwards; they were so ter-

state of great want. I resolved to increase
our stock of goats and grain, sufficient to
feed them all, and then to send for them
At the proper season we fell to work dig.
ging, and planted as much grain as we
could. We also gathered more grapes, and

caught a large number of kids. At last, I
rictualed the boat and sent the Spaniard
and Friday's fat her over to the mniu,aglee-

 

rifled with the accounts given by those
four men ('Em' it seems they did escape the
sea), that they believed whoever went to
that enchanted island would be destroyed
with fire from the gods.

In my discourse with the Spaniard, he
told me how he and thirteen others had
been shipwrecked on the savage coast, and
that his companions were all alive but in a

It was no less than eight days I hm'.
waited for them, when a strange and unfore

has not, perhaps, been heard of in his
tory. Iwas fast asleep in my hutch one
morning, when my man Friday came run-

grown to he a very thick wood. But I was
surprised, when. presently, I saw a boat
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder
[if-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in; also
I observed, presently, that they did not
come from that side which the shore lay
on, but from the southernmost end of the
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and
bade him lie close, for these were not the
people we looked for, and that we might
not know yet whether they were friends or
enemies. In the next place, i went in to
fetch my perspective glass, to see what I
could make out of them. I had scarce set
foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly
discovered s shiplying at anchor, notahove
a league and a half from the shore. By my
observation, it appeared plainly to he an
English ship, and the boat appeared to be
an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in,
though the joy of seeing a ship. and one
that I had reason to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently
friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hanging

thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed, and,
as I thought, bound; and when the first
four or five of them were jumped on shore,
they took those three out of the boat, as
prisoners. One of the three I could pen
ceive using the most passionate gestures of
entreaty, atlliction, and despair; the other
two, I could perceive, lifted up their
hands sometimes, and appealed concerned,
indeed, but not to such a degree as the
first. I was perfectly confounded at the
sight, and knew not what the meaning of
it should be. Friday called out to me in
English, as well as he could, "0 master!
you see English mans eat prisoner as well
as savage mans." " Why, Friday," says I,
" do you think they are going to eat them~
then l"---" Yes," says Friday, "they will
eat them."--"No, no," says I, "Friday; I
am afraid they will murder them, indeed;
but you may be sure they will not eat
them."

All this while I had no thought of what
the matter really was, but stood trembling
with the horror of the sight, expecting
every moment when the three prisoners
should he killed: nay, once I saw me of
the villains lift up his arm with a great
cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men; and I expected
to see him fall every moment; at which
all the blood in my body seemed to run
chill in my rains. I wished heartily now
for my Spaniard, and the savage that was
gone with him, or that I had any way to
have come undiscovered within shot of

they pleased; but they sat down all three
upon the ground, very pensive, and looked
like men in despair.

It was just at the top of high water
when these people came on shore; nnd
while they rambled about to see what-kind
of a place they were in, they ind carelessly
stayed till the tide was spenhleaving their
boat aground. They had loft two men in

 

them, that I might have secured the three
men. for I saw no fire-arms they had among
them; but it fell out to my mind another
way. After I had observed the outrageous
usage of the three men by the insolent sea-
men, I observed the fellows run scattering
about the land, as if they wanted to see
the country. I observed also that the

three other men had liberty to go where,

the bout, who, having drunk a little too
much brandy, fell asleep. When they
awoke and found that the boat was too
fast aground for them to stir it, they hal-
looed out for the rest-' upon which they
all came to the boat. Then I heard one 0!
them say, "Let her alone, Jack; she'll
flout next tide."

I knew it would be ten hours before theboat would float again, and by that time it
would be dark. So I kept close. I fitted
myself up for battle as before, and waited

in rrry castle. About two o'clock, hon"
ever, when they had all struggled into the
woods and out of sight, I resolved to
disclose myself to the three distressed
men, who were seated underatree brrt a
short distance ofi'.

Friday and I went out, and when we
came near them I called out, "What are

ye, gentlemen 1" They all started up, and l
were very much frightened at my uncouth '

appearance. But I calmed their fears with
a few words, and told them I was ready to
assist them. " What is your easel" said I.
"Ourme is too long," said one, " to tell
you now, but, in short, I was commander
of that ship; my men have nrutinied
against me; they have been hardly pre'
veiled on not to murder mo, and, at last,

" Have they any fire-arms I" said I. He
answered, " They had only two pieces, one

then." said I, "leave the mt to me. I see
they are all asleep; it is an easy thing a)
kill them all; brrt shall we rather take
them prisoners?" He told rue there were
two desperate villains among them, that it
was scarce safe to show any mercy to ; hurt
if they were secured, he believed all tne
rest would return to their duty. "\Vell,"
says I, " let us retreat out of their View or
hearing, lest they awake, and we will re
solve further." So they willingly went
back with me.

"Look you, sir," said I; "if I venture
upon your deliverance, my conditions are
but two; first, that while you stay on
this island with me, you will not pretend
to any authority here, and if I put arms
in your hands, you will, upon all occasions,
give them up to me, and do no prejudice
to me or mine upon this island, and in the

 

meantime be governed by my orders;
secondly, that if the ship is or may be
rmvered, you will carry me and my man
to England, passage free."

He gave me assurance that he would
comply with these most reasonable do-
nraruls " Well1 then," said I. "here rm)
 

three muskets for you, with powder and
ball; tell me next what you think is
proper to he done." He showed all the
testimony of his gratitude that he was
able, but offered to be wholly guided by
me. Itold him the best method I could
think of was to fire on them at once as
they lay. He said, very modestly. that he
was loth to kill them, if he could help it;
but that those two were incorrigible vil-
lains, and had been the authors of all the
mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped,
we should be undone still, for they would
go on board and bring the whole ship's
company, and destroy us all.

In the middle of this discourse we heard '
some of them awake, and soon after we!
saw two of them on their feet. I asked

the other badly wounded. But he jumped
up and called for help, and then, as I cumo
up, he, with all the test, cried out for
mercy. The captain told then: he would

with this, he took the musket I had given

the care, we were sure, could not hear;
and those in our keeping, though they
heard it well enough, yet durst give no
answer to them. T hen three men got into
the heat and put her off a little way from
the shore, while the other seven started to
find their companions.

It seems they were too much frightened
to go far from the shore, but they went to

the shore, I imagined it to he as it really
was; but I presently thought of a strata-
gem to {etch them back again, and which
answered my end to a tittle. I ordered
Friday and the captain's mate to go over
the little creek to a. rising ground, at about
half a mile distance, and halloo out as loud
as they could; and that as soon as ever
they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again; and then keeping
out of sight, take a round, always answer
iug when the others hallooed, to draw them

the top of a hill and hallooed seveml asfur into the island aspossihle.
They were just going into the boat,
when Friday and the mate hallooed; and
they answering, ran along the shore westa
ward, towards the voice the)r heard, when
they were presently stopped by the creek,
where, the water being up, they could not
get over, and called for the boat to come
up and set thcmover, as Iexpected. ""hen
they had set themselves over-,1 observed
that the boat being gone up a good way
into the creek, they took one of the three
men out of her, to go along with them, and
left only two in the boat, havingr fastened
her to the stirrup of a little tree on the
shore. This was what I wished for; and
immediately leaving Friday and the cap-
tain's mate to their business, I took the

their sight, we surprised the two man before
they were aware; one of them lying on
the shore, and the other being in the boat.
The fellow on share was between sleeping
and waking, and going to start up. The cap-
tain, who was foremost, ran in upon him,
and knocked him down; and then called
out to him in the boat to yield, or he was
a dead man. There needed very few argu-
Inents to persuade a single mar. to yield.
when he saw five men upon him, and
his comrade knocked down. In the
meantime, Friday and the captain's mate
so wei'. managed their business with the
rest, that they drew then), by hallooing and
answering. from one hill to another, till
they not only heartily tired them, but left

 

rest with me, and crossing the creek out of i them where they could not reach back to
 

the boat hefole it was dark; and, indeed,
they were heartily tired themselves also,
by the time they came back to us.

When they came back to the boat in
the dark, and found it high on the shore of
the creek, and their two men gone, they
began to complain that they were on an
"enchanted island.

I made the man they had left in the
boat, who was now one of its, call them
by name, to try if Icould bring them to
a. pulley. So he calls out as loud as he
could to one of them, "Tom Smith! Tom
Smith! For God's sake,throw down your
arms and yield, or you are all dead men
this moment." "\Vho must we yield to?

R OBI NSON CR USOE.

Where are they 1"
says Smith quickly.
" Ilene they are,'
says he; "here's our
captain and fifty men
with him, have been
hunting you these
two horns; the boat
swain is killed, 'Will
Eye is wounded, and
I am a prisoner; and
if you do not yield
at once, you are all
lost."

Then the captain
called out that if they
would lay down their
aims, the governor,
by whom he meant
me, would spare all
their lives, except
that of Will Atkins,
who, it seems, was the
first man to mutiny
and lay hold of the captain. They all lay
down their arms at once, and we bound
them and took some to the cave, and the
others to my bower. I mended the hole
that we had made in the first boat, and
after talking with the prisoners, the cap-
tain picked out those that he could trust
and started to retake the ship, reaching her
about midnight.

Those that were on the deck were not
alarmed at seeing their own boats coming
back, and so the captain, after a short
fight, captured them all and put down the
hatches to keep the others below. They
then broke open the door of the round-
house where the new rebel captain lay,aud

day his body was hung up at the yard'

When the captain came back, he told
me he had brought rue some little refresh-
ments, such as the ship afl'orded. Upon
this, he called aloud to the boat, and bade
his men bring the things ashore that were
for the governor; and, indeed, it was a
present as if I had been one that was not
to be carried away along with them, but
as if I had been to dwell upon the island
still, and they were to go without rue.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles
full of excellent cordial waters, six large
bottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of
excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces
of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of peas, and about a hundred-
a'eight of biscuit. He also brought me a

lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and
abundance of other things. But besides
these, he brought me six new clean
shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair
of gloves, one pair of shoes, a. hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been wonr
but very little: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot It was a very kind and
agreeable present, as any one may imaging,
to one in my circumstances: but never was
anything in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was
to me to wear such clothes at their first
putting on.

After dressing in my- new clothes, so as
to look more like areal governor than in

before me, and I told them 1 had got a full
account how they had run away with the
ship, and were preparing to commit further
robberies. I let them know that by my

 

 

 

direction the ship had been seized; that
she lay now in the road ; and they might.
see that their new captain had received the
reward of his villany; that, as to them,I
wanted to know what they had to say why
I should not execute them as pirates, as.
they could not doubt but I had authority
to do.

One of them answered that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they
were taken, the captain promised them
their lives, and they humbly implored my
mercy. But I told them I knew not what
mercy to show them; for as for myself I
had resolved to quit the island with all my
 

men, and had taken pilsmge to go to
England. As for them, they could not go
to England in the ship, exeept as prisoners

in arms, and upon leaching there, they
would surely be hanged.

Upon this they begged that I would let
tnem stay on the island, to which I gave
:y consent Then I told them my whole
history, and how I had managed every-
thing. I left them all my filearms and
abouta harm! and a half of gunpowder,
and. I prevailed upon the captain to give
them two barrels more and also some gar-
den seeds. I gave them aiso the bag of
mas. and the captain sent them theirchests
and clothes, for which they seemed very
thankful. And then I left the island, after
being upon it eight-and-tweuty years, two
alumina and. nineteen days.

 

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

\Vheu I came to England. I was a per-
fect stranger to all the world. My father
and mother were dead, and all my family
except two sisters and two children of one
of my brothels. The captain gave to the

 

 

owners a. handsome account of my saving
the ship, aml theyr made up a purse of
nearly PS200. With this money I resolved
to go to Lisbon and see if I could get any
news from my plantations in Brazil. I
accordingly took shipping and arrived in
Lisbon safely, Friday accompanying me,
and prorng a most valuable servant. Here
I found my old friend, the captain, who
took me on the coast of Africa. He was
an old man now, and he told me he had
not been to the Bmzils for nine years, but
he assured me that when he was there last,
my mrtner was alive, and he believed I

was now master of about 50,000 pounds
sterling in money, with a fine estate. The
trustees sent. me, besides the gold, 1,200
chests of sugar and 800 rolls of tobacco.

I was so overcome by this news, and the
reception of such great riches, that I tell
sick, but soon recovered. I iewruded my
old benefactor, and appointed him receiver
of the profits of my plantation. Having
settled all my afiairs in Lisbon, I resolved
to return to England by land--that is,

We were descending on the northern side
of the mountains, when, our guide being
something below us, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear.

Two of the wolves flewupon the guide,

and, had he been far before us, he would
have been devoured before we could have

his horse, and the other attacked the man

fellow, rode directly up, and with his
pistol shot the wolf in the head. The

other, when he heard the pistol shot, fled
immediately.

But never was a fight managed so handily,
and in such a surprising manner, asthat
between Friday and the bear.

then you must take care to be very civil to

very nice gentleman; he will not go a step

to pursue his revenge--that is his first

we were a little surprised.

moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as
we call the flat shoes they wear. and which
he had in his pocket), gives my other ser-
vant his horse, and with his gun away he
flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on, and
offered to meddle with nobody, till F ridny
coming pietty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him : "Hark ye, hark
ye," says Friday, " me speakee with you."
We followed at a distance. Friday. who

 

" Oh-oh, oh I" i

had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came
up with him quickly, and took up a great
stone, and threw it at him, and hit him

just- on the head, but did him no more

 

harm than if he had thrown it againsua

rogue was so void of fear that he did it
purely to make the hear follow him, and
show us some laugh, as he called it. As
soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw
him, he turns about, and comes after him,
taking very long strides, and shuflling on
at a strange rate, so as would have put a
horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and seeing a gmat oak-tree fit for
his purpose, he beckoned us to follow; and
doubling his pace, he got nimhly up the
tree, laying his gun down upon the ground,
at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree,
and we followed at a distance. The first
thing he did, he stopped at the gun,

guide told us, if there wvre more wolvn
in the country, we should find then) there;
and this was a small plain surrounded
with woods on every side, and a long nar-
row defile, or lane, which we were to pass
to get through the Wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were
to lodge. It was within half an hour of
sunset when we entered the wood, and a
little after sunset when we came into the
plain. "it: met with nothing in the first
wood, except that in a little plain we Raw

kept our arms ready and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came
through that wood, and entered the plain.
As soon as we came into the plain, the first
object we met with was a poor horse which
the wolves had killed, and at least a. dozen
of them at work picking his bones. We
had not gone half over the plain, when we
began to hear the wolves howl in the wood
on our left in a frightful manner, and pres-
ently we saw about a hundred coming on
directly toward us, all in a body. I scarce
knew in what manner to receive thenr, but
found to draw ourselves in a close line was
the only way; so we formed in a moment,
butI ordered that only every other man
should fire, and that the others should
stand ready to give them a second volley
immediately. However, at present, we had
no necessity; {or upon firing the first vol-
ley, the enemy made a full stop. Four of
them being shot in the head, dropped;
several others were wounded, and went
bleeding oil'. I found they stopped, but
did not immediately retreat; whereupon I
caused all the company to lralloo as loud
as we could ; and they began to retire and

117

 

turn about. I then ordered a second volley

to be fired in their rear, which put them to
the gallop, and away they went to the
woods. We had hutlittle more than loaded
our fusees, when we heard a terrible noise
in the same wood on our left, only that it
was farther onward.

The night was coming on, and the light

' began to he dusky, which nrade it the

worse on our side; and, on a sudden, we
perceived two or three troops of wolves, one
on our left, one behind us, and one in our
front, so that we seemed to be surrounded
with them. However, as they did not fall
upon us, we kept our way forward. Al

    

another opening of the wood, we hemd
the noise of a. gun, and looking that way,
out rushed a horse, with a saddle and
a bridle on him, flying like the wind. and
sixteen or seventeen wolves after him full
speed.
 

But here we had a most horrible sight;
for, riding up to where the horse came out,
we found the carcases of another horse and
of two men, devalued by the ravenous
creatures. 'l'his filled us with horror, and
we knew not what course to take; but the
creatures resolved us soon, for they
gathered about us presently, in hopes of

 

prey. It happened, very umch to our
advantage, that at the entrance into the
wood, there lay some large timber-trees. I
drew my little troop in among those trees,
and placing ourselves in a line hehiud one
long tree, I advised them all to alight, and
keeping that tree before us for a breast-
work, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts,
inclosing our horses in the centre. "'9. (lid

so, and it was well we did; for never we,
a more furious charge than the creature:
made upon us. They came on us with z
growling kind of a. noise, and mounted the
piece of timber. I ordered our men to fire
as before, every other man; and they took

was a necessity to keep a continual firinga

HAT homely proverb, that
' what is bred in the bone

was never more verified

\ Any one would think that after

which few men, it any, ever went

of peace and cnjoymentin the fulncss of

Yet all these things had no effect upon
me, or at least not. enough to resist the
strong inclination I had toga abroad again.
In particular, the desire of seeing my new
plantation on the island, and the colony I

left there, ran in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagina.
tion ran upon it all day; and my fancy
worked so steadily and strongly upon it
that I talked of it in my sleep.

In this kind of teinperI lived some years
My wife, finally, told me very seriously,
one night, that she believed there was some
powerful impulse of Providence npcm me

| to visit my island again, and that T ought
 

to go. This affectionate behavior in my wife
brought me a little out of the vapors, and
I began to think seriously of my folly,
and to give up my thoughts of going
away. I resolved to divert myself witll

other things, and to engage in some busi-
ness that might effectually tie me up from

    

<<4

any more excursions of this kind; for I
found that thing return upon me chiefly
when I was idle, and had nothing to do.
To this purpose, I bought a little farm in
the county of Bedford. I had a little
house upon it, and the land about it, I
found, was capable of great improvement.
In a word, I went down to my farm, settled
my family, bought ploughs, barrows a
cart, wagon, horses, cows and sheep, and,
setting seriously to work, became in one
half-year a mere country gentleman. My
thoughts were entirely taken up in manag-
ing my servants, cultivating the ground,
enclosing, planting, etc; and I lived, asI
thought, the most agreeable life that na-
ture was capable of directing.

 

But in the middle of all this felicity,
one blow from unseen Providence un-
hinged me at once, and drove me into a

deep lelapse of the wandering disposition,
which, as I may say, being born in my
very blood, soon recovered its hold of me.
This blow was the loss of my wife. My
thoughts ran all away again into the old
affair ; my head was quite turned with the
whimseys of foreign adventures; and all
the pleasant, innocent amusements of my
farm, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me, had no relish, and
were like music to one that has no ear, or
food to one that has no taste; in a word, I
resolved to let my farm, and return to Lon-
don. When I came to London, I was still
as uneasy as I was before ; I had no relish
for the place, no employmentin it. " "hing
to do but to saunter about.

It was now the beginning of \. is year
1693, when my nephew, whom I had
brought up to the sea, was come home
from a short voyage to Bilboa. He came
to me, and told me that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been proposing to
him to go a voyage for them to the East
Indies, and to China, as private traders.
"And now, uncle," says he, "if you will
go to sea with me, I will engage to land
you upon your old habitation in the island;
for we ale to touch at the Bmzils."

This so exactly hit with my temper that
Iconsented, but told him I would go no
further than my own island. He argued
against this, but to little purpose. How
ever, I and my man Friday went on board
in the Downs, on the 8th of January, 1693.
I took with me the frame of a sloop that
could be easily put together. I also took
with me some servants whom I purposed
to leave on the island, among them two
carpenters, a smith, a very handy in.

We steered on toward the West Indies
for twenty days, when we came up with a

 

 

ship with one mast gone, and quite help-
less. The crew were in g at distress,
being out of provisions, and rmrly starved.

There was a youth, and his mother, and
a maid-servant on board, who were pawn-

which we did.

I shall trouble nobody with the little irr-
cidonts of wind, weather, currents, etc., on
the rest of our voyage; but, to shorten my
story, shall observe that. I came to my old
habitation, the island, on the 10th of April,
1695. It was with no small difliculty that
I found the place; for, as 1 Carrie to it, and
went from it, before, on the south and east
side of the island, coming from the Brazila,
so now, coming in between the main and
the island,I did not know it when Isaw it.

\Vc went- orr shore on several islands,
but none for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, thatI
was under one. great. mistake before, viz.,
that the continent which I thought I saw
from the island I lived in, was really no
continent, but a long island, or rather a
ridge of islands.

Thus, coastingr from one island to an-
other, at length I came fair on the south
sirle of my island, and presently knew the
 

very countenance of the place ; soI brought "Well, well." says I, " Friday, you don't

As we went on show, the first maul

there was no keeping Friday in the boat,

then lay down on the ground, and stroked

thought the fellow bewitched. But it
would have made a dog laugh the next
day to see how his passion ran out another

L way. In the morning, he walked along the

slime again with his old father, several
hours, always leading him by the hand, as'
if he had been a lady ; and every now and
then he would come to the boat to fetch
something or other for him, either a lump
of sugar, a dram, a. biscuit cake, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the
afternoon, his frolics ran another way ; for
then he would set the old man down upon
the ground, and (lance about him, and
make a thousand antic postures and gel-
tules; and all the while he did this he
would he talking" to him, and telling him

believe he was more hurt than he really

now, resolving to go through with his work,
he stooped, and took the fellow's musket
whom he had knuckrd down, and was just
going to shoot the man who had fired at

him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being i

in the cave, came out and calling to him
not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the
other two, and took their arms from them.

The rogues went away swearing ven-

destroyed. They had just begun to be in-
solent again when an accident happened
which made them lay by all private resent-
ments, and look to the preservation of their
lives.

The Spaniard whom I had sa:ed and
who was then the leader or the governor,
feeling restless one night, got up and
wandered abroad to see if anything was
the matter. He had not gone far when he
was surprised to see several fires and a
great number of savages walking about
them. He went back and told the rest,
and they all kept very close till morning.
It seems that the savages had had a great
battle in their own country, and both sides
had come here to eat their prisoners. But
neither party knew that the other was on
the island. In the morning, when they
found it out, they fell to fighting again,
and a great number were killed. Three of
them ran away, right into our habitation
and were captured by the Spaniards.

raised a great shout, and took to their

grcat while after, they were tractable, and
went about the common business of the
whole society well enough. But some time
after this they fell into such simple meas-
ures again, as brought them into agneat
deal of trouble.

They had taken three pnsoners, as I
observed ; and these three being lusty,stout
young fellows, they made them servants,
and taught them to work for them; and
as slaves they did well enough. But they
did not take their measures with them asl
(lid by my man Friday, and so they never
had them to assist. thcm and fight for them
as I had Friday, who was as true to me as
the very flesh upon my bones.

And now they had another broil with

But after two-and-twenty days' absence
they all came back, and upon being ques-
tioned told of their adventures. They had
reached what they thought the main land
and found it only an island. The savages
rushed down to the shore to fight them, so
they did not land. They landed, however,
at another island where they were well
treated. On that island, they were told
that only the men. and women taken in

affront to the savage gentry that could he
oifered them. After some debate they
resolved to accept of them; and, in return,
they gave the savages one of their hatchets,
an old key, a knife, and six or seven of
their bullets; which, though they did not
understand their use, they seemed particu-
larly pleased with; and then tying the poor
creatures' hands behind them, they (lraggeo
the prisoners into the boat for our men.
 

'On the way back, they stopped at the
first island and set eight of them at lib-
erty, and the others they had brought to
I:ur island and then had them bound in

Ieir huts, so they could not run away.
Upon hearing such a remarkable story, all
went over to the huts to look at them.
Here they set, all of them stark naked.
First, there were three men, lusty, comely
fellows, well-shaped,straight and fair limbs,
about thirty and thirty-five years of age;
and five women, whereof two might be
from thirty to forty; two more not above
four or fire-and-twenty; and the fifth,a
tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seven
teen. The woruen were wellvfavoredmgree-
able persons, both in shape and features,
only tawny; and two of them, had they
been perfectly white, would have passed
for very handsome women, even in London
itself.

Only one of them, a woman, could
understand Friday's father, but through
her we soon rrrade them understand that
they were not to be eaten, nor even killed.
At this, when we untied them, they all
fell to dancing, and then they all began to
take up things to signify that they would
work. As there were fire women and
five Englishmen, the Spaniards let these
last each choose one for a wife, which they
did. And now each one built a hut for
himself, the two honest ones in one place,
and the three rogues in another.

Some time after this, fire or six canoes
of savages came on shore. Our rrrerr kept
within doors till the canoes were gone,
and then it was discovered that they had
left three of their number behind, and
they lay under a tree fast asleep. After

 

consultation it was resolved to take them
prisoners; and they did so. The poor
fellows were strangely frightened when
they were seized upon and bound; and
afraid, like the women, that they should be
murdered and eaten for it *eems those
people think all the world do a. they do;
but they were soon made easy as to that.
One of them ran away to the woods
and was never seen again. He probabl'
 

camped with some canoes that came ashore
soon after.

The first testhaouy they had that this
fellow had given intelligence of them was,
that, about two months after, six canoes of
savages came rowing along the north side
of the island, where they never used to

ROBINSON CR USOIL'.

 

"'hen our men came out from the tree,
the savage who was not killed began to
make piteous moans for his life, so they
tied him to a tree and ran on to their
wives. Soon after, the other savages went.
away as they came. It was five or six
months before they saw any more of the

 

come before, and landed about a mile from
the habitation of the two Englishmen,
where this escaped man had been kept.
As they were coming directly towards
their huts, the two men rent their wives
and some of their goods into the woods,
and went a little way themselves and hid
in a. hollow tree. The savages burnedi
their huts and then scattered about, the!

To their slaves they (lid not give

a long stall, with a great spike of imn fas-
tened into each end of it, and by his side
a hatchet; also every one of our men had
ahatchet. Two of the women could not
he prevailed upon, but they would come
into the fight, and they had bows and

 

arrows, which the Spaniards had taken
from the savages when the first act-ion hay
pened, and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor commanded the
whole; and \Vill Atkins, who, though a
dreadful fellow for wickednea, was a
most daring, bold fellow, commanded
under him. The savages came fol-wand
likr lions; and our men, which was the
worst 0'. their fate, had no advantage in

 

133

their situation; only that Will Atkins,
who now proved a most useful fellow, with
six men, was planted just behind a small
thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard,
with orders to let the first of them pass by,
and then the into the middle of them, and
as soon as he had fined, to make his retreat
as nimhly as he could round a part of the
wood, and so come behind the Spaniards.
When the savages came on, they ran

straggling about every way in heaps. out
of all manner of Older, and Will Atkins
let about fifty of them pass by him; then
seeing the rest come in avery thick throng,
he mders three of his men to fire, having
loaded their mnskets with six or seven bul.

wounded they knew not, but the conster-
nation and surprise was inexpresi'oie
among the savages. They were frightened

them a third volley.

Had \Vill Atkins and his men retired
immediately, as they were ordered to do,
or had the rest of the body been at hand,
to pour in their shot continually, the sav-
ages had been effectually routed; for they
thought they were killed by the gods with
thunder and lightning; but some of the
savages who were at a distance spying
them,csme upon them behind. and wounded
Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, as they did
afterwards one Spwiard, and one of the
Indian slaves.

Our men being thus hard laid at,
mtreated to a rising ground in the wood;
and the Spaniards, after-firing three volleys
upon them, retreated also; for their num-
ber was so great, and they were so desper-
ate, that though above fifty of them were
killed, and more than as many wounded,
yet they came on in the teeth of our men,
fearless of danger, and shot their arrows
like a cloud.

The Spaniard governor having drawn
his little body up together upon a rising
ground, Atkins, though he was wounded,
would have them march and charge again
altogether at once; but the Spaniard le-
plied: "Seignior Atkins, you see how their
wounded men fight; let them alone till
morning; all the wounded men will be
stiff and sore with their wounds, and faint
with the loss of blood; and so we shall
have the fewer to engage." This advice
1'1

 

 

was good; but Will Atkins replied mer-
rily, "That is true, seignior, and so shall I
too; and that is the reason I would go on

while I am warm." "Well, Seignior
Atkins," says the Spaniard, " you have he-
hared gallantly, and done your part; we.
will fight for you if you cannot come on;
but I think it best to stay till morning."
So they waited.

Butas it was a clear moonlight night,
and they found the savages in great dis-
order about their dead and wounded men,
and a great noise and hurry among them
where they lay, they afterwards resolved
to fall upon them in the night. They
came so neal where the thickest of them
lay, that, before they were seen or heard,
eight of them fired in upon them, and did
dreadful execution upon them; in half a
minute more, eight others fired after them,
pouring in their small shot in such a
quantity, that- abundance were killed and
wounded; and all this while they wele not

able to see who hurt them, or which way
to fly.

They fought desperately, out so many
were killed and wounded, that the rest
soon fled to their boats and put to sea.
But a dreadful storm coming on that even-
ing, many of the canoes were lost and the
others driven hack to the island, seeing
which our men went over and fixed guns
to frighten them, and they all ran into the
woods. Our men then destroyed all their
boats, so that they could not get back to
their nation to bring another army. The
savages kept hid in the woods most of the
time, but. they managed to destroy the
crops and do much damage. Having no
weapons, they" were reduced to a deplon
able condition, some of them even starv-
ing to death. Friday's father then caught
one, and through him arrangements were
made by which they were given seeds and
tools and a part of the island to live on,
upon condition that they would not leave
their bounds. The kept their promise,

log it up like baskehvork all the way
round. Our men were so taken with it,
that they got the wild savages to come and
do the like for them; so that when I came
to see the two Englishmeu's colonies, they
looked, at a distance, as if they all lived
like bees iuahive. As for Will Atkins,
who was now become a, very industrious,
useful, and sober fellow, he had made him
self such a tent of basket-work as, I be-
lieve, was never seen. It was one hundred
and twenty paces round on the outside, as

and only a few iron spikes, which he made
himself too, out of the old iron that I had
left there; and, indeed, this fellow showed.
abundance of ingenuity in several things
which he had no knowledge of. He made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden be'r
lows to blow the fire. He made himsell
charcoal for his work; and he formed out
of the iron crows a middling good anvil to
hammer upon. In this manner he made
many things, but especially hooks, staples
and spikes, bolts and hinges.
 

I had many talks with the Spaniards
about their adventures among the savages.
They told me they had given up all hope of
getting away. They were compelled to
go with them to their wars, and in one of
them the Spaniard, whom I had rescued,
was taken prisoner. They were very
grateful to me for sending {or them, and
were very polite and kind in every way.
So I called them all together one day, :md
showed them the stores I had brought,
and was going to leave them, for I had
not come to take them away. First, I
asked them, one by one, if they were
willing to stay, and \vould give up all
animo-sities, one to another. And each
told me he would.

Will Atkins, with abundance of frank-
ness, said they had met with aflliction
enough to make them all sober, and eue.
mics enough to make them all friends;
that, {or his part, he would live and (lie
with them; that they had done nothing to
him, but what his own mad humor made
necessary; and that he would ask them
pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and
hrutish things he had done to them; and
as for going to England, he cared not if
he did not go thither these twenty years.

I cannot express what pleasure sat upon
the countenances of all these poor men,
when they saw the care I had taken of
them. They told me I was a father to
them; and that having such a correspond-
ent as I was in so remote a part of the
world, it would make them forget that
they were left in a desolate place; and
they all engaged to me not toleave the
place without my consent

Then I presented to them the people I

 

had brought with me. particularly the
tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters,
all of them most necessary people; but,
above all, my general ai'tificer, than whom
they could not name anything that was

more useful to them. And the tailor, to
show his concern for them, went to work
immediately, and, with my leave, made
them every one a shirt, the first thing he
did; and what was still more, he taught
the women not only how to stitch, but he
made them assist to make the shirts for
their husbands, and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I scarce need men-
tion how useful they were; for they took
to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things,
and made clever, convenient tables, tools,
bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and.
everything they wanted of that kind. But
to let them see how nature made artificeis
at first, I carried the carpenters to see Will
Atkins' basket-house. as I called it: and
 

they both owned they never saw an instance it, after musinga good while, turningabom
of such natural ingenuity before, nor any- to me, "I mu sure," says he, "that man

The young man whose mother was
starved to death, and also the maid

built for them to live in. Before I left the

so much true piety that he was beloved by
all. He came to me one morning and told
me that the men I was leaving behind
would not have God's blessing if they were
not married to their wives, and further-
more that they should teach their wives

anything of the Christian religion--no, not
so nmch as to know that there was a God.

After this, my clergyman, turning to me,
said, "I cntreat you, sir, let us walk out
and look; I dare-say we shall find this poor
man somewheie or other talking seriously
to his wife, and tszching her aheady some-

thing of religion." \Ve went out together,
and I carried him a way which none knew
but myself, and where the trees were very
thick, when, coming to the edge of the
wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife
sitting under the shade of a bush, very
eager in diseoulse, pointing up to the sun,
and to every quarter of the heavens, and
then down to the earth, then out to the
sea, then to himself, then to her, to the
woods, to the trees. "Now," says the

clergyman, " you see my words are made
good. The man preaches to her; mark him
now, he 's telling her that. our God has
made him and her, and the heaven; the
earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, etc."
"I believe he is," said I. Immediately, we
peieeired "'ill Atkins stari- upon his feet.

Atkins and his wife came in. Upon ques-

not believe him at first, because she could

him that he realized what a great sinner he

said so, the man fell into transpox'ts of

Having now done with the island, I left
them all ill good circumstances, and in a
flourishing condition, and went: on heard
my ship again on the 6th of May. I prom-
ised to send them farther relief from the
Brnzils, and lmrtienlarly I promised to
send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs ,
and cows. As to the two cows and mlves '3
which I brought from England, we had,
been obliged to kill them at sea, for want: i
of hay to feed them. -

about. three days after we had sailed.
while we wele becalnied, a great fleet of

canoes were seen approaching us. I had the
ship brought to an anchor; the boats were
put overboard and manned, forI was afraid
only that they would set the ship on fire.
\Vhen they came nearer to us, they seemed
to be struck with wonder and astonishment,
as at- a sight which doubtleSS they had
never seen before. The}r came up, hour
ever, very near to us, and seemed to go
about. to row round us; but we called to
our men in the boats not to let them come
too near them. Our men beckoned with
their hands to keep them back, which they
uudeistood very well, and went back; but
at their reheat about fifty ariows came on
hoanl us t'mm these boats, and one of our
men in the long-boat. was wounded. How.
ever, I called to them not to fire by any
means; but: we handed down some deal
hoards into the boat, with which they made
a kind of fence to cover them. The;
 

a-swinnning; the rest, frightened out of
their wits, scouted away as fast as they
could, taking but little care to save those
whose boats were split or spoiled with our
shot; so I suppose that many of them

such a. broadside as they had never heard

Ind our gunners took the aim so well that
thirteen or fourteen of their canoes were

presents; and when I told him of the frame
of the sloop I had brought, and that it was
my design to send some supplies to the
people on my island, he offered to attend
to it for me.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished
the sloop in a very few days; and I gave
the master of her such instructions that, he
could not miss the plncr: nor did he, as I
had an account from my partner after-

 

who wished to go the island with his wife
and daughters, and we let them go.
Among the nest of the supplies sent to
my tenants on the island, I sent them by
the sloop three :nilch cows and five calves,
about twentytwo hogs among them, three
sows with pigs, two mares, and a. stone-
hoisc. For my Spaniards, accoziling to
my promise, I engaged three Portugal wo-

cargo I sent them; and one of our seamen,
that had been on shore with me there,
offered to go with the sloop and settle

From the Brazfls, we went directly to
the Cape of Good Hope, when we took in
fresh water, and then made the best of
our way to the coast of Madagascar.

Though the pcnple there are fierce and
treacherous, we traded some triili-s, such
as knives, scissors, etc., for some fat bul-
locks.

It happened one evening, when we went
on share, that a. greater rrrrnrlrer of their
people came down than usual, but all Very
friendly and civil; and they brought sev-
eral lxirrds of 'rroxisions, for which "a

tent or hut of some boughs, and lay on
shore all night. But: I was not; so well
satisfied to lie on Show as the rest; and
I splead the sail on the bottom of the boat,
and lay all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning, we
heaul one of our men make a terrible noise
on the shore, calling out for God's sake to
bring the boat in, and come and help
them. At. the saute time I heard the fire of
five muskets, which was the number of
guns they had, aml then three times over;
for, it seems, the natives here were not so
easily frightened with guns as the savages
were in America, where I lmd to do with
them. All this while I knew not; what
was the matter, but rousing immediately
frum sleep with the noise,I caused the
heat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three fusees we had on board, to land and
assist our men.

We got the hunt soon to the show, but
our men were in too much haste; for being
come to the show, they plunged into the
water, to get to the boat with all the
exlmdition they could. being plimred by
between three or 1 )ur hundred men.

 

 

 

W'e tool: up seven of our men, and with
difiiculty enough too, three of them beng

still worse was that while we stood in the
boat to take our men in, we were in as

for they poured their arrows in upon as
so thick that we were glad to barricade
the side of the beat up with two or three
loose boards, which we had by mere aeri-
dent in the boat. \Ve had, by the light
of the moon, a little sight of them, as they

and arrows; and having got ready our fire,-
anns, we gave. them a volley that we could
hear, by the cries of some of them. had
wounded several; however, they stood
thus. in battle army on the shore till break
of day.

In this condition we lay, and canal an

We soon learned the cause of the fray.
It seems that a young woman had been
taken by one of our snilms and curried into
the woods. An old woman, who was with
the young one, made a great outcry, and
that brought on the attack. We had one

so enraged them, as before. that they swore
to one another to be revenged, and that not
an Indian that came into their-hands should
have any quarter; and to work they went
immediately, and in a quarter of an hour
they set the town on fire in four or five
places, and manlered so many of the. peo-
ple that the rest lest ran off to the woods.
When our men came back, we set sail to
Bengal. On the \vayI blamed the men
very much for what they had done, and
this led to further trouble. I had gone on
shore at Bengal, and the men came and
told me they were resolved to leave me
there, for if Iweut back to the ship they
would all leave her. I sent for the captain,
and-told him it-wonld be so hard for him
to get sailms, that: I had better stay, so he
left me, with all my good" and with plenty
of money.

Ilene I met an English merchant, and to
gether we bought a ship and made trading
Voyages to the Spice Islands and to China,
with great profit. We then sold out shinresolved to voyage no more. But one day
a Dutch ship came into port, and the man
who claimed to he the captain oil'eied to
sell her to us cheap, and we bunglm All
the crew left her, which we thought very
strange, but we afterwards learned that
they had mntinied and murdered the cap-
tain, and after sailing a while aspirates
had sold the ship to us. We picked up
some English and some Dutch sailms, and
resolved to go to China again.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds
obliged to heat up and down a great while
in the Straits of Malacca, and among the
islands, we were no sooner got clear of
those difficult seas than we found our ship
hadspmnga leak, and we Were not able,

"Sir," says he, " you are a stranger to me,

and thought at. filst I had known him, but
I did not. " If it very nearly concerns
me," said I, "and not yourself,whatnzm'es

says he, " by the illnninent danger you are

says I, "but that my ship is leaky, and I
cannot find it out; but I intend to lay her

This led me to question him further, and
I found that he himself took us for pirates,

Bluprised, but he said we (lid well to go to
Nanquin, for if we fell into the hands of
the English or Dutch at that time they
would listen to no explanation. He ad-
vised that we sell the ship at Nanquin and
buy a. Chinese junk, and promised to assist
us at both sale and purchase. He promised,

the ship should not have the same trouble

compane the miserable people of these

had first of all the honor to ride with the

told us there was a great caravan of Mus

land to )Iuscovy, within four or five weeks;
and he was sure we would take the oppuxs
tnnity to go with them.

I confess I was greatly surprised with
this good news, and had scarce power to
speak to him for some time; but at. last I
turned to him. " How do you know this '5"
said I; " are you sure it. is true 2" " Yes,"
says he; "I met this morning on the street
an old acquaintance of mine, an Ar-nnarian,
who is among them." We then went to
consult together what was to be done; and
I asked my partner what he thought of the
pilot's news, and whether it would suit
with his affairs? He told me he would do
just. as I would; for he had settied all his
afi'airs so well at Bengal,and left his effects
in such good hands, that as we had ruadea
good voyage here, if he could invest it in
China silks, wrought and law, such as
might be worth the carriage, he would be
content to go to England, and then make
his voyage hack to Bengal by the Corn-
pnny's ships.

The old pilot was 02 so rnrrch service to
us that we agreed to pay him a good price
to accorupmry us, to which he consented,
and we soon made our arrangements to
start with the caravan.

It was the beginning of February, our
style, when we set out from l'ekin. My
partner and the old pilot had gone express
back to the. port where we had first put
in. to dislmse of some goods which we had
left there; and I, with aClrinese merchant
went to Nauquin, where I bought ninety
pieces of fine dalnnsks, with about two hun-
dred pieces of other very fine silks of sev-
eral sorts. some mixed with gold. Besides
this we bought a very large quantity of
raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo
amounting, in these goods only, to about
"It": thousand five lmndred poumls ster-
li which, together with tea and some
fine calicoes, and three canicls' loads of
nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen
camels for our share, besides those we rode
Upon; which, with two or three spare
homes, and two homes loaded with pro-
visions, made us, in short, twentyvsix
camels and homes in our retinue.

The company was very great, and, as far
as l can remember, made between three
and four hundred horse, and upwards of
one hundred and twenty men, very well
armed, and provided for all events. The
company consisted of people of several
nations; but there were about sixty of
them merchants of Moscow; and to our
particular satisfaction, tive of them were

 

 

gteat experience in business, and of very
good substance.

When we had travelled one day's jours
ney, the guides, who were five in number,
called all the gentlemen and merchants~
tllat is to say, all the pacxsengeis except the
servants--to a great council, as they called
it At this council, every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common
stock, for the uccesiary expense of buying
forage on the way, where it was not other-
wise to be had, and for satisfying the
guides, getting horses, and the like: and
here they constituted the journey, as they
call it, viz, they named captains and otlicen

it was a most excellent thing to keep out
the Tartais; which he happened not to
understand as I meant it, and so took it for
a compliment; but the old pilot laughed.
