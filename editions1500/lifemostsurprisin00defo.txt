PREFACE. 

IF ever the story of any private man's adven- 
tures in the world were worth making pub- 
lic, and were acceptable when published, the 
Editor of this account thinks this will be 
so. 

The wonders of this man's life exceed all 
that (he thinks) is to be found extant 3 the 
life of one man being scarce capable of a 
greater variety; 

The story is told with modesty, with seri- 
ousness, and with a religious application of 
events to the uses to which wise men always 
apply them, viz. to the instruction of others 
bythis example, and to justify and honour the 
wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our 
circumstances, let them happen how they 
will. 



IV preface: 

The Editor believes this narrative to te a 
just history of fact^ neither is there any appear- 
ance of fiction in it : and though he is well 
aware there are many who, on account of the 
very singular preservations the Author met 
with, will give it the name of romance ; yet, 
in which ever of these lights it shall be 
viewed, he imagines, that the improvement 
of it, as well as the diversion, as to the in- 
struction of the reader, will be the same^ and 
as such, he thinks, without farther compli-. 
ment to the world, he does them a great 
service in the publication.

OP 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I WAS born at York, in tho year 1G52. of a rcpufcble fa''- 
mily. My father was a naiive of Bremen, who by mer. 
chandizing at Hull for some time, gained a very plentiful 
fortune. He married my mother at York, who received 
her first breath in that country; and as her maiden name 
was Robinson, I was called Robinson Kreutznaer ; which not 
being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we ara 
commonly known by the name of Crusoe. 

I was ii\Q youngest of three brothers. The eldest was n 
lieutenant-co ' in Lockhart's regiment, but slain by the 
Spaniards: what became of the other I could never learn. 

No charge or pains were wanting in my education. — 
My father designed me for the Jaw, jet nothing would 
serve me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my 
faHier, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends. 
One morning my father expostulated very warmly with m.e : 
What reason, says he, have you to leave your native coun- 
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con- 
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of 
uneasiness and uncertainty ? He recommended to me 
Augur's wish, "Neither to desire poverty nor riches:" 
that a middle state of life was the most happy, and that 
the high towering thoughts of raising our condition by wan- 
dering abroad, were surrounded with misery and danger, 
and often ended with confusion and disappointment. 1 
entreat you, nay, I command you, (says he) to desist from 
these intentions. Consider your elder brother, who laid 
down his life for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobe- 
dience to my will. If you will go (added he) my prayers 
ghall however be offered for your preservation; but a timtr 
iH^y come, when desolate, oDpressed, or forsaken, you

may wlsliyoii had taken your'poor despised father^s counsel. 
He pronounced these words with such a moTing and pater- 
tial eloquence, while Hoods of tears ran down his aged cheekj^, 
^hat it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But 
this soon wore off, and a little after I informed my mother, 
thv^t I couklnot settle to asiy business, my resolutions were 
$0 strong to see the world ; and begged she would gain my 
-father's consent only to go one voyage; which if it did not 
prove prosperous, i would never attempt a second. But my 
desire was as vain as my folly in asking. My mother pas- 
sionately expressed her dislike of this proposal, telling me 
*' That as she saw i was bent upon my own destruction, con- 
^* trary to their will and my duty, she would say no more, 
-^^ but leave me to myself to do whatever I pleased." 

I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one time be- 
ing at Hull, I met a school-fellow of mine going along with 
Ms father, who was master of a ship, to London ; and ac- 
ijuaicting him with my wandering desires; he assured m.e of 
a. free passage, and a plentiful share of what was necesi^ary^ 
Thug, without imploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my 
parents, I took shipping on the first of September, 1651. We 
Srtt sail soon after, and our ship had scarce left the Humber 
a-stern, when there arose so violent a storm, that being ex- 
tremely sea-sick, I concluded the judgment of God desery- 
edly followed me for my disobedience to my dear parents. 
It was then I called to mind the good advice of my father; 
Iiow easy and comfortable w^s a middle state of life ; and 
I firmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry }an4 
onre more, I would return to my parents, implore their for- 
giveness, and bid a final adieu to my wandering inclinations. 

Sucli were my thoughts while the storm continued ; but 
these good r^'^olutions decreased with the dinger; more 
c;gpecially when n^y companion came to me. clapping me on 
the shoulder: *^ Wha<, Bobl" said he, ".sure you was not 
^' frightened last nighr yivh scarce a capful of wmd ? " — 
^' And do you," cried I, ^' call such a violentstorm a ca^^ful 
^' of wind ?" '' A storm you fool you," said he, " this is no^ 
'-ining; a goi.tl ship and sea-room always baffles such a

good resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promises 

made ia mj distress : and whenever any retlectioiLs would* 
return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, X 
soon mastered those fits, as I deridiiigly called them. But 
this only made way for another trial, whereby I ouid not 
but see how much I was beholden to kind Providence. 

Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich 
road, where we lay wind-bound with some Newcastle ships i 
and there being good ancliorage, and our cables sound, the 
seamen forgot their late toil and danger, aad spent the time- 
as merry as if they had been on shore. But on thecighth day 
there arose a brisk gale of wind, which prevented our ddmg. 
it up the river ; and still increasing, our ship rode forecastl*^ 
in, and shipped several large seas. 

It was not long before horror seized the seamen them- 
selves, and I heard the master express tJiis melancholy 
ejaculation, '' Lord have mercy upon us, we shall be all lost 
and undone!" For my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin, 
till the universal and terribly dreadful ap:M"ehensions of our 
speedy fate made me get upon deck; and there I was af- 
frighted indeed. The sea went mouiuains high: 1 could 
see nothing but distress around us; two ships had cut their 
masts on board, and another was foundered; two more that 
J»ad lost their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the- 
ocean: and to save oar lives we were forced to cut our 
foremast and Tuainmast quite away. 

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of irry (freadfuj 
condition ? I was but a fresh water sailor, and therefore it 
seemed more terrible. Our ship Avas very good, but over- 
loaded ; which made the sailors often cry out. ^' She woulC 
*' founder !" Words I then was ignorant of. All' this while 
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the master and 
the most sober part of his men went to prayers, expecting 
death every moment. In the middle of the night one cried 
out, *' We had sprung a leak ; another, " That there was 
'' four feet water in the hold.'* I was just ready to expire 
with fear, when immediately all hands were calted to the 
pump ; and the men forced me also in that extremity to 
share with them in their labour. While thus employed, the 
master espying some light colliers, fired a gun as a sigual oT 
distress; and 1, not understanding what it meant, and think- 
ing that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing hap» 
peiiedj fell into a swoon. Even in that con)mon coaditiou..

of TToe, nobody minded me, excepting to thursfc me aside 
irith their feet, tliiuking me dead, and it was a great while 
■before I recovered. 

Happy it was for us, when upon the signal given, they 
ventured out their boats to save our liyes. All our pumping 
had been in vain, and vain had all our attempts been, had they 
not come to our ship's side, and our men cast them a rope over 
the stern with a buoy to it, which aftpr great labour they got 
hold of, and we hauling them up to us, got into their boat, 
and left our ship, which we perceived sink within less than a 
quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what was meant by 
foundering at sea. And now the men incessantly laboured to 
recover their ovv n ship; but the sea ran so high, and the wind 
blew so hard, that they thought it convenient to hale within 
shore: which, with great difficulty and danger, at last we 
happily elfected, landing at a place called Cromer^ not far 
from Winrerton light-house; from whence we all walked to 
Yarmouth, where as objects of pity, many good oco le fur- 
nished us wirh necessaries to carry us either to Hull or London. 

Strange, after all this, like the prodigal son, I did not re- 
turn to my father; who hearing of ihe ship's calamity, for a 
long time thought me eqtombed in the deei/. No doubt 
but I should have shared on hi latted calj\ as the ^criiture 
cxpresseth it ; but my ill fate still pushed me on, in spite of 
the pou'crful convictions of reason and onscience. 

When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met my 
old comi>anion, who had given me the invitation to go on 
board along wi^h his fariier. His behaviour and speech 
were aUered, and in a melancholy manner asked me how I 
did, telling his father who I wa-, and how I had made this 
voyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Ur^on 
winch the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said, 
'• Young man, you ought nover to go to sea any more, but to 
*' take this for a certain >ign that you never will i-rosperin 
^' a seafaring condidon." "Sir," answered I, "will you 
*' take the same resolution?" '• It is a differeiit case," said 
he, "it is my calling, and consequently my duty; but as 
*' you have made this voyage for a trial, you see what ill 
^' success Heaven has set before your eyes; and perhaps 
*' our mi*^eries have been on your account, \\\lc Jonah in the 
•"' -hip of Tar hi h. But |>ray what are you, and on what 
<' acc')\int did you go to sea?" U on whirh 1 very freely 
declared my whole story : at the end of which he made this 



or ROBIN^SO!* CRlTSOEr V 

exclamation: ^^ Ye sacred powers: what had I commiftedy 
*' that such a wretch should enter into my shi}>to heapupoii 
*' me such a deluge of miseries I'* But soon recoliect^ing^ 
his passion, " Young man," said he, " if you do not go back ^ 
*' depend upon it, wherever you go, you will meet with 
'' disasters and disappointments till your father's words are 
" fulfilled upon you" And so we p-artcd^ 

I thought at first to return home ; but shame opposed thafe 
good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by my neigh- 
bours and acquaintance. So strange is the nature of ymith,. 
"uho arc not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to repent;, and 
so far from being ashamed of those actions for which tlu-y 
may be accounted fools, they think it folly to return to their 
duty, which is the principal mark of wisdom. In short. I 
trarelled up to London, resolving upon a voyage; and .t 
voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaintance with a captains 
■who took a fancy to me, to go to (he coast of Guinea, llav- 
ing some money, and appearing like a gentleman, 1 went 
on board, not as a common sailor or foremast man ; nay,, 
the commander agreed I should go that voyage with hini: 
without any expense; that I should be his messmate and 
€0111} anion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing; 
■with me, and make the best merchandise I could, 

I blessedmy happy fortuncf and humbly thanked my cap- 
fain for this otler : and acquainting my friends in York,' hi re,, 
forty pounds were sent me, the greatest part of which my 
dear father and mother contributed to, wi^th which 1 bongjit 
toys and trifles, as the ca;>tain directed me. My ca; lasn 
also taught me navigation, how to- keep an account of the 
ship's course,, take an observation, a^id led me into the know-^ 
ledge of several useful branches of the mathematics. i\nd 
indeed this voyage made me botb a saik>r and a merchan;,; 
for 1 brought home five pounds nine ounces of gt>ld dust for 
my adventure, which produced at ray return to I^jndon, 
almost three hundred pounds. But in this voyage 1 \va* ex.. 
trenifly sick, being thrown into a violent caleniure through 
the excessive heat, trading u})oiv the coai>t from the latituda 
of fifteen degrees north, even to the line I'self.. 

But alas! my dear friend, the captain^, soon departed lihrs 
Ufc after his arrival. This was a .sen^ible grief to uit: yet 
I resolved to go another voyage with his roate,, v.jio had 
HOW got command of the ship. This ijroved a 'very '.;-fi-^;:c- 
ccsbful one* for thouj^h 1 did not cairj qjjtiiv i iiuadiittS

pounds of my late acquired wealth, (so that I had two hun^ 
dred pounds left, which I reposed with the Captain's widow, 
who was an honest gentlewoman) yet my misfortunes in 
this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sailing 
towards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Saiee 
rover ; and in spite of all the haste we could make, by crowd- 
ing as much canvass as our yards could spread, or our masts 
carry, the pirate gained u'jon us, so that we prepared our- 
selves to fight. They had eighteen guns, and we had but 
twelve. About three in the afternoon there was a desperate 
engagement, wherein many were killed and wounded on 
both sides; but finding ourselves overpowered with nu^n- 
bers, our ship di'^abled, and ourselves too impotent to have 
the least hopes of success, we were forced to surrender ; and 
accordingly were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee. 
Our men were sent to the Emperor's court to be sold there; 
but the pirate captain taking notice of me, kept me to be his 
own slave. 

In this condition, I thought myself the most miserable 
<ireature on earth, and the prophecy of my father came afresh 
in'^o my thoughts. Ho'*vevcr, my condition was better than 
I thought it to be, as will soon appear. Some hopes indeed 
I had that my new patron would go to sea again, where he 
might betaken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and 
ihen I should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken; i 
for he never took me with him, but left me to look after his l 
little garden, and do the drudgery of his house, and when he 
returned from sea, would make me lie in the cabin, and 
look after the ship. I had no one that I could communicate 
my thoughts to, which were continually meditating my 
escape; no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman here, but 
myself; and for two years I could see nothing practicable, 
but only pleased myself with the imagination. 

After some length of time, my patron, as I found, grew so 
poor that he could not fit out his ship as usual ; and then he 
used constan'ly, once or twice a week, if the weather was 
fair, to go out a fishing, taking me andayoungMoresco boy 
to row the boat ; and so much pleased was he with me for 
my dexterity in catching the fish, that he would often send 
mt with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and the Mo- 
resco youth, to catch a dish of fish for him. 

One morning, as we were at the sport, there arose such 
. ft, thick fog; that we lost sight of the shore i and rowing wie 



or ROBINSON CRU<:0^. 11 

knew not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the 
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues from 
land. However, wc attained there at length, and made the 
greater haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly sharp 
and hungry. In order to prevent such disasters for the 
future, my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little state 
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a place 
behind it to steer and hale home the main sheet, wifh other 
conveniences to keep in from the weather, as also lockers to 
put in all manner of provisions, with a handsome shoulder 
of mutton sail, gibing over the cabin. 

In this he frequently took us out a fishing ; and one time 
inviting two or three persons of distinction to go wi^h him, 
made provisions extraordinary, providing also three fusees, 
with powder and shot, that they might have some sport at 
fowling along the sea-coast. The next morning the boat 
was made clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every 
thing ready ; but their minds altering, my patron ordered 
ws to go a fishing, for that his guests would certainly sup 
with him that night. 

And now I began to think of my deliverance indeed. In 
order to this I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions 
on board, as not daring to meddle with our patron's ; and 
he taking my advice, we stored ourselves with rusk biscuit, 
and three jars of water. Besides, I private ly conveyed 
into the boat a bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a ham- 
mer, hatchet, and a saw ; and, in particular, some bees wax, 
which was a great comfort to me, and served to make can- 
dles. I then persuaded Muley (for so was the Moor called) 
to procure some powder and shot, pretending to kill sea cur- 
leus, which he innocently and readily agreed to. In short, 
being rrovided with all things necessary, we sailed out, re- 
solving for my own part to make my escape, though it should 
cost me my life. 

When we had passed the castle, we fell a fishing ; but 
though I knew there was a bite, I dissembled the matter, in 
order to put out further to sea. Accordingly we ran a league 
further; when giving the boy the helm, and pretending to 
stoop for something, I seized Muley by surprise and threw 
him overboard. As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon 
arose, and made towards the boat; ui)on which, I took out 
a fusee, and :;resentcd at him: "Muley," said 1, " I ni-ver 
"yet designed to do you any harm, and seek nothing now

'^ but my redemption. I know you are able enough to swirri 
^' to shore, and save j^our life; but if you are resolved to 
^' follovr nic, to the endangering of mine, the very moment 
'^ you proceed, I v/ill shoot you through the head." The 
harmless creature at these words, turned himself from me^ 
and I make no doubt got safe to land. Then turning to the 
boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at the action; but I put 
him out of all fear, telling him. that if he would be true and 
faithful to mc, I would do well by him. " And therefore,'* 
said [, " you must stroke your face to be faithful ; and, as the 
^' Turks have learned you, swear by Mahomet, and the beard 
'' of your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also.'* 
So innocent did the child then look, and w ith such an oblig- 
ing smile consented, that I readily believed him, and from 
that day forward began to love him entirely. 

We then pursued our voyage; and lest they should think 
me gone to the Straits' mouth, I kept to the southward to 
the truly Barbaiian coast; but in the dusk of the evening, I 
changed my course, and steering directly S. and by E. that, I 
might keep near the shore; andhaving a fresh gale of wind, 
with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o'clock next day I was 
one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's 
dominions. Yet still having the dreadful apprehension of 
being retaken, I continued sailing for five days successively, 
till such time as the wind shifting to the southward, made me 
conclude, "^hat if any vessel was in chase of me, they would 
proceed no farther. After so much fatigue and thought, I 
anchored at the mouth of a little river, 1 knew not w hat or 
where ; neither did I then see any people. What I principally 
wanted was fresh Avater; and 1 was resolved about dusk to 
swim ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds of night 
begin to succeed the declining day, when we heard such 
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, that one 
might have thought the very strongest monsters of nature, or 
infernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, almost 
dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore that night. 
^' Supposing I don't, Xnry^" said I, " and in the morning we 
'' should see men who are worse than those we fear, what 
^'then?""Odenw'emay givedemdeshootgun," repliedXuryj 
langhing, "anddegunmakedemall runaway." Thewitand 
broken English which the boy had learned among fhe captives 
of our nation, pleased me entirely; and to add to his cheer- 
fubaess^ I gave him a dram of thie bottle ;^ we could get bust

Oi" K0BIS30N CRUSOE. 1^ 

Kttle sleep all the night far those terrible how lings they made ; 
and, indeed, ^e were both very much atirighted, when, by 
the rollings of the water, and other tokens, we justly con- 
cluded one of those monsters made towards our boat. I could 
not see, till it came within two oars length, when taking my 
fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit hira or no, I cannofc 
tell; but he made towards the shore, and the noise of my 
gun increased the sturiendous noise of the monsters. 

The next morning I was resoked to go on shore to get 
fresh water, and venture my life among the beasts or savages, 
should either attack me. Xury said, he would take one of 
the jars and bring me some. I asked hiK5, w hy he would 
go, and not I ? The poor boy answered, " If w ild mans come, 
they eat me, you go a-.vay." A mind scarcely now to be 
imitated, so contrary to self-preservation, the most powerful 
law of Nature. This indeed increased my atiections to the 
child. " Well, dear Xury, '• said I, '' Ave w ill both go ashore, 
bo^h kill wild mans, and they shall eat neither of us." So 
giving Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram, we 
waded ashore, carrying nothing wi h us but our arms, and 
two jars for water 1 did not go out of sight of the boat, as 
dreading the savages coming down the river in their canoes; 
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile in the 
country, he wandered to it: and <hen running back to mo 
•with great precipitation, I thought he was uursued by some 
savage or wild beast; upon which I approached, resolving 
to perish or protect hira from danger. As he came nearer 
tome, Isaw something hanging over his shoulders, which 
■was a creature he had shot like a^hare, but dillerent in colour, 
and longer legs; however we were glad of it, for it proved 
wholesome and nourishing meat: but what added to our joy- 
was, my boy assured me there was plenty of water, and that 
he ^ee no icild manf. And greater s'ill was our comfort, when 
the tide was out, without going so far up into the country. 

In this place I began to consider that the Canary and Cape 
de Verde islands lay not far oft ; but having no instrument, 
I knew not w hat latitude, or when to stand off to sea for 
them; yet my hop»es were I should meet some of the Eng- 
lish trading vessels, who would relieve and take us in. 

The place I was in was no doubt that m ild country, in- 
habited only by a fcw^ that lies between the Emperor of 
Morocco's dominions and the Negroes. I^ is filled with 
Wild beasts, and the Moors use itfor hunting chielly. Fron\ 



14 LIFE AND ACVEXTURE3 

tills place I thought I saw the, top of the mountam Tcneriff- 
in the Canaries; which made ine try twice to attain it ; 
but as oftfn was I drove back, and so forced to pursue my 
ibrtunc along shore. 

Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little 
'point of land, but pretty high : and the tide beginning to 
flow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose 
youthful and penetrating eyes Avere sharper than mine, in a 
soft tone, desired me to keep far from land, lest we should 
be devoured, ^' For look yonder, raayter," said he, ''and see 
*' de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de hill." — . 
Accordingly looking where he pointedj I espied a fearful 
monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that lay on 
;ghore, covered as it were by a shade of a piece of the hill. 
, v**Xury,'* said I,'' You shall go on shore a\id kill him." But 
the boy looking amazed: ''Me kill himl" says he, '-he eat 
Tne at one mouth;" meaning one mouthful. Upon which I 
bid him lie still, and charged my biggest gun Avith two 
islugs, and a good charge of powder, I took the best aim I 
©ould to shoot him through the head, but his leg lying over 
hisnose, the slug broke his knee bone. The lion avv^akiug 
^vith the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the most 
hideous groan I ever heard: but taking my second piece, 
I shot him througli the head, and then he lay struggling for 
life. Upon this Xury took heart, and desired my leave to 
^o on shore. " Go then," said I. Upon which taking it 
little gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the other, and 
coming close to the lion, put a period to his life by shooting 
Itirn again through the head. 

But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh 
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, and 
comes on board for a hatchet, to cut oft' the head of his eni^- 
my ; but not having strength to perform it, he cut oiF and 
brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that his skin 
would be of use. This work cost Xury and me a whole 
day; when spreading it on the top of our cabin the hot 
beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days time, and 
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on. 

And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our pro» 
visions, and went no oftener on shore than we were obliged 
for fresh water. My design was to make the river Gambia 
or Senegal, or anywhere about the Cape de Verde, in hopes 
to meet some European ship. If P^vidence did not so (jx^^ 



^diiT me, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose 
•my life amougst the Negroes. And, in a word, I put my 
T\'hole stress upon this,*- Either that I must meet with 
some ship or certainly peri';h." 

One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand 
on the shore looking at us; we could also perceive they 
were black and vtark naked. I was inclined to go on shore^ 
but Xury cried, ''No no;" however, I approached nearer, 
and 1 fonnd they run along the shore by me a good way. 
Tliey bad* no weapons in their hands, except one, who held 
a long stick, wliich Xury told mc was a lance, with which 
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to "them by sign«5 
and made them sensible I wanted something to eat; they 
beckoned me to stop my boat, while two of them ran up 
into the country, and in less than half an hour came backy 
and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some 
corn, which we kindly accepted; and (o prevent any fears 
on either side, they brought the food to' the shore, laid it 
down, then went and stood a great way off till Ave fetched 
jit on board, and then came close to us again. 

But while vre were returning thanks to them, being all we 
could afford, two mighty creatures came from the mountains; 
one as it were pursuing the other with great fury, which Me 
were the rather inclined to believe, as they seldom appear 
but in tha night; and both these swiftly passing by the ne- 
groes, jumped into the sea, wantonly swimming about, aS 
though the diversion of the waters had put a stop to their tierce, 
ness. At last one of them coming nearer to my boat than I 
expected or desired, I shot him direct ly through the head : u pon 
which he sunk im.mediately, yet rising again, would have 
willingly made the shore; but' between the wound and the 
strangling of the water, he died before he could reach it. 

It is impossible to express the consternation the poor Ne- 
groes were in at the firing of ray gun; much less can 1 men- 
tion their sun rise, when they preceived the creature to be 
ilam by it. I made signs to them to dr;<w near it with a 
rope, and then gave it them to hale on shore. It was a beau- 
"lUiA leopiird. which n;ade me desire its skin: and the Ne- 
Tpj. s seeuing to coret the carcase, 1 freelj gave it to them. 
\s f )r the other leo;;ard, it made ro shore, and ran with pro-

days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Verde, and tho?t5 
islands called by its name. But the great distance I was from 
it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my reaching 
them, I began to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon 
a sudden, Xury cried out," Master! Master! a ship with a 
Sail!" and looking as atfrighted as if it was his master's ship 
sent in seaich of us. But I soon discovered she was a PorJ 
tuguese ship, as I thought bound to the coast of Guinea for 
Negroes. Upon which I strove for life to come up to them. 
But Tain had it been, if through their perspective glasses they 
had not perceived me and shortened their sail to let me come 
U.J. Encouraged at ♦his, 1 set up my patron's ancient, and 
fired a g'ln, both as sign.ils of distress; upon which they 
ver) kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came up 
with them. They spoke to me in Portugucs-e, Sranish, and 
French, but neither of these did I understand ; rill at length 
a Scots sailor called, and then 1 told him L was an English- 
man, who had esca;ed from the JNioors at Salee; upon 
avhich they took me kindly on board, with all my effects 

Surely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at 
this harpy deliverance! who from being a late miserable 
and forlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour 
with the master of the ship, to whom in return for my de- 
livernace, I offered all I had. '' God forbid," said he, 
'' that I should take any thing from you. Every thing shall 
'' be delivered to you when you come to Brazil. If 1 have 
^' saved your life, it is no more than I should expect to re- 
^' ceive myself from any other, when in the same circum 
** stance I should happen to meet the like deliverance.— 
*' And should I take from you what you have, and leave you 
*' at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away a life I 
*' had given. My charity teaches me better. Those ettects 
" you have will support you there, and provide you a pas J 
*' sage home again." And, indeed, he acted with the strictJ 
est justice in what he did, taking my things into his possesJ 
sion, and giving me an exact invenrory, even to my eartheu 
jars He bought ray boat of me for the ship's use, giving 
me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil ; and 
if any body offered more he would make it up. lie also 
gave me sixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with great 
reluctance I was prevailed u' on to sell the child's liberty^ 
who had served me so faithf»=ll) ; but the boy was wilbntf 
'^imself; anditwa» agreed, that after ten years h« shouM

be made free, upon his renouncing jMahomctanism, and 
embracing Christianity. 

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in 
the Bav de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty 
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generoKS 
treatment of the captain. - lie would take nothing for my 
lassage, gave me twenty di'cats for the leoj^ard's skin, and 
thirty for the lion's. Every thing he caused to be delivered, 
and what I would sell he bought. In short I made about 
2e0 pieces of my cargo; and with this stock I catered 
once more, as 1 may say, into the scene of life. 

Being recommended to an honest planter, I lived with 
him till such time as 1 was informed of the manner of their 
planting and making sugar; and seeing how well they 
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I v, as filled with a 
de?ire to settle among them, an.d resolved to get my money 
remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation. 

To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to an honest 
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of English parents, 
whose plantation joining to mine, we improved it very ami- 
cably together. Both our stocks were low, and for two 
years we planted only for food: but the third year we 
planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a large piece 
of ground the ensuing year for planting canes. But now 
I found how much I wanted assistance, and repented the 
loss of my dear boy Xury 

Having none to assist me, my father's words came into 
my mind; and I u«ed to ask myself, if what 1 sought was 
only a middle station of life, why could it not as well be ob- 
tained in England as here? "When I pondered on this with 
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook me. I 
had none to converse with but my neighbour: no work to be 
done but by my own hands; it often made me say, my con- 
dition was like to that of a man cast upon a desolate island. 
So uuhappy are we in our reilections, so forgetfiil of what 
good things Me receive ourselves, and so unthankful for 
our deliverance from those calamities that others cndiire. 

I was in some measure settled, before the captain who* 
took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went i-j 
him, and told him what stock I had in London, desirirg his 
assi.^tance in getting it reu.ittcd; to which the good giinle- 
man readily consented, but M'ould only have me send for 
half my money^ lest it should miscaaTy: which if it did I

flight still have the remainder to support me: and so taking 
letters- of procuration of nie, bid me trouble myself no fart 
Iher about it. 

And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me; for 
he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon mf 
captain's widow, but sent me over a servant with a cargo 
proportionable to my condition. He also sent me over 
tools of all sorts, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my 
plantation, which proved to be of the greatcs. use to mc 
in my business. 

"Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon success 
crowning my prosperous labours, I might have rested happy 
in that middle state of life my father had so often rccom'. 
inend4^d:yet nothing would content me , such was my evil 
genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a foolish am- 
bition in rising; and thus, once more I cast myself into the 
€;reatest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into. 
Having lived four years in Brazil, 1 had not only learned 
the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most 
rminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvador; 
to whom, oncCj by way of discourse, having given account 
of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, and the manner 
of trading there for mere triHes, by which we furnish our 
plantation with ntgroeSj they gave such attention to what I 
#aid, that three of them came one morning to me, and told 
ine they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me 
to secrecy (it being an infringem.ent on the powers of the' 
kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind 
to tit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plan- 
tation with Negroes, v, hich as they could not be publicly 
field, they would divide among them.; and if I would go 
their super-cargo in.the ship to manage the trading part," I 
.'•hould ha've an equal share of the Negroes, without provid- 
ing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough had I 
been in another co*!dition. 33ut I was born to be my own 
destroyer, could nof resist the proposal, but accepted the of- 
tnr upon condition of th^'ir looking after my plantation. So 
making a formal will, i bequea(acd my etiects to my ^sood 
friend ihc captain, as n\v universal heir; but obliged him 
to dis}:.ose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce 
to hii'i.self, and the otlier to be shiin-ed to England. 

The shi.- being fitted out, and all things ready, we set 
Bail the liist of September^ 1059, being the same day eight

vcars T left my father and mother in Yorkshire We sailed 
north'vvard upon the coast, ia order to gain Africa, till Ave 
ir.ade Cape Augustine; from whence going farther into th(? 
ocean out of sight of land, we steered as though we Mcrti 
bound for the isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands^ 
on the east ; and then it was that we met with a terribler 
tempest, which continued for twelve days successively, so 
that the winds carried us wheresoever they pleased. In this 
perplexity one of our men died, and one man and a boy 
were washed overboard. When the weather cleared up a 
little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north latitude, upori 
the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave reasons 
for returning; which I opposed, counselling him to stand 
away for Barbadoes, w hich, as I supposed, might be attained 
in Ijfteen days. So altering our course, we sailed north- 
west and by west, in order to reach the Leeward islands ; 
but a second storm succeeding, drove us to the westward; 
so that we were justly afraid of falling into the hands of 
cruel savage:^, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey. 

In this great distress, one of our men, early in the morn- 
ing cried out, •'• Land, land!" which he had no sooner cried 
out, but our ship struck upon a sand-bauk, and in a moment 
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that Me expected 
we should all have i)erishcd immediately. We knew no- 
thing where we were, or upon what Und we were driven ; 
whether an island or the main, inhabited or not inhabited ; 
and we cou id not so much as hope that the ship would holdout 
many minutes, without breaking in pieces, except the wind 
by a miracle, should turn about immediately. While wc 
stood looking at one another, expecting death every moment 
the mate lays hold of the boat, and v.ith the help of the rest 
got her flung over the ship's side, and getring all into her, 
bring eleven of us, committed ourselves to God's roerc}' and 
trie wild sea. And now we saw that this last effort would 
i:'^t be sufiicient protection from death; so high did the sea 
; -.e, that it was impossible the boat should live. As to 
o^aking sail, avo had none; neither if w'e had, could wo 
make use of any. So that Avhen we had rowed, or rather 
weredriven about a league and a half, a raging wave, like 
a lofty mountain, came rolling a-s(ern of us, and took us 
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. Thus being^ 
swalloM ed up ia a moment, we had hardly time to call upoa 
t.to tremendous nar^ie of God ; much le^s to implore, in dying.

Men are generally counted insensible when struggling _ 
the pangs of death; but while I was overwhelmed with 
water, I had the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable. 
For the joys of iieaven and the torments of hell, seemed to 
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and 
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death, 
I was going I thought I knew nat whither, into a dismal 
gulph unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold 
my friends, nor tl>e light of this world any more! Could I 
even h-ave thought of annihilation, or a total dissolution of 
soul as well as body, the gloomy thoughts of having no far- 
ther being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an 
eternal qiueius^ without life or sense: even that, I say^ 
would have been enough to strike ma w ith horror and con- 
fusion! I strove, however, to th^ kist extremity, while all 
my companions w^ere overpowered and entombed in the 
deep : and it was with great ditficulty I kept my breath till 
the wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me on the f horc 
half dead with the wa,ter I had taken in. As soon as I got 
OQ my feet, 1 ran as fast as I could, least another wave 
sho'ild pursue me, and carry me back again. But for all 
the haste I made, I could not avoid it: for the sea came 
after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy ; so that 
my business was ta hold ray breath, and by raising myself 
on the welter, preserve it by swimming. The next dread- 
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep but at 
i\\Q same time carried me with a mighty force and swiftness 
towards the shore; when raising myself, I held out as well 
as possible, till at length i^wQ wafer having spent itself, be- 
gan to return, at which I struck forward and feeling ground 
with my feet, I took to my heels again. Thus being served 
twice more, 1 was at length dashed against a piece of rock^ 
in sucii a manner as left me senseless : but recovering a 
little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would 
then have overwhelmed me, I held fast by the rock till those 
succeeding waves abated ; and then fetching another ran ^ 
was overtaken by a small wave, which was soon conquered. 
But before any more could overtake me, I reached the main 
' Jand, w^here clambering up the clifts of the shore, tired and 
almost spent 1 sat down on the grass, free from the dangers 
of the foaming ocean. , 

No tongue can express the ecstasies and transports that 
my soul felt at the happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve

a dying malefactor, with a halter about hiinccV, and 
ready- to be turned otf. I was wrai)t up in conrcmplation, 
and often lifted up my hands, with the profoundcst humility,^ 
to the Divine Powers, for saving my life, Mhen the rest of 
my companions were all drowsed. And n >w I began to 
(it my eyes aronnd, to bvhold what place I was in, and 
w :>ac 1 had next to do. I co'ild see no house nor peaple ; I 
was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me; hungry and thirst^-y 
y^t had notiiing to eat or drink : no wea]>on to destroy any 
creatures for my sustenance, nor defend my-erf agaiust de- 
vouring beasts ; in short, I had nothing but a knife ,^ a 
tobacco-pipe, and a box half filled with totjacco. The 
darksome night coming on upon me, increased my fervrs of 
being devoured by wild creatures; my mind was plunged 
in despair, and having no prospect, as I thought, of life be- 
fore me, 1 prepircd Ibr another kind of death than what I 
had lately escaoed. I walked about a furlong to see if I 
could find any fresh water, which I did to my great joy; 
and taking a quid' of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up 
into a thick bushy Ucc, and seating myself so that I c ;iild 
not fall, adeej) sleen overtook me, and for that niglU buried 
iny sorrows in a quiet rjpoce. 

It M^as broad day the next morning before I awaked ; 
when 1 not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw 
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned,. 
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was 
about a mile from the place where I was. When I came 
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's^ 
boat two milcr distant mi my right-hand, lying on shore, as 
the waves had cast her. I thought to iiave got ta her ; but 
there being an inlet o^f water of about half a mile^s breadtli 
between it and me, I retaraed again towards the shio, as 
hoping to find something for my more iinmedialely subsistence^ 
About noon, when the sea was calm, that 1 could come 
within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to ray grief that I 
perceived, that if we had l:ept on board all our li\cs had 
been saved. These thoughts, and my solitude, drew tears 
from my eyes, though all in vaYn. So resolving to get to 
the ship, I stripped and leapt into the water, when swim, 
ming round her, I was afraid I should not get any thing to 
liy hold of; but it was my good fortune to espy a small 
piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that, by 
the help of it^ though with great difficulty. I got into tli

forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was 
bulged, and had a great deal of water iji her hold; her stern' 
was lifted u!) against a bank, and her head almost to the 
■water. All her quarter, and what was there, was free and 
drj. The provisions 1 found in good ordcr^ ^\ith which I 
cramreed my pc-ckets^*\ and losing no time,. ate while I was 
doing ather things ; I also found some rum, of which I took 
a hearty dram ; and now I wanted for nothing except a 
boat, vvhich indeed was all, to carrjc a^way what was need- 
ful for me. / ''''^- ' -^ • fc^, ^,\, ///j/c (- "^h- .'i n ^ 

Necessity occasions quickness of thought. We had se- 
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three 
large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and sluug 
as many of them overboard as I could managCj tying every 
one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away. 
This done I went down to the ship's side, and tied four of 
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying 
two or three short pieces of plank upon them crosswise, I 
found it would bear me, but not any considerable weight. 
Upon which I went to v/ork again, cuftiag a spare topmast 
into three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal 
of labour and pains. I then considered what I should load 
it with, it being not able to bear a ponderous bnrihen. And 
this I soon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks and 
bDards I could get ; next I lowered down three of the sea- 
men^s chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice, three 
Dutch cheeses, live pieces of dried goat's flesh, and some 
3*]uropean corn, what little the rats had spared; and for 
■ liquors, I- foisnd several cases of bottles belonging to out 
skipper, in^ which were some cordial waters, and four or 
Jive gailoiis of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By 
this time the tide beginning to How, I perceived my coat, 
waistcoat, and shirt, swim away, which I had left on the 
shore;: as for my linon-breeches and stockings, I swam with- 
t hem to the ship ; but I soon found clothes enough, though I 
took no more than I wanted for the present* My eyes were 
chiefly on tools to work with; and, after along search, I 
fou«d out tlje carpenter's chest, which I got safe dowii on 
ray raf:. 1 then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the 
great cabin found two good fowling-pieces, two pistols, se- 
veral powder-horns tilled, a small bag of shot, and two old 
rusty swords. 1 likewise found three barrels of powder, 
two of which were good^ but the third had taken water. 



or noBixs^oJf^ crusoe. -•> 

also two or throe ])rowen oars, two sqavs, an ax, and a hani- 
nicr. I then put to sea, aiid in getting to shore had three 
enroiiragements. 1. A smooth calm sea. •2. Tlie tide 
rising and setting in to shore. 3. The little wind there was 
blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a mile, I 
found the raft to drive a little distance from the ];Iace where 
I first landed: and then I perceived a little opening of the 
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it: up- 
on which I kept the middle of the stream. But great wa* 
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran 
aground, so that had I not, with great diiTiculty, for near 
half an hour, kept my back straining agaim^t the chests to 
keep my effects in their places, all I had would i\ave gone 
into <he sea. But after some time, the rising of the Avatcr 
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a little river 
with land on both sides, 1 landed in a little cave, as near the 
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any such 
providentially passed that way. 

Not far ofi", I espied a hill of stupendous height, sur. 
rounded with lesser hills about it, and thither 1 was resolved 
to go and view the country, that I might see what part 
was best to tix my habitation. Accordingly, arnnng my- 
self with a pistol, a fowling-]nece, powder and bali, I a"- 
cended the mountain. There I rerceived I was in an island, 
encompassed by the sea , no distant lands to be seen but 
scattering rocks that lay to the west: that it seemed to 
be a barren place, and as I thought, inhabited only by wild 
beasts. I perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of 
what kind, or whether good for nourishment ; I shot one of 
them at my return, which occasioned a confused screaming 
among the other birds, and! found it by its colour and beak 
to bea kind of hawk, but its llesh was pe* feet carrion. 

When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on shore, 
-which work spent that day entirely ; and fearing that some 
cruel beasts might devour me in the night time while I slept, I 
made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests and boaida 
I had brought on shore. That night I slept very comfort- 
ably; and the next morning my tiioughts were employed to 
make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away what 
necessaiies I could find, before another storm should break 
her tt; pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and 
proprifed a second raft far more nice than the first, upon 
"which I brought away the carpenter's stores^ two or three 



^4 l^lTt AND ADVENTITRES 

bags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a dozen or two of 
hatcliels, and a grind-stone. I also took awa}^ several things^ j 
that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iroiv 1 
crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another fowiing-piece, 
a small quantity of powder, and a large bagf-.d of small shot. 
Besides these, I took all the men's clothes I could find, a 
j<,)are fore to',)-sai1, a hammock, and some bedding; and 
thus comvlefing my second cargo, I made all the haste to 
fshore 1 could, fearing some wild beast might destroy what 
I had there already. But I only found a little wild cat. 
bitling' on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me 
or the g-=n that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of 
biscui<^, wl ich she instantly ate and departed. 

When I had gotten these eifects on shore. I went to work, 
in order to make me a HiHe tent with the sail and some poles 
which I had cut for thit purpose; and having iiuished it, 
what things might be damaged by the weather I brought 
in, viliug all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the 
better to foriify it against any sudden attempt of man or 
beast. Affer this I blocked up the doors with some boards, 
and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I then 
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the 
ground, slept a- comfortably, till next morning, as though I 
had been in a christian country. 

Now, though I had enough to subsist me a long time, yet 
despairingof a sudden deliverance, o* that both amniunitiori 
and provision might be spent before such thing happened, I 
coTot(?d as much as I could; and so long as the ship rcj, 
maiujd in that condition, I daily brought away one ueces-~ 
sary or other; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage, 
some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel 
of meal, three casks of rum, and, what indeed was most 
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread. 

The next time I went I cut the cables in pieces, carried 
off a hawser whole, with a great deal of iron-work, and 
nvjde another raft with the mizen and sprit-sail yard ; but 
this b> ing so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden 1 had upon 
it, and not being able so dextrously to guide it as the former, 
both rr.y cargo and I were overturnecl. For my part, ail 
the damage 1 sustained was a wet skin ; and, at low w ater, 
after much labour in diving, I got most of the cables, anid. 
fcoine pieces of iron. 

Thirteen days I had no\y been in the island, and eleven 



&t iionixsox CRUSOE. 25 

times on board, briiijSfing away all that wa-s possible; and I 
' believe had the weather been calm, I should have broiiglit 
away the whole ship piece by piece. As I was going the 
twelfth time, the wind began to rise ; however I ventured 
at low water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found 
<jveral razors, scissors, and some doz^ens of knives, and 
forks; and in another thirty-six pounds of pieces of eight, 
>ilver and gold. ''Ah! simple vanity," said I, ''whom 
*•• this world so much doats on, where is now thy virtue, thy 
"•• excellency to me? You cannot procure me one thing 
" needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a 
" place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteemed, 
^' is to me more preferable than all this heap. E'en there- 
" fore remain where thou art, to sink in the deep as unrc- 
" garded, even as a creature whose life is not worth preserv- 
" ing.''^ Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it up in a 
piece of canvas, and began to think of making anotlier rafc: 
but I soon perceived the wind began to arise, a fresh gale 
blowing from the shore, and the skv overcast with clouds 
and darkness; so thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself 
into the- water, w'ith what things J had about me, and it wa^ 
with much diliicalty I got ashore, when soon after it blew a 
fearful storm. 

That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur- 
rounded with all my eftecfcs ; but when I looked oirt in the 
morning no more ship was to be seen. This much sur- 
prised me for the present; yet, when I considered I had lost 
no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing useful 
out of her, -I comforted myself in the best manner, and en- 
tirely submitted to the will of Providence. 

IMv next thoughts were, how I should defend and secure 
myself from savages and wild beasts, if any such were in 
the island. At one time T thought of digging a cave, at 
another I was for erecting a tent ; and, at length, I resolved 
to do both: The manner or form of which will not, 1 hope* 
be unpleasing to describe. 

When I considered the ground where I was, that it was 
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, my resolutions 
were to search for a soil healthy and w^ell watered, where I 
inight not only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat, 
but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured 
froin wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to dis* 
cover any distant sail, should it ever so happen*

And, indeed, it ^vas not lonr; before J had my desire, 
found a little plain near a rising hill, the iront to'^ard; 
which being as steep as a housc-pide, nothing couid deseenc; 
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a litth 
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave, 
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I resolved 
my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed 
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de. 
jightfnl green before my door,^ with a plea-ing tLouo-h an 
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the' sea- 
side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it was 
sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I 
drew a f^emi-circle, containing ten yards in a semi-diameter^ 
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of* 
strong stakes, not six inche. from each oher. Then wi(h a 
piece of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid 
them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which 
were more than live feet out of the earth, and after drove 
another row of piles looking within side against them, be- 
tween two or three feet high, which made me conclude it a 
little impregnable castle against men and beasts. And for 
my better security I would have no door, but entered in and 
came out by the help of a ladder, which I also made. 

Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried afi 
my riches, ammunition and stores. After which, working 
on the rock, what with dirt and stones T dug out, I not 
only raised my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to 
my mansion-house ; and this cost me many days labour and 
pains. One day in particular a shower of rain falling, 
thunder and lightning ensued, Avhich put me in terror lest 
my powder should take tire, and not only hinder my ne- 
cessary- subsisrence, my killing me food, but even blown up 
me and my habitation. To })revent which, I fell to making 
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near 
1501b, v/eight. And thus being established as^ki'ng of the 
island, every day I went out with my gwn to see what I 
could kill that was fit to eat. 1 soon perceived numbers of 
goats, but very shy; yot hav^mg watched them narrowly, 
and seeing I could better shoot oif the rocks than when in 
the low grounds, I happened to shoot a she goat suckling a 
young kid; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by her 
unconcerned ; and when I took the dead creature up, the 
young one followed me even to the Inclosurc. I lifted the 



or noEiKsoN crusoe. 27 

kid oyer the pales, and would willingly hare kept it alive; 
iut finding it could not be brought to cat, I v,as forced to 
ijay it also for ray subsistence. 

Thus entering into as stransje a scene of life as er^kr any 
nan was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concern- 
ng my deidorable condition: and many times the 4ears 
rould plentifully run doM n my face, Avhcn I considered 
low I was debarred frovn all commuuication with human 
Lind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would 5ceni 
o make me accuse Providence, other good tliouglits would 
Dterposc and reprove me afrer~ this manner: Weil, suppos- 
Qg you are desolate, is it not better to be so than totally' 
lerish? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the rest 
estroyed: Why should you complain, when not only your 
ife is j)reserved, but the shi^ driven even into your reach, in 
rdt^r to take m hat was necessary out of her for your sub- 
istence? But to proceed. It was by the account I kept 
!ie 30th of September, when I first landed on this island, 
ibjut twelve days after, fearing least I should lose my 
2ckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for 
'afit ot pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a 
irge post, m great letters, and set it up, in the similitude of 
cross on the sca-?hore where I landed, / came on shore, 
epf. 30, 1659. Every day 1 cut a notch with mv knife on 
le sides of this square post, and that on the Sabbath was as 
)ng,againas the rest; and every iirst day of the month as 
•ng again as that long one. In this manner I kept my ca- 
^ndar, weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. " But 
id I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I 
^eded not have set up this mark; for among the parcels 
!longing to the gunner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I 
»und those very things I wanted ; partioularly pens, ink, 
id paper : also I found two or three compasses, some ma- 
ematical instruments, dials, perspective gl;!ssi:s, books of 
ivigation, three English Bibles, and several other good 
>o^s, which 1 carefully put up.— Here I cannot but call to 
md oar having a dog and two cats on board, whom I 
ide luhabitauits with me in my castle. Though one might 
mk I had ail the necessaries that were desrrkble, yet slill 
ound sevi>ral things wanting. My ink was daily wasting; 
wanted needles, i)in>, and thread to- mend or keep my 
^thcs together; and particularly a spade, pickax, or 
ovel; to remove the earth. It was a year before 1 tinithed

Biy little bulwark: and having some intervals of. relaxation, 
after my daily ^vandering abroad for pro\ision, I drew up

of the miseries and blessings of my life, under so many 
various circumstances.

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with my 
hatehet, making it as thin with my ax as possible, and then 
smooth enough with an adz to answer my designs : yet 
though I eould make no more this May than one board out 
of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to shelter 
all my stores, every thing being regularly placed, and my 
guns securely hanging against the side of the rock. This 
made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the result of 
vast labour and diligence; which leaving for a while, and 
me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an account 
of my Journal from the day of my landing, till the tixing 
and settling of my habitation, as heretofore shewn.

EPTEMBER 30th, 1659, I, unhappy Robinson Crusoe, 
having sulfered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate 
Island, which I named the Desolate Inland of Despair, my 
companions being swallowed up in the tem|}estuous ocean. 
The next day 1 spent in consideration of my unhappy cir- 
cumstances, having no prospect but of death, either to be 
starved with hunger, or devotired with beasts or merciless 
savages. 

Oct. 1. That morning with great comfort I beheld the 
ship drove ashore. Some hopes 1 had, that when the storm 
was abated, I might be able to get some food and neces- 
saries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be- 
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time 1 lamented 
the loss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the 
vessel. When 1 perceived (he ship as it were lie dry, i 
waded through the sands, then swam aboard, the weather 
being verj^ rainy, and with scarcely any wind. 

To the 14th of this month, my time was employed in 
making voyages, every tide getting what I could out of the 
fehij). The weather very wet and uncertain. 

Oct. 20. My raft and all the -goods thereon were over- 
set ; yet I recovered most again at low water. 

Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when 
the si*ip went in pieces, so that nothing was seen of her but 
the wreck at low water. This day I secured ray goods from 
the inclemency of the weather,

30 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Oct. ^6. I Avandered to see .where I could find a place 
<conveuieiifc for my abode. I iixed upon a rock in the even- 
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall, 
fortified with pile?, lined within with pieces of cables, and 
covered with turf. 

Nor. 1. 1 erected my lent under a rock, and took up* 
my lodgings very contentedly in a hau.mock that night. 

Nov. 2. This day 1 fenced mybcif in with timber, chests,, 
and boards- ) 

Nov. 3. T shot two wild fowls, re?cmbling ducks, which] 
were good to eat, jind in the afternoon made me a table. 1 

Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. In the morning, Jj 
allowed myself two or three hours to M'alk out with my gun ; 
I then worked till near eleven o'clock, and afterwards re- 
freshed myself v.ithwhat I had to cat. PVom twelve to' 
two I would lie down, to sleep. Extremely sultry weather, 
in the evening go to work again. 

Nov. 5^ Went out with my gnn and dog, shot a wild 
cat with a soft skin, but her liesh was good for nothing, 
'i'lie skins of those I killed, I preserved. In my return, ill 
perceived many wild birds, and was terriiicd by some seals 
^vhich made otf to sea. 

Nov. 6, Completed my table. 

Nov. 7, Fair weather. I worked till the 12th, but 
omitted the 11th, which according to my calculation, I sup- 
posed to be Sunday. 

Nov. 13. Ilain in abundance, which, however, much 
cooled the air; wirh thunder and lightning, ca.ised in m.e a 
terrible surprise. The weather clearing, 1 secured my pow- 
ider in separate parcels, 

Nov. 14' — 16. 1 made little boxes for my powder, lodg, 
jug them in several places, I also shot a large fowl, which 
proved excelknt mear, 

Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to 
(lesist for want of a pickax, shovel, and wheelbarrow. Iron 
crows I caused to sujiply the place of the first; but with all 
my art I could not nutke a wheelbarrow. 

Nov. ]?}. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling 
VI hat Bi-azilliaiis call an iron-tree. I had like to have spoiled 
juy a\' v,iih cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly 
he'avy ; yot with much labour and industry, 1 made a sort 
of a spaue out of it. 

Nov. 23, These; tools being made, I daily carri^^d on my 
biii:iiicss ; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging my cave, 



OF ROBINSON cr.usor, SI 

that it mi^lit serve mc, not only f-)r a Avarehou^, but kit- 
chon, parlour, and cellar. 1 commonly lay in the tent, un- 
less the weather was rainy that 1 coiilU not lie dry. So wet 
Mould it be at certai»i seasons, that 1 was obliged to cover 
all witliin the i^ale Mith long polo^, in the form of rafters, 
leaning against the rock, and loaded thjm witli Ihrgs and 
large leaves of trees, resembling a thatch. 

Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation finished, 
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that it was 
a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. This occasioned x 
great deal of pains and trouble to lue^ before I could make 
it linn and durable. 

Doc. 17. I nailed up some shelves, and drove nails and 
Staples in the wall and posts, to hang things out of the way.. 

Dec. 20. Every tiling I got into its place, then made a 
sort of a dresser, and another table. 

Dec. 24, 25. Rain in abundance. 

Udc. 26. Verv fair weather. 

Dec. 27. 1 chanced to lighten some goat?, shot one, anci 
wounded another. I led it home in a string, bound up its 
leg, and cured it in a little time; at length it became sa 
tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and follow me 
where I pleased. This put me in mirid to bring up tamo 
creatures, in order to supply me with food after my ammu- 
nition was spent* 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. The weather being excessively hot, 
with little air, obliged me, for the most part, to keep withii* 
doors. 

Jan. 1 . Still sultry, hoAvevcr, obliged by necessity, I went 
out with my gun, and found a great store of goats in the 
Talleys ; they were exceedingly shy, nor could ray dog 
himt them down. 

Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finish the 
wall before described, and search tlie island. I discovered 
a kind of pigeons, like our house pigeons, in a ne-stamon<»- 
the rocks. I brought them heme, nursed them till they could 
fly, and then they left me. After this, 1 shot some, which 
proved excellent food. Some time I spent vainly iji con- 
triving to make a cask; I may well say it was vain, because 
I could neither joint the staves, nor iix the heads, so as to 
make it tight: So, leaving that, took some goat's tallow I 
had about nic, and a little oakum for the wick, and provided 
myself Mith a lamp, which scrveU me instea^d of candles. 



S% TATE AND ADVENTURES 

But now a very strange event happened. For being in 
tlie height of my search, what should come into my hand, . 
but a bag, Avhich used to hold corn (as I supposed) for the 
fowls; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it, I 
shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock, little 
ex|)ecting what the consequence would be. The rain had 
fallen plentifully a few days before ; and about a month 
after, to my great amazement, something began to look out 
very green and flourishing ; and when I came to view it 
more nicely every day as it grew, I found about ten or - 
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same shape 
and make as that in England. 

I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this 
sight. Hitherto, 1 had looked upon the actions of this life 
no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and 
fortune. But now the appearance of this barley, flourishing 
in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it 
should come there, made me conclude, that miracles were not 
yet ceased: nay, I even thought that God had appointed it 
to grow there without any seed, purely for my sustenance 
in this miserable and desolate island. And indeed such 
great cff'ect this had upon me, that it often made me melt 
into tears, through a grateful sense of God's mercies; and 
the greater still was my thankfulness, when I perceived 
about this little field of barley some rice stalks, also wonder- 
fully flourishing. 

While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be 
more corn in the island ; and therefore made a diligent 
search narrowly among the rocks ; but not being able to 
iind any, on a sudden it came into mind, how I had shaken 
the husks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration • 
leased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as ihinkiiig 
it li'^s hut natural., and not to be conceived a miracle ; though 
even the manner of its preservation might have made me . 
own it was a wonderful event of God's kind Providence. 

It was about the latter end of June when the ears of 
this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully together 
with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day I should reap 
the fruit of my labour; yet four, years were expired be- 
fore I could allow myself to eat any barley bread, and njuch 
longer time before 1 had any rice. After this, Avith indefa- 
tigable pains and industry, for three or four months, at last I 
iinished my wall on the 14th of April, having no way io go 
Into it; but by a ladder against the wall. 



0F ROBINSON' CRUSOtt 



35 



April 17. I finished my hdder, and ascended it ; after- 
wards pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and 
descended into my new habitation, where I had ?paci> 
enoiiirli, and so fortified that nothing- could attack irc with- 
out scaling the walls. 

But what docs all human pains aid industry avail, if ih& 
blessing of God does not crown our labours? Or Mho can> 
stand before the Almighty, when he strctcheth forth bis arm ? 
For one time cs I was at the entrance of my cave, thei'e iiap- 
p?nL'd such a dreadful carthqualvC, that not only the roof of 
the cave came tumbling about nty ears, but the posts seemed 
io crack teriibly at the same time. This put me in great 
amazement ; and running tct the ladder, and getting over the^ 
w-iU, 1 then plainly kiacw it was an earthquake ; the place I 
stood on sustained three terrible shocks in loss than thrcii 
minutes. But judze of my terror when T saw the top of a 
ereat rock roll into the sea ; I then expected the island would 
be swallowed up everv moment : And what made th^ scene 
still more dreadful, was to sec the sea thrown into the most 
violent agitations and di-orders by this tremendous accident^ 

For my part, I stood like a criminal at the place of oxecn- 
lion, ready to expire. At the moving of the earth, I w\i=^ 
as it were, sea-sick ; and very much afraid lest the rock, 
under which was my fence and habitation, should over- 
■vrhelm it and n^yself in a lasting torab^ 

When the third dreadful shock had spent itself, mj spirits 
began to revive; yet still I would not venture to ascend 
the ladder, but continued sitting, not knowing what Fshould 
do. So little grace had I (hen, as only to say, Lord have- 
mercy upon ?)ie! and no sooner was the eartliquake over^ 
but that pathetic ])raycr left me. 

It was not long after^ when a ho rribr^ tcm pest arrsse, at 
the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. The sei. 
seemed mountains high, and the waves rolled so impetuously, 
that nothing could be i ercelvcd but froth and foam. Threti^ 
hours did this storm continue, and in?o violent a manner, as 
to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was succeeded 
by abundance of rain. When iho tempest was over, 1 went 
to my ten*^ : but the rain c<.'ming on in a furious niann'-^r. I 
was obliged to take shelter in ^he cave, where I was forrcdi 
to cut a channel throughmy fartiSoation to letthe water out* 
It continued raining all that night, and some time the next 
day. These accidents made mc resolve, a^ soon as the;

n\:eathcr cleared up, to build me a little hut in some open ' 
place, M ailed round to defend me from wild creatures and 
savages; not doubting but at the next earthquake, the 
mountain would fail upon my habitation and me^ and swaU 
low up all in its bowels. 

April 16 — 20. These days T spent in contriving how 
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All 
this while I w as under the most dreadful apprehensions. — 
AVhenI looked round my habitation, every thing I found in 
its proper place. 1 had several resolutions whether I should 
move or not; but at length resolved to stay where I was till 
J found out a convenient place where 1 might pitch my tent. 

April 22. AVhen J begaii to put my resolution in prac- ; 
tice, I was stopt for want of tools and instruments to work 
'with. Most of my axes and hatchets were useless, occa- : 
sioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island. , 
It took me up a full week to make my grindstone of use to ; 
me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with my 
foot, by help of a wheel and a string. 

April 28, 29. These days were spent in grinding my tools. 

April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but 
one buiscuit a day. 

May 1. As I walked along the sea-shore, I found a barrel 
of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea had 
flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship, whose 
Ftern was tore off, and washed a great distance ashore: but 
the rest lay in the sands. This 1 supposed was occasioned' 
by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place 
of abode; and also to go to the ship that day, but theii 
found it impossible. 

JMay 3. This day I went on board, and with my saw 
Fawcd off one of the beams, which kept the quarter-deck. 
I then cleared the sand till flood. 

IMay 4. I caught some fish, but they were not wholesome. •: 
The same day I also catched a TQung dolphin. 

May 5. This day I also repaired to the w^eck, and sawed : 
another piece of timber, and when the flood came, I made 
a float of three great planks, which were driven ashore by 
the tide. 

May G, 7, 8. 9. These days I brought off the iron bolts, 
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks 
to land, hayiug" made a Tvay into the very middle of the. 
wreck. 



OF ROBIXSON CRUSOE. 33 

^Ma}- 10, 11. 12, 13, 14. All tins time I spent in bringing 
off great quantities of iron and timber. 

May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpose to cut 
offsouic lead from the roll, but all in vain; for it lay too 
low under ^^atcr. 

May 16. I omitted going to the wreck this day, for em- 
ploying myself to look for pigeons, 1 outstayed my time. 

May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven 
ashore, which I found belonged to the head of the ship. 

]May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and with 
great difficulty loosened some things so much with the crow, 
that at the lirst flowing tide, several casks floated out, and 
many of the seamen's chests ; yet that day nothing came to 
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some 
Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the 15th of June ; 
(except necessary time for food or rest) and, had I known 
how to have built a boat, I had timber and planks enough : 
I had also near 100 weight of sheet lead. 

June 16. As I was wandering towards the sea-side, I 
found a laj-ge tortoise or turtle, being the first 1 had seen on 
the island ; though, as I afterwards found, there were many 
on the other side of it. 

June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, found in her 
threescore eggs, and her flesh the most savoury and pleasant 
1 ever tasted in my life. 

June 18. I staid within this day, there being a continual 
rain : and it was somewhat more chilly and cold than usual. 

June 19. Exceedingly bad, being taken with a trembling 
and shivering. 

June 20. Awake all night, my head racked with pain and 
feverish. 

June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the dismal 
apprehensions of my condition. Prayed to God more fre- 
quentl}', but very confusedly. 

June 22. Something better, but still uneasy in my mind. 

June 23. Again relapsed much as before. 

June 21. Mended a second time. 

June 25. A violent ague for seven hours, cold and hot 
fits succeeded with faint sweats. 

June 2G. Better, but verj- weak, yet I scrambled out, shot 
a she-goat, brouglit it home and boiled some of it; I would 
willingly have stewed it, and made scinc broth, but had no 
pot. 



36 LIFE AM) ADVE^"TUilE 

June ^7. AH this day I was afflicted vviui an ague ; 
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water: Prayed to God 
in these words : "Lord, in pity look upon nie ; Lord have 
" mercy upon me: have merry upon me!" After this I 
fell asleep, which I found had, much refreshed me, when I 
awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell into this 
strange and terrible sort of dream. 

Methoiight I was sitting onthe same spot of ground at the 
outside of the wall where I sat when the storm blew after 
the earthquake; and that I saw a man descending from a 
great ].)]ack cloud, and alight u]}on the ground. He was all 
over as liright as a flash of fire that a little before surrounded 
him; his countenance inconceivably terrible ; the earth, as 
it were, trembled when lie «tept U])on the ground, and flashes 
cf fire seemed to fill all the air. No sooner, I thought, he 
landed upon the earth, but with a long spear, or other wea- 
pon, he made towards me; but first ascending a rising 
ground, his voice added to my amazement, wheti I thought 
I heard him pronounce the?e dieadful words, " L^nhappy 
'*• wretch ! seeing all these things have not brought thee to 
*^ repentance, thou shatt immediately die." In])ronoune!ug 
this dreadful sentence, 1 thought he meant to kill me with 
the spear that was in his hand. 

Any body may think it impossible for me to express the 
horrors of my mind at this vision : and even w hen 1 awaked, 
this very dream made a deep im])ression upon my mind. — 
The little divine knowledge I had, I received from my fa- 
ther's instructions, and that v/as w^orn out by an uninter- 
rupted series of sea-faring impiety for eight years space. Ex- 
cept what sickness forced fi'om me, J, do not remember I had 
one thought of lifting up m.y heart towards Ggd, but rather 
had a certain stupidity of soul, not having the least sense or 
fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress, nor of gra- 
titude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I was on the 
desperate expedition on the desert African shore, I cannot 
remember I had one thought of what would become of me, 
or to beg his consolation and assistance in my sufferings and 
distress. When the Portugal captain took me up, and ho- 
nourably used uie, nay, farther, when I was even delivered 
from drowning, by escaping to this island, I never looked 
upon it as a judgment, but only said I was an unfortunate 
dog, and that's all. Indeed, some secret transports cf soul I 
hadj which was not through grace, but only a common flight

of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions -were all 
drowned, and no other joy conld I conceive but what is 
common with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they 
have escaped the greatest dangers. 

The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni- 
ences, might have called upon me for a thankful acknow- 
ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth of my corn 
touched me with some sense; but that soon wore otf again. 
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the fin- 
ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no longer 
than its duration. ' But now when my spirits began to sink 
>inder the burden of a strong distemper, and 1 could leisurely 
view the miseries of death present themselves before my 
eyes, then my awakened conscience began to reproach mc 
w ith my past life, in which I had so wickedly provoked the 
justice of God to pour down his vengeance upon me. 

Such reflections as these oppressed me even in the violence 
of distemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only proceeded 
from the fear of death. But when I considered my father's 
advice and prophecy, I could not forbear w eeping : for he 
told me, " That if I did persist in my folly, I should not only 
" be deprived of God's blessing, but have time enough to 
" reflect upon my despising his instructions, and this in a 
" wretched time, when none could help me." And now 
concluding it to be fulfilled, having no soul in the island to 
administer any comfort to me, I prayed earnestly to the 
Lord, that he would help me in this my great calamity. — 
And this, I think, was the first time I prayed in sincerity for 
many years. But now 1 must return to my journal. 

June 28. Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit 
quite Oif, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a great 
consternation; and, fearing that the ague might return the 
succeeding day, I concluded it time to get something to com- 
fort mc. I filled a case-bottie with water, and set it within 
reach of my bed; and, to make it more nourishing and less 
chilly, I put some rum in it. The next thing I did was to 
broil me a piece of goat's fiesh, of which I ate but little ; I 
was very weak ; however, walked about, dreading the return 
of my distemper; and at night 1 supped on three of the 
turtle's eggs, which I roasted and ate, begging God's bles- 
sing therewith. 

After I had eaten, T attempted to walk again out of doors 
wUh my gun; but v/as so weak, that I sat down^ and look-

ed at the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I con- 
tiiuied here, these thoughts cauic into my mind. 

In what manner is the production of the earth and sea, of' 
which I have seen so much? From whence came myself,- 
and all other creatures living, and of \^hat are they made? 

Our beings were assuredly created by some almighty in." 
Tissible Power, who framed the earth, the sea, and'air, and 
ail therein. But ^vhat is that Power? 

Certainly it must follo^v that God has created it all. Yet, 
said 1, if God has m.ade all this, ke must be the Ruler of- 
them all, and what is relating thereto; for certainly the- 
Power that makes, miLst indisputably have a power to guide- 
and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly it must; 
nothing can happen without his knowledge and appoint- • 
ment. Then, surely, if nothing happens without God's ap- , 
pointmeiit, certainly God has appointed these my suherings 
to befal me. And here I fixed my firm beli#f that it was . 
his will that it should be so ; and then proceeded to inquire, ' 
•v^hy Miouid God dealwuh me in this manner? Or what 
have I done thus to deserve his indignation? 

Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending mc as a 
blasphemer; crying with k loud and piercing voice, '' Un- 
'' worthy wretch! ho.v dare you ask what you have done? 
'^ Look on your past life, and see what you have left undone.^ 
'' Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the merciless 
'• hands of death? Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads, 
^' or killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by the 
" Salee man of war? Why not entombed in the bowels of 
''wild beasts on the African coast, or drowned here whca 
" all thy companioBS suffered shipwreck in the oce^n ?" 

Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pen- 
sive manner, being so thoughtful that I could not go to 
sleep; and fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it 
caused me to remember, that the Brazilliatis use tobacco for 
almost all diseases. I then went to my chest in order to 
find some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a 
cure for both soul and body; for there I found one of the 
Bibles, which, till this time, I had neither leisure nor incli- 
nation to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out of 
the chest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments 
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took a piece of leaf, and 
chewed it; but it being very green and strong, almost 
stupified me. Next I steeped it in some nini an hour cr 



OF R0B1N50X CRUSOE. 99 

two, resolving ^hcn I wont to Led to take a dose of it: 
and, in the third place, I burnt some over a ])an of tire 
holding my ni)se over it as long as I could endure it with- 
out saifocation^ 

In the intervals of this operation, though my head wa,s 
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to 
read. No sooner did I open it, but there a}y})eared to me 
tiiese words, '^ Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will 
*' deliver thee, and thiu shalt glorify mc." 

At first, this sentence made a very deep impression on 
my heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the 
word deliver was foreign to me. And as the children of 
Israel said, when they were promised flesh to cat, " Can 
God spread a table in the wilderness?" In like manner I 
began to sav, **Can God himself deliver me from this deso- 
late island?" However, the words would still return to my 
mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon me. 
As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my 
head I was inclined to slee]); but before I A\ould lie down 
I fell on my knee;, and implored the promise that God had 
made me in the Holy Scripture, that " if I called upon him 
in the day of trouble, he would deliver me." With much 
dtfiicuily, I afterwards drank the rum, wherein I had steeped 
the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw mc into such 
a profound sleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before 
I awaked ; or rather I believe, ] slept tw o days, having cer- 
tainly lost a day in my account, and I could never tell any- 
other way. AVhen I got up, my spirits were lively and 
cheerful; my stomach much hetter, being very hungry; 
and, in short, no tit re'^urned the next day, which was the 
29th, but I found myself much altered for the better. 

The 30fh I went abroad w ith my gun, but not far, and 
killed a sea-fowl or two, resei«b!ing a brand goose, which, 
however, I cared not to eat w hen I brought them home, 
but dined on two more of the turtle's eggs. In the evening 
I rencMcd my medicine, cxcej^ting that I did not take so 
large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my 
head over the smoke: but the next day, which was the 1st 
of July, bavins: a little return of the cold fit, I again took 
my medicine as I did the first time. 

July 3. The tic quite left me, bat very weak- In this 
condition, I of cen thought of these words, "I will deliver 
thcej" and whilc^ at some times, I would think of the i:u- 



40 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

possibility of it, other thouglits would reprehend me for dis- 
regarding the deliverances I had received even from the 
most forlorn anddistressed condition. I asked myself, what 
regard have I had to God for his abundant mercies? Have; 
1 done my part? "He has delivered me, but I have not 
glorified him:" — as if I had said, J had not owned and 
been thankful for these as deliverances, and how could I 
expect greater ? So much did this sensibly touch my heart, , 
that J gave God thanks for my recovery from sickness in i 
the most humble prostration. 

July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on what 
is written in the New Testament, resolving to read a chap- 
ter every morning and night as long as my thoughts w ould 
engage me. As soon as J set about this work seriously, I 
found my heart deeply affected with the impiety of my past 
life; these words that I thought were spoken to me in my-' 
dream, revived, "All these things have not brought thee to 
^'repentance." After this, I begged of God to assist me 
with his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day, in 
perusing the Scriptures, I came to these words, " Him hath 
" God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance 
"and to give remission:" immediately I laid down the , 
book, and with nplifted hands to Heaven, loudly cried, '^Oll 
blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus thou exalted Prince'! 
and Saviour, give me repentance !" And now indeed 1 prayed 
with a true sense of my condition, and a more certain ho])e, 
founded on the word of God. Now I had a ditlerent sense 
of these words, " Call on me and I will deliver thee," that 
is, from the dreadful load of guilt which oppressed my sinful 
soul, and not from a solitary life, which might rather be 
called a blessing, seeing I wanted neither food nor rai. 
meut, when compared with living among- the human race, 
surrounded with so much oppression, misery, and affliction: 
In a word, 1 came to this conclusion, that a deliverance 
from sin Avas a much greater blessing, than a deliverance 
from afilicdon. But again I proceed to my journal. 

To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun, little 
and little at a time, having been reduced to the greatest 
extremity of weakness. The applications and experiments: 
I used, were perfectly new : Rcither could I recommend^ 
them to any one's practice. For, though it carried off the 
fit, it very much weakened me, and I had frequent convul-^ 
siuns in my nerves and limbs for some time, Trom this, I

learncil, thai going abroad in rainy weather, especially when 
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind, was 
most pernicious to health. I had now been about ten. 
months in the island; and, as I never had seen any of the 
human kind, I therefore accounted myself as sole monarch; 
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to my 
mind, I resolved to make a tour round my kingdom, in or- 
der to make new discoveries. 

The 15th of July, 1 began my journey; I first went to 
the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore; and, tra- 
velling farther, found that the tide vrcnt no higher than two 
miles up, where there was a little brook of running water, 
on the -bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or 
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the 
rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I 
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strono- 
stalk. Several other plants 1 likev\'ise found, the virtues of 
which I did not understand. I searched a long tiiiic for the 
Cassava root, which I knevr the Indians in that climate 
*made their bread of, but all in vain. There were several 
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they 
were; likewise I saw several sugar canes, but imperfect for 
want of cultivation. With these few discoveries, I came 
back that night, and slept contentedly in my little castle. 

The next day, being the 16th, going the same way, but 
farther than the day before, I found the country more adorned 
with woods and trees. Here I perceived different fruits in 
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and 
clusters of grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the tvces. 
You may imagine I was glad of this discovery, yet ate very 
sparingly, lest I should throw myself irito a ilux or fever 
The grapes I found of excellent use; for when I had dried 
them in the sun, which preserved them as dried raisins are 
kept, they proved very wholesome and nourishing, and 
served me in these seasons when no grapes v.ere to be had. 

The night drawing on apace, I ascended up a tree, and 
•slept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had 
laiH out of my habitation. And when the morning ca»n'o, I 
proceeded with great pleasure on my way, tiavelling about 
four miles, as 1 imagined, by the length of the valley, di- 
recting my course northvvard,_there being a ridge of hills on 
the south and north side of me. At the end of this vallov, 
I came to an-opcaing, where thg countrv seemed to dcsceui

io tlicvrest; there I found a little spring of fresh water. 
proceeding out of the side of the hiil, with its crystal sfreams^ 
running directly east. And, indeed, here my scnscf? Avere 
charmed with the most bea;itiful landscape nature could af-! 
ford; for the country appeared flourishing, green, and de. 
Ilghtfiil ; that to me it seemed iikc a planted garden. I then 
-descended on the side of that delicious vale, when I found 
^bun^lance of cocoa, orange, lemon and citron trees, but 
mvy wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, they 
^ere delightful and whoiesonio, the juice of which I afterwards 
used to mix in water, which made it very cooling and re- 
freshing. And now I was resolved to carry hoine and lay- 
up a store af grapes, limes, and lemons, against the approach-' 
ing wet sea*ion. So laying them up in several parcels, and 
then talking a few of each with mc, I returned to my little 
.castle, after having spent three days in this journey. Before ■ 
I got home, the grapes were so bruised that they v/ere 
utterly spoiled; the liraes,,indeed, were good; but of those 
J could bring only a few. 

July 15. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither 
.figain, but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread 
about, tro<l to ])ieces, and abundance eaten, which made me 
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent 
lliis happening again, I gathered a large quantify of the 
<rrap-es, and hui\g thorn up^on the out-branches of the tree, 
])oth to keep ihcm unhurt, and that they might cure and dry 
in the sun: and having well loaded myself with limes and 
lemons, I returned once more to my old place of resi- 
dence. 

AndriO%v contemplating on the fruitfulness of this valley, 
^nd pleasantness of its situation, its security fiom storms, 
and the delightfulness of the adjacent woods, I concluded 
I was settled in the worst part of the country, and there- 
fore v/as thinking to remove my habitation. 

. But when I considered again, that, though it was pleai^ant, 
it was oft from the sea-side, where there was a pos&ibilifj, 
some time or other, a ship might eiihor be driven or sail by ; 
and, thai to enc^o';c myself among hills and woods, must cer- 
tain! v put an end to my hopes of ^leliverance; I resolved 
to let my castle remain where Providence had first assigned 
it. Yet so ravished was I with this p-lace, tliat 1 made mc 
a little kind of bower, surrounding it with a double hedge, 
;5ts high as I could reach^ v.ell staked and filled with bull^

Tushcs : and liavuig spent a great j)art of the montli cf Jiily, 
1 think it was the iirst of August before I begin ta enjoy 
my labour. 

Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to bo dry, I took tliem from 
the trees, and they ])roved excellent good raibins of the sun: 
the most of which I carried to my cave ; and happy for iiw 
I did so ; by which 1 saved the best part of my winter food. 

Aug. 14. This day it began to rain i and though I had 
made me a tent like the other, yet having no shelter of a hiii 
to keep me i^roin storms, nor a cafe behind mc to retreat to,. 
I was obliged to return to my old castle. The rain con-- 
tinned more or less every day, till the uiiddle of October;, 
and sometimes so violent, that I could not stir out of my 
cave for several days. This season I found my family to' 
increase; for one of my cats that ran away from me, and 
which 1 thought had been dead, returned about August, 
with three kittens at her heels, like herself, wlrich 1 thouglit 
strange, because both my cats v*ere females, and the wild 
rals of the island sesracd to be of a diiTercat kind from our 
European cfits; but from these cats- proceeded such nuin-- 
bers, that 1 was forced to kill and destroy them as I w-ould 
do wild beasts and vtr.niQe. 

To the 2C>th of this mouth, I could not stir out, it rainui^- 
incessantly : when beginning to want food, 1 was compelled" 
to venture twice: the first of which I sliot a goat, aud af- 
te.-wards found a very large tortoise. The maimer of my 
regulating my food was thus: a bunch of raisins served mc 
for my breakfast, a piece of goat's Hesh, or turtle, boiLd, for 
my dinner, and two or three turtle's eggs for my supper. 
While the rain lasted, I daily worked two or three hours at 
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards 
one side, till I came to the outride of the hill and made a 
door or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and 
so I came in and out this way. But after I had don? this, I 
Avas troubled to see myself thus exposed; though I couki 
not perceive any thing to fear, a goat being the biggest 
creature I had seen upon this island. , 

Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which 
amounted to ?,65, 1 concluded this to be the anniversary of" 
mylp.ndmg; and, therefore, humbly prostrating myself on 
the ground, confessing my sins, ackno^vledging God's 
righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ 
to have mercy upou me. I fasted for twelve hours till tht

going down of the sun; and then eating a biscuit and a 
bunch of grapes, laid me on the hed, and uilh great comfort 
took my night's repose. Till this time, I never had distin.^ 
guishcd the Sabbath-day: but now I made a longer notch 
than ordinary for the days of rest, and dividi-d the week a» 
well as I could, though 1 found I had lost a day or two in 
my account. ^Ay ink failing soon after, I omitted in my 
diily memorandum, things of an indiiferent nature, and con- 
tented myself to write down only the most remarkable events 
cf my life. The rainy and dry sea!;ons appeared now regular 
to me, and experience taught me how to provide for them; 
yet, in one thing I am going to relate, my experience very 
juuch failed me. You may call to mind what I have men- 
tioned of some barley and rice which I had saved; about - 
thirty stalks of the former, and twenty of the latter; and, at 
that time, the sun being in its southern position, going from 
me, together with the rains, made me conclude it a very 
proper season to sow U. Accordingly I dug up a piece of 
ground with my wooden spade, and divided it into tvvo 
parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed, preserving hy 
mc about a handful each. And happy it was J did so; for 
no raios falling, it v/as choaked up^ and never appeared 
above the earth till the wet season came again; and then 
part of it grew as if it had been newly sow^n. 

I was resolved still to make another trial; and seeking 
for a moister piece of ground near my bower, I there sowed 
the rest of m.y seed in February, a little before the vernal 
ecjuinox; which having the rainy months of IMarch and 
April to water it, yielded a noble crop, and sprang up very 
pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not daring to 
venture all; and by the time I found out the -j^roper seasons 
to sow it in, and that I might expect every year two seed- 
times and two harvests, my stock amounted to above half a 
peck of each sort of grain. 

No sooner were the rains over, butthestakes which I had 
cut from the trees, shot out like willows, the lirst year after 
lopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree T cut them 
from: but they grew so regularly beautiful, that they made 
a most lively appearance, and so flourished in three years 
time, that 1 resolved to cut more of them; and these soon 
grow ing, made a glorious fence, as afterwards I shall observe. 

And now I perceived that the seasons of the year might 
generally be divided not into summer and winter, as in 
Europe, but into wet and dry seasons, as in this manner :

The wet season wonld continue longer-or shorter, as the- 
winds happened to blow. Kut having found the ill consei. 
quences of being abroad in the rain, I took care beforehand 
to furnish myself Mith provisions: and., during the wet 
months, sat within doors as much as possible. At this time I 
contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it cost 
me much labour and paius, before 1 could accomplish them.. 
The first I tried Mas to make a basket,; but all the i wigs I 
could get proved so brittle, that I could not then perform it. 
It now proved of great advantage tome, that, wbcn a boy, I 
took a great delight at standing at a basket-maker's in ths' 
same toMn where my father lived, to view them at work ;: 
and like other boys, curious to see the manner of their 
working these things, and very officious to assist, I perfectly 
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but the tooij.. 
And it coming into ray m.ind, that the twigs of that tree of 
which I made my stakes, might be. as tough as a sallow- 
willow or osiers, growing in England, I resolved to make 
an experiment, and went the next day to my country-seat, 
and found somiC fit for my turn; arid after cutting down a 
quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pak, an J,, 
when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I 
employed rayself in making several sores of basket?, inso-. 
much that I could put in whatsoever I pleased. It ii 'rue, 
they were not cleverly made, yet they served my turn upon 
all occasions,,

LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



But still I vranted two necessary tilings. I had no cask 
to hold my liquor, except two runlets almost full of rum, a 
few bottles of an ordinary size, and some square case bottles ; 
neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle 
unlit to make broth, or stew a bit of meat : 'l wanted like, 
wise at the beginning of this dry season, a tobacco pipe; 
but for this I afterwards found an expedient. 

I kept myself employed in planting my second row of 
stakes. But remembering that when I travelled up to the 
brook, I had a mind to sec the whole island, I now resumed 
my intention; and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two biscuit? 
cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of j 
powder and shot than usual, I began my journey. Having 
passed the vale where my bower stood, I came within view 
pf the sea, lying to the west; when it being a clear day, I 
fairly descried land, extending from the W. to the S. W. 
about ten or fifteen leagues, as I concluded; but could not j 
say whether it was an island or a continent. Neither 
could I tell what this place might be; only thought it was 
part of America, and where I m.ight have been in a miser- 
able condition, had I landed. Again, T considered, that if 
this was tha Spanish coast, certainly one time or other, I 
should sec some ship pass hy ; and if it was not, then it 
must be the savage coast, between the Spanish country and- 
Brazil, which abounds with cannibals or man-eaters. 

As I proceeded forward, I found this side of the island 
much more pleasant than mine ; the fields fragrant, adorned 
wi'h sweet flowers and verdant grass, together with several 
very iinc woods. There were parrots in plenly, which 
made me long for one to bo my companion ; but it was with 
great difficulty I could knock one down with my stick ; and 
I kept him at home some years before I could get him to 
(fall me by my name. 

la the low grounds, I found various sorts of hares and 
fo'^^cy-, as I took them to be, but much different from those 
in England. Several of these J killed, but never ate them ; 
neither, indeed, had I any occasion ; for abounding with 
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes, J could defy Lcadenhall 
market to furnish me a better table. In this journey, I did 
not travel above two. miles a day, because i took several 
turns and windings, to see what discoveries I could make, 
returning weary enough to the place where 1 designed ia 
i^ebt ail nighty which was either ia a tree, or in a place^ 



OF ROBIXSON CRUSOi:. A'T 

Ti^hich I surrounded with stakes, that no wild creature might 
suddenly surprise me. When I came to the sea. shore, I was 
an^azed to see the splendour of it. Its strand was covered 
with shells of the most beautiful fish, and constantly abound- 
ing with innumerable turtles, and fowls of many kinds, 
■which I was ignorant of, esce;)! those called penguins. I 
might have shot as many as J pleased, but was sparing of 
xc^y ammunition ; rather choosing to kill a she-goat, m hich I 
did with much difficulty, on account of the flatnebs of the 
country. 

Now though this journey produced me the most pleasing 
satisfaction, yet my habitation was so much to my liking, 
that I did not repine at my being seated on the worst part 
of the island. I continued my journey, travelling about 
iwelve miles farther towards the east, where I set a great 
pile on the shore for a mark, concluding that my next jour- 
ney should bring me to the other side of the island, east from 
ray castle, and so round fill I came iQ my post again. As I 
had a constant view of the country, I thought I could not 
miss my way; but scarcely had I travelled three miles, 
when I descended into a very large valley, so surrounded 
with hills, covered with wood, that I having no guide but 
the sun, nor even that, unless I knew well his position at 
that time of the day ; and, to add to my misfortune, the wea- 
ther proving very hazy, I was obliged to return to my post 
by the sea-side, and so backwards the same way I came. — 
In this journey my dog surprised a kid, and would have 
killed it, had I not prevented him. As J had often been 
thinking of getting a kid or two, and so raising a breed of 
tame goats to supply me after ray ammunition was spent, I 
took this opportunity" of beginning: and having made a 
collar for this little creature, with a string made of rope- 
yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there inclosed and left 
him ; and having spent a month in this journey, at length 
I returned to my own habitation. 

Nobody can doubt of my satisfaction, when I returned ta 
my little castle, and reposed myself in my hammock. After 
my journey, I rested myself a week, which time I employed 
in making a cage for my pretty Poll. I now began to 
consider ray poor kid I had left in the bower, and I immc- 
dialely went to fetch it home. When I camethure, I found 
the young creature almost starved; I gave it some food, and 
tied it as before; but there was no occasion, for it followed.

mc like a dog: and, as I constantly fed it, it became <ff> 
loving, gentle, and fond, that it con:!nieuccd one of my do- 
meptics, and would never leave me. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now 
come, I kept the 30th of September in the most solemn 
ii^anncr, as usual ; it beisig the third year of my abode in 
ihc island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's 
Tsiercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life as 
agreeable and less sinful, than that of human society; and 
for the communications of his grace to my soul, in support- 
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his 
Frovidence, and hope for his eternal presence in the world 
to come. 

Indeed, I often did consider how much more happy I was 
in this state of life, than in that accursed manner of living I 
formerly used; and sometimes when hunting, or viewing 
the country^ the anguish of my soul would break out upon 
me, and my very heart would fink within me, to think of the- 
woods, the mounfaiiif:, the deserts I was in ; and liow I was 
a prisoner locked up within tlieeteraal bars and bolts of the 
ocean, in an uninhabited Avilderness, without hoiics, and 
without redemption, in th'i's condition I v.ould often wring 
my hands and weep like a child: And even sometimes, in 
the middle of my work, this fit would take me; and- then I 
w^ould sit down and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour 
or two together^ till such time as my grief got vent in a flootl 
of tears. 

One morning as I was sadly employed in this manner, I 
opened mv Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes upon- 
these words, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee !" 
Surely, thought J, these words are directed to me, or else why 
should they appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning 
my forlorn condition; and if God does not forsake, what 
matter? it, f;ince he can make me more happy ii\ this state af 
life, than if T enjoyed the greatest splendour in the worldi 
But \\hile I was gc)iug to return God thanks for my present 
state, som.ething seemed to shock my mind, as if it had thirs 
said; Lnv.orthy wretch, can you pretend to be thankful 
for a condition from which you world j ray to be delivered ! 
Here I stO|.;t'; — and though 1 corld not say. I thanked (be 
Di'ine Miijesly for being there, yet I gave God thanks for 
])lacing to my view my former course of life, and granting 
me a true knowledge of repentance. And whenever J opened; 



or ROEINSON CRUSOE. 49 

or shut the Bible, I blessed kind ProTidencc, that directed 
my good friend in England to send it among my goods with- 
out any order, and for assisting me to save it from the power 
of the raging ocean. 

And now beginning my third year, my several daily em- 
ployments were these : First^ My duty to Heaven, and di- 
ligently reading the Holy Scriptures; which I did twice or 
thrice every day : Secoiullj/, Seeking provisions with my gun, 
which commonly took me up, v; hen it did not rain, three 
hours every morning: Thirdhj^ The ordering, curing, pre- 
serving and cooking what I killed, or catched for my sup- 
ply, which took me up great part of the day; for, in the 
middle of the day, the sun being in its height, it was so hot, 
that I could not stir out; so that I had only but four hours 
in the evening to work in : and then the want of tools, of 
assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little 
purpose. I was no le?s than two and forty days making a 
board fit for a long shelf, which tvro sav/ers, with their 
tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the same tree in 
half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was to be 
broad. I was three days in cutting it down, aad two more 
in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of tim- 
ber. This I hacked and hewed off each side, till it became 
light to move; and then I turned it, made one side of it 
smooth and flat as a board from end to end, then turned it 
downwards, cutting the other side, till I brought the plank 
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. 
Any body may judge my great labour and fuitigue in such a 
piece of work; but this I went through with patience, as 
also many other things that my circumstances made neces- 
sary for me to do. 

The harvest months, November and December, were 
now at hand, in which I had the pleasing prospect of a very 
good crop. But here I met with a new misfortune ; for 
t\\Q goats and hares, having tasted of the sweetness of ths 
blade, kept it so short, that it had not strength to shoot up 
into a stalk. To prevent this, I inclosed it with a hedge, 
and by day shot some of its devourers ; and my dog which I 
had tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all night, so 
frightened those creatures, that I got entirely rid of them. 

But no sooner did I get rid of these, than other enemies 
appeared, to wit, whole Hocks of several sorts of birds who 
only waited till my back was turned to ruin rac. So much

did this provoke me, that I let flj, and killed three of the 
malefactors ; and afterwards served them as they do notori- 
ous thieves in England, hung them up in chains, as a terror 
to others. And, indeed, so good an effect had this, that they 
not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the island, so 
long as these crirainals hung there. | 

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of DecemJ 
ber, which was ray second harvest, 1 reaped it with a scythe^ 
made of one of my broad swords. I had no fatigue in cut. 
ting down, my first crop, it was so slender. The ears J car- 
ried home ia a basket, rubbing it with ray hands, instead of 
thrashing it; and when the harvest was over, found my 
half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice and 
two bushels and a half of barley. And now I plainly fore- , 
saw, thaf, by God's goodness, I should be furnished Avith' 
bread ; but yd I was concerned, because J knew not how 
to grind or make m.eal of my corn, or bread, neither knew , 
how to bake it. I would not, however, taste any of the i 
crop, but resolved to preserve it against next season, and,- 
in the mean while, use my best endeavours to provide my. 
self V, ith other food. 

But where were my labours to end ? The Avant of i^ 
plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to dig it, T conquered 
by making me a Avooden spade. The want of a harrow 1 
supj)lied myself with dragging over the corn a great bough 
of a tree. When it was growing I 'was forced to fence it;i 
when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrash it, part it from, 
the chaff and save it. And, after all, J wauled a mill to grind 
it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and' 
an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work to find 
some expedient for e\cry one of thi^se necessaries against the 
next harvest. 

And now having more seed, my first care was to prepaVa 
me more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of 
ground near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed 
my seed, and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me 
up three months : by which time the wet season coming on, 
and the rain lieeping me within doors, 1 found several oc 
casions to employ myself; and, while at work, used to di. 
vert myself in talking to my ])arrot, learning him to know 
and si:eak his own name Po//, the first welcome word I evep 
heard spoke in the island. I had been a long time con- 
triving how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted ex^ 



OF ROBIN? ON cnusoi:.. 51 

trcir.ely, and when T consitlerod the heat of the climate, I did 
not doubt but If I could find any such clay, I might potch 
up a pot, strong enough ivhen dried iu the sun, to bear 
handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, as com, meal, 
and other things. 

To be short, the clay I fonnd ; but it would occasion the 
most serious person to smile, to see what awkward waj s T 
took, and what ugly mishapen things I made: how many 
either fell out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun, and 
fell in pieces when they were removed : so that I think it 
was two montlis time before 1 could perfect any thing; and 
even then but two clumsy things iu imitation of earthen jars. 
These, however, I very gently placed in wicker baskets, 
made on purpo^^e for them, and between, the pot and the 
baskets, studed it full of rice and barley-straw, and these 1 
prcsum^ed would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal 
when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller things, I 
made them with better success; such as little round pots, 
fiat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking them very 
hard. 

Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely necessary, and that 
was an earthen pot, not only to hold my liquid, but also to 
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It once hap- 
pened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found therein a 
broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as rock, and 
rjd as a tile. This made me think of burning some pots ; 
and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead^ 
I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a pile 
one upon another. The fire I piled round the outside, and 
dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red 
h-ot, and found that they were not cracked at all : and when 
r perceived them perfectly red, I let one of them stand in 
the fire a])out five or six hours, till the clay melted by the ex- 
tremity of the heat, and would have run to glass had J suf- ' 
fered it: upon which J slackened my fire by degrees, till the 
redness abated ; and watching them till the morning, I found 
I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, as 
H'-ell burnt and (it for my turn as I could desire. 

No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery. For 
ifter this, I may say, I wanted for no sort of earthen Avare^ 
I filled one of my pipkins with water to boil me some meat, 
Vhich it did admirably well, and with a j.iecc of kid, I made 
ne some good broth, as well as my circumstances would 
ifford me &. that time. 



S3 1-1 FE AXD ADVrXTlTRES 

The next concern I had, was to get me a stone mortar toi 
beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here, in. 
deed, I was at a great loss, as not being lit for a stone-cutter; 
and many days I spent to find out a great stone big enough 
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and strong enough 
to bear the weight of a pesdl, and that would break the corn 
without filling it with sand. But all the stones of the island 
being of a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruitless; 
and then J resolved to look out for a great block of hard 
wood, which having found, J formed it with my ax and 
hammer, and then, w ith infinite labour, made a hollow in it, 
just as the Indians of Brazil make their canoes. When I 
had finished this, I made a great pestil of iron wood, and. 
then laid them up against my succeeding harvest. ! 

My next business was to make me a sieve to sift my meal, 
and part it from the bran and husk. Haying no fine thin 
canvass to search the meal through, I could not tell what to 
do. What linen I had was reduced to rags : ] had goat's 
hair enough, but neither tools to work it, nor did J know 
how to spin it : At length J remembered J had some neck- 
cloths of calico or muslin of the sailors, which I had brought 
out of the ship, and with these I made three small sieves 
proper enough for the v/ork. 

I come now to consider the baking part. The want of 
an oven I supplied by making some earthen pans very broatl 
but not deep. When I had a mind to bake, I made a great 
iire upon the hearth, the tiies of which I had made myself; 
and when the wood was burnt into live coals, I spread them 
over it, till it became very hot: then sweeping them away,: 
I set down my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots 
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all around the outsides 
of the pot to continue the heat ; and in this manner J baked 
my barley loaves, as well as if I had been a complete pastry, 
cook, and also made of the rice several cakes and puddings. 

It is no wonder that these things took me up the best 
part of a year, since what intermediate time I had was be. 
stowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry ; for id 
the proper season i reaped my corn, carried it home, and 
laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, till I had time td^ 
rub, instead of thrashing it. And, now, indeed, my corn! 
increased so much, that it produced me twenty bushels of 
barley, and as much rice, that I not only began to use it 
frcely^j but was tliiuking })ow to enlarge my baxns, and re-

.folrcd to soAV as mucli at a time as AvoiildLc sufTicIcnt for 
me for a ^vholc 3 car. 

All this wliilc, the prospect of land, Mhich I had seen 
from tlie other side of the island, ran in my mind. I stilt 
•meditated a deliverance from this place, t!)oiigh the fear 
of greater misfortnncs might hare deterred me from it. For, 
allowing that I had attained that place, I ran the hazard of 
'being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals; and if 
they were not so, yet I might be slain, as other I^uropeans 
had been, who fell into their hands. Notwithstanding all 
this, my thougi'.ts ran continually upon that shore. I now 
ivished for my boy Xnry, and the long-boat with the shoul- 
der of mutton sail: I went on the ship's boat that had been 
cast a great way 011 the shore in the la^e storm. She was 
removed but a little; but her bottom being turned up by 
the impetuosity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell to 
work with all the strength I had, v.ith levers and rollers I 
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the damages 
she had sustained. This work took me up three or four 
weeks, when finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to 
undermining it by digging away the sand, and so to mahe 
it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it 
in the fall. But after this was done, I was still unable to 
Stir it up, or to get under it, much less to move it forward 
tovrards the water, and so I was forced to give it over. 

This disappointment, horvcver, did not frighten me. J 
began to think vrhether it was not poi^ible for me to make 
a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk 
of a tree. But here 1 lay under particular inconveniences; 
•want of tools to make it, and want of hands to move it in 
the water when it was made. However, to work I went 
upon it, stopping all the inquires I could make, with this 
very simple answer I made to mjself. Let's first make it, 
I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to get it along when 
it is done. 

I fir*t cut down a cedar..tree, which was fire feet ten 
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four 
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
after which it lessoned for a space, and then parted into 
branches. Twenty days was I a hacking and hewing thi:* 
tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting oif the bra!ichG5 
and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like the bottom 
cf a boat. As for the inside, 1 was three weeks ^nth a

anallct anrl chissel, clearing it in siich a manner, as that liq 
<was big enough tti carry twenty-six men, much bigger than' 
any canoe I ever taw in my life, and consequently suiliciewt 
to transport me and ail ray etfects to that wished-fur shor«? 
2 so ardently desired. 

Noihiug remained now, bnt, indeed, the greatest diffi- 
dilty to get it into the water, it lying about one hundred 
jards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, "\vhich 
wa; a, rising hill between the boat, and the creek, with won- 
derful , ams ttnd labours I dug into the bowels of the earth, 
and K adc a declivity. But when this was done, all the 
strength I had was as insuificicnt to remove it, as it was when 
J at'eir.].tedto remove the boat. I then proceeded to measure 
the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal in order 
to bring the water to the canoe, since J Could not bring the 
canoe ;o the water. But as this seemed to be impracticable 
to myself aK/n£', under the space of eleven or twelve years, 
it broiighr me into some sort of consideration; so that I 
Con (hided this ali-o to be imuossible, and the attemj^t alto-' 
gethti vain. J uow^ saw, and not before, what stupidity it 
is to begin work before we reckon its tost, or judge rightly' 
4>ur own abilities to go through with its performance. 

Jn the height of this work my fourth year expired, from 
4he lime J was cast on this island. At this time I did not 
forget my anniversary ; but keep it with rather grtater dc- 
Totion than before. For now my hopes being frustrated, I 
iov ked upon this world as a thing J had nothing to do with; 
and very well might 1 say, as father Abraham said unto Dives,: 
*' Between thee and me there is a g'lf fixed." .^nd in- 
deed I was .-eparated from its wickedness '^oo, liaving nci- 
ihar the lust of the flesh, the lust of fhe eye, nor the v'rida 
of life; i had nothing to covet, being lord, king, and em-| 
peror ovei »he whole country J had in {ossession, v\'ithoutf

as des];icable dross, which J would fVeely have givi-n lor a' 
gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill io grind my corn; ia 
a Vv .'rd, file nature and experience of these thmgs dic^a-ed 
to li.e this just reiieciion: That the good things .>f this w<'rld 
are ii-^ fa^cher good to us, than -hey are for our use; and

or ROBINSON CRUSOE, 44 

These thoughtc rendered m}^ raind more easy than usuaL 
fjCverj time 1 sat djwn to mnat, I did it with (luinkr'.ilness, 
•dmiring the providential hand of God, who, in this wilder* 
ness, had s}>read a lablc to n)e. And now 1 considered what 
I enjoyed, rather tlian what I wanted; compared my present 
condition wirh what 1 .^t first expected it should be; how 
1 "-hoiild have done, if I had got nothing out of the snip; 
that I must have perished before I had caught fish or turtles; 
or lived, had I found them, like a mere savage, by eating 
them law, and ;jiilling them to pieces with my claws, like a 
beast. I next compared my station to that which 1 deferr- 
ed; how undutifnl I had been to my parents; how destitute 
of the fear of G )d: how void of every thing tkat was good^ 
and how ungratef*'! f jr those abundant mercies I had rc^» 
ceivL'd from Heaven, being fed, as it were, by a miracle,, 
ev'u as great as fdijiih's being fed by ravens; and cast oa 
a ' !dce where 'here is mq T.iiomoui creatures to ooison oT 
1 devour m.e; in sliort, making God's tender mercies matter 
of great consolation, I relinquished all sadness, and gava 
way to c mtenrment. 

As long as my ink continued, which with water I mad^ 
las- as long as I could, 1 used to mine.te down the days of the 
SQonth, on which any remarkable event har^pened. — And, 

First, J observed, tha* the same day i forsook my parent* 
and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to, go to sea : Hm 
cap.ie day afterwards in the next year, J was talicn and made 
a slave by the Salee rovers. 

That the very day J escaped out of the wreck of the ships 
in Yarmouth roads a year after, on the same day, 1 mad* 
jny eseaj)e from Salee in my patron's fishing boat. 

And, on the 30th of "^Cj-tember. being the day in the year 
I was born on, on that day twenty-six years after, was I 
miraculously saved, and cast ashore on this island. 

The next thing that wasted afjer ray ink, \\iks the bis* 
cuits which I had brought out of the ship; and though I aU 
lowed myself but one cake a day for above a twelvemonth, 
jet I was quite out of bread for near a year, before I got 
any corn of my own. 

In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my 
!in n had been gone long before. However, 1 had pVe-». 
served about three dozen i)f the sailors' chequered shirtSy 
which proved a great refreshment to me, when the violent 
Veaias of the sua would not iiuiler me to bear any of the itW*-

men's heavy watch-coats; v.hich made me turn tailor, and 
after a miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets. 
To. preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat's skin, v»ith 
the hair outwards to keep out the rain; Avhich indeed served 
me so Avell, that afterwards I mude me a waistcoat and open- 
kneed breeches of the same: And then J contrived a^ 
sox-t of an nmbrella, covering it with skins, Avhich not only 
kept out the heat of the sun, but rPvinalso. Thus being easy 
and settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to converse 
■with God, in most heavenly and comfortable ejaculations. 

For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary 
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure 
my raisins, and plant my barley and rice, both of which I 
had a year's provision beforehand. But though I was dis- 
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times, ' 
my business to make a second, of much inferior size; and it' 
was two years before I had finished it. But as I perceived j 
it would no wise answer my design of sailing to the other?' 
J^Jiore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour round thej, 
island, to see what further discoveries J could make. To| 
tills intent, after having moved her to the water, and tried J; 
how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and| 
made a s;iil of tlic ship's sail thdt lay by me. 1 then madel 
lockers or boxes at the end of it, to put in necessaries, pro- 
Tision, and ammunition, which would preserve them dry, 
cither from rain or the spray of the sea; and in the inside 
of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun in, 
and to keej) it dvy^ m.ade a flag to hang over it. My uui- 
brella T fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the 
heat of the sun off me. And now resolving to sec the cir- 
cumference of my little kingdom, I victualled my ship for • 
thti voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley. bread loaves, 
an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle of rum, 
half a goaf, powder and shot, and two watch coats. It was 
the 6th of November, in the Gth year of my reign, or capti- | 
rity, that I set out in this voyage; which was much longer 
ihan I expected, being obliged to put farther out, by reason 
of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea. And indeed 
so much did these rocks surprise me, that I was for putting 
back, fearing that if 1 ventured farther it would be out of 
my power to return. In this uncertainty I came to an an- 
chor just off shore, to which I waded with my gun on my 
shouiderj and then climbing up a hill^ which ovcrlookeU

spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart : and |;

gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, I had 
been lost another way ; for having no compass on board, I 
should never have found the way to steer towards the island, 
if once it had disappeared ; but it proving the contrary, I 
set up my mast again, spread my sail, and stood away 
northward as much as T could, to get rid of the current. And 
no sooner diil the boat begin (o stretch away, but I perceiv- 
ed, by the clearness of the water, a change of the current ., 
was near; for, where it was strong, the water vs^as foul; ":" 
and where it was clear the current abated. To the cast, I ' 
soon saw about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some 
rocks,, which caused it again to separate; and as the main 
force of it drove away more southerly, leaYing the 
rocks to the north-east; so the other came back by the re- 
])ulse of the rocks, mailing a sharp eddy, whkh returned 
hsick again to the north-west with a very s\vlft stream. 

Tljoy v/ho liave experienced what it is to be reprieved - 
npon the ladder, or to be saved from thieves, just going to 
take away their lives, or such as have been in the like cala- 
mities wiih my own, may guess my present excess of joy; 
how heartily I ran my boat into the stream of tliis eddy, and 
how joyfully I spread my sail to the refreshing wind, stand- 
ing cheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot. By 
the assistance of this eddy, I was carried above a league 
iiome again, when being in the wake of the island, betwixt 
the two currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand* 
About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a 
league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock, 
which crfused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be- 
fore, to the- southward, which throwing off the current more- 
southwardly, had occasioned another eddy to the north. But 
having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this eddy, and in 
an hour came within a mile of the shore, wliere T soon 
landed to my nirspeakable comfort; and after an humble 
prostration, thanldng God for my deliverance, with resa- 
lution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I broughtmy 
boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a wel- 
come repose. When I awoke, i was considering how I 
Blight get my boat home; and coasting along the shore, I

©r ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

Vhcrc finding a safe harbour, T stowed her as safe as if siic 
had been in a dry dock made on piirpo'^e for her. 

I now perceived myself not far from the place whers be- » 
fore I had travelled on foot ; so tiikinf; nothing with me, 
except my gun, and umbrella, I began my journey; and iit 
the evening came to my bower, where I again laid me down 
to rest. I had not slept long before I was awakened in 
great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several 
times ''Robin, Robin, R.obinson Crusoe, poor Robin! 
*' Where are you Robinson Crusoe? Where are you.* 
*' Where have yoa been : '* 

So fast was I asleep attirst, that I did not a^rake thorough- 
ly ; but half asleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed 
that somebody Sj^oke lo me. But, as the voice repeated 
Rohiu.^on Crusoe several times, being terribly aiiVii^hfed, 
1 staited up ia the utmost confusion; and, no soontT werg 
n\y eyes fully open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on 
i\\Q (op of the hfcd2:e, and soon knew that it was he that cal- 
led me: for jui^t in such bewailing language I u^ed to talk 
and teach him; which he so exacriy learned, that he would 
sic upon my linger, and lay his bill close to my face, and 
cry, ''Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you? where have 
'"• you been? how can^e you here?" and such like prattle I 
liad constantly taught him.. But even though I knew it to 
•be the parrot, it was a great while before I could adjust my- 
self: being am.ized how the creature got thither, and that 
he should fix about that place, and no where else. But 
now being assured it could be no other than my honest 
Poll, my wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and 
calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and perch^ 
ed upoft ray thumb as he was wont^ constantly prating to 
me with " Poor Robinson Crusoe, and hoAV didl come here, 
''and where had I been?" as if the bird was overjoyed to 
see me; and so J took him home along with me. 

I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea; yet 
I could wish my boat, which had co5it me so much trouble 
and pains, on this side the island once more, but which in- 
deed was impracticable. I therefore began to lead a very- 
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a very conkcnted 
manner, wanting for nothing except conversati<jn. As to 
mechanic labours, which my necessities obliged mc to, I 
fancied I could, upon occasion, make a tolerable carpente3, 
ifcrc the poor tools | had to work withal but goodl ^=._

sides, as I improved in my earrhen ^rare, I contrived t^^ 
make them with awheel, which J found much easier and 
better, making my work shapely, which befjre was rude 
and ui^ly. Out, I think, I was ntver so elated wj h my* 
own jierformance or » reject, than foi being able to make 
tobacco-pipe, m hich, though it proved an awkward clumsj 
thing, yet it was very so'tnd, and carried the smoke per. 
fectly well, to my great satr-faction. 

1 abo im vroved my wicker ware, m.aking me abundance oi 
necessary baskets, which, though not vei-y handsome, were- 
very handy and convenieni to fetch things hunie in, as also- 
for holding my stjres, barley, rice, and o^her provisions. 

JNiy powder beginning to fail, made me examine aftei 
what manner I should kill the goats or birds to live on aftepj 
it was all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways to! 
ensnare the goats, and see if J could catch them alive, rarti- 
cularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire; 
for, making pitfalls aad traps baited with barley and rice, I 
found one morning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and ia« 
the o her, three kids, one male, the other two female^;. J 

So boisterous was A\q old one, that I could not bring him' 
away. But I forgot the old proverb, "That hunger vvill 
''tame a lion:" Forbad I ke|)thim three or four days with- 
out provisions, and then given him some water, wi<h a little 
corn, he would have been as tame as a yoimg kid. The 
other creatiHC. 1 bound with strings together; biit I had 
great difficulty beforo 1 could bring iiem to my liai)iiati ui. 
it was some 'ime before they would feed; but throwing ^hera 
sweet corn, it so much tempted them that they began to be 
tamer. From thence I concluded, that if 1 designed to fur- 
nish n!)selt with goat's tlcfch, when my ammuniion was 
speni, the tamely breeding them U| , like a flock of sheep,. 
al^oui my settlement, was the only method I could take. I 
€onclHded, also, I must sej.avate the wild from the tame, or 
elsv 'hey'wou'd always run wild as^ they grew up ; and the 
be- \va.j for this, Mas tc have some inclosed piece of ground 
■well fenced, either with a hedge or j.ale, to keep them so 
eftectually, that those within might not break out, or those^ 
withont break in. Snch an under aking was verv grea^^ for

CF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Here again I gave another instance of Diy ignorance and 
inexperience, pitching upon a i)iece of meadow land so large, 
that had I enclosed it, the hedge or pale had been at least 
two nules about. Indeed, had it been ten miles, I had 
time enough to, do it in ; but then 1 did not consider that my 
goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they had 
had the whole island, and consequently as dilBcult for me 
to catch them. This thought came into my head, after I 
hnd carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards ; I therefore 
aUercd my scheme, and resolved to inclose a piece of ground 
about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hun- 
dred in breadth, suihcient enough for as many as would main- 
tain me, till such time as my flock increased, and then I could 
add more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work, 
and it took me about three months in hedging the tirst piece, 
in which lime I tethered the three kids in the best ]:art of 
it, feeding them as near me as possible, to make them fam.i, 
liar : and indeed I very often would carry some ears of bar. 
ley or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; by 
Tvhlch they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was 
finished, and I had let them loose, they would run after me 
for a handful of corn. This indeed answered my end; and 
in a year and a half's tim^, I had a flock of about twelve 
goafs, kids and all ; and in two } ears affer, they amounted 
to forty-three, besides what 1 had taketi and killed for my 
sustenance. Afiei' which I inclosed five several pieces of 
ground to feed them in, with peis^-to drive them into, that 
I might take them as I had occasion. 

In this project I likewise found additional blessings ; for 
I not only had plenty of goat's llesh, but milk too, which in 
my beginning I did not so much as think of. And, indeed, 
though I had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen 
butter or cheese made, yet, after some eisays and miscar- 
riages, I made me both, and never afterwards wanteds

Boat; 1 .inew n.t which way to ge^ her r.,unJ *he island, 
JJne 'line i resolved to go al..ng the shore by land to j.er: 
»m had any one in Fngiand met such a fi^^'ure, it would 
either h>ave aJfnghted them, or made them burst in^a 
laughter; nay, I could not but smile to myself at my habit, 
wnich 1 thi.ik in this riace will be rery pro- er to describe. 
iho cai- 1 wore on my head, was great, high, and sba.e 
less, n-ade of a goat's skin,- win a lia.) or -ent-house ban^ 
JHg aown behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but »> 
shoot the rain oli from running into my neck, nothing beiuif^ 
niore i3ernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh in th, e 
climates. I had a short jacket of ecat's skin, whose hair 
liung down such a length or. each side, that it reached down 
to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stocking-, I had 
none, but made a semblance of some thing, 1 know not what 
to call them; they were made like buskins, and laced oa' 
the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously shared like the rest 
ol my habit. I had a broad belt of goatVs 'skin dried, <^irt 
round me with a couple of thongs, instead of buckles; on 
each of which, to supply the deficiency of sword and dag, 
ger, hung my hatchet and saw. I had another bel:, not so 
broad, yQt fastened in the same mann- r, which hun? over 
my shoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm,'^hung 
t^o pouches, made of goat's skin to hold my powder an< 



3^of. Mj baslcct 1 carried on mj back, and niy g?in on my 
honlder ; and over my head a groat clumsy Ui^ly goat's 
kin umbrella, which, however, next to my gun, was the 
nos? necessary thing about ine As for my face, the colour 
ira- not so swarthy as the i^afulattocs, as might hare been 
rx ;ected from one who took so iit.'le care of it, in a climate 
writhin ni.ie or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time 
ny beard grew so long thaf it hung down aboul: a quarter 
jf a yard ; but as I had both razors and scissors in store, I 
lut it all oif, and sulfered none to grow, except a large pair 
>f Mahometan whiskers, >he like of which I had scon ware 
by some Turks at Saiec, not long enough indeed to hang a 
aat upon, but of such a moustrous size, as would have 
imazed any in England to haTe seen. 

But all. this was of no consequence here, there being non® 
to observe my behaviour or habit. And so, without fear 
md without control, I procoeded on my journey, the prose- 
luiion of which '^ook me up five or si\ days. I first travi-lied 
ilong the sea shore, directly to the place where I first brought 
aiy boat to an anciior, to get ui;on the rocks ; but now hav- 
ing no boat to take care of, 1 went overland a nearer way 
to 'he arae height that I was before upon; when looking 
forward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which 
I vsa= forced to double with my boat, I wai^ amazed to se^ 
the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no riplmg motion, 
aor current, any more than in other places. This made me 
ponder some time to guess the reason of it, when at last I 
was convinced that the ebb setting from the west and joining 
wi h the current of water from some great river on shore, 
must be *^he occaion of these rapid streams; and that, con- 
sequently, as the winds blew more westwardly or more 
southwardly^, so 'he current came the nearer, or went the 
farther from the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, 1 waited 
there till evening, when the timq of ebb being made, I 
plainly -erceived from the rock the current again as before, 

ith thib dilierence, that it ran farther ott, mar half a leagtio 
from the shore, wher'»a:>, in my expedition, it set close up- 
on it, furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with it, 
which at auothei' time u would no' have done. And now 
I ^vas convinced, that, by observing the ebbing and flowing 
of 'tie tide, 1 mig!:t ea^^il > bring my boat round the island 
agaiiv Biit when I botian f .> think of ^tutting it in jjraetice, 
tie remembrance of the late danger struck xae with i\ip%

horror, that I cLangcd mj resolution, and formed anothcrji 
•which was more safe, though more laborious ; and this wa^i 
to make another canoe, and so haje one for one side of th< 
island, and one for the other. ;' 

I had now two plantations in the island; the first m-" 
Jittle fortification, fort, or cattle, with many large and spa- 
«ious improvements; for by this time I had enlarged the cav< 
behind me with several little caves, one within anotherj 
to hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles A^ith whicl 
I made my wall, were grown so lofty and great, as obscurec 
my habitation. And near this commodious and })leasaui 
settlement, lay my well-cultivated and improved corn.fields,| 
which kindly yielded me their fruit in the proper seasoni 
My second plantation was that near my country-seat, oi 
little bower, where my grapes flourished, and where, havini 
planted many stakes, I made inclosures for my goats, s< 
strongly fortified by labour and time, that it was much stronger] 
than a wall, and consequently impossible for them to break' 
through. As for my bower itself, I kept it constantly in 
repair, and cut the trees in such a manner, as made them 
grow thick and wild, and form a most delightful shade- In 
the centre of this stood my tent, thus erected: I had driven 
four piles in the ground, spreading over it a piece of the 
ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of a couch with the 
shins of the creatures I had slain, and other things; and 
having laid thereon one of the sailor's blankets, Mhich I had 
saved from the wreck of the s^hip, and covering myself with a 
great v.atch-coat, I took up this jdace for my country retreat. 

Very frequently from this settlement did I use to visit 
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And sometimes 
I would venture in her a cast or two from the shore, but 
no farther, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy 
wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from the 
island as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst 
I proceed to inform you of a new, but most surprising 
scene of life which here befel me. 

You may easily suppose, that after having been here so 
long, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human 
creature. One day it happened, that, going to my boa^ I 
saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evi- 
dent on the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of ir. — 
Had I seen an apparition of the most frightful shape, I could 
Bet have been more confounded. My willing cars gave 



OF R03INS0X CRUSOE. 68^ 

he strictest attention. I ca^t my eyes around, but could 
itisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded alter- 
ately to every part of the shore, but with equal ctfect; 
either could I see any other mark, though the sand about 
t was as susceptible to take impression, as that w hich was 
o ];lalnly siamjicd. Thus, struck with confusion and hor. 
or, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bush 
nd iree, taking every thing for men; and possessed with 
he ^vildest ideas; That night my eyes never closed. I 
orraed nothing but themost dismal imaginations, concluding 
t must be the mark of the devil's foot which J had seen, 
'or otherwise how could any mortal come to this island? 
vhere was the ship that transported them ? and what signs 
f any other footsteps ? Though these seemed very strong 
casons for such a supposition, yet (thouglit I) why should 
be devil make the print of his foot to no purpose, as I caa 
ee, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified 
oe? why should he leave his mark on the other side of tho 
slaud, and that too on the sand, where the surging waves 
f the ocean might soon have erased the impression. Surely 
his action is not consistent with the subtlety of Satan, said 
to myself; but rather must be some dangerous creature, 
ome wild savage of the main land over against me, that, 
enturing too far in the ocean, has been driven here, either 
)y the violent currents or contrary winds; and not caring to 
tav on this desolate island, has gone back to sea again. 

Happy, indeed, said J to myself, that none of the sarages 
lad seen me in that place; yet I was not altogether with- 
»ut fear, least, having found my boat, they should return in 
lumbers and devour me, or at least carry away all my com 
^nd destroy my Mock of tame goats. In a word, all my reli- 
gious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would not 
low protect me by his power, who had so wonderfully pre- 
erved me so long. 

What various chains of Proridence are there in the life 
)f man ? How changeable are our aiections, according ta 
lijferent circumstances ? We love to day, w hat we hate 
o-morrow ; we shun one hour what Ave seek the next. 
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner: 
For I, who before had so much lamented my condition, in 
leing banished from all human kind, was now even ready 
:o expire^ ^vhea I considered that a man had set his foot wA-

this desolate island. But when I considered my station of 
life decreed by the iniiiiitely wise and good providence of 
God, that I ought not to di'^pute n>} Creator's sovereignty, 
Mho has an undoubted riglit to govern and dispone of his 
ereatures as he thinks convenient; and that his justice and 
Riercy ccii'd cither punish or deliver ma: I say, Mhen I 
eonsideied all this, I coirfortably found it niy duty to trust 
sincerely in him, pray aidontly to him^ and humbly resiga 
fuytelf to his divine will. 

One morning 1) ing on my bed, these words of the sacred ! 
writings came in Lo my mind, "Call upon me in tlie day of 
^' trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt giorif) nic.'* ' 
Upon this gentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed, I 
oHered up my prayers in the most heavtnly manner : and 
when 1 had done, taking up my bible to read, these words 
apj)eared first in my sight : — " W&it on the Lord, and b« 
^'- of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart : Wait 
^' 1 say on the Lord." Such divine comfort did this give me, 
as to remove all eau?e of sadness upon that occasion. 

Thus, after a world of apprehciisions and fears, for three 
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my castle, and 
milked my goats, one of which was almost spoiled for want 
of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and 
Eiilked my flocks there albo; when, growing bolder, I went 
dov^n to the shore again, and measuring the print of the foot 
to mine, to see, perhaps, whether I myself had not occasion- 
4»d that mark, I found it much superior in largeness : and so 
returned home, now absolutely convinced that either some 
ttien had beea ashore, or that the island must be inhabited, 
and therefore that I might be surprised before I was aware. 

J novr began to think of providing f«jr my security, and 
resolved in my mind many ditfercnt schemes for that pur- 
pose. I iirst proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn 
my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might 
not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing 
the same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn fieUls 
for the very same reason. And, lastly, I concluded to de- 
molish my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivance, ^ 
th.'y might come farther, and mid oat, ^nd attack me in my';, 
little cabtle. 

Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me: and I *'

Kim!tc!f» And, it is strango, that a little befor?, h ivliij en- 
tirely resis2;nod myself to the \^ili of God, I should now hav# 
little confidence in him, fearing tho*;? more who cjuld kill 
this fading body, than him who could destroy my imraortJil 
foni. 

Sleep was an utter stranger to my^ eyes tiiat nij^ht ; yef 
na+ure spent and tired, submitted to a silent repose the next 
morning, and then j lined reason with fear, I considerert 
tha*- this delightful and pleasant island mig'it not be so en- 
tirely forsaken as I might think; but that the inhabitant* 
from the other shore might sail, either with a design or from 
ncccssily, by cross wind-; ; and, if the latter circ.imstance,. 
] had reason to believe they would depart the first oppor- 
tunity. However, my f.^ar made me think of a place for re- 
treat upon an attack. I now repented that I had made my 
door to come out beyond my fortification ; to remedy whicb 
I resolved to make me a second oi^e: 1 fell to work, there* 
fore, and drove betwixt that d juble rows of trees, Tvhich I 
planted a^jove twelr? years before, several strong piles^ 
thickening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and 
Itrcng'hening the foot of it with earth which I dug out of my 
cave; I 3l>o made me seven h >les, wherein I pl.nfed my 
muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resemblin*- 
rarriages. This being finished with indefatigable industry^ 
for a great way every where, I planted sticks of osiers like 3 
wood, about twenty thousand of them, leavii>g a l:*rge space 
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see 
an enrmy, and that they mii^ht not be sheltered among th3 
young tree?*, if they offered to approach.ihe outer wall. — 
And, indeed, scarce two years had passed over my heady 
when there appeared a lovely shady grove, and in six years 
it becauie a thick wood, perfectly impass^ible. For my safe- 
ty, 1 left no avenue to go in or out; instead of which J set 
two ladders, one to a part of a rock which was low, aud 
then broke in, leaving room to place another ladder upo-i 
that; so that when I took these down, it was impossible for 
any man to dc'=;cend without hurting himself; and if they 
had, they would still be at the o;iilside of my outer wall. — •' 
Bi!^ while I took all the>e measure^ of h:iman prud.uice for 
my o\vn preservation, 1 was not altogether unmindful of othe.* 
aluiiis. To preserve my stock of tame goats, that ihe rne-

retired part of the island, which was the place where T had 
)ost myself before-mentioned, and Ihere finding a clear piece 
of land, containing three acres, surrounded with thick woods^,; 
J wrought so hard, that in less than a month's tiine, I fenced, 
it so well round, that my flocks were very well secured in 
it, and j)ut therein tM'o he-goats and ten she-goats. 

All this labour was occasioned purely by fearful appre, 
hensions, on account of seeing the print of a man's foot.- 
,Aiid not cont(^nted yet with what I had done, I searched 
for another place towards the west point of the island, 
where 1 might also retain another (lock. Then wandering 
on this errand more to the west of the island than ever I had 
yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, metho'.sght 
I perceived a boat at a great distance, but could not | ossi- 
biy tell what it was for want of my ])erspective glaf^s. I' 
<^.onsidered then it was no strange thing to see the print o'f 
a man's foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed God 
for being cast on the other side of the island, where none of 
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But when J came 
4own the hill to the shore, which was the S. W. point of 
the island, 1 \^as soon confirmed in my opinion ; nor can 
any one describe my horror and amazement, when I sa',v . 
the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet^ and bones of 
human bodies; and, particularly I perceived a space like 
It circle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about which 
I conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrificed 
and devoured their fellow-creatures. 

The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle, 
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from ray 
stomach in an excessive manner. J theq returned towards 
my habitation : and, in my way thither, siiedding floods of 
tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave God 
thanks for making my nature contrary to these wretches, 
and delivering me so long out of their hands. 

Though reason and my long residence here had assured 
jne, that these savages never came up to the thick woody 
part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre- 
hensive of a discovery ; yet such ah abhorrence did I still 
retain^ tha<^, for two years after, T confined myself only to 
},iy three plantations ; I mean my castle, country-seat, and! 
jnclosure in the woods. And though in process of time rayl 
dreadful apprehensions began 1o wear away, yet my eyes I 
"were more vigilant for fear of being surprised, and t wa^.

creiitiires, they -hoiild proceed to attack mc. I resolved^ 
however, iiianfully to lose my life if they did, and went 
armed with three pistols stuck to ray girdle, which, p.ddcd 
to the description 1 have 2;iven of myself before, made me- 
look with a very fv)rmidable appearance. 

Thns my circumstances for some time remained very- 
calm and undisturbed ; and when I compared my conditio* 
to others, I found it f.ir from being miserable. And, indeed, 
would all persons compare their circumstances, not Avith 
those above them^ but with tho5e innumerable unbaijpy ob- 
jects beneath them^ I am sure we should not hear iho««s 
daily murmurings and complaininsjs that ?.re in the world. 
For my ])art I wanted but few things^ Indeed, the terror 
which the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions 
for n«y own convenience*. One of my projects w^as to brivv 
Rie some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when it in 
considered that I had neither casks sufPicient, nor could I 
make any to preserve it in ; neither had I hops to m9ke it 
lieep, yea^t to make it work, nor a copper or kettle to iiiake 
it boil. Perhaps, indeed, after some years I miglit hriner 
this to bear, as 1 had done other things. But now my inven- 
tions were placed another way; and Ct^y and nigUt I could 
think of nothing but how 1 m.ight dei>troy some of these- 
€annibals, when proceeding to their bloody entertalniaent« ; 
and so saving a victim from being sacrificed, that he might, 
after become my servant. Many were my contrivances 
af^cr this p'lrpose, and as marry more objections occurred, 
after I had hatched the^.. 1 once contrived to dig a hole- 
under the place where they made rheir fire, and put therein 
five or six pounds of gv.npowder, which would v'-onsequenti v 
blow up all those that were near it; and then I \vr6 loth to- 
spend so much upon them, le^t it should no^ do that cert:ii'^=

ir.y-^elf to lie privately in ambui-h, in some convenient j lace, 
with my three guns double loaded, and let fiy at thei-i ii\- 
the mid^t of their dreadful ceremony: and, having killed 
two or three of them at every shot, faJl uporv the rest sud-

70 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

in execution, I was not long in seeking for a place conv^» 
nient for my purpose, where unseen I might behold every 
action of tlie savages, ^ere I placed my two muskets, each 
of which Avas loaded with a brace of slugs, and four or 
iive smaller bullets about the size of pistol bullets; the, 
fowling-piece was charged with near a handful of the largest 
>swan shot, and in every pistol was about four bullets. 
And thus all things being prepared, no sooner would the 
welcome light spread over the element, but, like a giant re. 
freshed icf'th zcine^ as the Scripture has it, would I issue forth 
from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three miles distant, 
view if I could see any invaders approach unlawfully to 
my kingdom. But having waited in vain two or three 
months, it not only grew very tiresome to me, but brought 
wie to some consideration, and made me examine myself, 
vrhat right I had to kill these creatures in this manner. 

If (■irgiied I to myself) this unnatural custoir. of their's be 
a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine Being, 
wiio j.lone has the vindictive power in his hands, to shower 
doM n his ren^eance upon them. And, perhaps he does so 
in m.jkiug thtnn become one another's executioners. Or, 
if not, if (^od thinks these doings just, according io the 
kuDv. ledge they conceive, what authority have 1 to pretend 
to thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted 
these actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost the be, 
ginning cf i\\Qi creation ? They never oflended me, wha^ 
rigrit have 1 then to concern myself in their shedding oni 
another's blood? And, indeed, I have since known, the} 
value no more to kill and devour a cajtive taken in warJ 
than VvC do to kill an ox, or eat mutton. I then concludcc 
it necessarily followed, that these people were no more] 
murderers than Christians, who many times put whole troor;s 
to the sword, after throwing down their arms. — Again, I 
considered that if I fell upon them, I should be as much in 
the wrong as the Spaniards, who had committed the great- 
CFt babaritics upon Ihese people who had never oft'ended 
them in their wliole lives; as if the kingdom of Stain was 
eminent for a race of men without con.mon compassion to 
the miserable, a princip.il sign of the most generous temper: 
these considerations made me pause, and made me think I 
)iad taUcn wrong measures in my resolution: I now argui 
tYith myself, it was better for m>e never to attack, but t.> ro« 
^^VO uudiscQyercd as long as I possibly^could; that an o] 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

positc conduct would certainly proTC destructive ; for as it 
was scarcely to be supposed J couM l;ill them al!, I might 
either be overpowered by the rontaiiiiRa,, or that some 
♦sca[)ing, might bring thousands to my certain destruction. 
And, indeed^ religion took their part so much as to convince 
me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding 
human blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they 
are to one another ; that I had nothing to do with it, but 
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I said 
before, to do therein what seemed convenient to his he;ivenly 
M'isdom. And, therefore on my knees I thanked the Al- 
mighty for delivering me from blocd guiltiness, and begged 
his nrotection that I might never fall into their hands. 

Tims giving over an attempt which { had rashly begun, 
I never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards: I only 
removed my boa^, which lay on (he other side of the island, 
and every thing^ that belonged to her, toward the east, into 
a little cove, that there might not be thclenst shadow of any 
b.)at near, or habitation u. on the island. — My castle then 
became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except when 
I went out to milk my she goats, and order my little flock in 
the wood, A\hich was q site out of dangt-r : for .'ure I was 
that these savages never came here wi'h expec^itions to 
find any thing, and consequently never wandered from the 
coa^t : however, as they might have been several times on 
shore, as well before as after my dreadful a',,j)rehensions, I 
looked back with horror to think in what s-ate I might have 
beon, had I suddenly met them slenderly armed, with one 
gun only loaded with small shot ; and how great would 
have been usy amazement, if, instead of one man's foot, I 
had j)erceived fifteen or twenty savages, who having once 
set their eyes u] on m.e, by the swiftnes-s of their feet would 
have left me no possibility of e.-ca:ing? These thoughts 
would sink my very soul, ? o that I would fall into a deep 
melancholy, uli si'ch tin.e as the consideration cf my grati- 
tude to the Divine Being moved it fi jm my heart. 1 then 
fell into a contemplation of the sacrrd sj^rings of Providence, 
and how won«leifr:lly we are delivered, when insensible of 
it ; and when intrlcated in uncertain mazes or labyrinths of 
doubt or hesitation, what «ecret hints direc ui in the right 
way, when we intended to go out of it ; nji} , perhaj'S con- 
trary to our business, sense, or inclination. Upon which I 
Jxed within mc this as a certain rule, never to disobey those

secret impressions of (lie mind, to tlie actiiiG; or tiot acting 
any thing that otTered, for which I yet could assign no reju 
son. Ihit let it be how it vfill, the advantage of this con- 
duct very eminently appeared in the latter part of my abodO' 
on this island ; lam a stranger in determining whence thesff' 
s^ecret intimations of Proridence derire ; yet ir.etliinks they 
are not only some proof of the converse of spirits, but also 
of the secret communications they are supposed to l)ave 
wit}', those that liave not passed through the gloomy rale of 
death. | 

These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation^j 
put a period to all future inventions and contrivances, either^ 
for ac.*ommodation or convenience- I now cared not to 
drive a nail, choj) a stick, fire a gun, or make a lire, lest 
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke discover mr. 
And on this account I used to burn my earthen ware privately 
in a cave wliich I found in the wood, and whicli I made 
convenient for that purpose; the principal caMse that 
brought me here was to m.ake charcoal, so that I might bake 
and dress my bread and meat without any danger. At that 
time a curious accident happened me, which 1 shall now 
relate. 

While I was cutting dov/n «^ome wood for ranking my 
charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very thick branch 
of underwood. Curious to Jook into it, I attained its month,, 
and perceived it su{hti( nt for me to stand upright in. But 
"when I had v^ntered, and took a furflier view, two rolling: 
shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to dart themselves 
at me; so that I made all the haste out that I could, as not 
knowing whether it was a devil or a monster that had taken- 
his residence in that place. When I recovered a little from 
my sur^ ri^e, I called myself a thousand fcols, for being 
afraid to see the devil one moment, who had now lived 
almost twenty year- in the most retired solitude. And 
therefore resuming all the courage I had, I took a flaming 
firebrand, and in I rushed again. I had not proceeded 
above three steps, when I was more alTiighted than before; 
for then 1 heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human crea- 
ture in the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise, 
resembling words half ex]3ressed, and then a broken sigh 
again. Stepving back, Lord! (thought I to myself) where 
am I got, into what enchanted place have 1 plunged my- 
Jelf, such as arc-reported to contain miserable cajptiveSj^ tUi- 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

death puts an end to their sorrows? And, indeed, in such 
great amazement was I, that it struck me into a cold sweat; 
and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would 
have moved it off. But again encouraging myself w ith the 
hopes of God's protection, I proceeded forward, and by the 
Jight of my firebrand, perceived it to be a monstrous he-goat, 
lying on the ground, gasping for life, and dying of mere old 
age. At first T stirred him, thinking to drive him out, and 
tlie poor ancient creature strove to get upon his feet, but 
-was not able; so I e*en let him lie still to afiright the sava- 
ges, should they venture into this cave. 1 notv looked 
round me and found the place but small and shapeless. At 
the farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance, yd 
so low, it must oblige me to creep upon uiy hand, and 
knees to it ; so, having no candle, I suspended my enter- 
prise till the next day, and then 1 came provided v.ith two 
large ones of my own making. 

Having crept ur^on ray hands and feet through this strait, 
I found the roof higher up, 1 think about twenty feet. But 
surely mortal "never saw such a glorious sight before ! The 
roof and walls of this cave reiiected a hundred thousand 
lights to me from my two candles, as thovgh they w^ere in- 
rdented with shining gold, precious ston.'s, or sparkling 
diamonds. And, indeed, it was the most d'jlightful cavity or 
'grotto of its kind, that could be desired, though entirely 
'dry. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind of 
gravel upon it; no nauceous venomous creatures to l)e seen 
there, neither any damp or wet about it. i could find no 
ffiult but in the entrance, and I began to think that even 
this might be very necessary for my defence, and therefore 
resolved to make it my most principal magazine. I brought 
hither two fowling-pieces, and three muskets, leajting only- 
five pieces at my castle, planted in the nature of cannon. 
Of the barrel of gunpowder which I took up out of the sea, 
I brought away about sixty pounds of good powder, which 
"was not damaged; and this, with a great quanUty of lead 
for bullets, I removed from my castle to this retreat, now- 
fortified both by art and nature. 

J fanced myself now like one of the giants of old, who 
Were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac- 
cessible to any but themselves; or, at least, a most danger- 
ous at.om;>t. And njw^ I despised both chc cunnnig and 
Itrength of the savages, either to find me out or to hurt mc.

LTFE ATD ADVENTURES 



But I mnst not forget the old goat, which caiis;d my lali 
dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the 
ghost the day after my dibcovery; and it being diflOcult to 
drag him out, 1 dug his grave, and honourably entombed 
him in the same place where he departed, with as much 
ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred about 
the high rnountain Penmanmawr. 

I think r now was in the twenty-third year of my reign] 
and my thoughfs mnch ensier than formerly, having contri^ 
red several pretty amusements and diversions to pass away 
the time in a plca^nt manner. By this time my pretty Pol"^ 
had learned to speak English, and pronounce' his word 
verv articulately and plain; so that for many hours we nse 
to (r it together afrer a famiirar manner, and he lived wif 
Bie no less than tuen-y-six yenrs. My dog, which w 
Dincteen years old, sixt^-en of which he lived with me, die 
some time ago of mers old age. As for my cats, they mul 
tiplied so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them intc. 
the wood?, eACjpt two or three which became my pcrticuUr 
favourites. Besides these. I continually ke.)t two or thre© 
household kids alj«ut me, which I learned to feed o'lt of my 
liand, and two more parrots which could talk indilierently, 
and call Robivsmi Crusoe^ but n»t so excellently as the firstJ 
as not taking that pains with them. I had also several sea-^ 
fowls which I had wounded and cut their wings; an<L 
growing tame, they used to breed among the low tree«] 
about iny castle walls, all which made my abode verw 
agreeable. 

But what unforseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy, 
ment of this uncertain state of life, vrhen we least expec 
them! It was now the month of December, in the southeraS 
solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which required! 
my attendance in the fields; when going oat pretty early 
one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared to me 
from the sea-shore, a llaming liglit, about two miles from ' 
me at the east end of the island, where I had observed somM 
savages had been before, not on the other side, but to mj'^ 
great aflliction, it was on my side the island. 

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen- 
sions, that the savages would perceive \uy improvements, I 
returned direc/ly to my cattle, ])ulled the ladder after me, 
making all things look as wild and nainral as 1 possibly 
OQuld. In the next place, I put myself in a posture oi

defence, loaded nir muskets and pistols, and committing 
myself to God's protection, I resolved to defend nivscif till 
my last breath. T\\ o hours after, im];atient for intelligence, 

1 set my ladder up to the side of the hill, where theie was 

2 flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me, ascended 
to the to]), wliere, laying myself on my belly, with my per- 
spective glass, 1 perceived no loss than nine naked savages, 
sitriiiground a small lire, eating, as I supposed, human llesh, 
with their two ca:ioes hailed on shure, waiting for the Hood 
to cany them off again. Von cannot ea.>ilj- express the 
consterna ion I was in at this sigiit, es})ecidlly seeing them 
near me; but when 1 perceived their coming must be 
ilvpays with the current of the ebb, J became more easy in 
my thoughts, being fully convinced that I might go abroad 
with securitj^ all the time !>f Hood, if they were n )t before 
landed. And, indeed, this proved just as I imagined: for 
10 sooner did thty all take boat and paddle away, but the 
tide made N. W. Before tkey went olf, they danced, 
naking ridiculous poi-tures and gestures, for aJjove an hour, 
ill stark-ii*ked : but whecher men or women, or both, I 
30uld not perceive. When { saw tii«in goi:^, 1 took two 
5^ns upon my shoulders, and placing a couple of pi-tols ia 
i\y belt, with my greiit sword hanging by my side, i went 
o the hill, where at first I made a. discovery of these can- 
libals, and tlian saw th<?re had been threfi canoes more of 
he savagjs on shore at tliat place, which with the rest wer« 
naking over to the main larrd. 

But nothing could be more horrid to me, v/hen going to 
he place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other mangled 
Darts of human bodies ajjpeared in my sight ; and so fired 
vas I with indignation, that 1 was fully resolved to be rc- 
rengcd on the hrst that came there, though I lost my life 
n the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visit* 
rhich they make (o this island are not very frequent, it be- 
ng fifteen months before they came again : but still 
f was very uneasy, by reason of the dismal apprehensions 
)f their surprising me unawares ; nor dared I offer to lire a 
JUH on that side of the island where they used to appear, 
est, t:iking the alarm, the savages might return with many 
lundred canoes, and then God knows in what manner I 
hould have made my end. Thus was la year or more bs» 
©re J saw^ny of these devouring cannibals again. 






76 tlFE AND ADYENTURES 

But to waTe.this, the following accident, which demandw 
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts iRj 
revenging myself on thope Heathens. I 

On the 16th of May (according to my wooden calendar)! 
the wind blew exceedingly liard, accompanied with abun-3| 
dance of lightening and thunder all day, and succeeded by ai 
Tery stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens^ 
Baade me hare recourse to my Bible. Whilst I was scri. ^ 
ously pondeiing upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the*^ 
Hoise of a g'-'.n, which I conjectured was fired upon the 
ocean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in 
jninutCj when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain as 
before, that very moment a fiash of fire •)resaged the reports 
of another gun, which I presently heard, and found it wasj 
from that pait of the sea where the current drove me away, j 
I could not but then think, that this must be a ship in dis 
tress, and that these were the melancholy signals for a.i 
speedy deliverance. Great, indeed, was my s®rrow upou 
this occasion ; but my labours to assist them must have 
proved altogether vain and fruitless. However, I brought 
together all the dry wood th*t was at hand, and making a 
pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. 1 was certain 
they plainly perceived it, by thsir firing another gun as soon 
as it began to blaze, and after that several more from the 
same quarter. All night long I kept up my fire; and 
when the air cleared up, I perceived something a great way 
at sea directly E. but could not distinguish what it was, 
even with my glass, by reason the weather was so very 
foggy out at sea. However, keeping my e^es directly fixed 
upon it-, and perceiving it did not stir, I presently concluded 
it must be a khip at anchor, and so yery hasty [ was to be 
satisfied, that taking the gun, I went to the S. E. part of the 
island, to the same rocks where I had been formerly drove 
away by the current: in which time the weather being 
perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the 
wTeck of a ship cast away upon those hidden rocks I found 
when I was out with my boat; and v^hicb, by making a 
kind of an eddy, were the occasion of my preservation. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another's ruin ; for un^ 
doubtedly this ship had been driven on them in the night, 
the wind blowing strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived I 
the inland, as I now guessed they had not, certainly, instead I 
©/ firing their guns for help, they would rather hare vcn

Iprncd In tlieir bo?.t> and ^avcd them ^clres that M-ay. I iVm 
thought, that perhaps they had done so, upon seeing UiV 
fire, and were ca:bt away ui the attempt; for 1 perceived 
DO boat m the ship. But jhen I again imagined, that, per- 
haps, they had another vessel in company, v.hich, upon 
gignaJ, saved their lives, and tooL the boat up: or that the 
boat might be driven into the main ocean, -where tiiese poor 
crearurcs might be in the most miserable condition. But 
as all these conjectures were very uncertain, I could do no 
more than coramisserate their distress, and thank God for 
delivering me, in particular, when so many perished in the 
lading ocean. 

"When I considered seriously every thing concerning this 
wreck, and could jierceivc no room to suppose any of them 
saved, \ cannot ex-dain, by any possible force of words, what 
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often breaking out 
in this manner : '• O that there had been but two or three, 
'•nay, even one person .saved, that ^\e might have lived 
'• together, conversed with, and comforted one another'." 
and so much were my de>ires moved, that when ] repeated 
these words, " Oh 1 tiiat there had been but one!'' ciy 
hands would clench together, and my fingers press X\\t 
palms of my hands so close, that, hid any soft thing been 
between, it would have crushed it involuntarily, while my 
teeth wjuld strike together, and set against each o^her so 
strong, that it required some time for me to part them. 

Till the last year of my being on this i-iJand, I never 
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship, 
1 had the afiliction, some time afcer, to see the corpse of a 
drov.ned boy come on shore, at the end of the island 'vvhich 
|was next the shipwreck ; there was nothing on him but a 
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-knted linen dravvers, 
and a blue linen shirt, but no particular mark to guess what 
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, 
and a tobacco-pipe, the last of which I preferred rauch 
more than I did the first. And now the calmness of t'ao 
sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck, 
not only to ^<i\. something necessa.y out of the shir-, but 
perhaps some living creature might be on board, m hose 
life I might preserve. This had i-uch an influence u.oii 
my mind, that immediately 1 went home, and ^re .i.ed 
every thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on boar^

any boat proviiilons of all sorls, ^vith a good quantity of rum 
I'resh water, and a coiiij^ass : so putting off, i paddled th 
canoe aioug the f'hore, till 1 came at last to the iiorth-eas 
];art of the island, from Vrhcnce 1 was to launch into tht 
-ocean; but here the currents ran so Tiolently, and ap| earec 
£0 terrible, that my heart began to fail me ; foreseeing tha 
df I was driven into any of these currents, I might be car. 
ried not only out of reach or sight of the island, but cyci 
jtievitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean. 

So oppresjicd was 1 at these troubles^ that I gave ovc 
Si'^'V enterprise, sailing to a littlt creek on the shore, whcru 
stepping out, I set me down on a rising hill, very pcnsiv* 
*?nd thoughtful. I then perceired that the tide w as turned 
inid the flood came on, which made it impracticable for mi 
^o go out for so many hours. To be more certain how^ thr 
sets of the tides or currents lay when the liood came in, 
iiscended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked thi 
iea both ways ; and here I found that as the current of th( 
*;bb set OMt close by the south point of the island, so th{ 
^current of the Hood set in close by the shore of the nortl 
fldc'. and all that J had to do, w^as to keep to the north o, 
the island in my return. 

That night i reposed myself in my canoe, coYercd wit]- 
tny watch-coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being m) 
tester. I set out with the first of the tide full north, till 1 
jfelt the benefit of the current, v, hich carried me at a grca 
Tate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, a: 
to take from me all government of my canoe ; so that ii 
two hours time I came up to the wreck, ^vhich appeare( 
to me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to l)e a Spanish 
Tcsscl by its building, stuck fast between two rocks; hef 
gtern and c^uarter beaten to pieces by the sea ; her mainj 
luast and foremast were brought ofi" by the board, that i^ 
T^roken off short. As I approached near, I ])erceived a do^ 
«n board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried, an(j 
110 sooner did I call him., but the poor creature jumped intc 
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famished witl 
Jiungcr and thirst : so that when I gave him a cake of brca ' 
^10 ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily ; and 
drank to that degree of fresh water, that he would ha 
liurst himself, had I suffered him. 

The first sight 1 met with in the ship, were two m

Searching further, I found a cask, containing aboub 
wenfy gallons, full of liquor, which, with some labour, l 
pt into my boat; in her cabin weic several muskets, which- 
[ let remain there, bat took away with me a great powder- 
lorn, with about four pounds of powder ' \ it. I took alsa

ing of the chest, several things appeared very useful to me! 
for ii)sta!ice, [ found ia one a very (ine case of bottles, con 
taining- the finest and best sorts of cordial w aters ; each 
bottle held about three {)iiits, curiously tipt with silver. 1 
found also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and 
two more which the water had utterly spoiled. There 
"were likewise several good shirts, exceedingly welcome to 
me; and about one dozen and a half of white linen handker- 
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which w^as 
absoiuiely necessary for wiping my face in a hot day; and, 
in tiie till, I found three bags of })ieces of eight, about eleven il 
hundred in all, in one of w hich, decently wrapped up in a^t! 
]>iece of paper, were six doubloons of gold, and some small 
bars and wedges of the same metal, which I believe might 
weigh near a pound. In the other chest, which I guested, 
to belong to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumstances 
%hich attended it, 1 found only some clothes of very little 
Yalue, except about tw^o pounds of fine glazed powder, in 
t^rec llasks, kept, as I believe, for charging the fowling- 
pieces on any occasion ; so that in, the whole, I had no 
great advantage by this voyage. The money was ind;^cd 
p!? n)ere dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all v/hich I 
■would have freely parted with for two or thice' pair of Eng- 
lish shoes and stockings ; things that for many years I had 
not worn, except lately those which I had taken off the feet 
of those unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, 
yet not so good ao English shoes, either for ease or service. 
I also found in the seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eighth' 
in royals, but no gold; so concluded that what 1 topl^ 
from the first belonged" to an officer, the latter ai-'pearin^j 
to have a much inferior person for its owner. Iiowever^4 
as despicable as the money seemed, I likewise lugged it t<A 
my cave, laying it up securely as I did the rest of myh 
cargo; and after I had done ail this, I returned back t '" 
my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I cam-e to m 
old harbour, where J carefully laid her up, and so made th 
best of my way to my castle. When I arrived there, ever 
thing seemed safe and quiet: so that now my only busines 
was to repose myself after my wonted manner, and tak 
care of my domestic a1!'airs. But though I might have live 
very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely needful ; ye 
still I was more vigiia-it than usual upon account of the sa4 
va^es, never going much abroad j or, if I did^ it was to the

I cannot, however,, but consider niyself as one of the un-

e^S LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

^old bcforo the cruel Spaniards came among them : On© 
night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and 
twentieth year of my solitude, J lay do^vn to sleep, very 
"well in health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon un- 
easiness either of body or mind ; yet, notwithstanding, I] 
could not compose Hiyself to sleep all the night long. All' 
this tedious while, it is impossible to express what innumer- 
able thoughts came into my head. I traced quite over the 
whole history of my life in miniature, from my utmost re, 
piembrance of things till I came to this island, and then 
proceeded to examine every action and passage that hadj 
occurred since I had talxcn possession of my kingdom. Inl 
my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy ^ 
posture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to this 
iife of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered a i 
print of a foot in the sand; that while I rontinised without 
apprehensions 1 was incapable of feeling the dread and ter-, 
ror I now suffered. How thankful rather ought I to 
have been for the knowledge of my danger, since the 
|3;reatest happiness one can be possessed 0/ is to have suffi- 
cient time to i)rovide against it? How stupendous is th<5 
fifoodness of Providence, m hi( h sets such narrow bounds to 
the sight and kno^vledge of h\iman nature, that while men 
walk in the midst of so many dangers, they are Ic^^pt serene 
and calm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes, 
jand knowing nothing of those many dangers that surround 
thcin, till perhaps they are dissipated and vanish away. 

When I came moie particularly to consider of the real 
tlanger I had for so many years escaped; how I had walked 
about in the greatest security and tranquillity, at a time, 
perhaps, when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great 
tree, or the common approach of night, had interposed be- 
tween me and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who^ 
would devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a 
pigeon or curlew; surely all this, I say, could not but 
Fiiake me sincerely thankful to my great Preseiver, whose 
singular protection I acknowledge with tlie greatest humi- 
lity, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into 
ihc cruel hands of those dovourers. 

Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest manner, 
'p,ccording to my weak undcrstaiiding, I next proceeded to- 
fionsider the wretched nature of those destroying savages, 
,|)y seeming, though with great reverence, to inquire, why 
CtoU should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity^

^ 



even to bruialify itsrlf, to devour its own kind ? but as this 
>vas rather matter of abstruse speculation, and as my miser- 
able situation made me think tliis of mine the most uncom- 
fortable situation in the world, 1 then began rather to inq«in? 
what part of tlie world these wretches lived in ; how far-olT 
the coast was from whence they came; why they ventured 
over so far from home; what kind of boats conveyed them 
hither; and why I could not order myself and my business 
60, that I might be a^ able to attain their country, as they 
were to come to my kingdom ? 

Jjut then, thouoiit i, how sliall I mana2;e myself when I 
c»me thither? what will become of me if I fall into thn 
hands of the savag'S ? or how shali I escape from them, if 
they make an attempt upon me? and supposing I should nofc 
fall into their rower, what shall I do for provisions, or which 
way shall J bend my cours**? These counter-thoughts threw 
me into the greatest horror and confusion imaginable ; but 
then I stili looked upon my present condition to be the most 
miserable that possible could be; and tliat nothing could be 
worse, except death. For (thought I) could I but attain 
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with some re- 
lief, or coast it along, as I did with my boy Xury, on the 
African shore, till 1 came to some inhabited country, where 
I might meet witli some relief, or fall in with some Christian 
ship that might take me in ; and if 1 failed, w by then I could 
but meet with death, which w ould put an end to all my mise- 
ries. Thc^e thoughts, I must confess, where the fruit of a 
distempered mind, an impatient temper made desperate, as it 
were, by long continuance of the troubles and disappoint- 
ments I had met wih in the wreck, where I hoped to have 
found some living persons to speak to, by whom I might 
have known in what place 1 was, and of the probable means 
of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated, 
my resignation to the will of Heaven were entirely suspend- 
ed, so that I had no power to fix my mind to any thing, but 
io the project of a vo} age to the main land. And, indeed, 
so much was I inliaraed upon this account, that it set my 
blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat high, as though I 
had been in a fever; till nature being, as it were, fatigued 
and exhau«;ted with the thoughts of it, made me submit my- 
t self to a silent repose. 

: In such a situation, it is very strange, that I did not

ir,i;Hl roved oa a qnitc different thing, alfopcef-hcr forci^w, 
1 dreamed, that as I was i3«uing from irfv castli! one morn, 
iTig, as customary, when I ptTccived \i],on the shore, fw.j 
cauocs,a[id el. • .:a savages coming to lauJ, who had brought 
with then another Indian, whom they design .d to make a, 
s.'icrifice of, in order to devour; but just as they were going; 
io give the fatal blow, methjught th^^ poor dt^iiigned victim 
jumped away, and ran directly into my little' thick grove 
before my fortihcation, to abscond from his enemies, when 
perceiving that the others did not follow him tliat way, I 
aiipeared to him ; that he humbly kneeled down before 
me, seemed to pray -for my assistance; upon which I 
showed him my ladder, made hiin ascend, carried him to 
my cave, and he became my scrvaiit; and when I had 
gotten this man, [ said to myself, no\v surely I may have 
some hopes to attain the main land; for this fellow will 
serve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I must 
go for provisions, what places to shun, -what to venture to, 
and wiiat to escajie. But when I awaked, and found ai 
these inexpressible im ressions of joy entirely vanished, I 
fell into the great, st dejection of spirit imaginable. 

Yet this dream brought me to redect, that one sure way 
of cscardng was to get a savege; that af'er I had ventured 
my life to deliver him from the bljf dy jaws of hisdevourers. 
the natural sense he might have of snch a preservation, 
might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and m.ost sincere 
affection. But then this otjecti;>n reasonably interposed : 
hew can I effect this, rtiought 1, without I attack a whole 
company of them, and kill them all? why should J proceed 
on such a desperate attempt, which my scruples before had 
suggested to Ire unlawful? and indeed my heart trembled 
at the thoughts of so much blood, though it were a meai 
to procure my deliverance. *Tis true, I might reasonabh 
enough sui}pose these men to be real enemies to my Jifd 
men who would devour me, was it in their j-ov/er; so fhi 
it was self preservation in the highest degree to free myseli 
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfejty as H 
they were actually assaulting me: though all these thingSj 
I say, seemed to me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as J 
just said before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding huniao 
blood, struck such a terror to my soul, that it was a long 
time before I could reconcile myself to it.

liot'.vithstandinj (ho vnnny disputes and pcr|)lo.xitIes I Iiad 
with myself, I at lengtli resolved, riglit or wrong, to get one 
of these savages, into my ha. ids, cost what it would, or even 
though I should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired wilh 
this iirm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find out 
what methods I should take to amwer my design : this, in- 
deed, was so difficult a task, that J could not pitch upon any- 
probable means to execute it : I therefore resolved conti- 
nually to be in a vigilant posture, to i)erceive when thesa- 
Tages came on shore, and to leave the rest to the event, let 
the opportunities otier as they would. 

Such was my fixed resokitions; and accordingly I set 
myself upon the scout, as often as I could, till such time as I 
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year and a 
half, the greatest part of wliieh I went out to the west and 
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to look 
for canoes, but none a])peared. This v/as a very great dis- 
courgement ; yet though I was rery much concerned, the 
edge of my desi^^n was as keen as ever, and tlie longer it 
seemed to be delayed, the more eager "it as I for it; in a 
word, I never before was so careful to slum the loathing 
sight of these savages, as I was now eager to be with them ; 
and I thought my elf sufticiently able to manage one, two, 
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them my en- 
tire slaves, to do whatsoever I should direct tijem, and pre- 
sent their being able at any time to do me a mischief. Many 
times did I use to please myself with these thoughts, with 
long and ardent expectations; but nothing presenting, all 
my deep projected schemes and numerous fancies vanished 
away, as though, while I -jtainedsuch t}ioughts,the decrees of 
Providence were such that no savages were to come near me. 

About a year and a half after, when I was seriously mus- 
ing of sundry other ways how I should attain my end, one 
morning early, I was very much surprised by seeing no less 
than five canoes all on shore together, on my side the island, 
and the savages that belonged to them all landed, and out 
of my sight. Such a number of thciti di'^concerted all my 
measures; for, seeing so many boats, each of which would 
contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell what to 
think of it, or how lo order my measures, to attack twenty 
or thirty men single-handed; upon which, much dispirited 
and perplexed. 1 lay still in my, castle; which, however, I 
put in a proper posture for an attack; and having formerly 
provided all that was necessary, was soon ready to enter

upon an cngagcTDcit, should they atterns)L Having ^raf 
for some time, my iaiuatierit temper would let me bear it n 
longer; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, 
ysual, ascended up U the top of the hill at two stages, stand 
ing, however, in such a manner, that my head did not ap 
pear above the hill, sj that they caakl not easily perceiv 
me; and here, by the assistance of my perspective glass, 
ob^Ci"ved- no less thaii thirty in number around a lire, feasting 
upon vi^hat meat they had dressed; how they cooked it, or 
what it was, I could not then perfectly tell; but they were 
all dancing and capering about the fiarne?, using many 
frightful and barbarous gestures. 

But while, with a ciuious eye, I was beholding these 
"wretches, my spirits sunk within me, when I perceived 
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act 
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done 
before. It was not long before one of them fell uuon the 
ground, knocked down, as I suppose, v.dth a club or wooden 
sword, for that was their manner; while two or three jothers 
wentimmcni.>tely to work, cutting him open for their cook-, 
er)', and then foil to devonr him as they had done the for, 
mcr, while the last unhappy captive was left by himself, 
till such time as they were ready for him. The poor crea- 
ture looked round him with a wi^hfel eye, trembling at th*. 
thoughts of dea'h ; yat, seeing himself a little at liberty, na- 
ture, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with ho'ie* 
of lite : He started away from them, and ran, with incre- 
dible swiftness, along the sands, directly to that part of the 
coast where my ancient and venerable castle stood. 

You may well iiudgine, I was d, -adfully alFrighted upon 
this occasion, when, as 1 thought, they pursued him in a 
whole body, all running towards my palace. And now, 
indeed, I expected that part of my dream was going to' 
bo fuimied, and that he would certainly ily to my grove 
for protecti.jii ; but, for the rest of my dream, I could de- 
pend nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him 
thither, and hnd him there. However, my spirits, begin- 
ning to recover, I still kept upon my guard ; and [ now 
plainly perceived there were but three men out of the num- 
ber that pursued him. I was infinitely pleaded with v/hat 
swiftness the poor creature ran from his pursuers, gained s.> 
much ground upon them, that I plainly perceived could hi. 
thus hold out for Julf an hour, there was not the least doubt

Ect-vrecn them and my castle there was a rreelc, (hat 
TC.'v same Miiiih I haiiod into Avith all my etiects from the 
wreck of the ship, on the steep banks of which I very 
much feared the j oor victim would be t.iken. if ho could 
jjot swim for his escape : But soon was 1 out of pain for 
}iim, when I | erccived he made nothing of it, though at 
full tide, but wi(h a:i intiepid courai^e, spurred on by tlie 
fense of danger, he plunged in<o the Hood, swinmiing over 
in about thirty stroke?, a'.ul then landing, ran with the 
fame incredible strength and swif'ness as before. When 
the three pur>juers can)e to the cre.-k, one of them, who 1 
perceived could not Fv\im, happily for his part, returned 
to his company, while the o'hers, with equal courago, ])ut 
much less swiftness, attained (he other side, as thoujrh they 
were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now 
or never I thought was the time for me to procure me a 
servant, comjianion, or assistant ; and that I was decreed 
by IVovidoncc to be the instrument to save this poor crea- 
ture's life. 1 immediately descended ray two ladders with 
the greatest expedition ; 1 took np my two guns, which, I 
faid before, Avere at the bottom of them, and getting up 
jigain with tlie same haste towards the hill, I m^ide nearer 
the sea. Inn word, taking a short cut down the hill, I 
interposed between Lhe i)ursuers and pursued; hallooing 
aloud to the latter, who, venturing to l.)ok back, was, no 
<loubt, as much terrified at me as J at them. I beckoned 
to him wi-h my hand, to return back ; in the mean time 
advancing towards the pursuers, and rushing on the fore- 
most, 1 knocked him down with the stock of my piece, 
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to 
fire, least the rest should hear, though at a distance, T ques- 
tioned whether theyNcould or no; andbeing ont of si^ht of 
the srackc, they could not easily liave known what to make 
of it. The other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as 
if he had been amazed; when, advancing towards him, I 
-could perceive him take his bow from his back, and, fix- 
ing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at me, and, with- 
out dispute, miglit have lodged the arrow in my breast; 
but, in this absolutely necessary case of self preservation, I 
immediately fired at him, and shot him dead, just as his 
hand was going to draw the fatal string. All tliis while, 
the savage who had fled before stood still, and Iiad the ^a-

figncd to talie away his life; so affrighted ^ras he with the 
fue and noise of my piece, that he stood, as it were, like 
Lot's wife, fixed and immovable, without either sense or 
motion. This obliged m.e to holloo to him again, making 
the plainest ^igns J could to him to draw nearer, i per- 
ceived he understood those tokens by his approaching to 
mc a little v.ay, when, as if afiaid 1 should ki!I him too, 
he stopped again. Several times did he advance, and as i 
often stop in this manner, till comii^g more to my view. I J 
perceived him trembling as if he was to undergo the same i 
fate. Upon which 1 looked npon him with a smiling I 
countenance, and still beckoning to him, at length he' 
came close to me and kneeled down, kissed the ground, : 
laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, set it j 
jipon his head; and this, as I understood afterwards, was^ 
a token of swearing to bo my slave for ever. I took him 
up, and, making much of him, encouraged him in the best 
manner I c:)uld. But my work was not yet finished 
for I perceived the savage whom I had knocked down, was 
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to como 
to himself. Upon which I pointed to my new servant, and 
showed him that his enemy was not yet expired ; he spoke 
some words to me, but which I could not understand; yet 
being the first sound of a man's voice I had heard for above 
twenty-five years, they were very pleasing to me. But 
there was no time for retlection now, the wounded sa\i!ge 
recovering himself so far as to sit upon the ground, which- 
made my poor prisoner as much afraid as before; to put 
him out of fear, I presented my other gun at the man, with' 
an intent to shoot him; but my savage, for so I must now 
.call him, prevented my firing, by making a motion to mc 
to lend him my SAvord, which hung naked in my belt by my 
side. No sooner did I grant his request, but away he rnns 
to his enemy, and at one blow cut ofi his head as dexterously 
as the most accomplished CACCutioner in Germany could have 
done; for, it seems, these creatures make use of wooden 
swords made of hard wood, which will bear edge enough to 
cut off heads and arms at one blow. When this valorous 
exploit was done, he comes to me laughing, as a token of 
triumph, delivered me my sword again, with abundance of 
surprising gestures, la) ing it, along with the bleeding and 
•ghastly head Qf the Indian; at my feet. 



or ROBINSON CRUSOP. S9 

Thp groafcst asfonisliment that my ncv.* servant conrcircd 
tTiis the manner of killing the sava^je at such a distance, 
vithout a bow and arrow ; and such was his loni;in:T desire 
to know it, that he firjst pointed to the dead carcase, and 
then made si:;ns to me to grant him leave to go to him. 
Upon which I bade him go, and, as well as I could, made 
him sensible I gratited his request. But when he came, 
there, how wonderfully Mas he struck with amazement! 
First he turned him on one side, then on another, wonder- 
ing he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding 
inwardly; and after sufficiently aJmiring the wound the 
bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar- 
rows, and came back again: upon Mhich 1 turned to go 
•way, makitig my signs to him to follow, lest the vest^ mis- 
ding their companions, might come in pursuit of them, and 
this I found he understood very well; by his making me 
understand that his design was to bury them, that thev might 
not be seen if it happened; and which by signs again I 
made him sensible 1 very much approved of. lufmediately 
he fell to work, and never was grave-digger more dextrous 
in the world than he was; for in an instant, as I might say, 
he scraped a large hole in the sand with his hands, sufficient 
to bury the first in ; there he dragged him, and wirhout anv 
ceremony he covered him over ; in like manner he served 
the other; so that I am sure no undertaker could be more 
expert in his business; for all this was done »a less than a 
quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and instead 
of carrying him directly to my castle at first, I conveyed him 
to my cave on the farther part of the island; and so mv 
dreani was now fulliiled in that particular, that my grov« 
should prove an asylum or sanctuary to hiin. 

Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must 
this poor creature be, supported chiefly by the vivacitv of 
spirit, and uncommon transports of joy that his deliverancvs 
occa.sioned. Here 1 gave hiui bread and a bunch of raisiui 
to eat, and water to drink, ou which he fed very cheerfullv, 
to his exceeding refreshment, I then made him a conveui- 
LMit bed with a parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, 
(a bed which I used m^^self sometimes) and then pointing 
to it, made signs for him to lie down to sleep, upon whicii 
the poor creature went to take a welcome repose. 

Indeed he was a very comely, handsome young fellow, ot^

luit fall and wcU-shapcd, and, as near as I could rcclxon,>i 
about tuenty-six years of age. His countenance had no- 
thing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his 
face; and yet, especially when he smiled, he had all the' 
sweetness and softness of an Eurojean. His hair was not 
curled like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and 
black, with the most beautiful yet careless tresses spreading 
ever his shoulders. He had a very high and large forehead, 
•^vilh a great vivacity and s[.arkling sharpness in his eyes. 
His skin was not so tawney as the V^irginian Brazilians, or 
other Americans ; but rather of a bright dun olive colour, 
that had something agreeable in it, though not yery easy to 
gi\e a description of. His face was round and plump, with 
a small nose, very different from the flatness of the negroes, 
a lirtitty small mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very v\'ell set, 
and white as the driven snow\ In a word, such handsome 
features, and exact symmetry in every part, made me con- 
siiier, that J had saved the life of an Indian princ<>, no less 
graceful and accom.plished than the great Oroonoko, whose 
Dumorabie behaviour, and unhappy contingencies of life, 
have charmed the world, both to admiration of his person, 
and'compassion to his sufferings. 

But let him be either prince or peasant, all my hap])iness 
centered in this, that 1 had now got a good servant or com- 
panion, to whom, as he deserved, I was resolved to prove a 
kind masiei, and a lasting friend. He had not, I tl-.ink, slept 
above an hour, when he awaked again, and while I was 
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards 
ijic in my inclosure, and layng himself down on the 
ground, in live lowest prostration, made all the antic gestures 
imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me for being his 
deliverer. I confess, though the minn'r of his behaviour 
seemed to bc~ludicrous enough to occasion laughter, yet I 
iv.as very miuch moved at his affection, so that my heart 
melted within me, fearing he might die away in excess of 
ioy, like reprieved malefactors ; especially as 1 was incapable 
cither to let him blood, or admniister physic. H were 
to be wished that Christians would take example by this 
Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance of the benefits and 
deliverances they have received, by the kind mediation 
^nd powerful interposition of their benefactors and deliver- 
ers : and it would be likewise hajipy for mankind, w ere 
tiifjye no occasion to blame many, who^ instead of thankfully

ackniwletl^mg favours and benefits, rather abuse and con- 
domn rh;)sc who have been the instruments to save them 
from destruciiou. 

But leavino these just refleetion^, I return to the object 
that occasioned them ; for my man, to conclude the last 
ceremony of obedience, Liid down his head a«;ain on thvi 
ground, close to my foot, and tet my other fjjt upon hli 
head, as he had done before, making; all thcsij(;isof subjec- 
tion, servitude, and submission ima^(inable, and let me un- 
derstand he would serve me as louu; as his life endtired. A?? 
I understood him in many things, 1 made him sensible I was 
very well pleased with him; and, in a little time, I began 
to speak -to him, and learn him to talk to me again. In the 
first place I made him understand his name was to be Fri- 
day, because it was upon that day 1 saved his life; then I 
taught him to say Master, which I made liim sensible was 
to be my name. I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, 
and to know what they meant. I gave him some milk in an 
earthen pot, making him view me while I drank it before 
him, and soaked my bread in it; I gave him a cake of bread, 
and caused him to soak it likewise, to which he readily con- 
sented making signs of the greatest satisfaction iuiaginable. 

All that night did I keep him there ; but no sooner did 
the morning light appear, when 1 ordered him to arise, and 
come along with me, with certain tokens that I would give 
him gome clothes like mine, at which he seemed very glad, 
being stark naked, w ithout the least covering v.hatever, — - 
As we passed by the place where the two men had boea 
interred, my man pointed directly to their graves, showlnsf 
me the marks that he had made to find them agairi, givin?^ 
me to understand, by signs, that we should dig them up, 
and devour them. At this J appeared extremely displeased, 
expressed my utmost abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the 
apprehension of it, beckoning with my hand to come away, 
which he did with the greatest reverence and submission. 
After this I conducted him to the to)) of the hill, to view if 
the rest of the savages were yet remaining there ; but when 
I looked through my perspective glass, 1 could see no ap- 
pea-ance of them, nor of their canoes ; so that it was very 
evident they never minded their d *cea«;ed companions whom 
wc had slain; which if they had, they would surely. have 
searched for, or left one boat behind for them to folluWj, 
alter they returned from their pursuit.

S2 tilFE AXD ADTESTURES 

Ciinosky, and a desire of sathfaction, aalmatlng me \vifl 
rouiage to see this scene of })arbarity, I took my man Fri- 
<!ay With me, putting a sword into his hand, with the bo\y' 
and arrows at his back, which I i)crceivcd he could use 
Tery dextrously, cansijig him to carry one g'ln for me, and 
I two for myself; and thus equipped against ail attacks, 
away we marched directly to the place of their bloody enl 
lertainnicnt. Bat vvlien I came there, I was struck with 
the utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday 
"»vas no way concerned abaut it, being no doubt in his turn 
one of these devourers. Here lay several human bones, there 
several psieccs of mangled tiesh, half eaten, mangled and 
scorched ; whilst streains of bio 3d ran promiscuously as 
waters from a fountain. As I wm musing on this dreadful 
sight, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular 
signs, to make me understand, that they had brought over 
four prisoners to feast upon, three of whom they had eaten 
up, and that he was the fourth, poinMng to himself; that 
there having been a bloody battle between them and his 
great Ling, in the just defence of whom he was taken pri, 
fconer, with many others; all of these were carried oil" to 
^iiiferent places to bo devoured by their conquerors ; and 
that it was his misfortune to be brought thither hy these 
wrenches for the same purpose. 

After 1 was made sensible of these things, 1 caused Fri- 
Hzy to gather those liorrid remains, and lay them together 
H.'on a heap, which ] ordered to be set on fire, and bura 
thf;m to ashes : jMy man, however, still retained the nature 
of ii cannibal, having a hankering stomach after some of the 
jlesh : but sucli an extreme abhorrence did I express at the 
least appearimcc of if, that he durst not but conceal it; for 
1 made him very sensible, that if he oiFered any such thing, 
I Mould certain] V shoot him. 

This being done, I carried my man with me to my castl', 
nnd gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had takta 
€ut of the poor guaner's chest before mentioned; and 
which with a l.'tle alteration, fitted him very well: in the 
next place I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, such as my 
t'kiU was able to maMage, and indeed I thought myself then 
a tolerable good tailor. I gave liim also a cap which 1 
made of a hare's skin, very convenient and fashionable. — ■ 
Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man Avas no less 
proud of hiii habitj than I was at seeing him iu it. Indeed lay

him, and by using himself to them, at length i,:' fo^k to 
them very well. 

My ncit concern was, whore I !^honld f id-., r.i ;, ; md 
thAt I might da well by him, and yet be pcrftcrly easy Thy- 
self, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place }>of^r^:eTt 
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, anct the out- 
side of the tirst ; and, as (here was an entrance or door in- 
to my cave, I made a fonual framed door-case, and a door 
to opew on the inside; 1 barred it np in 'henigU* time. Lik- 
ing in mv ladders too, so that, wa.s my man to i;rove treach- 
erous, there could be uo way to coaie at me In the inside 
of mv innermost wall, without making so much no'se in 
getting over, that it must needs waken me; for my lirst 
wall had now a comrdete roof cv;;r it of long poles, spread- 
ing over my tent, and leading np to the side of the n.oun- 
tain, which was again laid Cio'-s with smaller sticks instead 
of Idtlis, and tha'ched over a great thickness with the rice 
straw, which was as strong as reed? : and at the hole of the 
place, left on purpose to go in and out by the ladder, had 
jiliiced a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted 
on the outside, would not have opened at all, hnt have 
fallen down, and made a great noise; and as to my wea- 
pons, every night I took t]>em all to my bed-idc^ 

But there was no occasit-n for this precaution ; for surety 
never master had a more sincere, faithful, and loving ser- 
vant than Friday proved to me. V/irhout pa-;sion, sn'len- 
ness, or design, perfecilv obliging and engaging, hU a'fi-c- 
lions were as Uiuch tied to me, as those of a child to its 
parents; and J might ven<:ure to say, lie would have sacri- 
ficed his life for the saving mine, upon any occ:i>ion vhat- 
socvei-. And, iiKl;.'ed, the many te*-^inio:iies he g3-vc me of 
this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion ;o use 
these precautions. At\d here I could not but roflt'Ci: v, itii 
grea: wonder, that, however it hith pleaded th3 Ahntghty 
in his providence, and in tht; government of the creation, 
to take from so great a part of the world of his CTCj-^urcs, 
the noblest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of 
their souls are adapted: yet that he has- bestowed upon

ronsidcreti hov/ mean a use we make of all these, even 
though we have these powers enlightcd by the Holf| 
Spirit; of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an ' 
addition to our understanding: and why it has pleased the 
heavenly wisdom to conceal the like saving knowledge 
from so many millions of souls, who would certainly make 
a much better use of it than genorally mankind do at this 
tinje. These rellce-tions would soiuetiraes lead n>e so far 
SiS toiuveigh the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, 
arraign the justice of such an arbitrary disposidon of things, 
that ^iiovild obscure that %iit from some, and reveal it to* 
othors, and yet expect a like duty from all. But I closed 
it uji, checking my (lioughis with this eoncl.ision; first. 
That we were ignorant of that right and law by whicli 
th-ose should be condemned; but as the Almighty was ne- 
tesj^arily, and hy the nature of his essence, in.initely just 
mid ho^" ; so it could not be otherwise-, hut that if these 
erea'^ures were all destined to absence from hiuiself, h was 
oi^ account of sin.;;ing against that light, which, as the 
S€ri;>t»re- sa}s, wras a law to themselves, and by such a rule 
'ds their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though 
1h« firs^ fonndatioii was nat discovered to us. And, se-

! ImMuvliatoly I cafrhcd hold of tpv man Friday, and biddinjr 

j him stand stitl, and net s^i^, I pr.'seiited iny y/vjcc. and shot 

I one of the Lids. My poor servant, mIio at a distance pci*- 

i ccived me kill his adversary, and yet did nji know by what 

I means, or how it was done, stood Irembiin^ and surprised, 

i and looked so amazed, that i thought he would have sunk 

into the earth, lie did not se;? the kid I aimed at, or be- 

I held I had killed it, but rip))ed up his walstcoitt to see if he 

I ^vas not wounded, thinking my resolution was to kill him; 

! for coming to nie, he fell on his knees, earnestly ji.ronounc- 

hiZ niauv thiugjs which I did not ;inder,stand the moaning 

of; which at length I perceived was, tJiat I would not 

take a way his life. 

Indeed I was much concerned to see hini in that con- 
dition, where nauire is upon the severest trial, when the 
immediate hand of death ts ready to put for ever a period 
to tills mortal life, and, indeed, so much compassion had I 
to this creature, that it was with ditllculty I refrained from 
tears. Cut. h;)wever, as another sort of countenance was 
necessary, and to convince hiai that I would do him no 
harm, I took him ismi'irg by the hand, then laughing at 
him, and pointing to the kid which 1 had slain, made signs 
to him to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less 
curious was he in viewing how the creature was killed, thrm 
he had been before in beholding the Indian ; which, while 
he was admiring at, 1 charged my gau again, and presently 
perceived a great fowl, like a hawk, perching upon a tree 
within shot: and therefore, to let Friday understand ^vhat 
I w as going to do, I called liim to me again, pointing at tho- 
fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made him under- 
stand that I would shout and kill that bird; accordingly 1 
fired, and bade him look, when immediately he saw the 
parrot fall down Again he stood like one amazed, not- 
withstanding all I had said to him: and the m.ore confound- 
ed he was, i)ecause he did not preceire me put any thing 
iwto my gun. L ndotibtedly a thing so iitterly strange, 
carrying death along with it, far or neai', cither to man of; 
beast, mv!st certai!>ly create the greatest astonishment to one 
who never had heard such a thing in his whole life; and 
really his amazement conrinned so long, that had I allowed 
it he would liave prostrated himself before me and my gun^ 
%%-itli the greatest -.vorshlj^ and adoratixjn. As for the guR,

in particular, lie wonid not so mnch as touch it for seTcrall 
days after, but Hou*vi come and coraumnicate his thoughts! 
to it, and talk to it, as if the senseless })iece had understood! 
and answered hiin ; all this T could perceive him do, when] 
he thought my back was turned, the (hief intent of which 
was, to desire it not to kill him, as ] afterwiirds came to 
understand. 

1 never strove to prevent his adrairaiijn, nor hinder him 
from those comici! ges^tures he used on such occasions; but 
when his astonishment was a little over, 1 made tokens to 
Idm to run and fetch the i)arrot that 1 had shot; which 
accordingly he did, staying sometime longer than usual, by 
reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some 
way further from the |)lace where he fill. In the mean 
time, he was looking for her I took the advantage* of 
charging my gun again, so that I might be ready for any' 
other mark that otiered ; but nothing more occurred at that 
time. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening 
took of tlic skin and divided the carcase as wellas I could. 
Part of the fiesh I stewed and boiled in a ]iot 1 had for this 
purpose. And then spreading my table, I sat down, giv« 
ing my man some of it to eat who was ^vonde^fully pleased, 
and seemed to like it very well; but what was the most 
surprising to him was to see me eat salt with it: upon 
•which he made me understand, that thj salt was \cTy bad 
forme; when putting a little into his mouth he seemed to 
nauseate in such a manner, as to spit and sj)iutter at it, 
and (hen washed his mouth with fresh water: but to show 
him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put some 
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and 
Fplutter as much for the want of it, as he had done at it;! 
yet all this proved of no signification to Friday ; and it wa&' 
along while before he could endure salt iu his meat or broth, 
and even then but a small quantity, 

Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat andl 
broth at that time, the next day 1 was resolved to feast him' 
with a roasted piece of the kid- And having no spit to 
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, [ made use of that common i 
artifice which many of the common people of England have, 
that is, to set two poles u|.on each side of the fire, andl 
one cross on the top, hanging the meat thereon ^ith a 
string, and so turning romd continually, roast it, in the 
same manner as wc read bloody tyrants of e'd cruelly roast^

cd the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admira- 
I tion in my man Friday, bei.r^^ quite another way than that 
sto which the savages were accustomed. But when he came 
fo taste the sweetness and tenderness of the flesh, lie ex- 
pressed his entire satisfaction ab )ve a tho>isand dili'erent 
hvays. And as 1 could not but understand his meaning, yoiv 
l.may be sure J was as wonJjrfuily pleaded, especially when 
he made it also very plain to me, that he would never, 
!, while he lived, eat man's llesh more. 

It was now high time 1 should set my seivant to work ; 
80 next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in 
he same manner as 1 had done before. And reaily the fel- 
low w as very quick and handy in the execution of any thiajj 
1 ordered him to go about. J made him understand that it 
was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see 
me make it. In short, he did every thing as I ordered him,, 
and in a little time as well as I could perform it myself. 

But now considering that 1 had two mouths to feed in- 
stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide moro 
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of com 
than J commonly used to do; upon which I marked out a 
larger piece of land, fencing it in, in the same manner as 
I had done before ; in the execution of which 1 must give 
Friday this good word, that no man could work more hardy, 
3r with better will than he did ; and when 1 made him sen- 
sible that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he 
hen very passionately made me understand, that he thought 
I had much more labour on his account, than ] had for mj- 
iclf : and that no ])ains or diligence should be wanting in 
tim, if I would but direct him in those works wherein he 
night ])rocecd. 

J mast certainly own, that this was the most pleasant year 

ever had in the island ; for after someiip.ie, Friday began 
o talk pretty well, and understood the names of those things 
vhich I was wont to call for, and the places where I used 
send him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been 
iseless so many years, except in an exclamatory manner, 
ither for deliverance or blessings, now began to be occu- 
pied in teaching, and talking to my man Friday ; for indeed 

had such a singular satisfaction in the fciiow himself, so 
nnoceat did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear more 
nd more to me every day, that 1 really began entirely to 
oye hini ; ar.J for his part, 1 b.'ierc there was uo love lost.

and that his nature had been more charmed by his eTcoedi 
mg kindness, and his alfections more placed a\)on me, thai

J once had a great mind to try if he had any hankerirjg in. 
clination to his own country again ; and by "tliis time havin- 
learned the English so well, that lie could give me tolerabl. 
answers to any question which 1 demanded ; l^skcd hin 
whether that nadon to which he belonged, ever conquere( 
in battle ? The question made Friday to smile, and to whici 
he answered, "Ves, yes, Ave always %ht the better;" a 
much as to say thej always got the better in fight. Upoi! 
which we proceeded on the following discourse: You say 
said 1, that you always fight the better ; why, then, Friday 
how came you to be taken prisoner ? 

i^77i/r/y. But for all that, my nation beat much. 

Master. How say you, beat? if your nation beat them 
now came you to be taken prisoner ? 

Friday. They more many mans than my nation in th< 
place where me was ; they take one, tvvo, three, and rae 
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place when' 
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three grea 
tousand. 

Ma icr. Then why did not your nation recover you fron 
the hands of your enemies ?- 

Fridaij. They run one, two, or three, and me: they maki 
all go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does youj 
nation do with the prisoners they take ? Do they carry then 
away and eat them, as these have done ? 
. Friday, Yes, yes, my nation eats mans too, eat up all. 

Master. To what place do they carry them to be devoured:- 

Friday. Go to other nations whi^re they think. 

Mater. Do they bring them hither ? 

Fridaij. Yes come over hither, come over other place. 

Mazier. And have you been with them here, Friday ? 

Fr/day. Yes, me been here (pointing to the north-z::e&t oj 
the island^ being the side uhere thei) used to land). 

Thus havinrg gotten what account 1 could from my nian^ 
I plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any' of the! 
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the saJ 
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of the 
island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was broughl 
hither for ; and some time after I cariiod him to that placi'

where he pointed ; ai\cl no sooner did he come (here, but 
le presently knew the ground, signifying to me that he was 
7nce there Avlien they ate up tweaty men, two wonien, and 
I young child : but as he could not cxj)lain the nuniher in 
Rngli<h, he did it by so many stones in a row, making a 
lif n for me to count thero. 

This passage 1 had the rather mentioned, because it led 
things more importimt and u«;eful for me to know ; for 
ifter J had the satisfactory di-course with him, my next 
liiestion was, how far it was from the island to the shore, 
tnd whether the canoes were not ofien lost in the ocean ? 
o. which he answered there was no danger ; that no canoes 
xare ever lost ; but, that after a little way out to the sea, 
here was a strong current, and a wind always oneway in 
fce afternoon This I thought at first to be no more than 
he sets of the tide, of going out or coming in ; but I after- 
wards understood it was occasioned by the great draught 
md reflux of the mighty riyer Oroonoko, in the mouth or 
jalf of which 1 imagined my kingdom lav ; and that the 
and which I perceived to the W. or N. W. must be the 
freat island Trinidad, on the north of the rirer. A thou- 
and questions (if that would satisfy me) did I ask Friday, 
ibout the nature of the country, the sea, the coasts, the ili- 
labitants, and what nations were nearest them ; to Avhich 
piestions the i)oor fellow declared all he knew, with the 
reatest openness, and utmost sincerity. When I demand. 
;d of him the particular names of the rarious nations of his 
ort of people, he could only answer me in general, that 
hey were called Carrihee. Hence it was I considered that 
hese must be the Carribees, so much taken notice of by 
>ur maps, to be on that part of America, which reaches 
rora the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guimo, and so 
►n to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that 
ip a great way beyond the moon, as much as to say, be- 
ond the setting of the moon, which must be W. from their 
own try, there dwelt white, bearded men, such as I was, 
oiutiug to my whiskers, and that they kill much man.^. I 
ras not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated 
hese creatures ; so that I presently concluded it must be 
hem, whose cruelties had spread throughout America, to 
c remembered even to succeeding generations.

comforfable to nic, and made me so C'lrious as to ask Iiimi 
how I might de}:art from tiiis island, and get amongst those 
'white men ? He told me, "Yes, yes, I might ^o in two 
canoes. " In two canoes, thought I, w!iat does my man 
mean ? surely he means one for himself, and another for me; 
and if not, how must two canoes hold me without being 
joined, or one part of my bod/ being put in one, and ano- 
ther in another ? And indeed it was a long time before [ 
iindL'rstand his meaning, which was, that it must be a large 
boat as big as two canoes, able to bear with the wmtcs, and 
not po liable to be overwhelmed as a small one must be. 

I believe there is no state of life but w hat may be happy, 
if people would but endearour for their part to make it so. 
lie is not the happiest man that has the most riches ; but hei 
that is content with what he lias. Before 1 had my ser-,: 
Tant, I (bought myself miserable till I had him; and now that 
I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I still complained, 
and begged a deliyeranee from a place of retirement, ease, 
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently blessed me. 
In a word, from this time I entertained some hopes, thai: 
one time or other T might find an opportunity to mal\C my 
escape from this island, and that this poor savage might be 
a great furtherance thereto. 

AH the time since my man became so intelligent as to un- 
derstand and speak to me, I spared no pains nor diligence 
to instruct him, according to my poor share of knowledge,, 
in the principals of religion, and the adoration that he ought< 
to pay to the True God, One time, as I very well remem, 
ber, I asked him who made him? At first the innocent i 
creature did not understand what I meant, but rather thoughtl 
I asked him who was his father ? Upon which I took ano«. 
thcr way to make him sensible, by demanding from him am 
answer to this question. Friday, said I, who is it that made 
the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and all these hills 
and woods which we behold? And here, indeed, I did not' 
miss my intention ; for he told me it was Old Benamuckee 
(the God whom I suppose these savages adored) who lived 
a great way beyond all. But as to his attributes, poor Fri- 
day was an utter stranger. He could describe nothing of 
this great person ; and all that he could say was, that he 
was very old, much older than the sea and land, the moon, 
or the stars. Friday, said I again, if this great and old per- 
K'li has made all things in the woild^ how comes it to pass^ 



or noEiNSos" CRiiSoi:. 101. 

tiat all thiJigs, as you in particular, do not adore and wor- 
ship him? Upon this, looking very grave, with a perfect 
s«e„'t look of iniiocciice, he replied, "Master, all things say 
O to him," by which it may be reasonably supposed he 
niraiit adoration. Andnvherc, said I, do the people of your 
country go when they die ? lie answered to Beuumuckee, 
WJiat, and those people that are eaten up, do they go there? 
■*' Benamuc'cce^''' said he, "• iove 'cm dearly ; me pray to 
*' Benamuckee in dc canoe, and Benamuckec would love me 
*^when they eat me all up " 

Such discourses as these had I with my man, and such 
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped, though 
under imperfect similitudes; and that the false adoration 
which the Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as great 
an argument of the divine essence, as the most learned 
Athiests (Jahcltj so called) can bring against it; for God 
will be glorified in his works, let their denomination be 
what it will ; and I cannot be of that opinion wlilch f.omc 
conceive, that God should decree m.en to be damned for 
want of a right notion of faith, in a place where the wisdom 
of the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached; and 
therefore cannot but conclude, that, since obedience is the 
best sacrifice, these poor creatures, acting by that light and 
knowledge which they are possessed of, may, undoubtedly, 
obtain a happy salvation, though not that enjoyment with 
Christ, as his saints, confessors, and martyrs must enjoy. 

But laying these determinations aside, more fit for divines 
than rac to discuss, I began to instruct my servant in the 
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the directions 
of God's Holy Spirit assisted roc. I lifted up my hands to 
Heaven, and pointing thereto, told him, that the great 
Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there; that, as his infinite 
power fashioned this world out of a cowfused chaos, and 
made it in that beautiful frame which we behold, so he 
governs and prescrres it by his unbounded kH;>w ledge, 
sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence ; that he was 
omnipotent, could do every thing for us, giv^ every thing to 
us, and take every thing away from us ; that he was a re- 
warder and punisher of good and evil actions ; that (here was 
noihing but what he knew, no thoughts so secret but what he 
could bring to light: and thus by degrees I opened his eyes, 
ftnd described to him the manner of the creation of tlie

world, the slhiatiou of paradise, ths transgression of our 
lirst parent?, the v>ickcducss of God's peculiar peoplr, and 
the iinirersal sins and abominations of the whole earth. 
When these things Were implanted in his mind, I told Iiim, 
that as (*od's justice was equal to his rnercy, he resolved to 
destroy this world, till his Son Jesus Christ interpoped in our. 
l^ehalf ; aud, to procure our redemption, obtained leave of 
his heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the 
■world, where he took human nature upon him, instructed us 
in our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins ; 
that he was now ascended into Iteaven, mediating for onr J 
pardon, delivering our petitions andobtaining ail those good*^ 
benefits which we ask in his name, ])y humble and hearty 
prayers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven. — 
As very frequehily 1 used to inculcate things into his mind 
Friday one day told me, that if our great God could hear .J 
Vs beyond the sun, he must surely be a greater God than " 
their Bcnamuckee^ who lived but a little way oif, and yet'^ 
could not hear them till they ascended the great mouuiains, f] 
■where he dwelt, to speak to him. What, said I, Friday, i 
did you go thither to speak to him too ? He answered, 
^' No, they never went that were young men, none but old^ 
^' men, called i\\%ix OoiDakukee^'^ meaning the Indian priests, 
'' who went to say 0,'(so he called saying their prayers) 
''and they returned back, and told them what Benamuckce^' 
'•said." From hence, I could not but observe how happy -, 
we Christians are, who have God's immediate revelation 
for our certain guide ; and that our faith is neither misled, v 
nor our reason imposed upon, by any set of men, such as i 
these Indian impostors. " 

But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday, I 
told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going up to 
the mountain to say O to their God Benamuckcc^ was an im- 
posture, and that their bringing back an answer was all a 
sham, if not worse; for that, if there was any such thing 
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an infernal 
spirit. And here X thought ifc necessary to enter into a long 
discourse with him, which I did after tliis manner. 

Friday, said I, you must know, that before this world' 
^yas made, there wiis an Almighty power existing, by whose' 
power all things were made, and whose Majesty shall" have 
no end. To be glorified and adored by beings of a heaven- 
ly nature^ he created angels and archangel's^ that is glorified 



OF ROKINSOX CRUSOE.' lOJ 

Spirits rescmV.ing himself, to encompass Iiis throne, cfpr. 
nally sinking forth his praise in his most heavenly sounds 
and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir, 
Lticifer bore a great sway, as being then one of the jicculiar 
favourites of these celestial abodes ; but he, contrary to that 
duty he ovred his heavenly Sarereign, with nuboiinded 
ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him tliat 
adoration which was his due, but thought to usurp tliat 
throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pre- 
tend to. He raised a dissention and civil war in Heaven, 
and had a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded 
folly! stupendous ])ridel to hope for victory, and a-^pire 
above his powerful Creator! The Doi(y. not fearfil of sucli 
an enemy, yet justly provoked at his rebellion, commis- 
sioned his archangel Mich:iel to lead forth the heavenly host, 
and give him battle; the advantage of which was quickly 
perceived by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince of 
the air, for so the devil is called, with all his fallen angels, 
driven headlong into a dismal place which is called IJcll, 

The recital of this truth made my man give the greatest 
attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction by his ges- 
tures, that God had sent the devil into the deep hole. — • 
And then I desired iiim to give great heed to v. hat I had 
further to say. ' 

No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and tho 
Heaven clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father speaks to 
the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his essence, and 
were eqaal to him in power and glory, Comclcf iff make nici}?y 
- 5aid he, in our oii'nimage. ofter our oivn likcies^, Gen. i. 26, 
to have dominion over the creatures of the vrorld which we 
have created. And these he intended should glorify hiia 
ill Heaven, according to their obedience in this state of 
probation on earth, which was, as it were, to be the school 
to train them up for these heavenly mansions. Now, Satan 
seeing himself foiled, yet that God had not taken the power 
'from him as prince of the air, which pcfwer Heaven design- 
ed he should retain, whereby his creatures might 1)G tried; 
in revenge for the disgrace he had received, he tempts 
Adam's wife, Eve, to taste of th? tree of knowledge of good 
and evil, w^hich God had forbidden. He a])pears to her in 
the shape of a Serpent, then a m;>st beautiful creature, aoJ 
tells her that it was no better than an imposition which God 
had put upon her and her hui)baiid^ not to ea,t of that fair

fruit which he had created ; that the taste thereof would, 
make them immortal like God himself: and conseqiieutlyl 
»is great and powerful as he. U])on which she not only eafe^ 
thereof herself, but made her husband eat also, which brought 
them both under the heavenly displeasure. 

Here Friday expiressed a great concern : ''"■Ah, poor mans !*' 
cried he, "naughty wom.ans ! naughty devil! make God not 
-^' love de mans, make mans like devil himself." 

Friday, said I, God still loved uuinkind ; and though the 
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not sulfer hina 
to have an absolute power over them. J have told you be- 
fore of his tender love to his peo])le, till they, like Lucifer, 
disobeyed his comuiands and rebelled against him; and 
tven then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save 
feinucrs. Bat still every man that lives in the world is un- 
<!cr temptation and trial. The JJevii has yet a power, as 
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds, 
and. jirompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory in 
our destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have, proceed 
from him ; so that God, in this our distress, expects we 
should apply ourselves to him by fervent prayer for speedy 
redress, lie is not like BenamurJcz:e. to let none come near 
iiim but Oozcakakcc, but sulfcrs the people, as well as priests 
to oifer th??m; *'ves at his feA'.t, thereby to be delivered from 
the power and temptation of the devif. 

But though at tirst my man Friday expressed some con- 
cern at the wickedness of Lueifer, 1 found it not so easy to 
imprint the right notions of him in his mind,, as it was about 
the divine essence of God; for there nature assisted me in 
all my arguraeiits, to show to him plainly the necessity of a 
Great First Cause, au overruling, governing power ; of a 
secret directing Providence, and of the equity and reason- 
ableness of payino adoration to our Creator; whereas therij 
ap])eared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit, 
of his first beginning, his nature, and, above all, of h]s in- 
rlination to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the 
likQ. And indeed this unlearned Indian^ by the mere force 
of nature, puzzled me with one particularly question, more 
than ever 1 could have expected. 

J had, it seems, one day, been talking to him of i^iQ om. ' 
Tiipotent j)0wer of God, and his infinite abhorrence of sin, 
in«;omuch that the Scriptures stjled him a consuming fire to 
all xhc workers of iniquity ; and that it was in his power^

AVhcn, Mith a serious attention, he Lad listened a great 
wl;i!e to what I said, after I had been telling Iriin how the 
devil was God's enemy in the hjarts of men. and used all 
[his malice and sliill to defeat the good de-igns of Providence, 
and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so 
forth: ''Very well, ^Master," saitl Friday, '^you say God is 
" so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much iiiighfier 
f< than the naughty devil I" To be sure. Friday, said I, Gocl 
is more wi^e and stronger than tlic serpent: lie is above the 
devil, which makes iis pray to him, that lie would tread down 
Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent tcmpta- 
fionv, and (Juench his fiery darts. " Why tlien," answered 
^Friday quickly, " if God, as you say, has much strong, much 
" might as the devil, Avhy God no kill devil, make no more 
<' tempt, no more do wicked." 

* You may be certain I was strangely surprised at the ques- 
tion of my man's : and, though an old man, I was but a 
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualilicd for a ca- 
suist, or aresolver of intricate doubts in religion; and as it 
required some time for me to study for an answer, I pre- 
tended not to hear him, nor to ask him what he said ; but, 
so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question^ 
which lie repeated in the very same broken words as above. 
\Vhen] had recovered myself a little; Friday, 5aid I, God 
•will at last punish him severely, being reserved i iv judg- 
ment, and is to be cast into the bolton.less pit. to remain in 
fire everlasting. But all tkis did not satisfy Fridaj ; for 
returning upon me, he repeated my words, " iie^ikyf. at 
'' LAST, me no understand ; bu^, Vf hy not kill devil now, 
*^ not kill devil great, great while ago :'' F-iday, said I, ydu 
may as well ask me v.hy God does not kill yon and me, 
when, by our wicked actions, we so ranch offended his divine 
Majesty? lie gives us time to repent of our sins, that there- 
by wc may obtain pardoji^ At these words oh fahx pardon^ 
Friday mused a gritat while ; and, at last, looking me -ted- 
fastly in the facet " Well, well," said he, '" that's very well ; 
" so J ou, I, devil, all wicked man?, all preserve, repent, 
*' God i^ardon a' I. 

Indeed, here I was run down io the la,:t extremity, whrti 
it, became very evident to me. how mcrb natural notion?

will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a Delrrj 
and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God ; but 
ho'.rcver, nothing but di?ine revelation can form the tnow- 
l.'dge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for 
us, of the mediator of the new covenant, and of an inter. 
<;cssor at the foofstool of God's throne; and, therefore, the 
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: that is, the 
word and spirit of God, promised for the guide and sancti- 
fier of his people, are his most necessary instructors of the 
souls of men, ia the saving knowledge of the iVlmighty, and 
the means to attaio eternal happiness* 

And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis- 
course between my man and me; for which purpose I rost? 
up hastily, and made as if I had some occasion to go ou(, 
scndiUi:: Friday for something that was a good way oiF. I 
then fell on my knees, and beseeched God (hat he would 
ins}nre me so far as to guide this poor savage in the know- 
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, that 
his. conscience iiii2;ht be convinced, his eyes opened, and 
bis soul sared. When he returned again, I entered into a 
Tery long discourse with him, upon the subject of the world's 
redemption by the SaYiour of it, and the doctrine of repent-* 
ance preached from Heaven, together with an holy faith 
of our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christ; and then I proceeded 
to explain to him, according to ray weak capacity, the 
reason why our Saviour took not on him the nature of angels, 
hilt rather the seed of Abraham : and how the fallen angels 
had no benefit by that redGm])tion; and, lastly, that he came 
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. — 
God knows I had more sincerity than knowledge in all the 
v/ays J took for the poor Indian's instruction; and I must 
acknowledge wlrat I beli-ve every body that acts upon the 
vSarae principle will find, that ir» laying heavertly truths open 
befure him, J informed and instructed myself in raaay things 
that either 1 did not know, or had nat perfectly considered 
before ; so that, however, tKs poor creature miglit be im- 
proved by my instructions, certain it is, that I myself had 
great reason to be thankful to Providence for seeding hiia^ 
to me. His company allayed my grief, a4ul made my bai 
bKation comfortable; and when I reflected that the solitary 
3ife to which I had been so long confin'^d, had made me t 
look further towards Heaven, by making me the instrame 
«nder Providence^ to save Vhj lifcj and^ for ou^ht I. know

the soul of this poor savage, by bringii"*^ him fo the knotr- 
kdge of Jesus Christ, it cau.sod a secret j')y to spread throiigU 
every part of my soul ; and I frcqurntly rejoiced, that ever 
I was brought to this place, v, iiii h 1 once thought the most 
miserable part of the world. 

In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards continue 
Avl.ile, J abode on the island, and for ihrce years did my 
man and i live in the greite^st enjoyment of happiness. In- 
deed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian as I ; 
and I hope we were efpiallv loiiitent: and such penitents 
as were comforted and restored by God's Holy Spirit: for 
iiow we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the right 
■way, as much as if we had been on the English shore. 

By the constant application I made to the Scriptures, as 
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to 
make liim understand every part of it, as much as lay in my 
power. He also, on the other hand, by his very serious 
questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient 
in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by my 
own private reading and study, I must not omit another 
thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my retire- 
ment ; It was that infinite and inexpressible blessing, the 
knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain 
and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct me to 
carry on the great work of sincere rey enraace for my sins, 
and laying hold of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical 
stated reformation, and obedience to all God's institutions, 
without the assistance of a reverend and orthodoi: divine; 
and especially by this same instruction, so to enlighten this 
savage creature, as to make him so good a Christian, as very 
few could exceed him. And there was only this great thing 
wanting, that I had no authority to administer the Holy Sa- 
crament, that heavenly participation of Christ's body and 
blood ; yet, however, we rested ourselves content, that God 
would accept our desires, and according to our faith, have 
mercy onus. 

But what we wanted oneway, w^as made up in another, 
and that was universal peace in our little church. We had 
BO disputes and w ranglings about the nature and equality of 
the holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity ; no niceties in 
doctrine, or schemes of church government; no sour or 
morose dissenters to impose more sublimated notions upon 
us j uo pedant sophisters to confound us with, unintcUigjbia.:

mysteries: fcr.t instead of all tlib, we enjojod tlie most cer- 
tain gnidc to IleaYcTi ; tliat is, the word of God ; besides 
Vrliich, wc bad the comfortable views of his Spirit leading 
lis to the truth, and making us both willing and obedient to 
the insfrnction of his word. As the knowledge and prac- 
tire of <liis are the principal means of salvafion, I cannot 
.^§.ee what it avails any Christian church, or man in the world, 
' to amuse himself with speculations and opinions, except it 
be to display their particular vanity and affectation. 

You may well suppof^e, that, by the frequent discourse wc 
had together, my man and 1 became most intimately ac- 
quainted, and that there was but very little that I could say- 
but what Fiiday understood ; and, indeed, he sp^oke very 
fluently, thougH it was but broken ii^nglish. 1 now took a 
])ariicu!ar pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially 
those that occurred since my being cast on this island. I 
made him understand that wonderful mystery, as he con- 
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to 
shoot. I also ]irescn(ed to him a knife, MJiich })lcascd hini 
exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog hanging there- 
to, like those in which we wear hangers in England ; and, 
instead of a hauger to put in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, 
"v^hich was not only as good, but even a better wcajjon upon 
many occasions. In a word, my man thu? accoutred, look- 
ed upon hiraseh as great as Don Quixote, when that cele- 
brated cham.pion went to combat the windmill. 

T next gave Inui a very particular description of the ter- 
ritories of P^urope, and in a particular manner of Old Eng- 
land, the place of my natiTit3^ I laid before him the man. 
ner of our worshipping God, our behaviour one to another, 
and how we trade in ships to every part of the universe. — 
I then told him my misfortunes in being shipw recked, show- 
ing, as near as" I could, the place where the ship lay, which 
had been gone long before ; but 1 brought him to the ruins 
of my boat, which before m) whole strength could not move, 
but now was almost rotten and fallen to pieces. I observed 
my man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon cu- 
riosity ; which, when lie had done, he stood pondering a 
great while,- and said nothing. At last, said I, Friday, what 
makes you porider so much ? Jle replied, ^' O master, me 
see like boat come to place at my nation." 

It was some time, indeed, before 3 understood what my 
man meant; but examining strictly into it^ I plainly found, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



109- 



that such another boat resembling mine, had come upon th» 
country w here he (Ivvelt ; that is to say, by his farther explana- 
tion, that the boat was driven thorc through stress of weather. 
It then came into my mind that some European t,hip having 
been cast away, the poor distressed creatures were forced 
to have recourse to the boat to save their lives ; and bein^ 
?.::. a, I thought, drowned, I never concerned myi<elf to ask 
thing concerning them, but my only inquiry was about 
tiit^ boat, and what description my man could give of it. 

Indeed, Friday answered my demands very well, making 
everything very plain to my understanding; but beyond 
measure was I satisilfd, when he told me with great warmth 
and ardour, '' O master, we save white mans from drown;" 
ii})on which I immediately a^ked him, if there wero any 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat ? '' Yes, yes," 
said he, " the boat full, rcry full of white mans." llu\r 
many, Friday? said I. Hereupon he numbered his finger*, 
md counted scrcntecn. And when J asked him what be- 
came of them all, and whether they lived or njt ^ he replied 
" Yes, ^master, they all live, they be live among my nation." 
This information put fresh thoughts into my head, that these 
nuit be those very men who before I concluded had beea 
jwallowedup in the ocean, after they had left the ship, that 
bad .struck upon the rocks of oiy kingdom, and after e-jCap- 
ing the furv of the deep, landed upon the wild shore, and 
!^ommItted themselves to the fury of the devouring Indians. 

The manner of their cruelties' to one another, which con- 
;equently, as I thought, must be acted with greater barbarity 
lo strangers, created in me a great anxiety, and made me 
itill more curious to ask Friday concerning them, lie told 
Jie, he was sure they still lived there, having resided aaioui^ 
:hem above four years, and that the savages gave them vie- 
:uals to live upon ; But pray, Friday, »md 1, whence pro- 
:eeded all this good nature and generosity? How came ic 
:o pass that they did not kill and eat them, to please their 
levouring appetites, and occa^-ion ««o spleiidid an entertain- 
neut among them ? •'• No, no," said Friday, '• they not kill 
em, (hey make brothers with 'em;" by which I understood 
here was a truce between them. And then I hitd a more 
avourable (»]union of the Indians, npon Friday utterint; 
he>e words : •» My nation, t'other nation no eat mans, but 
vhcn mans make war fight:" as though ht; had >aid, that

knew of, ever ate their fellow-creatures, but such as ihd 
law of arms allowed to be dovoiireLi ; that is, those miser 
able captives, whose misfortune it should be to be made pri 
soners of war. 

Some considerable time after, upon a very ])lcasant day 
m most serene weather, my man and I stood upon the to] 
of a hill, on the east side of the island, whence I had one 
before beheld the continent of America. 1 could not tel 
immediately what was the matter ; for suddenly Friday fel 
a jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and upor 
my demanding the reason of his behaviour, ^^ O joy,'* saic 
he, " O glad ! there sec my country, there my nation, ther 
" Hfc white m?/s gcther." And indeed such a rapturou 
sense of pleasure appeared in his countenance, that his eye 
had an uncommon sparkling and brightness, and such 
strange eagr^rness, as if he had a longing desire to be in hi: 
country again. This made me not so well satisfied witl 
my man Friday as before ; for by this appearance, I madi 
no dispute, but that if he could get back thither again, h( 
would not only be unmindful of what religion I had tatighi 
him, but likewise of the great obligation he owed me foi 
his wonderful deliverance ; nay, that he would not only in. 
form his countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds of their 
to my kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice, lik< 
those unhappy wretches taken in battle. 

Indeed I was very much to blame to have those cruel anc 
unjust sxispicions, and must freely own I wronged the pooi 
creature very much, who w-as of a quite contrary temj)or 
And had he had that discerning acuteness which m.any.Eu. 
ropeans have, he would certainly have perceived ray cold- 
ness and indiifercncc, and also have been very much con- 
cerned upon that account : as I was now more circumspect. 
I had much lessened ray kindness and familiarity with him. 
and wifile this jealousy continued, I used that artful wa) 
(now too much in fashion, the occasion of strife and dissen. 
tion) of pumping him daily, thereby to discover whetiier he 
was der.eitft^il in his thoughts and inclinations; but ctTtalnlj 
he had nothing in him but what was consistent with the bv 
principles, bo(h as a religious Christian and a grateful friend; 
and, indeed, I fanud every thing he said was ingrnuous anc 
innocent, that I had no room for saspicion, and, in spiteol 
all uneasiness, he not only made me entirely his ov/n again", 
but aho caused me much to lament that 1 ever conceived 
one ill thought of him. 



DF ROBIKSON CRUSOr. Ill 

As wc were walking up the same lull anotV.er day, Avlien 
le weather was so haity at sea, that I could not perceive 
ic contiueat, Friday, said I, don't you ^\ish yourself to be 
I your own country, your nation, among your old friends 
nd acquaintances ;" '•*• Ves," said he, " me much O glad to 
' be at my OMn nation." .\nd what would you do there, 
Viday ? Would you turn Mi!d again, eat man's ilesh, and 
e as savage as you were formerly? ^''So^ no," (answered 
e, full of concern, and shaking his head) '•' Friday now tell 
' them to live good, tell them pray God, tell them to eat 
' corn, bread, cattle, llt-sh, ir.ilk, no eat mau again." But 
urelv, replied I, if you should ofl'er to do all this, they will 
ill you ; and to manifest their contempt of such instruction 
at vou up when tliey have done. lie then put on a gr.ire, 
ct innocent and smooth countenance, saying, " No, they 

* no kill me, they willing love learn:" that is, that they 
rould be very willing to learu: adding witlial, ''that they 
' had learned much of the bearded mans that came in the 

* boat." Will vou, said I, go back again, Friday : He 
miled at that, and told me, that he could not swiui so far. 
5ut, said I, I will make a canoe for yon. " Yes, master," 
aid he, "me go if you go, me no go if you stay." I go^ 
j'riday! why would you have them to 'cat me up, and de- 
jour your kind master : " No, no," said he, " me make 
'them not eat master, "and me make them much love you;" 
hat i>, he would tell them how I had slain his enemies, and 
hereby saved his life, for which reason he would make them 
ove me: and then he related to me, as well as he was able, 
low exceedingly kind those of his nation were to the white, 
•r bearded men, as he called them, who, in their great cala- 
mity, were driven into their country. 

li was from this time, indeed, I had s'lrong inclinations to 
enture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to join 
hese white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards 
ir Portuguese; for, thought I, it must certainly be a better 
,nd safer way to escape when there is a good company, than 
or me alone, from an island forty miles olf the shore and 
rithout any assistance. Some days after, Friday and J be- 
Qg at work, as usual, at the same time diverting ourselves 
dth various discourses, J told him I had a boat which I 
vould bestow upon hira, whenever he pleased to return to 
lis own nation ; and to convince him of the truth of what I 
aid, I took him with me to the other side of the island, where

my frigate Tar, and then taking it from under tlie water, (for 
1 always kept it sunk for fear of a disrovery) we went both 
into it to see how it would manage such an expedition. 

And really never could any be more dextrous in rowing 
than my faUhfiil servant, making the boat go as fast again as 
J could. Well now, Friday, said J, shall we now go to 
your so much admired nation? But instead of meeting with 
that cheerfulnefis 1 expected, he looked tcry dull and me- 
lancholy at my saying so; Avhich indeed at tirst surprised me, 
till he made me sensible that his concern was about 
the boat being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon 
whidi 1 let him understand 1 had a much bigger; and, ac- 
r-ordingly, the next day went to the place were the first 
boat lay, which I had m,ade, when all the strength I had, or 
art I could use, failed me in my attempt to get it into the 
water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty 
years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became 
in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such a boat 
would do very well for the purpose, suthcicnt to carry 
e?70ugh vitfle^ drink ^ bread (or that was his manner of talking. 
In short, my mind being strongly fixed upoti my designs of 
going over with him to the Continent, T very plainly told 
him that we would both go and make a boat full as big, and* 
Hiorc proportionable than that, wherein he might safely re- 
turn to his own nation. 

These words made Friday look so Tcry pensive, that I 
thought he would have fallen at my feet. It was some time 
before he could speak a word, which made me ask him what 
^as the matter with him? He replied, in a very soft and 
moving tone, ^*^What has poor Friday done? why are yon 
^' angry, mad with poor servant? What me done, O Mhat 
^' me done?" Friday, said I, yen never yet have offended 
me, what makes you think 1 am angry with you, when I am 
Bot angry at all. " You no angry, no angry," said he, several 
times; ^'^if you be no angry, why den send Friday overi 
*^ great water to my own nation?" Why, surely, Friday, an. 
swered I, did not you wish to be there, when from a raoun. 
tain you beheld the place where you was born ? and is it 
not to satisfy your desires that I am willing to give yottj 
leave to leturn thither? '' Yes, yes," said Friday, ^'me Avish 
^' to be there sure enough, but then me wish master there 
^'' too: no wish P^riday there, no master there." In short,: 
liaxould not endure the thoughts of going there without la^i 



or ROBINSON CRUSOt:. 113 

I £:o thpTc! Friuay, said I, uliatshall I do there? lie an. 
?\vcrctl .very quickiy, *^'0 master, you do i^iX'Sit deal iiiiich 
*' good, vou teach all dc wild inaus to be good tame mans : 
*• you learn dem to bo sober, live good life, to know God, 
^' and pray God." Alas! poor Friday, said I, what can 1 
do against their priests of i^enarauf.kec, or indeed what 
good tan I make your nation sensible of, when J myself am 
but a poor ignorant man ? '* Xo, no, master," said he, "you 
** be no ignorant, yon teachee me good, you teachee dem 
*• good." You sliall go without me, Friday, said J, for I 
don't care to accompany you thltlicr: I would rather live 
in this solitude than venture among sucli inhuman savages. 
Go your way, since you desire it, and leave me alone hy 
my«;clf, as I was before I saved your life. 

Xevcr was any creature more thunderstruck than Frid.iv 
was at these words. " Go me away, leave master awav," 
said ho, after a long silence, '^'no, no. Friday die. Fridav live 

not master gone," as though he had said, I neither can 
r.or will live, if my m.aster sends mc, from him. And here I 
cannot but take notice of the strong ties of friendship, which 
many times surpass those of consanguinity; For often we. 
find a great disagreement among kindred; and when there 
is any seeming regard fur each orher, it is very seldom true, 
and scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest does not bear 
the sway; and that alone is often the occasion of the great- 
est hatred in the world, which is to desire the death of pa- 
rents and relations, for the sake of acquiring their fortunes. 
But there was no such thing between my servant and me ; 
insteail of which there was tiic greatest gratitude and the, 
most sincere love; he found me not only his deliverer, but 
his preserver and comforter; not a severe and cruel tyrant, 
but a kind, loving, and ailable friend. He wan;ed for no 
manner of sustenance : and when he was ill or oat o? order, 
I was his physician, not only for his body but his soul ; and 
therefore no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature, 
long since dirested of his former natural cruel .y, should have 
an uncouimon concern at so cruel a separaii ju from me, 
•which pierced hiiu to the very soul, and made hi:n desiry 
even to die, rather than live without mc. 

After 1 had told Friday, in a very careless manner, that 
lie should be at his liberty as soon as the boat was; uiadj, ihe 
language of his eyes expressed ail imaginable confusioH ; 
Viicn, immediately running to one of his hatchets, w iiich h^ 



M »I/ITE AND AT)TENTUIIE« 

vTi5;ed to \vear as a defensirc "Wf^apon^ he gives it into my 
3iand, with a heart so full, that he could scarcelj speak. — - 
J^'ridg;;^., said 1, what is it you mean? What must I do with 
ihis ? '' Only kill Friday," said he, '* Friday care not live 
^' loi>2:.^' But \rhiit must I kill you for? repliexl 1 again. 
*' Ah ! dear master, what made you Friday save from eat a 
^- me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and 
^' love not JBenamuckee, and now Friday send away; never 
=*^ see Friday more." As though Ihe poor creature had said, 
Alas ! my dearest kind mas+er, how comes it to pass, that 
;after having ventured your precious life to save me from the 
jaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, after such a tender 
regard to provide for me such a comfortable nourishment, 
and continuing so long a kind master, and a most sincere 
frieu'd ; and after making me forsake the false notion of an 
Indian deity, and worship ihc true God in spirit and ia 
truth; and after ^U this, how comes it now, that you are 
'tvillir.g to send me away to my former course of living, by 
which means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other ;' 
t)ut greater must l)e. my misfortune, that I shall never behold' 
jny best friend 1 have in the world any more. And this un.' 
(douhtedly, though he could not express himself so clearly, 
STiust lie liis sciiitjments; for the tpars ran down his cH,eoks 
in such a plentiful manner, that I had much atloto refrain frora^ 
^veeping also, when I behekl the poor creature's atfectioQ;' 
#0 that I was forced to comfort him in the best manner I 
could, which I did, by telling him, if he was content to abide' 
.with me, I should be .ever ^viili-«g to keep him. 

-After Friday's grief was somewhat abated, more fully io' 
.convince m.c of liis atfectioa, he said, "O master, me not 
*' care to be m my nation, leave you here; me dei-irc nation 
*' learn good that's all ;" meaning, that his desire was for the 
/•onversion of that barbarous ]5coiile. But as I had no apos-'- 
tolic mission., nor any concern about their salvation, so I- 
liad not the least iiifeniion or .^Icsire of undertaking it; aadj 
Ihe strength of my inclination, in order to escape, proceed- 
ed chieily from my late discourse with Friday, abotit thesef 
?ev(>n.teeB ^whlte bearded men, that had been driven upoa 
the Barbarian coast, whom i designed to join as the only* 
2iieanf to furth<?r our escape. To which intent my maa 
^nd I went to search for a proper tree to fell, whereof we 
j^Mght make a large perigua or canoe, to undertake the Toy- 
-,2^e; ^-nd; li:deed, we were not long in finding owe iit far 



! 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE^ 11 5> 

our purpose, thcFe being enough of wood in tlie isFand tcp 
have built a tleet of large vesst'ls ; but tlie thiug wc princi-^ 
pally wanted, was to get one so near the water^ that we- 
miglit launch it after it uas linished, and not connult so- 
horrid a mistake as I had djne once before. 

Well, after a great searcli fur %\ hat was best and most 
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such aiiairs 
was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of v.ood 
the most fitting for it. To this day 1 cannot tell the name 
of the tree, nor describe it any other way, than on\y by say- 
ing, that it is very like what we call_/W.s7/r, oi- between that 
ami the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour 
aud smell. Bat though my man exceeded me in my kno%v- 
ledge of the most proper tree, yet i showed him a much 
better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he kne.v 
before ; for he was for burning tfie. liollovv or cavity of the 
tree^ in order to make this boat; but 1 then told him how he 
might do it with tool?, learning him at the same time how 
to use them, which indeed he did very Acxtrously ; so that 
in a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome 
by cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. Afte,r 
this it took us a fnll fortnight before we could get her iafb 
the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon g:reat 
rollers ; but when she was in, she would have carried tvisntj 
Oien, with all the ea^'^e imaginable. 

As J was yevy well pleased, you may be sure, at the 
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no less amazed 
to behold with wJiat dexterity my man would manage her, 
turn her, and paddle her along. VV^e!!, Friday, said i, what 
do you think of it now ? I)o you think this will carry \u 
over? ''Ye?, master," said ht?, "me venture over welT, 
" though great blow wind." But my design was yet fa."- 
ther, which he was insensible of ; aad that was to make a 
mast and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor anl 
cable. As to a mast, that w-as no difficult thing aX all to 
procure: so I fixed upon a streight young cedar-tree, whirls 
1 found near the place, groat plenty of it abounding in th-j 
island; and setting Friday to cut it dov^n, 1 g^ive him parti- 
cular directions how to shape and order it ; but a« to the 
sail, that 1 managed myself. 1 very well knew I had some 
old ones, or pieces of saiU enough, whlcli had lain six and. 
twenty ) ears by me; but not being careful to preserve them, 
as thuiking i should have no occ.ision-to uac them any more, 



11 § LIFE AND ADYEXTURES 

■wIksh I came to OYerlook thcni, I found them almost ail 
rottcR. o-xcept two; and with these I went to work, and 
after a great deal of pains and awkward tedious stitching 
for want of needles, at length I finished a three-cornered 
ligly thing, like what Ave call in England a shoulder of mut- 
ton sail; to go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit 
at the top, like those which our long-boats use, ami which 
I very v/ell knew how to manage, especially since it was 
hke that which I had in my patron's fishing-boat, when, 
with my boy Xury, I made my escape from the Barbariaa 
shore. 

It w^is near two months, I tliink, ))efore I completed this 
work, tiuit is, the rigging and fitting my masts and sails; 
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small stay 
and a sail, or a foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to 
the westward; and, what is still more, I fixed a ruddej; to 
the stern of her, io steer with; and though I was but a very 
indifferent shipwright, yet, as I v>^s sensible of the great 
usefulness and absolute necessity of a thing like this, I ap- 
jdied myself to it with such a constant application, that I at 
/ last accomplished m}- design: but what with the many dull 
contrivances T had about it, and the failure pf many things, 
it cost nic as much pains in ordering as in making the boat. 
Besides, when ail this was done, 1 had my man to teach 
what belonged to its navigation; for though he very well 
understood how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter 
stranger to a i^aW and a rudder, and was amazed when he 
faw me work the boat to and again in the sea, by them, and 
how the sail gibhed and filled this way or that way, as the 
course we sailed changed. After some time and a littl 
use, I m.ade all these things very familiar to him, so that h 
became an expert sailor, except in relation to the compass, 
and that I could make him understand but little of. But as 
it happened, tliere was seldom occasion for it, there being 
but little cloudy weather, and scarce Jlny fog in those parts ; 
the star*? were* always visible in the night, and the shore 
perspicuous by day, except in the rainy season, which con- 
fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered in the 
seven and twentieth year of my reign, or captivity, which 
you please, (the last' three of which, blessed with the com- 
])any of my man Friday, ought not to be reckoned) I kept 
the anniversary of my landing here, with the same thank- 
fullleL.^j to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before: and

certainly as T had groat cause f<>r a thatikful ac'kri<)M'led^-.- 
iTK^t for my deliverance at firsf, 1 had much greater now 
for such singular and additional Vestimonies of the care of 
Providence over me, in all my distresses of bath body and' 
mind, and the great hopes l"h:^d of be^ng' e-Oectually and 
speedily delivered; for 1 had a strong impression upon my 
mind, that I shonid not be another year in this island; 15iir, 
however, J still continued on ui(h niy husbandry, digging, 
llanting, and fencing, as usual; gathering and curing my 
gra{9es, and doing all other things that vpcre nece.':?sary. 

And mm the rainy season beginning to come on, obligedj- 
mc to keep thelonger -»vithin doors ; but before this, [brought 
my new vessel into the creek, vs here I had landed my raffs 
from the ship, and hailing her up to theshoro^ 1 ordered my 
nan Friday to dig a dock sufuCieiU to hold her in, and dee]) 
enough to gire her water, wherein sh»" might tioat; and 
then when the. tide was out, we made a strong dam across 
the end of it, to keep out the Water; by which means she' 
lay dry^ as to the tide from the sea; and to keep (he rain 
from her, we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of 
trees, like a house, so Me waited for the months of Novem- 
ber and December^ in which I designed to venture over the 
ocean. 

No sooner did the seasonable weather begin to dra^7 
near, but so much was I elevatecVwith this new designed 
advenfuie, that T daily prepared for the voyage. The first 
thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of pro.- 
rision'--, as a sufficient store for such an expedition, intend- - 
ing in a week or fortnight's time to open the dock, and to 
lft,unch out the boat for that purpose. But one morning as I 
•« as very busy upon something necessary for this occasion, 
1 called Friday to me, and bid him go to the s«a shore, and 
*ee if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we 
commonly had once a week, as much upon account of the 
€gg'=, as for the sake of the tlesh. lie had not been long 
■^one, but he carUic running back, as though hev/as jiur^^ued 
for life, and as it were flew over my outer waif, or fenre, 
like one that felt not the ground, or hadstc})sto set hisfeeton, 
and before I had time to inquire the reason^ of his preciji- 
tation, he cries out, '* Odcar Master^ O sorrow, sorrow! 
*' Ikdl Obad!" Why what's the matter, Frid.iy, said I. 
'' O yonder, yonder 1" said he, ^' there be one, two. or three 
^'canoes! two three'/' Surely, thought I, there Hiust Ic^

six, hy my man's v/ay of reckoning; l)ut on a stricter 
inqiiifYj I found there were but three. AYclI, Friday, said I, 
don't be terrified, I warrant yon we will not only defend 
ourselves against them, but kill the most of these cruel sa- 
ya^cs. But though I comforted him in the best manner I 
could, the poor creature trembled so, that I scarce knew 
■what to do with him: '-O master," said he, '' they come look 
'' Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up." ^"^ hy, Friday, 
said I, they will cat me up as well as you, and my danger is 
as great as yours. But since it is so, we must resolvg to 
tight for our lives. What say yon ? Can you fight, Friday ? 
'•Yes," said he, very faintly, "me shoot, me kill what I 
^' can, but there come a great many number." That's no 
matter, said I again, our guns will terrify those we do not 
kill : I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop of 
my blood. Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and' 
obey my orders in whatsoever I command ? Friday then 
iinswered, '^O master m.e lose life for you, me die when 
" you bid die." Thus concluding all questions concerning 
hia fidelity, immcdiateiy I fetched him a good dram of rum, 
(of vrhich I had been a very r;ood husband) and gave it hira 
to comfort his heart. Afier he had drank it, I ordered him 
t) take the two fowling-pieces, ^vhich w^e always carried, 
and loaded them with large swan shot, as big as small pistol 
tnllcts ; fhen I took four muskets, and loaded them w ith 
two sings ; and five small bullets each, charging my two 
pistols each with a brace; I hung my great sword, as cus. 
tomary, naked to my sid?^ and gave Friday his hatchet, as a 
most excellent weapon for defence. 

Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any knigli-fc 
errant that ever itanaled a sword and spear. I took my per 
spective glass, and went np to the side of the hill, to se( 
what I could discover; and I perceived very soon, by mj^ 
glass, that there were one andtwenty savages, three prisoners, 
and three canoes, and that their chief concern seemed tc 
l)e the triumphant l)anquet upon the three poor humar 
Todies, a thing which by this time I had observed was very 
(onimon with them. 1 also remarked, that they did noi 
land at that place from whence Friday made his escape, bui 
nearer to the creek, where the shore was low, and where s 
thick v/ood came very close to the sea. My soul was thel 
filled with indignation and abhorrence at such inhumaji 
wretches, which put a period to all my former thoughts ir 
their Tindication; neither: Avould I give m.yself time to con. 



OF ROr.lNSON CRUSOE. 119 

«ider tlieir right of ronquc-st, as I had done before: but de- 
scending from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and 
fold liim I was resolved to go speedily to them, and IdU 
them all; askins; him again, in the same breath, if he would 
stand by me: when by this time being recovered from his 
fright, and his spirits much cheered Avith the dram I had 
given him, he was very ])leasant, yet seriously telling me, 
as he did before, '• When I bid die, he would die." 

And now it was, having fixed ray resolution in so strong 
a manner, that nofliing could direst my breast of its uncom- 
mon fury, I immediately divided the loaded arms betwixt 
us. To my man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his gir- 
dle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great, 
•I confess, to bear; but what must a poor king do, who had 
flmt one soldier in the world ? But to show J made him bear 
'-no more than what I would lay on myself, I stuck the other 
'pistol in my girdle, and the other three guns upon my 
Fhoulders; nay, something more, but that was like /Fsop's 
•burden, a small bottle of rum, wliich was soon lightened to 
^ our exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched out, under 

• a ponderous load of armour, like two invincible champions, 
- with a quantity of pow^der and bullets to stand our battle, 

• and load again when the pieces were discharged. And 
; now my orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to 
^ keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or attempt 
t any thing till I commanded him ; and in the intrim, not to 
-speak so much as one word. It was in this order 1 fetched 

• a compass to the right hand, of near a mile, as well to get 
over the creek, as to attain the w^ood ; and by this ] thought 
to come within shot of them before I could be discerned, as 
I found, by my glass, would not be dilVicult to accomplish. 

l)ut how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even in 

our greatest fury and strongest inclinations ? For while I 

f was taking this march, my resolution begaa to abate, not 

• through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked 
' nnarmed wretches, but those reflections occurred to ray 
' thoughts : what power was I commissioned with, or what 

■ occasion or necessity had I to go and imbrue my hands in 
< human blood, and murder people that had neither done nor 

• intended to do me any wrong ? They were innocent in 
' particular as to me ; and their barbarous custom ^vas not 

■ only their misfortune, but a sign that God had ]eft them ia. 
the most immense stupidity; but yet did not warrant mc tO;

be a jtidge of their actions, much less an execntIon(?r of his 
TighttM>tis judfijmenYs : That on the contrary, whenever he 
thought i\ty he would take vengennco on them himself, and 
])nnish them in a nafional way, according to their national 
crimes; bnt (his was nothing at ail to me, who had no con- 
Ci rn with then). Indeed ray man Friday might justifj' him- 
self, because they were his declared enemies, of tliat very- 
same nation that went to sacrihce iiim before ; and, indeed, 
it was lawful for him to attack them, which I conld not sny 
was so with resyject to me. So vi armly did thttsc things pre?* 
upon my thoughts all the way I went, that 1 only resolved 
to place myscl/ so as to heboid their bloody entertainment 
M'ithoiit fal!inc>- upon them, except something more than or- 
dinary, by God's special direction, should oblige me thereto. 
Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into the thick w ood, 
(my man Friday folloAving me close behindj when with all 
possible wariness and silence, I marched till I came to the 
skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest to them; for 
only one end of the wood interposed between me and them. 
Upon which I called very softly to Friday, and showing him 
a great tree, that was just at the corner of tlve wood, i or- 
d( red him to re})air thither, and bring me word if he could 
plainly perceive their actions ; accordingly he did as I com- 
manded him, and came back with this melancholy story, 
that they were all about their fire, eating the ilesh of one oi 
their prisoners ; and that another lay bound upon the sand, 
at a little distance from them, which they desivgned for the- 
next sacrifice, and this he told me was not one of their na~ 
tion, but one of those very bearded men, who were driven 
by a storm into their country, and of whom he had so often' 
talked to me about. Yon may be sure, that upon hearing this, 
my soul was ready to sink within me: when, ascending into- 
a tree, I saw | lainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon 
the beach of the sea;, with his hands and feet tied with t\tigs^ 
or things re.'embling rushes, being covered wiih clothes,, 
and seemed to be an European. From the tree where I took 
this prospect, I perceived another tree and a thicket beyond 
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where i w as, which^ 
by taking a small circle round, I might come at undiscovered, • 
and -hen I should be within half a shot of these devourers. 
And this consideration alone, to be mare ] erfectly revenged 
upon them, made me withhold my passion, though I was 
enraged to the highest degree imaginable; when going

a^cended to a little rising ground, not above eighteen yards 
ilistaiice, and there I had a full view of these creatures, and 
1 Could perceive all their actions. 

Such a sight did then appear as obliged rac not to lose 
a moment's time. No less than nineteen of these dreadful 
n retches sat upon the ground, close huddled together, ex- 
pressing all the delight imaginable at so barbarous an en- 
tertainment; and they had just sent the other two to murder 
this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by limb 
to their lire; for they were them just going to untie the 
bands from his feet, in order for death, as fetters arc knock- 
ed oil' the fvct of malefactors before they got to the place of 
cxeciiiion. IIereaj)on, immediately turning to my man, 
now, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but 
do exactly as you see me do. All which he promising he 
w Guld perform, I set down one of my muskets and fowling- 
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same by his ; and 
with the other mu.*ket [ took my aim at the savages, bidding 
him do the like: Are you ready? said I : " Yes, :\Ia5ter,'' 
said he; why then tire at them,'said 1 : and that very mo- 
ment [gave fire likewise. 

J i only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday, 
taking his aim much better than I, killed two and wounded 
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful consterna- 
tion at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had yet 
escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon 
tht'ir feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew not 
which way to run or look, not knowing from whence their 
destruction came. We threw down our ])ieces and took up 
otliers, giving a second dreadful volley ; but as they were 
loaded only Avith swan shot, or smiill i)istol bullets, we per- 
ceived only two of them fall; though many were wounded, 
who run yelling and screaming about like mad creatures. 
Now, Friday, said J, lay down your piece, and take up the 
musket, and follow me. He did so, with great courage ; 
i^^hen,- showing ourselves to the savages, we gave a great 
shout, and made directly to the poor victim, who would 
have been sacrificed had not our (irst fire obliged the butch- 
ers, Avith three others, to jump into a canoe. By my order 
Friday tired at them, at Avliich shot 1 thought he had killed 
them all, by reason of their falling to the bottom of the boat; 
however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. la

the mean time, T cut the flags that tied the hands ami ffM 
of the poor creature, andltfting him up, asked him in the 
Portuguese tongue, iVhuf he zcas? He answered nie in Latin, 
Christiamifij but so very weak and faint, that he could scarcCi 
stand or speak. Immediately X gaAe him a dram, and a! 
piece of bread to cherish him, and asked him what country, 
man he was? He said Hispaniola, and then uttered all the 
thankfulness imaginable for his deliverance. Signior, said I, 
with as much Spanish as I was master of, let us talk after, 
wards, but fight noM^; here take this sword and pistol, and 
do what you can. And, indeed, h€ did so with such coiu 
rage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them in pieces inj 
an iustaut, the savages not having the power to fly for their 
lives. I ordered Friday to run for those pieces we had left 
at the Ueo^ which he brought m** with great swiftness, and 
then I gave him my musket, while I loaded the rest. But 
now there haj)pened a fierce encounter between the Spani- 
ard and one of the savages who had made at him with one 
of their wooden swords; and though the farmer was as 
brave as could be expected, having twice wounded his ene- 
my in the head, jet being weak and faint, t\\Q Indian had 
thrown him upon the ground, and was wresting my sword 
out of his hands, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting,] 
drew out his pistol and shot him through the body before I 
could come near him, though I was running to his assistance. 
As for Friday he pursued the Hying wretches with liis hatch- 
et, dispatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him. 
The Spaniard taking one of v.he fowling-pieces, wounded 
two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued and killed ; 
but the other, notwithstanding his wounds plunged himsell 
into the sea, and swam to those who were left in the canoe, 
whicli, with one wounded, were ali that escaped gut of one 
and twenty. The account is as follows :

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1'23 

, Thp savages in the eanoe worVed rery ha-d to ^ct out 
|of our reach, and"!'' ritlay nas as eager in pursuing thi?ni ; 
and indeed 1 was no less anxious about their escape, lost, 
ifter flic news had bcea carried to their people, lliey sthotijd 
return in multitudes and destroy us. 80 being resolved to 
pursue them, 1 jumped into oric of their canoes, and bid 
Friday follow me; but no sooner \vas I in, than, to my sur- 
prise 1 found anotaer poor creahire bound hand and foot 
for the slau.^hter, i -St as the S-.aniard had been, -vvith rery 
little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and would 
have helped him up, but he could neither stand nor speak, 
hut groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only unbound 
n order to be shun. Hereupon 1 bid Friday speak to him, 
and tell him of His deliverance; when pulling out my 
bottle, I made the poor wretc-h drink a dram, which, with 
the jt>yful news he had received, so revived his heart, that 
he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday began to heai him 
speak, and look more fully in his face, it would have moved 
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon transports of 
joy; for he kissed, embraced him, hutrgcd him, cried, 
laughe<d, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then cried 
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head, then sung 
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature; so that 
it Avas a great while before I could make him speak to me, 
or tell me what was the matter with him ; but when he 
came to the liberty of his speech, at the last he told me it was 
his father. 

Here indeed T was infinitely moved to see that dutiful 
and tender atlVction this poor savage had to his aged parcn*. - 
He would sit down by him in the boat, o*pen his breast, and 
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half an hour toge- 
ther, to cherish him : then he took his arms and ancles, 
which were stiff' and numbed, with binding, and chafed and 
rul)bed them M'ith his hands; by which means, perceiving 
what the case was, 1 gave him some rum, which proved of 
^rcat benefit to him. 

While we were busy in this action, the savages had got- 
ten almost out of sight; and happy it was we did not pur- 
sue them : For there arose from the north-west, which cou^ 
Unued all night long, such a violent storm, that I could not 
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After 
ihis I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had giveu 
kis father any bread? He shook his head and said^'* Noue, 



^24 I-^FE AND ADVENTURES 

<^ not one bit, mc cat a-np all ;" so I gave him a cal^c of 
bread out of a Httie pouch I carried for this end. 1 like- 
wise ftavc liim a dram for himself, and two or three buucius 
of rahins for his father. Both these ho carried to him, for 
he would make him diink i^^.e drain to comfort him. 

Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched, 
with such an extraordinary swifmess, that he was out of 
sight as it were in an instant ; but at his return I perceived 
him slacken his pace, because he had something in his hand. 
And this I found to be, as he approached nearer, an eartken 
iug with some water for his father, with two more cakes of 
bread, which lie delivered into my hands. Being very 
thii-stv myself, I drunk some of the water, of which when 
his father had drank sufficiently, it more revived his spMnis 
than ali the rum I had given him. 

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the 
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water, who was 
reposino- him?elf under a green place, nnder the shade of a 
tree, but so Aveak, that though he exerted himself, he could 
not 'stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to 
rub and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did ids fathers. - 
But every minute he was employed in this he would cast 
wishful eye towards the boat, where he left his father sit. 
tinfr; who suddenly disappearing, he iiew like lightniug 
to him. and finding he had only laid himself down to ease 
his lim'bs, he returned back to me presently, and then I 
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead h.mii 
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where 
I would take care of him. Upon which Friday took him 
upon his back, anu so carried him to the canoe, setting hii^ 
close by his father; and presenHy stepping out agam^ 
launched the boat oH^ and paddled it along the shore faster 
than I could walk, thouoh the wind blew very hard too, 
and having brought them safe to the creek, away he runs ta 
fetch the other canoe, which he brought to (he creels almost 
as soon as I got to it by land, when wafting me over, he 
took our new guests out of the boat; but so Nveak were they 
that I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow : and 
when I came to my castle, not being willing to make an 
entrance into ray wall, Ave made them a handsome, tent, 
cove-ed with old sails, and boughs of trees, making two 
rrood beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon and covei 
them. Thus, like an absolute king over subjects who owed 



or ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 125 

their lives to mo, I thought myself very considerable, espe- 
cially, as I ha^l now three religions in ray kingdom, my man 
Friday being a Protestant, his father a Pagan, and the Spa- 
niard a Papist: but I gave liberty of conscience to them 2;!, 

To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered 
Friday to kill mc a yearling goat; Avhich \vhcn he had uoTie, 
I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small 
pieces, boiled and Fte\vcd it, putting barley and rice into 
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table, dined 
uith them myself, and encouraged them, Friday -was my 
interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, 
who spoke tlic language of the savages pretty well. After 
dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms from the 
field of battle, and the next day to bary the dead bodies, 
'"which he did accordinglv. 

And now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether 
he thought tiicsc savages had escaped the kte storm in their 
, canoe? and if so, whether they would not return with a 
power too great for us to resist? lie an^sTrered, tliat he 
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if 
they were driven southwardly, they would come lo a land 
where they would be as certainly devoured, as if they were 
drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their 
own country, the strangeness of their fatal and bloody at- 
tack, would make them tell their people, that the rest of 
them were killed by thunder and lightning, not by the 
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits, (meaning Friday 
and me) Avho were sent from above to destroy them. And 
this, he said, he knew, because he had heard them say the same 
to one another. And indeed he was in the right on't; for 
I have heard since, that these four men gave out that who- 
ever went to that enchanted island, would be destroyed by 
fire from the gods. 

JNo canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap- 
prehensions ceased: Instead of which my former thoughts 
of a voyage took place, especially when Friday's father as, 
sured me, 1 should have good usage in his nation. As to 
the Spaniard, he told me, that sixteen more of his coautry- 
men and Portuguese, who had been shipwrecked, madi^ 
their escape thither ; that though thev were in union with 
the savages, yet they were very Uiiserable for want of pro- 
fisions and other uccccsarics. When I asked him about 

:L 



t^6 fLUTE AXD ADVEXTURES 

the parfkulars of his Toyagc, he answcrc<l thiit their ship 
^as bound from Rio dc la Plata to the Ilavannah; that 
"when the ship was lost, only five men perished in the ocean; 
the rest, h'aving saved themselves in the boat, were now 
landcil O'li tiic oiaisi continent. And -tvhat do they intend 
to do there? saixl I. He replied, thej hiive concerted mea- 
^ures to esjcape, hy buiWing a vessel, bnt that they had nei- 
ther tools nor provisions, so that all their designs came to 
nothing. -Supposing, said I, J should make a proposal, and 
invite them here^ would they not carry me prisoner to New 
'Sjiaiii? lie answered do; for he knew them to be such ho- 
nest ?ncn, -as ^voiild scorn to act such inhuman baseness to 
their deliverer: That, if I plcasexl, he anil the old savage 
Mould go over to them, talk with them aboat it, and bring 
jne an aasvror : That ,thcy should all swear fidelity to me 
.as their Jcader^ upon tJhe Holy Sacrament ; and, for hi> part, 
he would not only do the same, but stand to the last drop 
d)f hii3 x>1<)x^k1, fhould fkere be occasion.. 

These solemn assurances mado me resolve to grant thcra 
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose; but 
'when every thin^ VFas ready', the Sjjaniard raised an objec- 
tion, .which carriexl a great deal of weight in it: "Yoii 
<*' know, Sir,"" said he, '' that having been some time with 
*' you, f cannot but he sensible of your sto<:k of rice and 
^' .corn, sufficieiit, perhaps,, for us at present, butnct for them, 
^* should they come over presently- ; much less to victual a 
•^' vessel forxin intended voyage. Want might be as great 
'• iin occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the children 
^' of Israel did against jGod himself, when they wanted ] 
^' bread m the wilderness.. And, therefore, mj advlrc i.«, 
*' to v» ait knottier harvest, and in the inean time cultivate 
^* and improve xsome more Land., whereby we maj have 
^' plenty^ of provisions, in order to execute our jdesign.'* 

This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and 
so saiisfied was I of Jbis fidelity., that I esteemed him ever 
after^ And thus we all four went to work upon some more 
land, and against seed-tiinc we had gotten s/) much cured 
iand trimmed up^ as was sufiitient to sow twenty-two bushels 
of barle}' <on, and. sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, 
all the seeil we had to spare. As we were four in number, 
^nd by this time a,ll in good health, we feared not a hun- 
ddred Indians, shouJd they venttire to attack us ; and while 
i^c com was growing, 1 pitched vpon some trecs^ fit to 



OP ROBINSON cr.rsoE- 1^ 

hnWd us a large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over ;; 
^hich being- marked, 1 ordered Friday aud his father to cut 
them down, appointing the S,)auiard, who was now my 
privy counsellor, to orersee and direct the whole, I like- 
■\rise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting (he wild 
dams, and bringing home their kids to my inctosurc. Nor 
did I neglect the grape season, but cured thtin as usual, 
though 1 had such a quantity noAv, as woiri'i h-ave filled 
eighty barrels wich raisins. And thus aH of U5 beiirg em- 
ployed, they in working, and J in ])rovidlng for tlu^ui", till 
harvest ca!ue, God Almighty blessed the incrcass- of it so- 
much, that from twen'y-two barrels of barley, we thrashed 
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice, 
sufficient to victual a shij) lit to carry mc and all tlie Spani- 
ards to any part of America. 

Thus the [mncipal objectionr being answered, by a sufti- 
cient stock of prD4;isionSj I sent my two aaibaisadors over 
to the main land, vfhh. a regal authority to administer ihcr 
oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and have an iastrument 
signed under their hands, though I never asked whether 
they had pen, ink, or ])aperj Avhen giving each of them a 
musket, eight charges of powder and ball, and jjro visions- 
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair gale, 
on a day whrn the moon was at full". 

Scarce a fortnight had passed over iny head, but impa«^ 
tient for their return, I laid me down to sleep one morning, 
"when a strange accident happened, which was ushered ia 
ty Friday's coming rnnuing to- nie, and calling aloud, 
*' Master, master, they are com-e, they are come." Upoa 
which, not dreaming of any danger, out 1 jumped from my 
bed, put on my cfothes, and hurried through my little grove'f 
when looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a 
league and a half distant, standing ia for the shore with the 
i\-ind fair. I beheld they did not come front the side- where 
the land Jay on, but from the southermost end of the island:. 
So these being none of th-e ]'.cople we wanted, I ordered^ 
Friday to lie still, tiU such tira« as I came down from the 
mountain, which with my ladder, 1 irow ascended, iuf order 
to discover more fully what they were; stnd no^y with 'he 
fcjlp of my perspective gla^s, I plainly perceived an Eng- 
lish ship, which J concluded it to be, by the fa>shion of its 
K>ag boat; aoid whicli filled mjj vvita such- uncommon tracis-

128 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ports of joy, that I cannot tell how to describe; and ye 
some secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from 1 knov 
not what cause, as though I had reason to be upon m^ 
guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn th^ 
secret bints and intimations of danger, which very often an 
given, when we may imagine there is no possibility of its 
being real; for had 1 not been warned by this silent admo. 
nition, I had been in a worse situation than before, an( 
perhaps inevitably ruined. 

Not long it wa.=, before I perceived the boat to approael] 
the shore, as though they looked for a place where thej 
might conveniently land ; and at last they ran their boat oi 
shore upon the beach, about half a mile's distance; whici 
praved so much the happier for me; since, had they come 
into the creek, tliey had landed just at my door, and might 
not only have forced mc out of my castle, but plundered 
nie cf all I had in the world. Sow 1 was fully con- 
vinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were un- 
armed and bound; when immediately the first four or five i 
leaped on shore, and took those three out of the boat as ' 
prisoners ; one of whom I could perceive used the most 
passionate gestures of entreaty, afiliction, and despair, while 
the others, in a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern* 

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as- 
tonished, and 1 beckoned to Fridaj^, who was below, to^ 
ascend the mountain, and likewise to view this sight. " O 
*' master/' said he to me, '^you sec English mans eat pri- 
soners as well as savage mans." And do you think they 
will eat them, Friday? said I, ''Yes," said Friday, "they 
'• eat-a all up.". No, no, said I, Friday, .1 am much more 
concerned lest thoy murder them, but as for eating them 
up, that I am sure they will never do. 

And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not hav- 
ing the Spaniard and the Savage with me, but also that I 
f ould not come within shot of them unperceived, (they hav. 
ing no fire aruis among them) and save these three men,j 
whom I thought they were going to kill with their swords. 
But some comfort it was to me, that I perceived they werej 
set at liberty to go where they pleased, the rascally seamen; 
scattcringabout as though they had a mind to see the i)lajce ; 
and so long did they negligently ramble, that the tide had 
«!bbed so low as to"^leave the boat aground. Nor Mere the 
two men who were in her more circumspect; for having 



d^ninK. a little too much liquor, thuy fcUTast a^Feep; "But onie 
of them waking before the other, and perc;Mvin^ the boat 
too fastagrounJ for his strom^th to move it, he hallooed out 
fo the rest, who made all possible expcdirioir to come to 
him; but as Providence- onlered it, all their force wa?^ in- 
effectual to launch her, when I c oiHd heaf" thum s-pea-k to' 
©ne another, '• Why let her a'onv. Jack, cm't ye: she'll' 
float next tide;" by which- words I was fully convinced they 
were my own countrymenv J all this while lay very quiet, 
as being fully sensible i-t could be no less than ten hours be- 
fore the boat could be afloat, and then i-t wauld l^e so' dark, 
that tliey could not easily pc/ceivp me,< by which mearts I 
should be at more liberty to hear their talk., and observe al^ 
their motions : not but that I prepared for my defen^L* ; yot, 
as I had another sort of an enemy to coraliat wi.h, I acted 
wiih more caution. I took two fusees on= my shoulder, and 
gave Friday three muskets; be'^ides my formidalle goat- 
skin coat and monstrous cap mad:j me look a"? fierce and 
terrible as Hercules of old, c^pe.iiilly when * 70 piitoKs were 
stuck in my belt, and. my nakvd sword hanging by Ti?y side. 

It was my de-ign' at first not to make any attempt till it 
i^as dark; and it being. now two o'clock, in ihe ^^ry heat 
ef the day, tho sailors were all straggling in *bc woods, and 
undoubtedly were lain down to sleep. The three po )r dis- 
tressed crea'.ures, too anxious toget any repose, were how- 
ever sealed under the shade of a great tree, abou« a- quarter 
e>f a mile from me. Upon whi-ch, wilhout any more ado, I 
approached towards them, with my man following behind 
me, and, before J was perceived, J called alixud tu them ia 
Spanish, " What are ye, Gentlemen ? " 

At thcs« words, they stUrted up in great confusion, '>vhe»- 
they beheld the strange figure I made; they returne:! no

said I, "my poor habit will tell you I am a man, and an 
'' Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant 
*-only: Here are arms and ammunition; tell freely your 
^•'condition: Can we save you?'* " The story," said he, 
^' is too long to relate, since our butchers are so near; but 
" Sir, I was mast(-r of that ship, my men have mutinied, 
'' and it is a favour they have put my mate, this passenger, 
" and me, [on shore without murdering us, though we ex- 
*' pect nothing but perishing here." "• x\re your enemies , 
^^ gone ?" said I. " No," replied he, pointing to a thicket, 
'' there they lie, while my heart trembles, lest having seen 
*•' and heard us, they should murder us all." '^ Have they 
.*' fire arms?" said I. "They have but two pieces," said 
he, "one of which is left in the boat." He also told me 
there were two enormous Tillains among them, that vrere 
the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed or ' 
seized, might induce the rest to return to their obedience. — 
" Well, well," said I, " let us retire fartlier under the 
^•' covering of iho woods;" and there it was I made these 
conditions with him. 

I. That, while they staid in the island, they should not 
pretend to any authority ; but should, entirely conform to 
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in 
their hands. 

II. That, if ihe ship was recovered, they should afforii 
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England. 

When he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire^ 
I gaye him and his tv«^o companions each of them a gun, 
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon 
them as they lay sleeping. The Captain modestly said, that 
he was sorry to kill them ; though, on the other hand, to 
let thes« Tillains escape, who Avere the authors of his misery, 
might be the ruin of us all. "Well," said he, " do as you 
?' think fit;" and so accordingly I fired, killed one of the 
Captain's chief enemies and wounded the other, who eagerly 
called for assistance; but the Captain who had reserved 
his piece, coming up to him, '*^ Sirrah," said he, " 'tis too 
" late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to God to 
<<= pardon your yillany ;" and so knocked him down with 
the stock of his gun ; three others were also slightly wound- 
ed, who at my approach cried out for help. This the Cap- 
tain granted, upon condition that they would swear to be 
true to him in recovering the ship, which they solemoly did J

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

howcTcr T obliged the Captain to keep them bound. After 
v;hich I sent Friday and the Captain's mate to secure the 
boat and bring away tlie oars and sails; when, at their re- 
turn, three men coming back, and seeing their late distressed 
Captain now their conqueror, submitted to be bound also. 
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the ad- 
Tenturcs of my own life, which he heard with a serious, 
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried h-!m and his 
two companions into my little fortified castle; showed them 
all my conrcnicnccs, and refreshed them with such provi- 
sions as I could afford. When this was over we began to 
consider about regaining the ship. lie said that there were 
twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their lives were 
forfeited by the law for conspiracy and mutiny, were so very 
hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small company 
to attack them. This was a reasonable inference indeed; 
but something avc must resolve on, and immediately put in 
execution. AVe. therefore heaved the boat upon the beach 
so high that she could not shoot off at high water mark, and 
broke a hole in her not easily to be stopped ; so that all the 
signals they gave for the boat to come on board were in 
vain. This obliged them to send another boat ashore, with 
ten men armed, whose faces the Captain plainly descried, 
the boatswain being the chief officer; but he said there 
were three honest lads among them, who were forced 
into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage 
(for I had perceived he was in concern) in the mean while 
securing our prisoners, except two, whom we took to our 
assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure 
a battle. When the sailors landed, and .beheld their boat 
in that condition, they not only hallooed, but fired for their 
companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This 
struck. them with horror and amazement; and thiaking their 
companions were murdered, they made as if they would re- 
turn to the ship. I could perceive the Captain's counte- 
nance change at this, till of a sudden, three men were or- 
dered to look after the boat, while the other seven leapt on 
shore in order to search for their companions; and, indeed^ 
they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle^ 
from whence they could see to a great distance in the woods, 
and there shouting and hoollooing till tired and weary, they 
at length, seated themselves uader a spreading tree. My 
opinion was^ that nothing could be done till nighty Tvhen i

might use some artifice to get them all out of the boal;' hiit 
of a sudden they started up, and made to the sea-side ;: 
hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's mate to go 
over the ereek, and halloo as ] jud as they could, and so de- 
coyiniT theminto^ the v/oods^, come round to me again. Ami 
this, indeed, had good edect; for they folloAVcd the noise, 
till coming westward to the ereek,. they called for tlieir boat 
to carry them over, -and taking one of the men out of her, 
left two to look after her, having fasten^ed her to the stump 
of a little tree on shore, llereujjon immediately the Cap- 
tain and our party passing the creek, out of tlieir sight, we- ' 
surprised them both, by the Captain's knocking down one 
and ordering the other to surrender upon pain of death, 
and who being the howestest of them a41, sincerely joined 
w ith us. By this time it was pretty Lite ; w hen the rest 
returning to their boat, which thty found aground in the * 
creek, the tide out, and the men g:one, they ra;n about wring- 
ing their hand?, crying it was an enchanted island, and that 
they should be all murd^ied by spirits or devils. INIy men 
would willingly have fallen upon-, them, but I would not 
agree to hazard any of our party. Bat,, to be more certain, 
Friday and the Captain crawled upon their hand-, and feet, 
as near as possible; an<l when the boatswain approached 
in sight, so eager was the Captain,, that he fired and killtid 
him on the spot ; Friday wounded the next man, and a third 
ran away. Hereupon- I asdvanced Avith my whole army; 
and, it being dark, I ordered the ma^i we had surprised in 
the boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with' 
them. Accordingly he called out aloud, "Tom Smith, 
Tom Smith!" Ileanewered, '^ Who's that?" "Rjbinson: 
answered the other. " For G-od's sake Tom, surrender 
^' immediately, or you're all dead men." ^' Who must we: 
'' surrender to ?" says Smith. " To onr Captain and fifty men 
^' here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will Frye, 
'^ and killed the boatswain." ^' Shall we have quartei^s,. 
then?" said he. Hereupon, the- Captain calls out, '' \'ou 
^' Smith, you know* my voke, surrender iiTimediately, and 
'' you shall have all youi: lives granted, except Wall Atkins." 
Hereupon Atkins cried out, " What ha'y^e I- done, Captain, 
^' more than the rest, who have been as bad as me?" But 
that was a lie, for he was the person that laid hoUl of him, 
and bound him. However he was ordered to submit to the 
gpyerflor's mercy, for such was J called. And so, laying, 






OF ROBINSON CRUSOT!. 133 

down their arms, we bound them all, and seized on their 
boat. 

After this, the Captain expostulated with them, telling 
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might ux- 
eciite them there; but he thought they Mould all be sent to 
England, excei)t Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare 
for death the next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the 
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they 
niigljt i^ot be sent to England. This answered our project 
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins and two of 
the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being com- 
mitted to my bower, I sent the Captain to treat with them 
in the governor's name, otfering, them pardon if they would 
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all promis- 
ed to stand by him to the last drop of their blood ; and who- 
ever acted treacherously, should be hanged in chains upon 
the ])cach. They were all released on these assurances; 
and then the Captain repaired to the other boat, making his 
passenger Captain of her, and gave him four men well aim- 
ed : while himself, his mate, and five more went in the 
other boat. By midnight they came within call of the ship, 
when the Captain ordered Robinson to hail her, and tell 
thcni that with great dillicuity they had found tlie men at 
last. But Avhile they were discoursing, the Captain, his 
mate, and the rest entered and knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter, secured those that were upon deck, 
by putting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew 
entered and secured the forecastle ; they then broke into 
the round-house, where the mate, after some resistance, shot 
the pirate captain througli the head, upon which all the rest 
yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship being re- 
covered, the joyful signal was fired, which I heard with 
the greatest joy imaginable; nor was it long before he 
brought llie ship to an anchor at the creek's mouth, where 
coming to me unawares, ^' There," says he, ''my dearest 
" friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and we are your 
''servants:" a comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon 
in his arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten- 
derly embracing each other. 

Nothing now remained, but to consult what we should 
do with tlie prisoners, whom he tliough it was not safe to 
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the Captain, I 
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending for them, told 
them, that 1 was going to leave the island with all my peo« 



134 riri- and ADTrNxuREs 

pic, if they would tarry there, their lives should be spared 
if not they should be hanged at the first port they came as 
They agreed to stay. Hereupon I told them my whole story 
charging them to be kind to the Spaniards, that Avere ex 
l)ected, giving them all my arms, and informing them of ever 
thing necessary for their subsistance, after which, 1 and m 
man Friday went on board. But the next morning, two of th 
men came sw imniing to the ship's side, desiring the Captai 
to take them on board, though he hanged them afterward.' 
complaining mightily how barbarously the others used then: 
Upon which I prevailed with the Captain to take them in 
and being severely vvhipt and pickled, they proved mor 
honest for the future. And so I bid farewell to this islan 
carrying along with me my moaey, my parrot, umbre] 
and goat-skin cap ; ^etting sail December 12, 16S6, aftt> 
twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days resi 
dence, that same day and month that 1 escaped from Salcc 
landing in England June 11, 1687, after five and thirt 
jears absence from my own country, which rendered m- 
altogether a srranger there. 

Here I found my first Captain's widow alive, who ha 
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances 
find w^hom 1 made easy upon his account. Soon after, 
went down to Yorkshire, where all my family was expired 
except two sisters, and as many of one of my brother' 
children. I found no. provision had been made for me 
they concluding I had been long since dead; so that I \\ 
but in a very slender station. Indeed the Captain did m 
a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how I ha 
delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, upon which the_ 
made me a present of 2001. sterling. 1 next went to Lis 
bon, takiug my man Friday with me, and there arriving i; 
April, 1 met the Portuguese Captain, who had taken me Oi 
board on the African coast; but being ancient, he had let 
cff the sea, and resigned all his business to his son, wli 
followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, tha 
we did not know each other at first, till I discoverd my 
self more fully to him. After a few embraces, I began -t. 
inquire of my concerns: and then the old gentleman toh 
me, that it was nine years since he had been at Brazil 
where my J artnep M4S then living, but my trustees w er 
both dead; that he believed I should have a good accoun 
t^f tlK' product of my plauta'ion ; that the imxigiiiatioa a

ly bcrn:; lost, had obliged my trustees to give an ostlmate 
f my share to tho procurator fiscal, uho, in case of my not 
-turning, had giron on^^-third to the kins:, and the rest to 
ie monastery of St. Augustine: but if Tput in my claim, 
r any one for me^ it would l;e returned, except the yearly 
wduct which was given to the poor. I then desired thcni 
> tell me what improvement he thought had been made of 
y plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my 
bile to look after it ? Ue Rn^^wercd he did not know how 
nch it was improved : but this he was certain of, that my 
irtner was grown vastly rich upon his half of it : and, that 
5 had been informed, that the king had 200 moidores per 
inum for his third part. He added, that the survivors of 
y trustees T^ere persons of an ingenuous character; that 
ly partner could witness my title, my name being register- 
[ in the country, by which means T should indispensably 
cover considerable "ums of money. But, answered j 
)w could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made 
m only my heir? This, said he, was true; but, there be- 
g no affidavit made of my death, he could not act as my 
ecutor. However he had ordered his son, (then at Bra- 
) to act by procuration upon my account, and he had 
ken possession of my sugar-house," having accounted him. 
If for eight years with my partner and trustees for the pro- 
s, of which he would give me a very good account 
And, indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few 
ys, making himself Indebted to me 470 moidores of golr] 
er and above what had been lost at sea, after 1 had^ left 
; place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes 
had gone through, which forced my money out of his 
nds, to buy a part in a new ship: '« But," says he, «' you 
shall not want, take this ; and, when my son returns 
every farthing shall be paid you." Upon which he put 

my hands a purse of 150 moidores in gold; as likewise 
! nistrument, containing the title to the ship which his 

1 was in, and which he offered as security for the remain. 
\ But really when I saw so much goodncfs, generosity 
derness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept 
for fear he should straiten himself upon my account — 
tt IS true," Eaid he, " it may be so; but then the money 
s yours, not mine, and you may have the greatest occa- 
•lon for it." However I returned fifty of them back 
^y promising that I would freely forgive him the other 



136 r.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

hundred Avhcn T got my effects into my hands, and that I 
designed to go m} self for that purpose. But he told me 
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter 
my name -vvith a public notary, as likewise my affidavit, with! 
a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered mc to send] 
in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil; 
and, indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and honour, 
ably observed; for, in seven months time, I had a very faithi 
ful account of all my effects, >vhat sums of money v.er^ 
raised^ what expended, and what remained for my use: It 
a word, I foundmyself tobe worth SOOOl.^sterling, and lOOOl: 
per antium. Nor was this all ; for my partner congratulateij 
mc upon my being alive, telling me how much my plantai 
tion was improved ; what Negores were at work, and how 
many Ave Marias he had said to the Virgin INIaty for my 
preservation; desiring me to accept kindly some presents he 
had sent me, which I found showed the greatest generosity. 

No sooner did the ship arrive, but I rewarded my faith-i 
ful Captain, by returning him the hundred moidores and 
not only forgave him all he owed me, but I allowed him yearly 
a hnndred more, and fifty to his son, during their lives. And 
now being resolved to go to England, I returned letters ol 
thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in particular to my 
old partner, with very suitable presents. By the Captain's 
advice, I was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and there 
take passage for England ; when as it happened, I got i 
young English gentleman, a merchant's son at Lisbon, to ac 
company me, together with two English, and two Portu. 
t^uese. gentlemen; so that with a Portuguese servant, ar 
English sailor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us ii 
number. 

Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to iNxa. 
drid, when the summ.er decaying, we hasted to Navarre 
where we were inform.ed, that' there was scarcely any pas. 
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow ; so tha 
we were obliged to abide near twenty days at Parapeliina 
and at last to take a guide to conduct us safe to%vards Tho 
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with u 
together with their servants, we had a very jolly con-!])any 
Away our guide led us by frightful mountains, and througl 
so many intricate mazes and'wir.dings, that we inscnsi!)!; 
passed them, which, as we travelled along, ushered ns iut^ 
the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces of Lan 
guedoc and Gascoignc. 



or KC3IN50N CRI/SOE, 137 

But now ramc en two aciTcnturcs, both trnglcal and co^ 
fliical. First, our guide was cncounteied by three wolves 
and a bear, who set upon liiin and his horse, and womidod 
liim in three places ; upon which my laan, riding up to hi< 
assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which 
made the others retire into the woods. But the plcasan^est 
adventure was, to beliold my mau attack the bear. 'Tis 
such a creature, that if you let him alone, he will never 
meddle witU you ; and this my man \cry well knew, and 
fo begging leave of me in broken English, be told us, *' he 
^' would make good laugh." *' Why, you silly fool," said 
I, " he'll <^at you "p at a mouthful." ^^ Eaice mc up," re- 
plied he, by way of scorn, ^* me not only calee him, but 
^* make much good laugh." Upon which, pulli^ig off his 
boots, he clamps on iiis pumps, and running after the monstroiis 
beast, lie ^-alled out that he wanted to discourse with him, 
and then throwins; stones on purpose to in>cense him, the 
beast turns a])out in fury, and, with prodigious strides, 
shuffles after him. }lut tiiou^h he was not swift enough to 
ieep up ]>aec with Friday, who made up to us as it Avere 
for help; yet being angry, ^' You dog," said I, '• immcdi- 
■*'ately ta"ke horse, and let us shoot the creature." But he 
cried, "Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh much." 
And so he turned about, making signs to follow, while the 
bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, lie ascended in a 
minute, leaving his gun at ihc bottom of it. Nor did the 
bear make any difficulty of it, but ascended like a cat, though 
his weight was yery great. You must consider I was not 
A little amazed at the folly ©f my man, as not perceiving any 
thing to occasion o^r laughter, till such time as we rode up 
flearer and beheld the beast mounted upon the oak, on the 
beginning of thesasie branch, to which Friday clung at the 
farther end, where the bciir durst not come. Hereupon 
Friday cried out, ^^Now, master, me make much laugh, mc 
make bear dance." Upon v»hich ]iG fell a shaking the 
■bough, which made the creatnre look behind him, to see 
how he coukl retreat. Then, as if the boar had understood 
his stammering English; *' Why you no come farther, Mr. 
'*'Bear?" said he, ''pjayMr. Bear, come far here:" and 
Cnen indeed we all burst into a laughter, especially when 
we perceived -^Friday drop like a squirrel u])on the ground. 
-Jfaving the beast to make the bc't of his way dcr.yTL iho. twr. 

: M 



1S8 tIFE ANU ADYENTUfiES 

And now ihlnking it the most conrenicnt time to shoot the 
creature, Friday cried oat, ^^ O dear master, no shoot, me 
*' shoot by and by;" Avhen taking up the gun, "me no^ 
^' shoot yet," said he, '' me make one more muqh laugh." 
And accordingly lie was as good as his word; for the crea-i 
•ture descending backward from the tree verj- leisurely, be* 
fore he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot hiia 
through the ear, stone dead; and looking to sec whethefF 
Ave were pleased, he burst out into a hearty laughter, say-^ 
ing, "So we kill de bear in my country, not with the gun,* 
" but .with much long arrovvs.'* Thus ended our diversion. 
■^0 our i^reat satisfaction; especially in a place where the*, 
terrible bowlings struck us with a continual terror. But 
the snows now growing very deep, particularly on the^ 
mountains, the ravenous creatures were then obliged to seek 
jor sustenance in the villages, where coming by surprise on, 
the country ])eople, killed several of them, besides a great. 
Tiumber of their sheep and horses. 

Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place^ 
to pass by; and if there were any more wolves in the coun. 
try, there we should find them. This was a Small plain I 
.encompassed wiih woods, to gat through a long lane to the 
village where v.e were to lodge- When we entered the 
wood, the sun was within half an hour of setting; and a 
jlHle after it was set, we came into the plain, which was 
not above two furlongs over, and then we perceived five 
^■[reat wolves cross the road, without taking notiee of us, 
nnd so swift as though they were persuing after their prey. 
'}Iercupoa cur guide, believing there were more coming, 
dcsirt'd us to be upon our guard. Accordingly our eyes 
were very circumspect, till about half a league farther, we 
perceived a dead horse, and near a dozen of wolves devour. 
jw^ its carcase. My man Friday fain would have fired at 
•fhem, but I would not permit him; nor had we gone half 
over the jjlain, but we heard dreadful bowlings in a wood 
on our left, when presently wc saw a hundred come up 
Sf^ainst us, as though they had be-cn an experienced army. 
This obliged us to form ourselves in the best manner; and 
then i ordered chat every other man should fire; and those 
who did not, might be rendy to give a second volley, should 
they advance upon us ; and then every man should make 
use of his pistols. But there was no necessity for this ; fof 
*hn enemy bein^ terrified; stopped at the noise of the ftrcy 



OF Roni.vsoN cnusoE. 130 

I four of them were shot dead, and several others being 
wounded, Avent bleeding away, as we could rery plainly 
discover by the snow. And now remembering what had 
[been often told me, that such was the majesfy of a man's 
iToice, as to strike terror even in the fiercest creatures, J or- 
Ideredall our companions to halloo, as loud as possible; and 
i in this notion I wa!s not altogether mistaken ; for they ini- 
mrdiately turned about upon the first halloo, and began to 
retire; upon which, ordering a second volley in the-ir 
rear, they gaMoped into the woods with great precipitation. 

Thus we had some small time to load our pieces again, 
and then made all the haste we could on our way; but we 
had not rode far, before we were obliged to put ourselves 
,tn a posture of defence as before, beir?g alarmed with a very 
dreadful noise in the same wood, qn our left hand, the same 
way as wc were to pas?, only that it was some distanco 
from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread 
over the elements, and the night growing very dusky, made 
it so much the more to our disadvantage; but still the noise 
increasing, we were fully assured that it was the howlin^-. 
md yelling of those ravenous creatures ;- when presently 
three troopa of wolves on our front, appeared in sight, as 
though a great number of them had a design to surround us, 
and devour us in spite of fate. But as they did. not fait 
jpon us immediately, we proceeded on our journey in as swift 
I manner as the roads would permit our horses, which was 
Jnly a large trot. It was in this manner we travelled, tili 
«uch a time as wc discovered another wood, and had the 
prospect of its entrance, through v.-hich we were to pass, at 
;he farthest side of the plain. But surely none can express 
he terror we were in, when approaching the lane, we per- 
wed a confused number of the fiercest wolves, standing, 
is^ it were, guarding its entrance. Nor were we long in 
his amazement, before another occasion of horror present- 
'd itself; for suddenly we heard the report of a gnu at ano, 
her opening in the wood; and looking that way, out ran a 
lorsc bridled and saddled, flying with the greatest swiftness, 
nd no less than sixteen or seven te'in wolves pursuing after 
lim, in order to devour the poor creature; and unque^tion- 
bly they did so, after they had run him down, not being abla 
hold out that swiftness with which he at first escaped 
ficm. 

\ 



J5i& Y^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

"When vre rocfe up to that entrance fi*om whence the horse 
tame forth, there lay the carcase of another horse and two 
wen, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves : and un- 
<k)ubtedly one of these men was the person who fired the 
gun which^ we had hcan>y for th-e piece lay by him ; but, 
ulas J most of the appcr part of his bo^y and his head were 
entombed w the bowels of these ravenous creatures. 

What course to take, ivhether to proceed or retreat, we 
could not telf; but it^^ras not loi>g' before the wolves them- 
selves made us to come to ar resoJutionj for such numbers 
curroumled us, cycry Oiie of whom expected their prey, 
^hat were our bodies to be divided among them, there would 
>iot be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, rery happy it 
'.^as for us, that but a little way from the entrance, there lay 
some very large timber trees, which I supposed had been 
cut down and Juid there for sale ; amon-^st which I drew my 
I'ttle troop, placing ourselves in a line behind one !©ng^ tree, 
'w'hlch served us for a breast-work, when desiring them to 
alight, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, closin-g- our 
liodicfi in the centre, the only place where we could pre. 
terre them. 

Never certainly was there a more furious charge than 
vhat tlie wolves made upon us in this place: and the sight 
of the horses, which were the princip.al prey they aimctl at, 
provoked their hunger and added to- their natural lierceiress. 
They came on us with a most dreadful ivoise, that made the 
woods ripfcg againj and beginning to mount the pieces of 
timber, I ordered every man to fire, as before directed: 
and, indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they killed 
several of the wolves at the first volley ; but still we were 
obliged to keep a continual firing, by reason they came on 
Tike devils, pushing o!ie another with the greatest fury.—. 
But our second volley something abated their courage, when 
stopping a little, we hoped they would have made the best 
tef their way; however it did not prove so, for others made 
a new attempt upon us; and though in four firings we killed 
seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet 
they several times successively came on, as though they. 
Talued not their lives for the sake of their prey- 

Unwilling was I to spend our last shot too suddenly, awl 
therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a horn 
of powdr^r, bid him iny a large train quite along the timber, 
which he did, while Friday was charging my fusee and hi3 



OF uoniN5o:f cuusoi:. ^4't 

own, "vvith the greatest dexterity. By this tinjc ihe -sTolres 
coming up the timber, I set fire to ths traiit, by snapping a 
discharged pistol close to the po\rder. This so seorcheu 
and tcrriiied them, that some fell down, and others jumped 
ia ailing us ; but these Avera immediately disi)atched, 
TR'hen all the rest, frightened with tha light, which the darkv 
some night caused to appear more dreadful, began at length 
to retire; upon which, ordering our last pistols to be fired 
at one*", giTing at the same time a great shout, the wolves 
were obliged to have recourse to their swiftness, and turn 
tail; and then we sallied out upon twenty lame one?:, cut* 
ting them in pieces with our swords, AThich obliged thcuL 
to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows, vrho re- 
signed to us the field as victorious conquerors. And, in* 
deed, I question whether Alexander, king of ^Macedonia, 
in any of his conquests, had more occasion for triumph than 
we had ; for he was but attacked with numerous armies of 
soldiers, whereas our little army was obliged to combat a 
legion of dcTils, as it were, worse than the cannibals, who, 
the same moment they had slain U3, would have sacrificed 
US, to satisfy their voracious appetites. 

Thus ended our bloody battle with the bc-ast?;, having 
billed threescore of them, and saved our lives tVos* their 
fury. We silil had a league farther to go, when, as we 
went, car oaf? were saluted with their most uawelcom.? 
howling?, and we expected every moment another attack:. 
But, in an hour'^s tim€, we arrived at the town where we 
%ere to lodge; and here wc found the pla-ca strictiy guard- 
ed, and all in terrible confusion, as well they might, for 
fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the village, in order 
to prey upon their cattle and people. The next morning 
we were obliged to take a new guide, by reason the other., 
fell very bad of his wounds, which he had received, as be-A, 
fore mentioned. After we had reached Theulouse, wo 
eame into a warm, plca^^ant, and fruitful country, not infest- 
ed with wolves, nor any sort of raveacns creatures ; and 
when we told our story there, they much bhimed our guide,, 
for conducting us through the forest at the foot of the monn - 
tains, in such a severe season, when the snow obliged the 
wolves to seek for shelter in the woods. When we inform- 
ed them in what manner wo i;iaced ourselves, an 1 the- 
lioises in tho centre, they exceedingly reprehended us, anxi

t-jld uc, it was an hundred to one but we had beeii all de- 
stroyed; for that it was the very sight of the horse*, (thcic 
?o much desired prey) that made the wolves more raging)/ 
furious than they would have been, wluch was evident, by 
their being at other times really afraid of a gun; but then 
being exceedingly hungry and furious upon that account, 
their eagerness to come at tha horses raadc them insensible 
©f their danger : and that, if we had not, by a contiaual 
fire, arul at last by the ctmning stratagem of the train of 
powiUrr, got the better of them, it had bm-n great odds if 
iheifi iT-umhe-r had not overpowered us; besid-es, it was a 
great mercy wc alighted from our horses, and fought them 
\iiith that courage ar.d conduct, which had we failed to do, 
etery man of us, with our beasts, had been devoured; and. 
Indeed, this was nothing but tuith; for never, in my lifoj 
■was 1 80 ^ensibie of danger, as when three hundred devils 
jame roaring upon us, to shriu whose unwelrojue company, 
ii J wa3 sura to meet a storTn- every week, J would rather i 
fp a ttiousand leagues by ser,, 

I-^|iftk I hare nothing uncommon' in my passage through 
ynif£e to take notice of,, since other travellers of greater 
learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account 
than my pen-i&ablc to set forth. From Thoulouse I travel- 
Jed to Paris,^ from thence to Calais, where I took shipping^ 
and landed at Dover the 14th of January, in a very cold 
^ason. 

Thus come to; the end of vay travels, I soon discovered 
ni} new found estate, and all the bills of exchange I had 
^'ere currently paid. The good ancient wfdow, my only 
privy counsellor, thought no pains or cares too great to pro- 
■ T-iure my adrantage; nor had 1 ever occasion to blame her 
^deliiy, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for 
leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out fof 
jL'sbon, and to the Brazils: but, as in the Desolate Island, 
J; had some doubts a.bout the Romish religion, so I knew 
therj A^as Ilttlo encouragement to settle there, anless I 
would a;)0-»tatizc ffom the orthodox faith^ or live in conti- 
hJial fca,r of the Inquisition. Upon this account I resolved 
to r-11 my piantitlon; and, for that intent, I wrote to my 
Qld friend at Li=?bcn, who- returned me an answer to ray great 
san^faction; which was, that he would sell it to good ac* 
count; however, if I thought it convenient to give hira li- 
berty to offer it in my ni^.Tno to the two merchants, the sur<-

doubt, but that I should n;ake four or five tliousand piecei 
of eigat more of it, thaa I could if I disposed of it in any 
other manner whatsoever. 

You may be sure I cirld not hwt agree with this kind and 
ingenuous proposal ; and jitmiediately I sent him an ordor 
to offer it to them, which he accordlngry did: so that abtyttt 
eight months aftcr^ the ship being in fhat time returned, he 
gave me a safisfactory arcoiint, that they not only willinj^ly 
accepted the olfcr, but that they had also remitted :)3.()()0 
pieces of eight to a corrcspondeiit of their ov/n at Lisbo^^ 
in order to pay for the purchase. 

Hereupon, in return, 1 signed the instrument of sale, ac- 
cording to form, w'bicii they had sent from Lisbon, and re- 
turned it again to my old friend, he having sent nie, for my 
estate, bills of three hundred and twenty eight thousand 
pieces of eight, reservinji: the payment of one hundred moi- 
dorcs per annum, which i had a-Mowcd him during life^ 
Jikewise fifty to his son during life also, according to my 
faithful promise, which the plantation was to make good as

And tnus having led my reax!er to the knowledge of th^ 
first parts of my life, so remarkable for tho many peculiar 
providonces that attended it, floating in the ocean of uncer- 
taiaty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity, 
beginning fi)oli^hly, and yet ending happily ; incthinks uov/ 
that I am come to a safe and pleasant hav«n, it is time to 
cast out my anchor, and, laying up my vessel, bid, for a 
"tphile, adieu to foreign adventures. I had no other concerns 
to look after, but tiie-care of my brother's two sons, which

One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered, 
focrethor with advanced age, and the fear of losing, not only 
what I had gotten, but my life also, might have choaketl 
up all the seeds of useful ambition and curiosity, and put 
a lasting period to my wandering inclinations. But as no- 
thing but death can fully allay the active part of niy life, no 
less remarkable for the many various contingencies of it, 
yon will next perceive how I visited my little kingdom^

sui j 'cted to the Spaniards, "who yet used thera very ho-

over the Indiy.ns who Invaded, and thought to have con- 
quered the island, but were re]ielled by their invincible-l 
courage and- bravery, having taken elcvca men and five^ 
women prisoners, by which, at my return, i found about 
twenty yo^ung children on my little kingdom. Here I staid!

TIIB FURTHER ADVENTUEtS OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



Wherein are contained several strange and surprising «c- 
• counts of his Travels, and his most remarkable Tr ansae-. 

tiotis both bij Sea and Land; isiih his zsonderfnl vision of 

the Angelic IVorld. 

WHEN we consukr the puissant force of Nature, ancj 
what mighty inHucttce it has many times over the temper 
of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to think, 
that my powerful reason should be overcome by a much 
stronger' inclination. My late acqui-ed kingdom ran con- 
tiuiially in roy thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it ia 
the night ; nay, I made it the continual subject of my talk, 
eren to impertinence, when I was awake. 1 had such va- 
ponKs in my head, that I actually supposed myself at my 
fastic; that I not only perceived Friday's father, the old 
Spaulard, and the wicked sailors, but that f talked and dis. 
coursed with them about their manner of living; that I heard 
the things related to me, which I found afterwards to be, 
too true ; and that I executed my judgments with the greatest 
severity upon the offenders. And, indeed, this anticipating 
all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely aiTorded me one 
pleasant hour : ray dear and tender wife could not but take 
notice of it, which drew these aiiectionate speeches from 
her: ''My dear," said she, '• I am really persuaded that 
^' some secret impulse from Ileaven occasions in you a de* 
*• termination to see the island again; nor am I less sensibk^ 
*' but your being engaged to me and these dear children, i* 
" the only hinderance of your departure. I know, my dear, 
'' if I were in the grave, you would not long continue at 
*•' home; prevent not your happiness on my account, whose 
" only comfort centres in you. All that I can object is, that 
*' such an hazardous undertaking is no way consislent with 
*' a person of your ye.irs; but if yon are resolved to go," 
added she, weeping, "- only permit me to bear you com- 
^' pany, and that is all that 1 desire.*' 

Sutii endearing tenderness, graced with the most inno, 
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensibly 
irto my right understanding.: and when I considered all thi;. 



14€ LIFE AND ADVENTURE* 

transactions of my life, and particularly my new exigag€- 
ment ; that I had now one child already born, and my wife 
big of another; and that I had no occasion to seek for more 
riches, who already was blessed "with sufficiency, with much 
struggling I altered my resolutions at last, resolving to apply 
myself to some business or other, which might put a period 
to sich wandering inclinations. Hereupon 1 bought a little 
farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution to idotg 
thither; upon this there was a pretty convenient house, 
surrounded with land, very capable of improvement, which | 
suited my temper, as to planting, managing, and cultivating^ 
Nor was I long before I entered upor^my new settlement^ 
baviiig bought ploughs, arrows, carts, waggons, horses, 
cows, and sheep ; so that I now led the life of a country 
gentleman, and as happy in my retirement as the greatest 
monarch in the world. And what made me think my 
happiness the greater was, that I was in the middle state of 
life, which my father had so often recommended, much re- 
sembling the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly 
described by the poet in these lines : 

Free from all rices, free from c«ire. 
Age has no paixi, aud youth ao snare. 

But in the midst of this my happines?, I was suddenly 
plunged in the greatest sorxovv that I could possibly endure; 
for, when I least e:fpfcted it, my dear and tender wife was 
forced to submit to the irresistible power of Death, leaving 
this transitory life for a better. It is impossible for me to 
express the beauties of her mind, or the loveliness of her 
person ; neither can I too much lament her loss, which my 
latest breath shall record ; her influence was greater over 
me than the powers of my own reason, the importunities of 
friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting tears of a 
tender and disconsolate mother; in a word, she was the 
spirit of all my allairs, and the centre of my entcrprizcs. — 
But no^7, since the cruel hand of Death had closed my dear- 
est'8 eye?, 1 seemed \n my thoughts a stranger to the world; 
my privy counsellor being gone, I was like a ship without a 
pilot, that could ouly run before the wind. And when I 
looked around me in this busy world, one part labouring, 
for bread, and the other squandering away their estates ; 
tSis put mc in nnnd how I had lived in my little kingdom^ 



OF R0BI»:30N CRUSOE. 



I4f 



irhcrc both rea5;on and religion dictated to roe, that there 
was something that certainly was the icason and end of life, 
vhich was far su])erior to wh^it could be hoped for on this 
side the grave. My country delights were now as insipid 
and dull, as music and science to those who liave neither 
taste nor ingenuity. In short, resolving t^ Icarc ofi" house- 
keeping, 1 left my farm, and in a few months returned to 
L'/ndon. 

But; neither could that great city, so famous for its varii-ty 
of entertainment, atlord me any agreeable delight; a sratc 
of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and most 
hurtful to body and soul. It was now the beginning of the 
year 1684. at which time my nephew (who, as I before ob- 
served had bec^n brought up to the sea, and advanced to he 
captain of a ship) v.as returned from a short voyage to BiU 
boa, the first he had made in that station. He comes to me 
one morning, telling me, that some merchants of his ac- 
quaintance had proposed to hira to go a voyage for them to 
th' East-Indies and China, in the manner of private traders; 
*' and now uncle,'' said he, *Mf you'll accompany me thither, 
** V\l engage t» land you upon 3'our own island, to ytsit the 
^* state of your little kingdom." 

Just before he came in, my thoughts were fixed to get a 
patent for its possession, and then to fill it with inhabitants. 
Affcr I had paused a while, and looked stedfastly on him, 
*' What devil or spirit," said I, **sent you with this un- 
lucky errand ?" lie started at first ; but recoveriag him- 
self, when he perceived I was not offended, **5Ir," replied 
he, " what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled un. 
lucky, since certainly you must be desirous to see your little 
territory, where you reigned with more content than any of 
your brother kings in the univirse." — *' Nephew," said I, 
*' if you will leave me there, and call for me as you come 
back, I care not if I give my consent:" hut he answered, 
<hat the merchants would not allow their Tcssel, loaden 
with an infinite value, to return there again, which was a 
month's sail out of the way; *^ besides. Sir," said he, *'if I 
should itiiscarry, was your request granted, wh)' then you 
would be locked up as before.'* This, indeed, carried a 
j;rcat deal of reason in it : but we found out a remedy, and 
that was to carrj- a framed sloop on board, ready to be set 
wp in the island, by the assistance of some carpenters, which 
we should carry with us^ that might be fitted in a few ^dajF

to o-o to Eca. I was Dot long in forming my reso!utioB, 
"n-hich overstayed my good friend, the widow's, persuasions,^ 
and the TsatuTal afi'ection I bore to my yoirng childrtn. I' 
made my willj and settled my estate io such manner, that Ij 
%vas perfectly sure my poor i-nfant's would have justice done 
ihenu The* good widow iipt only undertook to make pro-i 
yisiou for my voyage, but al^o took the charge of my do- 
me;?tic aflairs, and to provide for my children's educa(ion;i 
.and indeed no mother could take more caro, or understood 
the office better ; for which I lived to reward and return 
her my hearty thanks. 

The begin'ning of January, 1G04-5, my nephew being; 
ri\idy to sail, 1 and Friday went on board in the Downs ofii 
the 8th, having, besides th«tt sloop already mentioned, a ' 
very condderable cargo for my new colony. First, I had 
some seivants, whom 1 proposed to leave there, as they 
should ap'pear Avillingt there were two carpenters, a smith, 
and a very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-alUtrades; foi 
he was not only a cooper by trade, but also was dextrous at 
making wheels, and liand-mills to grimd corn, likewise a 
t; ood turner, and a good pot-maker. I aho carried a tailor, 
who consented to stay in my plantation, and proved a most 
necessary fellow in the island. As to my cargo, it consisted 
of a sufficient quantity of linen, and English stuffs for cloth. 
fng4hc Spaniards that I expected to find there; as likewise 
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings ; together with beds, bedding, 
;iud hcjschold stuff, especially kitchen utensils, with pots, 
kettles, pewter, brass, kc. also nails, tools of all sorts, 
staples, hooks, hinges, and all other things ticcessary ; all 
which, I think, cost me about three hundred pounds. Noi; 
was this all; for I carried a liundred spare arms, muskets, 
and fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity oi 
several sorts of shot, two brass cannon, beside swords, 
cutlasses, and the iron part of som.c pikes and halbcrts. I 
made my nephew take with us two small quartcr-dcck 
guns, more than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave bc-i 
hind, if there was a necessity ; so that we might build a 
fort there, and man it against all opposers whatsoever., ^ : 

Well, wc put out to sea; and though I can't say this 
voyage was so iinprosperous as my others had been, yel 
contrary winds drove vis so far northward, that we were 
obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay 
^.Tind^beund U\o and twentv days. Here, indeed, ciir pro

vi-iioii"; were verv cheap, and we added to our ship's sfores 
by taking several live liogs, two cows a-nd calves, which I 
then resolved to put on ^hore in my island, if our necessities 
did not call for then. On the 5lh of February we sarlcd 
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for some 
davs ; and I think it was about the 20lh of the same month, 
late in the evenings when the mate informed us, that he 
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired : and when he was 
speaking, a boy came in and told us, that the boatswain had 
heard another. Upon which wc all ran to the quarter-deck, 
from whence, in a few moments, we perceived a terrible 
fire at a distance. We had immediately recourse to our 
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that there 
could be no land that way, it appearing to be at N. N. W, 
Hereupcm we concluded that some ship had taken fire at 
sea, and that it could not be far off, by the report of the- 
guns which we had heard. We made up directly to i!, and 
in half an hour's time, ths wind being fair, vre could plainly 
perceive a great ship on fire. In the middle of the sea. — 
Touched with this unhappy dii»aster, and considering my 
foriner circumstances, when the Portuguese Csptaih took 
tne up, I Immediately ordered five guns to be fired, that the 
poor creatures, not seeing us, it being dark, (though we 
could perceive their flame) might be sensible there was de- 
liverance at hand, and conse(iBently might endeavour to 
save themselves in their boat. Nor was it long before the 
ship blew up in the air, and the fire was extinguiNhed in 
the ocean. But supposing them all to be in their boats, we 
hung out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in 
the morning ; when, witli our perspective^, we beheld two 
boats full of people, making towards us, ihcaigh the tide wa« 
againsl them : tiieu sjjreading out our ancient, and haiiging- 
out a waft, as n signal for them to come on board, in half 
an hour's lime we came up with thesn, and took them all in, 
there being no less than SiXty-four men, women, and cliild-. 
jen. It was a French merchant ship of three hundred tQni<, 
homeward-hound from Quebec in the river of Cauada. — 
The master informed me how, by the negligence of tho 
steersman, the steerage was set on fire : that, at his outcry 
for help, the fire was, as he thought, totally extinguished; 
but that some sparL< getting between the timber and withiH 
Ihe .ceiling, 'it proccedtid into the hold, where there wa« n#

resisting it ; and then tliey got into their boats, as creatures 
in the lastextremiiy, with what provision they had, together 
with oars, sails, and a compass, intending to go back to 
Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though 
there were several chances against them, as storms to over- 
set and founder them, rains and colds to benumb and perish 
their limbs, and contrary winds to keep them back and 
starve them; but, said he, in this our great distress, we 
heard the welcome report of your guns, when, with unspeak- 
able joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were resolved 
to lie by till morning; but perceiving your light, we set- 
our oars at work, to keep our boat ahead, the sooner to 
attain your ship, ihe happy instrument of our deliverance. 

Indeed no one can ck press the joy of these poor crea- 
tures on this occasion ; fear and grief are easily set forth ; 
sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head,* 
are all the demonstrations of these passions ; but an excess 
of joy carries in it a thousand extravagancies ; especially, 
1 think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be 
more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of 
other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in 
the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad about 
the ship, while the rest were stamping with their feet, 




blood. But among the passengei . 
the one an old, and the other a young man ; but what amazed 
me more was, bhat the oldest was in the worst plight; tor 
no sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he 
dropped down, as it were, without life, and to every one sap- 
pearance quite dead ; but the surgeon chafing and rubbing 
his arm, opened a vein, which at first dropped, and thert 
flowing more freely, the old man began to open his eyes, 
and in a quarter of an hour was well again But soon re- 
n^embering this happy change, the joy ot which whirled his 
blood about faster than the vessels could convey it he be- 
came so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than any 
other place ; but the surgeon giving him a sleepy dose, 
he was perfectly composed the next morning. 

Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young 
priest At his enUaace on board the ship, he fell on fais lac« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* . _ t5 1 

in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. I thought, 
indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him 
up; bat he modestly told me, he was returning thanks to 
the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments, 
and that,' next to his Creator, he would return me thanks 
also. Ar.d indeed he did so, about three minutes after, with 
great seriousness and atTcction, while the tears stood in \\v^ 
eyes, which convinced me of the gratitude of his soul. Nop 
did he less show his piety and wisdom, in applying himself 
to his country people, and labouring to compose ihem, by 
the most powerful reasons, arguments, and p-rsua&ions. — 
And when, indeed, these people had taken their night's re- 
pose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found 
nothing but the best of manners, and the most civil acknow- 
ledgments, for which the French are eminently remarkable- 
The next day the Captain and one of the priests desired to 
speak with me and my nephew the commander. They 
told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things 
out of the ruined vessel, which was at our service; only 
that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way. 
At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but 
I (who knew how hard my case would have been, had tbe 
|Portuguese Captain served me so) persuaded him to thecon^- 
[trary; and therefore told them, that as we had done nolhing^ 
ibut what we were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, 
land what we ourselves might expect from others in such 
scalamity, so we took them up to save them, not to plunder 
them, or leave them naked upon the land, to perish for 
want of subsistence, and therefore' would not accept their 
money : but as to landing them, that was a great difficulty ; 
for being bound to the East Indies, it was impossible, wil- 
fully, to change our voyage upon their particular account, 
nor could my nephew (who was under charter party to 
pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to the freighters. — 
All that we could do, was to put ourselves in the way of 
meeting some ships homeward-bound from the West indies, 
that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or 
England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first 
kindness; but were under great concern, especially the 
passengers, at their being earned to the East Indies. They 
begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks of Newfound- 
|{and, where probably they might meet with some ship or 
sloop, to carry them to Canada, whence they came. As

this was but a rea';Gnable request, 1 was inclined to grant it, 
since it was no breach of chartv"r party, and the laws of God 
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our 
Jeliow-creatures ; and besides the danger we ourselves 
should he in for want of" provisions : so we consented to 
carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and vveafher would 
])ermit ; if not, that we should carry them to Marfinico in 
the West Indies. But, as it happened, in a week's time 
we made tiie banks- of Newfoundland, where the French 
people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the_young 
priest being desirous to go to the East Indies, I readiiv agreed 
to it; because i liked his conversation, and two or three of 
the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship. 

Now, directing our course for the West Indies, steering 
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano- 
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the ' 
latitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the I'Jih of March, 
169-4-5, we perceived a sail, (our course S. E. and by S.) 
which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large 
vessel, having lost her main top-mast and boltsprit ; when 
firing a gun as a signal of distress, wind N. N. \V. we soon 
came to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol, bound 
home fVcni Barbadoes, out of which road she had been forced 
in a hurricane to the westward, in which they lost their 
jnasts. 

They told us, their expectations were to see the Bahama 
islands, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N. W.ft 
and having no sails to work the ship with, but the main-j 
•course, and a kind oi a square sail upon a jury fore-mast,i^ 
because they could not come near the land, were endeavour-^ 
ing to stai'd ibr the Canaries: nay, wliat was worse, besides^ 
all their fatigue, ihey were almost starved (or want of pro-^ 
vision, having ate nothing for eleven days; all that they hacMJ 
aboard was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and seven casks? 
of rum. In this ship were passengers, a youth, his mother, 
and a maid-servant, who were in a most deplorable conditiaj[^^ 
for want of food. If I had not gone on board their ship,tl 
the knowledge of their misery had been concealed from me,'' 
and they woubl have inevitably perished, though, indeed, 
their second mate who was Captain, by reason the true 
Captain was not on board when the hurricane haj)pened^ 
had before informed me that there were such persons on 
board, whom he supposed to be dead, being afraid toincjuirft^

dfter them, because he had nothing to give them for relief. 
Hereupon we resolved to let them have what we could 
spare, ordering the mate to bring some of his men on board 
us, which he did according!)' : as he and they looked like 
skeletons, when meat was set before them I ordered them 
to eat sparingly. But, however, they soon fell sick; which 
obliged the surgeon to mix something in their broth, which 
was to be to them both food and physic. When they were 
fed, we ordered our mate to carry them a sack of bread, 
and four or five pieces of beef; but the surgeon charged 
them to see it boiled, and keep a guard on the cook-room,. 
to prevent the men from eating it raw, and consequently 
killing themselves with what was designed for their relief. 
But, particularly, I desired tlie mate to see what, condition, 
the poor passengers were in, and the surgeon gave him a 
pitcher of the same broth which he had prepared for the 
men. And being curious to see this scene of misery myseit^ 
I took the Captain (as we called the mate of the ship) ia. 
our own boat, anci sailed after them. 

Here was a sad sight indeed ! scarce were the victuals^ 
half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break open 
the cook-room door. To stay their stomachs, the mate gave 
them biscuits, which were dipped and softened with the 
liquor of the meat, which they call ^a/V^ ;, telling them it 
was for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them-, 
but a little at a time ; and so feeding them gradually, their 
bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did very well 
again. But when they came to the poor gentlewoman in- 
the cabin, who for several days had continued without food^ 
giving what she had to her son, tl)ey found her,, as it were, 
in the arms of death. She was sitting upon the floor of the 
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two 
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head shrunk be- 
tween her shoulders, like a senseless corpse. Nothing was- 
wanling in mv mate to revive and encourage her ; opening 
her lips, and putting some broth into her mouth with a spoon. 
But not having strength to speak, she lifted up her head 
with much difficulty, intimating that it was now too late !; 
at the same time pointing to the youth her son, as though. 
she desired him to do what he could to save the lad j and,^ 
in a little time after, she died. 

The youth, indeed, was not so far gone, yet lay stretched. 
©ut on the cabin bed, like one that had scarce any life* In.

his mouth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which he 
had ate up. At first he vomited what the mate had given 
him ; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in the 
greatest concern tor the death of his tender mother. 

As to the poor maid, she lay by iier mistress, like one in 
the last pangs of death : her limbs were distorted, one of her 
hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, which she 
grasped so liard, that it was with some difficulty we sepa- 
rated her from it ; her other arm lay over her head, and her 
feet lay both together, set fast against the frame ot the cabin 
table; not only being starved with hunger, but overcome 
with grief at the loss of her mistress, whom she loved most 
tenderly. It was a great while before the surgeon could 
bring her to life, and a much longer time before she came 
t© her senses. 

After we had sailed wkh them some days, we sent them 
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, 
with peas, flour, and other things ; taking three casks of 
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment, we 
left them, but took the youth and maid with us, with all 
iheir goods. The lad was about seventeen years old, very 
handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily 
concerned for the loss of his honoured mother, having lost 
his father at Barbadoes but a few months before. He be- 
seeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take him out 
of the ship ; for that the sailors, by not sparing a small suste- ' 
nance, had starved his mother. But hunger has no bounds, • 
no right, and consequentlv Is incapable of any compassion. 
When the surgeon told him, our voyage might put him in 
bad circumstances, and farther from his friends, he said he 
did not care, if he was delivered from that terrible crew;; 
that as the Captain (meaning me) had saved him from death, 
so he was sure he would do him no harm ; and, as for thej 
maid, when she was restored to her senses, she would bei 
no less thankful, let us carry them where we would. And 
indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me, that I . 
consented, and took them on board, with all their goods, . 
except eleven hogsheads of sugar ; but the youth having a 
bill of lading, 1 made the Commander oblige himself to de-. 
Uver a letter and the deceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers, 
a merchant in Bristol ; but 1 believe the ship was lost at sea,. 
for we never could hear what becam.e of her afterwards. We 
were now in the latitude 19 deg. 52 min. having as yet aa

tolerable good voyage. But-, passing by several little incidents 
relating to wind and weather, I shall relate what is mostrt- 
markable concerning my little kingdom, to which I was 
then drawing near. I had great difficulty in finding it, lor 
as I came to, and went from it before, on the south and east 
side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now ap- 
proaching Jbetween the main and the island, not having any 
chart of the coast, nor land mark, it obliged us to go on 
shore on several islands in the mouth of the rrver Oroonoko, 
but to no purpose. Thus I perceived, that what I thought 
T\as a continent before, was r.o such thing, but a long island, 
or rather a rtdge of sands. On one ol these islands I found 
some Spaniards, but they belonged to the isle de Trinidad, 
who came hither in a sloop to make salt, and try to find 
some pearl muscles. But at length I came fair on the 
south-side of my island, and then I presently knew the 
countenance of my liitle kingdom: so we brought the ship 
safe to an anchor, broadside within the creek, where stood 
my ancient and venerable castle. 

No sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I 
asked him where he was? But when he looked a liitle, he 
clapped his hands, crying, " O joy, O there, O yes, O 
there \" pointing to our old abode, and then fell a dancing 
and capering as if he was madj and I had much ado to keep 
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. "Friday,'* 
said I, '" what do you think, shall we go to see your father r^' 
At the mentioning his father's name, the poor affectionate 
creature fell a weeping: *'No, no,'^ says he, "me see him 
no more, never see poor father more ! he long ago die, die 
long ago; he much old man." *'You don't know that," 
said I, *' but shall we see any body else?" He looks about> 
and pointing to the hill above my house, cries out, " We 
see, we see there much men and there ;" which, though I 
could not perceive them with my perspective glass, was 
true, by what the men themselves told me the next day. 

When the English ancient was spread, and three guns 
fired, as a signal of friendship, we perceived a smoke rise 
from the creek; upon which I ordered the boat out, taking 
Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag of truce, I 
went on shore, accompanied also by the young friar, to 
whom I had related the history of the first part of my Ufe;. 
besides, we had sixteen men well armed, in ease we hai 
mot with any opposition. 



156 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

. After we had rowed directly into the creek, the first man 
I fixed my eye upon was tl.e Spaniard, whose life I had 
saved, and whose face I perfectly well knew. I ordered 
theni all to stay in the boat fur a while; but Friday, per- 
ceiving his father at a distance, would liave jumped into the 
sea, had they not fet the boat go. No sooner was he on 
shore, bathe flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to em- 
brace his aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of 
the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to see with what 
uncommon transports of joy he saluted him; he first kissed 
him, then stroked his face, took him in his arms, laid him 
under a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as ear- 
nestly at him, as one would do at a picture, for a quarter of 
an hour together. After this he would lie upon (he ground, 
stroke his legs and kiss them, then get up and stare at him, 
as though he was bewitched; but the next day one could 
not forbear laughter to see his behaviour ; for he would walk 
several hours with his father along the shore, leading him 
by the hand, as tho' he was a lady ; while, every now and 
then, he would run to the boat to get something for him, as 
a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit, or something or other that 
was good. His frolics ran in another channel in the after- 
noon ; when he set old Friday on the ground, he would 
dance round him, making comical postures and gestures; 
and all this while would be telling him one story or another 
of his travels and adventures. 

It was on the 10th of April, anno 1695, that I set my 
foot upon the island a second time. When my faithful 
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat,., 
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him, 
" Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, '*don*t you know me }** 
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attend- 
ant, extended his arms, and saying something in Spanish 
that I did not then understand, he came forward and em- 
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not Ko know his de-- 
liverer, who, like an angel sent from heaven, had saved his 
life. He then beckoned to the man to call out his com- 
panions; asked me if I would walk t© my own habitation, 
and take possession, where I should find some mean im- 
provements; but indeed they were extraordinary ones ; for 
they had planted so many trees so close together, that the 
place was like a labyrinth, which none could find out ex- 
cept themselves, who knew its intricate windings, I asked* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 157 

him the meaning of a!I these fortifications? he told me he 
would give a large ?.ccount of what had passed since my 
departure till this time, and how he liad subdued some Enj^- 
lish, who thought to be their murderers, hoping 1 would 
not be displeased, since necessiu compelled Inem to it. — 
As I knew they were v\ icked viiij'ms, so 1 told him, that 1 
was not only far from linding fault with it, but vv:.s rather 
l;eartily glad thai thcv had subdued them. While xve were 
thus talking, the man who.m he ii^^n^^ returned, acct>njpanied 
by eleven more, but in such habits, that it was impv^ssible 
to tell what nations they were of. He first turiied to me, 
and pointing to lliem, '' These, Sir,^' said he, " are some of 
the gtnilemen who owe their lives to )oar g-.^'dness i" then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them sensi- 
ble who I was ; and then indeed they saluted me one by 
one, n(;t as ordmary men, but as though ihcy had been am- 
bassadors or noblemen, and 1 a triumphant conqueror; for 
Iheir behaviour not only agreed with a manlike, majestic 
gravity, but at the same time was so obliging acd courteous, 
as made them agreeable to the last degree. 

Before 1 relate the history of the transactions of my king- 
dom, as 1 had it from the Spaniard's own mouth, I must 
here insert what I omitted in my former relation. The 
matter is this: Just before we weighed anchor and set sail, 
there happened a quarrel on board tne ship, which had like to 
have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as the cou- 
rageous Captain, taking two of the most refractory prisoners, 
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were concerned in 
the former disorders, lo have t.tjem hanged in England For 
running away with the ship. This frightened somt: of the 
rest, as thinking the Captain would serve them in the 
same manner, though he seemed to give them good words 
lor the present. But the mate having intelligence of this, 
made me acquainted with their fears; so that, to make 
them more easy, and ourselves more safe Irom their corspi- 
racies, I was obliged to go down, and pais my honour's 
word for it, that upon their good behaviour, ail that was 
past should be forgiven ; in testimony pf which, I ordered 
the two men^s iions to be taken oit, and themselves for- 
given. But as this had brought us to an anchor at night, 
in which there was a calm, the two men that had been in 
irons, stole each of them a musket, and sonne other weapons^ 
aiwi taking the ship's pinnace^ not yet bauled up, r»G away

to their brofher rogues. The next morning we sent the 
long-boat, wilh men to pursue them, but all in vain ; the 
male, in revenge, would have demolished my liltie castle, 
burnt its furniture, and destroyed their plantations, but 
having no orders for it, he did not put it in execution — 
ADd thus there were five Englishmen in the island, which 
caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a 
perfect account of, in the following manner : 

*' You cannot. Sir, but remember the embassy you sent 
me about, and what a disappointment we met wilh, by your 
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the 
relation ot all our voyage, being blessed with calm weather, 
and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy ofjny coun- 
trymen to see me alive, having acted as the principal luan 
on board, the captain of the shipwrecked vessel dv ing before ; 
nor was their surprise less, as knowing I was taken prisoner 
by the savages of another nation, tbey had thought me long 
since entombed in their monstrous bowels. But when I 
showed them the arms, ammunition, and provisions I had 
brought for them, they looked upon me as a second Joseph 
advanced in Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to 
come along with me. Indeed they were obliged to trespass 
upon their friendly savages, by borrowing two of their 
canoes, under a pretext for fishing ; and they ca.Tie sway 
the next morning, but without any provisions of their own, 
except a few roots, v hich served them instead of bread. — - 
After three weeks absence, we arrived at our habitation. 
Here we met with three English sailors, who, J confess, 
gave us provisions, and that letter of direction you had left 
ibr us, which informed us how to bring up tame goats, plant 
corn, cure grapes, make pots, and, in short, every thing 
that was necessary for our use. As, in particular, I knew 
your method best, so taking Friday's father to assist me, we 
managed all the affair.^ ; nor were the rest of the Spaniards 
wanting in their kind otlices, dressing food for the English- 
men, who did -nothing but ramble and divert themselves in 
the woods, either shooting parrots, or catching tortoises. 
But we had not been long ashore, before we were informed 
of two more Englishmen, unnaturally turned out of their com- 
mon place of residence, by the three others above-mention- 
ed ; this made m)'^ Spaniards and me (whom they now 
looked upon as their governor in your absence) endeavour to 
persuade them to Uku them in, that we mighi be as one family j 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 

buf all our entreaties were in vain, so that the poor fellows 
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their 
tents on the north side of the island, a liLtle inclining to the 
west, for fear of savages. Here Ihey built two huts, one to 
lodge, and the other to lay their stores in ; for my good natur- 
ed Spaniard giving Ihem some seeds, they dug and planted 
as I had done, and began to live prettily. But while they 
were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural brutes, 
their countrymen, in a mere bull) ing humour, insulted them, 
by saying, the governor (meaning you) had given them 
possession of the island, and d — mn 'em they should build no 
houses upon their ground, without p.'^ying rent. 7 he two 
honest men (for so let me now distinguish them) thought their 
three countrymen only jested, and one of them invited them 
in, to see their fine habitations ; while the other facetiously 
told them, that since they built tenements with great im- 
provements, they should, according to the custom of lords, 
^ive him a longer lease; at the same time desiring them to 
fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of these 
wretches swearing he should pay for the jest, snatches up a 
fire-brand, and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very 
fairly set it on fire, which would soon have consumed it, 
had not the honest man thrust him away, and trod it out 
with his feet. Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole, 
with which he would have ended his days, had not the 
poor man avoided the blow, when fetching his musket, he 
knocked down the villain that began the quarrel. The 
other two coming to assist their fellow, obliged the honest 
man to take his musket also, and both of them presenting 
their pieces, bid the villains slaiid off; and if they did not 
Jay down their arms, death should decide the dispute one 
way or other. This brought them to a parley, in which 
they agreed to take their wounded man and begone; but 
they were in the wrong that they did not disarm them when 
they had the power, and then make their complaint to me 
and my Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented 
their farther designs against them. And, indeed, so many 
trespasses did they afterwards commit, by treading down 
their corn, shooting their young kids and goats, and plagu- 
ing them night and day, that they resolved to come to my 
castle, challenge all the three, and decide their right by one 
plain battle, while the Spaniards stood by to see fair play. 
One day it happened, that two o£ my Spaniards (one of 



]t>0 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

whom understood English) being in the woods, were met 
by one of the honest men, who complained how barbarous 
their counlrynien had been in destroying their corn, killinjy 
their miik-goat, and three kids, which deprived them of their 
fubsislei'ce ; and that if v.e did not grant them relief, they 
must be inevitably starved, and so they parted ; but when 
my Spaniards came liome at night, and supper being on the 
tab!e, one of them began to reprehend the Englishmen, but 
in a very mannerly way ; which they resenting, replied, 
*' What business had their counir-ymen in that plate without 
leave, when it was Tjone of their ground ?^* " Why,'' said 
my Spaniard, calmly, ""' Inglise, they must not starve;" but 
iht^y replied, " Let them starve, and be damnM, ihey sh.oulsi j 
neither plant r.or build; and damn them, they should bel 
their servants, and work for them, for the JKland was theirs, 
and lhev~woiild bur*) all the huts they should find in the 
island." *' By this rule,'^ said my -Spaniard, smilmg, " We 
sljai! be yoar servants too.'* *' Aye, by G — d, and so you 
shall," replied the impudent rascal. Upon which, starting; 
up, Will Atkins cries, "Come, Ja<.k, let's have t'other 
brush with them, who dare to haild in our dominions?'^ — - 
Thus leaving us something heated with just passioa, away 
they trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and sword, 
muttering some threatening words^ that we could then bat 
imperfectly understand. That night they designed to mur-" 
c!er their two companions, and slept till midnight in the 
bovver, thinking to fail upon them in their sleep; nor were 
the honest men less thoughtful concerning them ; for at this 
juncture they were coming to find them out, but in a mucb 
jairer wav. As soon as the villains came to the huts, and 
found no body there, they concluded that I and my Spaniard 
had given them notice, and therelisre swore to be revenged 
on us. Then they demolished the poor men's habitations ; 
not by fire as they attempted before, bat pulled down their 
houses linib from limb, not leaving stick or stone on the 
ground where they stood, broke their household stuff in 
pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their inclosure, and, in 
short, quite ruined them of every thing tliey had. Had 
these people met together, no doubt but theie would have 
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it for the 
better ; for just as the three were got together, the two 
were at our castle ; and when they lelt us, the three came 
back again, but in great rage, scoffingly. itUing us what 
7

they had done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat, 
twirls it round, saying, '* And you, Seigni.-.r Jack Spaniard* 
shall have the same sauce, if you don't mend ^oar manners.*' 
j\Iy Spaniard, a grave but courageous man, knocked him 
d«>wn with x>ne blow of his li.st; at which another villain 
fired his pistol, and narrowly missud hrs body, but wounded 
him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard takes 
up the fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, and 
would have shot him, if I and the rest had not come out^ 
and taken their arms from eveiy one of them. 

" These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us 
their enemies, began to cool ; but notwithstanding therr 
bitter words, the Spaniards would not return theai their 
arms again, telling them they would do them no manner of 
harm, if they would live peaceably j but if they orTered any 
injury to the plant^lion or caslle, they would shoot them as 
they would do ravenojjs beasts. This made them so mad, 
tnat th.ey went away raging iike furies ofheil. They were 
no sooner gone, but in came the two honest men, fired with 
the justest rage, if such can be, having been rained a,\ afore- 
said. And indeed it was very hard, that nineteen of us 
should be bullied by three viiialus, continually olfending 
with impunity. 

^' It was a great while, Sir, before we could persuade the 
two Eiigiishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly killirg 
them with their lire-arms ; but we promised them justice 
should be done them ; and, in the mean iinut^ tliey should 
reside with us in our habitation. In about tive days after, 
these three vagrants, almost starved with hanger, drew near 
our grove, and perceiving me, Ihe governor, and two others 
walking by the side of tlie creek, they very submissively 
desired to be received into the family again. We told 
them of their great incivilily to us, and of tlieir unnatural 
barbarity to ikeir couwtrymen ; but yet we would see what 
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour*s time would bring 
them word. After some debate, we called them ie, where 
their two countrymen laid a heavy charge against them, 
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, which 
they could not deny. But here 1 was forced to interpose 
as a mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt 
them, being naked and unarmed; and that the other three

it was be-| 



and fencing their ground in the same manner as 

Jbre. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted 
to this at present, and lived some time regularly enough,] 
except as to the working part, which they did not care fc^r,! 

,but the Spaniards would have dispensed with that, had they' 
continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them 
again, they scarce had them a week when they became as 
troublesome as ever; but an accident happening soon after, 
obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and iook to our; 

.common preservation. i 

"One night. Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health, ' 

and yet by no means could I compose myself to sleep ; upon 

which, being very uneasy, I got up and looked out, h\A it 

being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees around 

■the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one, 1 could 
not sleep ; when one of my Spaniards hearing me walk 
about, asked who was up? I answered, "It is I." When 
I toid him the occasion, " Sir,'' said he, <* such things are 
not to be slighted ; for certainly there is some mischief plot- 
ting against us." "Where are the Englishmen?" said I. 
He answered, '* In their huts ; for they lay separate from 
us. Sir, since the Ia»t mutiny." ** Well,*' said I, "some 
kind spirit gives this information for advantage. Come let 
us go abroad, and see if any thing offers to justify our fears.** 
Upon which I and some of my Spaniards went up the moun-i 
tain, not by the ladder, but through the grove, and then we; 
■were struck with a panic fear on seeing a light, as though 
it were a fire, at a very little distance, and hearing the; 
voices of several men. Hereupon we retreated immediate- 
ly, and jaised the rest of our forces, and made them sensible 
of the impending danger ; but with all my authority, I could 
.not make them stay where they were, so earnest were they 
to see how things went. Indeed, the darkness of the night' 
.^ave them opportunity enough to view them by tl>e light of" 
the fire, undiscovered. As they were in different parties, 
and straggling over the shore, we were much afraid that 
they should find out our habitations, and destroy our flocks 
^f goats; to prevent which, we sent immediately an Eng- 
lishman and two Spaniards to drive the goats into the val- 
ley where the cave lay; or, if there was occasion, into the 
cave itself: As to purselves, resuming our native courage^ 
and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we durst" 
venture to attack a hundred of them i but before it waa 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOE. " 16^ 

Tery light^ we resolved to send out Friday's father as a spy, 
who, immediately stripping himself naked, gets among them 
undiscovered, and in two hours time brings word, that they 
were two parties of two difierent nations, who lately havifig 
a bloody battle with one another, happened to land by mere 
chance in the same island, to devour their miserable pri- 
soners ; that they were entirely ignorant of any persons 
inhabiting here; but rather being filled with rage and fury 
against one another, he believed, that as soon as day-light 
aj?peared, there would be a terrible engagement. Old Fri- 
day had scarce ended his relation, when we heard an un- 
common noise, and perceived that there was a horrid en- 
gagement between the two armies. 

"Such was the curiosity of our party, especially the Eng- 
lishmen, that they would not lie close, though Old Friday told- 
them their salety depended upon it ; and that if we had 
patience, we should behold the savages kill o»e another. 
However they used some caution, by going farther into 
the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient placa 
to behold the battle. 

"Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or 
inen of more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac- 
cording to their n^anner and way of lighting. It lasted near 
two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle began 
to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors. We 
were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on this 
account, lest they should run jnto our grove, and conse- 
quently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-- 
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and 
that too with our swords, and the butt ends of our muskets, 
for fear the report of our guns should be heard. 

" And 30 indeed, as we thought, it happened; for three 
of the vanquished army crossing the creek, ran directly to 
the place, as to a thick wood for shelter; nor was it long 
before our scout gave us notice of it; as also, that the vic- 
tors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon this I would 
not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised and taken 
by our party ; afterwards they proved very good servants 
to us, being stout young creatures, and able to do a great 
deal of work. The remainder of the conquered savages 
fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean, while the, 
eouquerors> joining together, shouted by way of triumph^

and about three in the afternoon they also embarked for 
their own country. Thus we were freed at once from those 
ravages and our fears, not perceiving an^ of these creatures 
for some considerable time after. We tound two and thirty 
men dead in the field of battle; some were slain with long 
arrows, whic h we found sticking in their bodies ; and the 
rest were killed with great unwieldy wooden swords, which 
denoted their \^ast strength, and of which we found seven- 
teen, besides bows and arrows ; but we could not find one 
wounded creature among thena alive ; for they either kill 
their enemies tjuite, or carry those wounded away with them. 

•'This'terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for some time, 
considering how unfortunate they might have been had theya 
fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them aVi 
enemies, but also for food, as we do cattle : and indeed so^ 
much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not only made ' 
them very sick, but more tractable to the common necessary 
business of the whole society, planting, sowing, and reap- 
ing, with the greatest signs of amity and friendship; so, 
that beitij^ now all good friends, we began to consider ef 
circumstances in general; and the first thing wc thouglit 
of was, whether, as we perceived ihe savages haunted that 
side of the island, and there being more retired parts of it, 
and yet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally \ 
to our advantage, we ought not raiher to move oar place > 
of residence, and plant it in a much safer place, both fori 
the security of our corn and cattle. I 

*' After a long debate on this head, it was resolved, orj 
rather voted, nem'we anilradicente^ not to remove our ancient 
castle, and that for this very good reason, that some time 
or other we expected to hear from our supreme governor, 
(meaning you, Sir^) whose messengers not finding us there, 
anight think tke place demolished, and all his subjects de- 
stroyed by the savages. 

" As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle, 
we consented to have them removed to the valley where 
the cave was, that being most proper and sufficient for both. 
But yet, when we considered farther, we altered one part 
of our resolution, which was to remove part of our cattle 
th-rther, and plant feniy part of our c«rn there; so that in 
case one part was destroyed, the other might be preserved. 
Another resolution we took, which really had a great deal 
of prudence in it, and that was, in not trusting lh« three

savages whom we had taken prisoners, xvUh any knowledge 
of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what num- 
ber of cattle we had there, much less of the cave, wlierein 
we kept several arm*, and two barrels of powder ycu left 
lor us at your departure from this island. But though we 
could not change our habitation, we resolved to make it 
more fortified and more secure. To this end, Sir, as you 
planted trees at some distance before the entrance of your 
palace;-so we, imitating your example, planted and filled' 
up the whole space of ground, even to the banks of the 
creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not 
leaving a place for landing ; and amorvg those I had planted, 
they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which 
growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could 
scarcely find a passage threugh them. Nor was this suffi- 
cient, as we thought, for we did the same to all the ground, 
fn the riglit and left hand of us, even to the top of I lie hill, 
without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves, except 
by the ladder, which being taken down, nothing but- what 
had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us. 
And indeed this was exceedin^gly weU contrived, especially 
to serve that occasion, for which we afterwards found it 
necessary. 

*' Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav- 
ing, all this time, not one visit from the savages. Indeed' 
one morning we had an alarm, v/hich put us in some amaze- 
Riont; for a few of ray Spaniards being out very early,, 
perceived no less than twenty canoes, as it were, coming 
on shore : upon which returning home with great precipi- 
tation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep 
at home all that day and the next, going out oniy in the 
Jiight-time to make our observations ; but, as goodluck^ 
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not 
land that time upon the island. 

*' But now there happened another quarrel between the- 
three wicked £nglishn:en, and some of my Spaniards. — 
The occasion was this : One of them being enraged at one 
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not being 
able to comprehend something which he was showing him, 
snatched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but to 
kill him ; yet missing his head, gave him such a barbarous 
cut in the shoulder, .that he had like to have struck oti'his

arm ; at which one of my good-natured Spaniards Inter- 
posing between the Englishman and the savage, beseeched 
die iormer not to murder the poor creature ; but this kind- 
ness had Jike to have cost the Spaniard his life, for the 
Enghshraan struck at hira in the same manner; which h« 
nimbly and wisely avoided, returned suddenly upon him 
with his shovel, (being all at work about their corn land) and 
very fairly knocked the brutish creature down. Hereupon, 
another Englishman coming to his fellow*s^ssistance, laid the 
good Spaniard on the earth ; when immediately two others 
coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Englishman,- 
armed with an old cutlass, who wounded them both. This' 
Uproar soon reached oar ears, when, we rushing out upon 
them, took the three Englishmen prisoners, and then our next 
question was, what should be done to such mutinous and 
impudent fellows, so furious, de-sperate, and idle, that thev 
were mischievous to the highest degree, and consequently 
not safe for the society to let them live among them. 

" Now, Sir, as I was governor in your absence, so I also 
took the authority of a judge ; and, having them brought 
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my country, 
I would have hanged every mother's son of them; but, 
since it was an Englishman, (meaning you, kind Sir,) to 
whom we were indebted for our preservation and deliver- 
ance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all possible mild- 
ness; but_, at the same time, leavinja: them to the judgment of 
the other two Englishmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their 
lesentments, would deal impartially by them. 

♦'Hereupon owe of his countrymen stood up: "Sir,** 
said he, " leave it not to us, for you may be sensible we^ 
"have reason to sentence them to the gallows : besides. Sir, 
this fellow, Will Atkins, and the two bthers^ proposed to us, 
that we mJght murder you all in your sleep, which we could 
not consent to : but knowing their inability, and your vigi- 
lance, we did not think fit to discov^-r it before now.-"^ 

**Novv, Seignior,'* said I, "do you hear what is alleged 
against you ? What can you say to justify so horrid an action 
us to murder us in cold Wood ?" So far, Sir, was the wretch 
fiom denvir.git, that he swore, d — mn him but he would do 
it still. *' But what have we done tovou, Seignior Atkins,*' 
said 1 ; ** or what will yoii gain by killing us ? What shall 
we do to prevent you? iVlust we kill you, or you kill us >> 
Why willyou. Seignior Atkins," iaid I, smiling, ** put us in

«uch an unhappy dilemma, such a fatal necessity r" But so 
great a racre did my scoffing and yet severe jest, put him 
into, that he was going to riy at me, and undoubtedly had 
attempted to kill me if he had been possessed of weapt>ns, 
and had not been prevented by three Spaniards. This un- 
paralleled aud vilianous carriage, made us seriously consider 
what was to be done. The two Englishmen and tlie Sj)a- 
niard, who had saved the poor Indian^s life, mightily peti- 
tioned me to hang one of them for an example to the others, 
which should be him that had twice attempted to commit 
oiurder with his hatchet, it being at that time thought im- 
possible the poor slave should recover. But they could 
never gain my consent to jmt him to death, for the reasons 
above-mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even your- 
self) who was my deliverer; and as merciful counsels are 
most prevailing when earnestly pressed, so 1 got them to be 
of the same opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them 
doing us any farther mischief, we all agreed, that they should 
have no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or shot, buc be 
expelled from the society, to live as they pleased by them- 
selves ; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the 
Spaniards, should have conversation tvith them upon any ac- 
count whatsoever ; that they should be kept from coming 
within a certain distance of our castle; and if they dared 
lo offer us any violence, either by spoiling, burning, killing, 
or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, feiues, 
or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as 
JVeely as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places 
we should find them. 

'' This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves ; 
when, like a merciful judge, I called out to the two honest 
Englishmen, sa>ir.gj ** You must consider they ouglit not lo 
be starved, neither; and since it will be some time beibre they 
can raise corn and cattle of'lheir own, let us give them some 
corn to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which 
time they'll raise some for themselves ; let us also bestow 
Upon them six milch goats, four he ones, and six kids, a§ 
■well for their present support, as for a further increase : 
with tools necessary for their work, as hatchets, an ax, saw, 
and other things convenient to budd them hut^ : all which 
were agreed : but before they look them into possession, I 
obliged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt any thing 
against us, or their countrymen, for the future. Thus di3» 



168 LIFE AND ADVENTBTRrSf 

Tnis&ing tfaem from our society, they went away, sullen and? 
refractory, as though neither willing to go nor stay ; how- 
ever seeing no remedy, they took what provision was givea- 
them, proposing to choose a convenient place where they 
might live by themselvesi 

"• About five days after, they came to those limits appoint- 
ed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by one of 
my Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched* 
their tenlSj and marked themselves out a habitation and 
plantation, at the N. E. and most remote part of the island,- 
.And, indeed, there they built themselves two very handsome 
cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the side of 
a mountain, with some trees already growing on three sides' 
of it ; so that planting a few more, it would be obscured fron>' 
sight, unless particularly sought for. When these huts wer«' 
finished, we gave them some dry goat skins for bedding- and- 
covering -and upon their giving us fuller assurances of their 
good behaviour for the future, we gave them some peas, bar- 
ley, and rice for sowing, and whatever tools we could spare» 

*^ Six months did they live in this separate condition, ia- 
which they got their tirst harvest in, the quantity of which 
was bat small, because' they had planted but little iandjfor^ 
indeed, all their plantations being to form, made it more 
difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their element ; 
and when they were obliged to make their boards and pots/- 
&c. they could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy 
season coming on, put them into a greater perplexity, for 
want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent it from 
spoiling : and so much did this humble them, that they beg- 
ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the good-natured - 
men readily consented, and in four days spaee, worked a- 
great hole in the side of the hill for them, large enough for 
their purpose, to secure their corn and other things from the 
rain, though not comparable to ours, which had several ad- 
ditional apartments. 

"But a new whim possessed these rogues about three 
quarters of a year after, which bad like to have ruined us, 
and themselves too ; for it seem.s, being tired and weary of 
this sort of living, -which made them work for themselves, . 
without hopes of changing their condition, nothing would 
serve the;n, but that tiiey would make a voyageto the con- 
tinent, and try if they could seize upon some of the savages^ 
and bring them over -as slaves, to do their drudgery, while 
they lived at ease and pleasure. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

** Indeed the project was not so preposterous, If they had 
Bot gone farther; bat they neither did, nor proposed any 
thing, but what had mischief in the design, or the event. — 
One morning, ihese^ three fellows came down to tl.e limited 
station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk, with us, 
which we readily granted; they told us, in short, that be- 
ing tired of their manner of living, and the labour of their 
hands in such employments, not being sufficient to procure 
the neces.^aries of life, they only desired one o{ the canoes 
we came over in, with some arms and amrannition for their 
defence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad, and 
never treuble us any more. To be sure, we were glad 
enough to get rid of such wretched plagues ; but yet 
honesty made us ingenuously represent to ihem, by what 
we ourselves had suffered, the certain destruction they were 
running into, either of being starved to death or murdered 
by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied, 
that they neither could nor would work ; and consequently 
that they might as w^ell be starved abroad as at home ; 
and as to their falling into the hands of the savages, why, if 
they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there was ^n 
end of them : neither had they any wives or children to cry 
alter them : nay, so intent were they upon their voyage, that 
if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but 
the canoe they would have gone without them. 

''Though w^e could not well spare our fire-arms, rather 
than they should go like naked men, we let them have two 
muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which weie 
thought very sutiicient ; we gave thera also goats' fiesh, a 
great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh butier, a 
young live kid, and a large canoe sullicient to carry twenty- 
men. And thus, with a mast made ofalongpoie, and a 
sail of six large goat-skins dried, having a fair breeze^, and 
flood-tide with thera, they merrily sailed away, the Spa- 
niards.caliing after them, Bon veyajoj no man ever expecting 
to see them more. 

" When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen 
would often say to one another, " O how peaceably do we 
♦' now live, since those turbulent fellows have left us !" — • 
Nothing could be farther from their thoughts than to behold 
their fdces any more ; and yet scarce two and twenty days 
had passed over their heads, but one of the Englishmer^ be- 
ing abrijad a planting, perceived, at a distance, three iuei^

well armed^ approaching towards him. Away he flles^ wUfe 
f.peed to our castle, and tells me ?nd the rest, that we were 
ail uncione, for that strangers were landed upon the island, 
and who they were he couid not tell ; but added^ that they 
were not savages, but men habited, bearing arms. Why 
ti^en^ said I, we have the less occasion to be concerned, 
snice, if they were not Indians, they must be friends ; for 1 
am sure there is no Christian people upon earth, but what 
Will do us good rather than harm. But while we were 
considering of the event, up came the three Englishmen^ 
^Tiose voices we quickly knew, and so all our admiration 
C'l that nature ceased at once. And our wonder was suc- 
ceeded by another sort of inquiry, which was^ what could 
be the occasion of their returning so quickJv to the island, 
^^hen we little expected, and much less desired, their com- 
pany? But as this was better fro be related by themselves, 
i ordered them to be brought in, when they gave rne the 
Jollovv'ing relation of their voyage. 

*' After two days sail, or something less, they reached 
,and, where they found the people roming to give thein 
another sort of reception than what they expected or desi- 
red ; for, as the savages were firmed with bows and arrows,, 
tiiey durst not venture on shore, but steered northwards, six. 
or seven hours, till they gained an opening, by wliich they 
plainly perceived, that the land that appeared from this 
place, was not the main land, but an island. At their en- 
trance into tlie opening of the sea, they di&covered another 
hia.p.d on the right band northward, and several more lying 
to the westward ; but being resolved to go- on shore some 
where or other, they put over to one of the western islands. 
Here they found the natives very courteous to them, giving 
them several roots and dried fish j nay, even their women, 
t-oo were willing to supply them with what they could 
precure them to eat, bringing it a great way to t-he'm upon 
their heads. Among those hospitable Indians the/, con- 
tinued some days, inquiring, by signs and tokens, what na- 
t-ions lay around them ; and were informed, that ther^ were 
several fierce and terrible people lived every, way, accus- 
tomed to eat mankind; but for themselves they never used 
such diet, except those that were taken in battle, and of 
tljem they made a solemn feast.

ago, pointing to the moon; and then two fingers; that, 
at this lime, their king liad two hundred prisoners, which 
Avere fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishineii 
A^'ere mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, Which the 
-others mistaking, thought that they wanted some of them 
for tiieir own food ; upon which they beckoned to them, 
pointing to the rising, a^id then to the setting of the sun; 
meaning, that by the time it appeared io the east next 
morning, they would bring them some; and indeed they 
were as good as their word ; for by that time they brought 
•eleven men and five women, just as so many cows and 
oxen are brought to sea-port towns, to victual a ship. But 
a» brutish as these Englishmen were, their stomachs turned 
at the sight. What to do in this case, they could not teJi : 
lo refuse the prisoners would have been the highest afl'ront 
offered to the savage gentry ; and to dispose of them, ihey 
inew not in what manner; however they resolved to ac- 
cept them, and ^o gave them, in return, one of (heir 
hatcliets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their 
bullets; things which, though they were wholly ignorant of, 
yet they seemed entirely contented with ; and'dr'^agging the 
poor v/reiches into the boat, with their hands bound behind 
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. But this obliged 
them to put off as soon as they had these presents, lest the 
donors should have expected two or three of them to be 
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next dav; and so 
taking leave with ail possible respect and thanks, thou<-h 
neither or them .understood what the ethers said, they sailSd 
away back to the first island, and there set eight of <he 
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage thev endeavoured to 
xromfort, and have some conversation with the poor cap- 
.tives ; but It was impossible to make them sensible of any 
Ahing; and nothing they could say or give, or dv; for them 
coula make them otherwise persuaded, but (hat they were 
unbound onJy to be devoured: if they gave them any 
food, they thought it was only to iatten ihera for the 
slaughter ; or looked at any one more particularly, the 
poor creature supposec itself to be the first sacrifice' and 
even when we brought them to our island, and be^an lo 
use theni With the greatest humanity and kindness, yet they 
expected every day that their new masters would devour 
tnera. 

"And thus. Sir, did these three strange wanderers con- 
clude their unaccountable relation of their voyage, which

vas bolb amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, I asked 
them, where their new family was? They told nie, they had' 
pui them into one of their huts, and they came lo beg some 
victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long to see 
them ; and taking Friday's father wilh us, leaving only two' 
at our castle, we came down to behold these poor creatures. 

'* When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again 
by the Englishmen, for fear of escaping) we found them 
stark naked, expecting their fatal tragedy ; they were 
three lusty men, well shaped, with straight and good limbs, 
between thirty and five and thirty years old ; and five wo- 
men, two of them might be from thirty to forty, two more' 
not above tour and twenty; and the last, a comely tali 
maiden of about seventeen, indeed, all the women were 
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except 
that they w'ere tawney, which their modest behaviour, and 
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards 
came to be clothed. 

'* This naked appearance, together wilh their miserable 
circumstances, was no very comfortable sight to m^ Spa- 
niards, who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without 
flattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest 
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be ; for 
they immediately ordered Friday's father to see if he knew 
any of them, or if he understood what they could say. 
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at 
them with great seriousness; yet as they were not of his 
ration, they were utter strangers to him, and none could 
understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was 
enough to answer his design, which was to assure tkem 
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of 
Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they 
were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such 
strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible 
for me lo describe. But the woman, their interpreter, was 
ordtired next to inquire, whether they ^were content lo be 
servants, and would work for the men who had brought 
.them hither to save their lives ? Hereupon, (being at this 
lime unbound,) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking 
this thing upon her shoulders, and the others that, intima- 
ting, that they were willing to do any thing for them. But 
now. Sir, having women amongst us, and dreading that 
it might occasion some strife, if not blood, I asked the three 



.^- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

tn«n what they would do, and how they intended to use 
these creatures,whether as servants or women ? One of them 
very pertly and readily answered, they would use thera as 
both. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own masters, I 
am not going to restrain you from that; but, methinks, for 
avoiding dissensions among you, I would only desire you to 
engage, that none of you will take more than one for a wo- 
man or wife, and that having taken this one, none else should 
presume to touch her; for though we have not a priestly 
authority to marry you, yet it is but reasonable, that who« 
ever thus takes a woman, should be obliged to maintain her, 
since nobody has any thing to- do with her^ and this, in- 
deed, appeared so just to all present, that it was unanimously 
agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, whe- 
ther they designed to take any of them ? but they all an- 
swered. No; some declaring they had already wives ia 
Spain; and others, that they cared not to join with infidels. 
On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a tem- 
porary wife, and so set up a new method of living. As ta 
Friday's father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants 
we had taken in the late battle, they all lived with me in. 
our ancient castle ; and indeed we supplied the main part 
of the island with food, as necessity required. But the most 
remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who 
liad been so much at variance, should agree about the choice 
of those women; yet they took a way good enough to pre- 
vent quarrelling among themselves. They set the live wo- 
men in one of their huts, and going themselves to the other, 
drew lots which should have the first choice. Now, he 
that had the first lot went to the htit, and fetched out her 
he chose ; and it is remarkable, that he took her that was 
the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the 
rest of the Englishmen exceedingly merry ; the Spaniards 
themselves could not but smile at it; but, as it happened, 
the fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for ap- 
plication and business 3 and, indeed, she proved the best 
'\i\fe of all the parcel. 

But when the poor creatures perceived themselves placed 
in a row^ and sej^arated one by one, they were again seized 
with an unspeakabis terror, as now thinking they were going 
to be slain in earnest; and when the Englishmen came to 
take the first, the rest set up a lamentable cry; clasped their

arms round her neck, and hanging about her, look their 
Jast farewell, as they thought, in such trembling agonies, 
and affectionate embraces, as would have softened the hard- 
est heart in the world, and made the driest eyes melt into 
tears ; nor could they be persuaded but that they were going 
to die, till such time as Friday's father made them sensible 
Ihat the Erglishnjen had chosen them for their wives, which 
ended all their terror and concern upon this occasion. 

" Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and, be- 
ing assisted by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours 
they erected every one of them a new hut or tent for their 
separate lodging, since those they had already were filled 
with tools, household stuff, and provision. They all con- 
tinued on the north shore of the island, but separate as be- 
fore • the three wicked ones pitched farther off, and the two 
honest men nearer our castle; so that the island seemed ta 
be peopled in three places, three towns beginning to be built 
for that purpose. And here 1 cannct but remark, what is 
ifeiy common, that ihe two honest men had the worst wives, 
(I inean as to industry, cleanliness, and ingenuity) while the 
three reprobates enjoyed women of contrary qualities. 

*' But another observation I made was, m favour ot the 
two honest men, to show what disparity there is between a 
diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a s.oth- 
fu), negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both ot 
them had the same parcel of ground laid out, and corn to 
sow sufficient for them; but both did not make the same 
improvements, either in their cultivation or their planting. 
The two honest men had a multitude ofyoung trees planted 
about their habitations, so that when you approached near, 
them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing and de- 
lightful. Every thing they did prospered and flourished; 
their grapes planted in order, seemed as though managed in 
a vineyard, and were infinitely preferable toany ot the others. 
Nor were they want;ng to find out a place ot retreat, but 
du^ a cave in the most retired part of a thick w«od, lo se- 
cure their w ives and children, with their provision and chiet- 
est goods, surrounded with innumerable stakes, and having 
a most subtle entrance, in case any mischief should happen, 
eitherfrom their ffllowcountrymen.or the devouring savages. 
'«.Aslo the reprobates, (though I must oao they were 
much more civilized than' before) instead ot adehghUul woot 
surrounding their dwUlirg^', we tound ihe words ol K.ing

Solomon too truly verified ; '' I went by the vineyard of the 
*' s'otbful, and it was all overgrown with thorns/' In many 
places their crop was ob^cured by weeds; the hedges having 
several gaps in them, the wild goals had got in, and eaten 
up the corn, and here and there was a dead bush to stop 
these gaps for the present, which was na more than shutting 
the stable door after the steed was stolen away. But as to 
their wives, they (as I observed before) were more diligent, 
and cleanly enough, especially in their victuals, being iri- 
structed by one of the honest men, who had been a cook's 
mate on board a ship: and very well it was so; for as he 
cooked himself, his companion and their families lived as 
well as the idle hasbands, who did nothing bat loiter about, 
fetch turtles' eggs, catch fish and birds, and do any thing but 
work, and lived accordingly; while the diligent lived very 
handsomely and plentifully, in the most comfortable manner. 

*' And now, Sir, 1 come to lay before your eyes a scene 
quite different from any thing that ever happened to us be- 
fore, and perhaps ever befel you in all the time of your 
r-esidence on this island. I shall inform you of its original 
in the following manner : 

*' One morning, Sir, very early, tlicre came five or six- 
canoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon' their old cus- 
tom of devouring their prisoners. All that we had to do 
upon such an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they, not 
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, after 
performing their b'oody execution : whoever first discovered 
the savageSj was to give notice to all the three plantations 
to keep within doors, and then a proper scout was to be 
placed to give intelligence of their departure. But, not- 
withstanding these wise measures, an unhappy disaster dis- 
covered us to the .ravages, which was like to have caused 
the desolation of the whole island ; for, after the savages 
were gone ofTin their canoes, some of mv Spaniards and I 
looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curiosity to see 
what they had been doing, to our great amazement beheld 
three savages fast asleep on the ground, who, either being 
gorged, could not awake when the other vveiu off, or having 
wandered too far into the woods, did not come back in time. 

*' What to do with them at first, we Cf^uld not tell ; as for 
slaves we had enough of them already; an! as to killing 
them, neither Christianity nor humanity would suffer us ta

shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong. We 
perceived they had no boat left them to transport them to 
their own nation ; and that, by letting them wander about, 
they might discover us, and inform the first savages that 
should happen to land upon the same bloody occasion, which 
informaiion might entirely ruin ns; and therefore I coun- 
selled my Spaniards to secure them, and set them about some 
work or other, till we could better dispose of them. 

'•' Hereupon «e all went back, and making them awake, 
to'^k them prisoners. It is impossible to express the horror 
they were in, especially when bound, as thinking they were 
going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon eased them of 
their fear as to that point. We first took them to the bower, 
where the chief of our country work lay, as keeping goats, 
planting corn, &c. and then carried them to the two Eng- 
lishmen's habitation, to help them in their busines; but 
happy it was for us all we did not carry them to our castle, 
as by the sequel will appear. The Englishmen, indeed, 
found them work to do; but whether they did not guard 
them strictly, of that they thought they could not better them- 
selves, I cannot tell ; but cerlainly one of them ran away into 
the woods^and they could not hear of him for a longtime after. 

** Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he got 
home in some of the caHoes, the savages returning in about 
four weeks time, and going oft' m the space of two days. 
You may be certain. Sir, this thought could not but terrify 
us exceedingly, andmakeus justly conclude, th?.t the savage 
would inform his countrymen of our abode in the island, 
how few and weak we were in comparison to their numbers;, 
and ue expected it would not be long before the English- 
men would be attacked in their habitations: but the savages 
had not seen their places cf safety in the woods, nor our 
c.isile, which it was a great happiness they did not know. 

** Nor were we mistaken in our thoughts upon this oc- 
casion ; for about eight months atler this, six canoes, with 
about ten men in each canoe, came sailing by the north-side 
of the island, which they were never accustomed to do before, 
and landed about an hour alter sun-rise, near a mile from the 
dwelling of the two Englishmen, who, it seems, had the 
good fortune to discover them about a league off: so that it 
was an hour before they could attain the shore, and some 
time longer before they could come at them. And now- 
being confirmed in this opinion that they were certainly

betrayed, they immediately bound the two slaves which w^ere 
left, causing two of the three men, whom they brought with 
the women, and who proved very faithful, to lead them with 
their wives, and other conveniences, into thej-r retired cave 
in the wood, and there to bind the two fellows hand and 
foot, till they had further orders. Then they opened their 
fences, where they kept their milch goats, and drove them 
all out, giving the goats libetty to ramble in the woods, to 
make the savages believe that they were w^ild ones; but the 
slave had given a truer information, which made them come 
to the very inclosures. The two frightened men sent the 
other slave of the three, who had been with them by acci- 
dent, to alarm the Spaniards, and desire their assistance; in 
the mean time they took their arms and ammunition, and 
made to the cave where they had sent tiieir wives, and se- 
curing their slaves, seated themselves in a private place,, 
fi'-om whence they might beholdall the actions of the savages. 
Nor had they gone far, when, ascending a rising ground, 
t^ey could ^ee a little army of Indians approach to their 
beautiful dwelling,, and in a few moments more, perceive 
the same, and their furniture, to their unspeakable grief,, 
burning in a consuming flame : and when this was done, 
they spread here and there, searching every bush and place 
for the people, of whom it was evident they had information.. 
Upon which, the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves - 
s-ecure where they stood,, retreated about half a mile higher 
in the country, rightly concluding, that the farther the: 
savages strolled, there wouldbe less numbers together t.apon 
which tbey next took their stand by the trunk of an old tree 
very hollow and large, whence they resolved, to see what 
■would ofler; but they had not stood long, there, before two 
savages came running directly towards them, as though 
having knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved. 
to attack them ; a. little farther were three more, and five 
more behind them again, alk running the same way.. It 
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were in at- 
this sight, thinking that if assistance did not speedily come,, 
their cave in the wood would be discovered, and consequently 
all therein lost; so they resolved to resist them there, and, 
when overpowered, to ascend to the top of the trees, where 
they might defend themselves as long as their ammunition 
lasted, and. sell their lives as dear as possible to those.

devouring savages. Thus fixed in their resolation, they 
next considered, whether tliey should fire at the first two, or 
wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the two first and the five last would be separated. In this 
regulation (he two savages also confirmed them, by turning 
a little to another part of the wood ; but the ihr^^, and the 
five after them, came directly towards the tree. Hereupon 
they pesolved to fake them in a direct line, as the}' approach- 
ed nearer, because, perhaps, the first shot might hit them all 
three; and upon this occasiow, the man who was to fire, 
charged his piece with three or four bullets. And thus 
wliiie they were waiting, the savages can>e on; one of them 
was the runaway, who had caused all the mischief; so they 
resolved he should not escape, if they both fired at once. 
But, however, though they did not fire together, they were 
ready charged ; when the first that let fiy, v^-as too good a 
marksman to miss his aim; for he killed the foremost out- 
right, the second (who was the runaway Indian j fell to the 
ground, being shot through the body, but not dead, and the 
third was a litile wounded rn the; shoulder, who, sitting 
down on the ground, fell a screaming in a most fearful man- 
ner. The noise of the guns, which not only made the most 
resounding echoes, from one side to the other, but raised 
the birds of all sorts, fluttering with the most confused noise> 
so much terrified the five savages behirud, that they stood 
still at first, like so many inanimate images. But when all 
things were in profound silence, they came to the place where 
their companions lay ; and here, not being sensible that 
they were liable to the same fate, stood over the wounded 
man, undoj^btedly inquiring the occasion of this calamity ; 
and 'tis as reasonable to suppose, he told them, that it came 
hy thunder and lightning from the gods, having never seen 
or heard of a gun before, in the whole course of their lives. 
By tfals time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces, 
tired both together a second time, when seeing them a!I fall 
immediately on the ground, they thought they had killed 
every creature of them. This made them come up boldly 
before they had charged their guns, which, indeed, was a 
wrong step ; for, when they came to the place, they found 
four alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not at 
all, which obliged them to fall upon them with their muskets; 
they first knocked the runaway savage on the head, and 
another that was but little wounded in the arm, and thea 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179 

put Ihe other languishing wretches out of their pain ; while 
he that was not hurt, with bended knees and uplift hands, 
made piteous moans and signs to them to spare his life ; 
ror, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch, but 
pointing to him to sit down at the root of a tree hard by ; and 
then, one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope-twine he 
had in his pocket, by mere chance, t) ing his feet fast to- 
gether, and his two hands behind him, they lelt him there, 
making all the haste they could after the other two, fearing 
they should find out t^eir cave ; but though they could not 
overtake them, they had the satisfaction to perceive them 
at a distance cross a valley towards the sea, a quite con- 
trary way to their retreat; upon w4iich they returned to the 
tree, to look after their prisoner; but when they came there 
he was gone, leaving the piece of rope-}arn, wherewith he 
was bound, behind him. 

" Well, now they were as much concerned as ever, as 
not knowing how near their enemies might be, or in what 
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to see if 
all was well there, and found every thing sale, except the 
women, who were frightened upon their husbands account, 
whom they now loved entirely. They had not been long 
here, before seven of my Spaniards came to assist them ; 
while the other ten, their servants, and Friday*s father, were 
gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in case the 
savages shcmld have rambled so far. There accompanied 
the seven Spaniards, one of the three savages that had for- 
merly been taken prisoner; and with them also that very 
Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little before, left under 
the tree ,• for it seems, they passed by that way where the 
slawghter was made, and so carried along with ihem that 
poor wretch that was left bound. But so man) prisoners 
row becoming a burden to us, and fearing the dreadful 
consequence of their escaping, most of the Spaniards and 
English urged the absolute necessity there was of killing 
them for our common preservation ; but. Sir, the authority 
I bore, as governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty ; and 
then I ordered them to be sent prisoners to the old cave in 
the valley, bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to 
guard them. 

" So much encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap- 
proach of the Spaniards, and so great were their fury against 
the savages for destroying their habitations, that they had 



180 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

rot patience to stay any longer ; but, taking five Spaniards 
along with them, armed with four muskets, a pistol, and a 
quarter staff, away they went in pursuit of their enemies. 
As they passed by the place where the savages were slain, 
it was very easy to be perceived that more of them had 
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies, 
but found it impracticable. From a rising ground, our party 
had the mortification to see the smoke that proceeded from 
the ruins; when, coming farther in sight of the shore> they 
plainly perceived that the savages had embarked in their 
canoes, and were putting out to sea. This they were very 
sorry for, there being no coming at them to give them a 
parting salute; but, however, they were glad enough to 
get clear of such unwelcome guests.^ 

" Thus the two honest, but unfortunate Epglishmen, be- 
ing ruined a second time, and their improvements quite de- 
stroyed, most of my good-natured Spaniards helped them to- 
rebuild, and we all assisted them with needTul supplies i nay, 
what is more remarkable, their three mischievous country.- 
men, when they heardof il, (which was after all these disasters 
were over, they living more remote eastward) very friendly, 
sympathized with them, and warked for them several da) s ; 
so that in a little their habitations were rtbailt, their necessities 
supplied, and themselves restored to tlieir former tranquillity.. 

"Though the savages had nothing to boast of in this ad- 
venture, (several canoes being driven, ashore, followed by 
two drowr.ed creatures, having undoubtedly met with a 
storm at sea, that very night they departed) yet it was natural 
to be supposed, that those whose better ibrtune it waste 
attain their native shore, would inllame their nation to- 
another ruinous attempt, with a greater force to carryall 
before them. And, indeed, so it happened : for about sevea 
roonth-i after, our island was invaded with a most formidable 
navy, no less than eight and twenty canoes full of savi^gcs, 
armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows and 
arrows, and such like instruments of war,. landing at the 
east end of the island. 

** You may well. Sir, imagine, what consternation, our 
men were in upon this account, and how speedy they were 
to execute their resolution, having only that night^s time 
allowed them. They knew, that since they could not with- 
stand their enemies, concealment was the only way to pro- 
cure their safety; and, therefore, they took down the huts. 



OP ROBrNSON CRUSOE. 181 

that were built for the two Englishmen, and dr©ve their 
flock of goats, together with their own at the bower, to the 
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of in- 
habitants as possible ; and then posted themselves, with all 
their force, at the plantation of the two men. As they ex- 
pected, so it happened ; for early the next morning, the 
Indians, leaving their canoes at the east-end of the island, 
came running along the shore, about two hundred and fifty 
in number, as near as could be guessed. Our army was but 
little indeed; and what was our greatest misfortune, we had 
not arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the men, 
Sir, is as follows: viz. 17 Spaniards, 5 Englishmen, old Fri- 
day, the three savages, taken with the five wom«n, who 
proved faithful servants, and three other slaves, living with 
the Spaniards. To arm these, they had 1 1 muskets, 5 pis- 
tols, 3 fowling-pieces, 2 swords, 3 old halberts, 5 muskets, 
or fowling-pieces, taken from the sailors vyhom you reduced. 
As to the slaves, we gave three of them halberts, and the 
other, three long staves, with great iron spikes at the end 
of them, with hatchets by their sides; we also had hatchets 
sticking in our girdles, besides the firearms; nay, two of 
the women, inspired with Amazonian fortitude, could not 
be dissuaded from fighting along with their dear husbands, 
and if they died, to die with ihem. Seeing their resolution, 
we gave them hatchets likewise ; but what pleased them 
best, were the bows and arrows (which they dexterously 
knew how to use) that the Indians had left behind them, 
after their menjorable battle one against another. 

*' Over this army, which, though little, was of great in« 
trepidity, I was constituted chief general and comaiander; 
and knowing Will Atkins, though exceedingly wicked, yet 
a man of invincible courage, i gave Him the power of com- 
manding under me ; he had six men, with their muskets 
loaded with six or seven bullets a piece, and were planted 
just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, 
having orders to let the first pass by ; and then, when he 
fired into the middle of them, make a nimble retreat round 
a part of the wood, and so come in the rear of the Spaniards, 
who were shaded by a thicket of trees: for, though the sa- 
vages came on with the fierceness of lions, yet they wanted 
the .sublilly of foxes, being out of all manner of order, and 
straggling in heaj)s every way; and, indeed, when Will 
Atkins, after ^fiy of the savages had passed by, had ordered 



182 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

three of hi'; men to give fire, so ^reat was their consterna- 
tion, lo see so many men kiUed and wcundedj and hear sucb 
a dreadful noise, and yet knew n.ot whence it came, that 
they were frightened to the highest degree ; and when the 
second volley was given, they concluded no less but that 
their companions were slain by thunder and lightning from 
Heaven. In this notioJi they would have continued, had 
WiJl Atkins and his men retired, as soon as they had fired, 
according to order; or had the rest been near them to poirr 
in their shot continually, there might have been a complete 
victory obtained ; but staying to load their pieces again, 
discovered the whole matter. They were ps^rceived by 
some of the scattering savages at a distance, who let fly their 
arrows among them, wounded Atkins himself, and killed his 
fellow Englishman, and one of the Indians taken with the 
women. Our party did not fail to answer them, and in their 
retreat killed about twenty savages. Here I cannot but 
take notice of our poor dying slave, who, though stopt from 
Jiis retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his staff and hatchet 
desperately and gallantly assaih. d his pursuers, and killeci 
five ef the savages before his life submitted to a multiplicity 
of wounds. Nor is the cruelty or malice of the Indians to 
be less remarked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of 
the two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden swords> 
after a most wretched manner. As Atkins retreated, our 
party advanced, to interpose between him and the savages: 
but, after three vollies, we were obliged to retreat also; 
for they were so numerous and elesperate, that they came 
up to our very teeth, shot their arrows like a cloud, aiid 
their wounded men, enraged with, cruel pain, fought like 
madmen. They did not, however, think fit to fellow us, but 
drawing themselves up in a circle, they gave two triumphant 
shouts in token of victory, though they had the grief to see 
several of their wounded men bleed to death before them. 
** Afterl had, Sir, drawn up my little army together, upon 
a rising ground, Atkins, wounded as he was, would have 
had us attack the whole body of the savages at once. I 
was extremely well pleased with the gallantry of the man : 
but, upon consideration, I replied, '• You perceive, Seig- 
" nior Atkins, how their wounded men figHt, let them 
** alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiff, and sore, 
*' and then we shall have fewer to combat with." To 
which Atkins, smiling, replied, " That's very true, Seig- 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

^ nlor, so Voall i two ; and that's the reason I would fight 
•** iheic now I am warm." We all answered, Soignior 
Atkins, for your part, you have behaved very gallantly ; and 
if you are not able to approach the enemy in the morning, 
we will fight for you, liU then wc think it convenient to 
wait, and so we tarried. 

*< By the brightness of the m.oon that night, we perceived 
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded 
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve to 
fall upon ihem in the night, if we could give them one vol- 
ley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do, 
by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between 
the woods^ and the -sea-side westward, and turning short 
south, came privately to a place where the thickest of them 
were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired among 
them, and did dreadful execution j and in half a minute 
after, eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abund- 
ance of them ; and then dividing ourselves into three bodies, 
eight persons in each body, we marched from among the 
trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, sending forth the 
greatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing a 
different noise from three quarters at once, stood in the 
utmost confusion; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley 
cf arrows, which woun-ded poor old Friday, yet happily it 
did not prove mortal. We did not, however, give them a 
second opportunity ; but rushing in among them, we fired 
three several ways, and then fell to work with our swords, 
staves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our maskets, with a 
fury not to be resisted; so that, with the most dismal scream^- 
ing and how ling, they had recourse to their feet, to save their 
Jives by a speedy flight. Nor must we forget the valour 
of the two women ; for they exposed themselves to the 
greatest dang^rrs, killed many with their arrows, and va- 
liantly destroyed several more with their hatchets. 

** In fighting these two battles, we were so much (ired, 
that wje did not then trouble ourselves to pursue them to 
their canoes, in which we thought they would juesently 
put to the ocean ; but there happening a dreadful storm at 
«ea, whichcontinuingall that night, itnotonly prevented their 
voyage, but dashed several of tht? ir boats to pieces against 
the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the shore, that it 
lequired infinite labour to get them otf. After our men had 
tsken soHie refreshment and a little repose, they resolved^^ 



^Si LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

early in the mornrng to go towards the place of their land- 
ing, and see whether they were gone off, or in what posture 
they remained. This necessarily led them to the place of 
battle, where several of the savages were expiring, a sight 
no way pleasing to generous minds, to delight in misery, 
though obliged to conquer them by the law df arms j but 
our own Indian slaves put them out of their pain, by de- 
spatching them with their hatckets. At length comiag in 
view of the remainder of the army, we found them leaning 
upon their knees, which were bended toward their mouth, 
and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming 
within musket-shot of them, I ordered two pieces to be fired 
without ball, in order to alarm them, that we might plainly 
know, whether they had the courage to venture another 
battle, or were utterly dispirited from such an attempt, that ; 
so we might accordingly manage them. And, indeed, the 
project took very well; for, no sooner did the savages hear 
the first gun, and perceive the flash of the second, but they 
suddenly started upon their feet, in the greatest conster- 
nation; and when we approached towards them, they ran 
howling and screaming away up the hill into the country. 

'* We could rather, at first, have wished that the weather 
had permitted them to have gone off to the sea; but when 
we consider that their escape might occasion the approach 
of multitudes, to our uttsr ruin and desolation, we were 
very well pleased the contrary happened: WiU Atkins 
(who, though wounded, would not part from us all this while) 
advised us not t© let slip this advantage, but clapping be- 
tween them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity 
of ever returning to plague the island : " I know,*' said he, 
«' there is but one objection you can make, which is, that 
" these creatures living like beasts in the wood, may make 
*' excursions, rifle the plantations, and destroy the tame 
"goats; but then, consider, we had better to do with an 
" hundred men, whom we can kill, or make slaves of at 
*Meisure, than with an hundred nations, whom it is im- 
*< possible we should save ourselves from, much less sub- 
•' due." This advice, and these arguments being approved 
of, we set fire to their boats; and though they were so wet 
that we could not burn them entirely, yet we made them 
incapable of swimming in the seas. As soon as the Indians 
perceived what we were doing, many of them ran out of the 
woods, in sight of us, and kneeling down, piteously cried out, 



OF ROBINSON CF. USOE. 18.0 

Oa, Oil, JVaramaha. Intimating, I suppose, thai, if we would 
but spare their canoes, they would never trouble us again. 

"But all their compljints, submissions, and entreaties, 
were in vain ; tor self-jireservation obliging us to the con- 
trary, we desiroyed every one of them that had esciped the 
hiry of the ocean. When the Indians perceivel this, tiiev 
raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods, where thev 
conlinued ranging about, making the woods ring with their 
lamentations. Here we should have considered, that making 
these creatures tiius desperate, we ought, at the same lime' 
lo have set a sufficient guar 1 upon tiie plantations : for the 
savages, in their ranging about, found out ihe bower, de- 
stroyed the fences, trode ih^ corn down under their feet, and 
tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, we were always 
able to tight these creatures; but as they were too swift tor 
us, and very numerous, we durst njt go out single, fwr fear 
of them; though that too was needless, they having no 
weapons, nor any materials to make them : and indeed, 
iheir extremity appeared in a Jittle time after. 

*' Though the savages, as already mentioned, had de- 
stroyed our bowtr, and all our corn, graf.-es, &c. yet we 
-had still left our stock of cattle in the valley, by the cave 
\^iih some little corn that grew there, and the jdantation of 
VVdl Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed 
iy an arrow^ they w^re now reduced to two : it is remark- 
able that this was ihe fellow v. ho cut the poor Indian with 
his hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my coun- 
4rymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so low, v/a 
xame to the resolution to drive tlie savages up to the farther 
}-art of the island, where no Indians landed; to kill as manv 
"of them as we could, till we had reduced their number; and 
then to give the remainder some corn to plant, and to teach 
them how to live by their daily labour. Accordingly we 
■pursued them with our guns at the hearing of which they 
were so terrified, that they would fall to the ground.— 
Every day we killed and wo"^unded some of them, and many 
were found starved to death, so that our hearts began to ro- 
lent at the sight of such miserable objects. At last, with 
great difficulty, taking one of them alive, and using him 
with kindness, and tenderness, we brought him to old Fri- 
day, -who talked to him, and told hina how good we would 
be to them all, giving them corn and land to pUnt and live 
n, and present nourishment, provided they should keep

vtithln such bounds as should be allotted Ihem, and not do 
prejudice (o others: ** Go then/' said he, '-and inform 
'* your countrymen of this ; whicli- if they will not agree to, 
'* every one of them shall be slain,'* 

*' The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being reduced 
to about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted ihe offer, and earn- 
estly begged for food; hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards 
■and two Englishmen, well armed, together with old Friday, 
and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large quant iiy 
of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats; and the 
poor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side of the 
hill, they ate the victuals very thankt^ully, and have proved 
faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their bounds, 
where at this day ihey quietly and happily remain, and 
where we now and then visit them. They are confined to 
a neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or 
four in length, on the south-east corner of tlKi island, the 
sea being before, and lofty mountains behind them, free 
from the^ppearance of panoes; and indeed their country- 
men never made any inquiry after them. We gave them 
twelve hatchets, and three or tour knives; have taught 
them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant c©rn, make 
bread, breed tame goats and miik them, as likewise to make 
wicker-work, >n wJiich, I jnust ingeauous.ly confess, they 
infinitciy outdo us, having made themselves several pretty 
necessaries and fancies, as baskets, sieves, birdcages, and

than delightful; and now 4:hey live the most innocent and 
inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued in the world,

less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who 
heard it : nor were liiese people less pleased with those 
necessary utensils thai I brought them, such as the knives, 
scissors, spades, siiovels, and pick-axes, with which ihcy 
now adorned their habitat ions. 

So much had they addicted themselves to \\ icker-vvork^ 
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted tliem, 
that when I viewed the Englishmen's coiopies, they seemed 
at a distance as though tijcy had lived like bees in a hive ^ 
fur Will Atkins, who has now become a very industrious 
and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work 
round the outside; the walls were worked in an a basket, 
in pannels or strong sqvaresr ot thirty-two in number, stand- 
ing about seven feet high: in the middle was another, nor. 
above t went) -two paces round, but much stronger built,- 
being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood 
eight strong posts, round the lop of which he laid strong, 
pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which he raised a. 
pyramid \ot the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined 
T'erv wtli together with iron spikes, which he made him- 
self; lor iie had made him a forge, with a pair of- wooden 
bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil (Xit ot' 
one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner 
would he make himself hooks, staples, sj^ikes, bolts, and 
hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermc^i tent, 
he made it so firm between the rafters with basket-work,- 
thalchmg that over again with rice-straw, ?.nd over that a 
Targe leaf of a tree, that his hou-^e was as dry as if it had 
been tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a 
Jean-io, quite round this inner apartment, laying long rafters 
from the thirty-two angk-s to the lop posts of the ir;:.er 
house, about twenty feet distant, so thai there was a sjjact/ 
like a wall between the (»uter and inner wali, n-ar twenty 
feet in breadth. The inner place he pariiti oned off wit'n 
the sauie wicker-work, dividing it into six ne^it apartments, 
every one of which had a door, firstf into the cfttry of ihe

passage directly to the door of the mntr-house ; on either 
side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which yo j got-

and ihrough that into another ofa smaller length ; so (hat m 
the outer circ'c wero ten handsome rooms, six of which 
were only to k- come at through the apartments of the in- 
T-.er tent, serving as retiring rooms tt) the respective cham- 
bers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which 
went in through one anolher, two on either hand of the 
passages that led throng!) the outer door fo the inner tent. — 
in short notliing could bt* built more ingei iousiy, kept more 
r;e'jt, or have better conveniences; an. I here lived the 
three families, Will Atkins, hi/ companion, their wives and 
children, and the widow of iht dccessed. As to religion, 
the men seldom taught (heir wives the knowledge of God, 
any more than ihe sailors* custom of swearing by his name. 
Ine gTtratest improvemeiit their wives hc)d, was, ihey 
taught ihem to speak Eng!i^h, so as to be understood. 

None oi their ch-Klrcn were then above six years old ; 
they were all fruitful enough, and I think the cook's Biate's 
wife was big of her sixth child. 

When 1 inquired of the Spaniards about their circum- 
stances while amoj\g the savages, (hey (oM me, that they 
abandoned (hemselves to despair, reckoning themselves a 
poor aiid misviable pecpic, that had no means put into iheir 
hand-, and consequently must soon be starved to death.— 
They owned, howtver, that they were ifi the wrong to think 
so, and for refusing the assistance that reason cti'^;red for 
their support, as weil as future deliverance, confessing (hat 
grit'fwas a most insignificant passion, as it looked uj)on 
things as with(;ut remedy, and having no hope of things to 
come; all which verified this noted proverb, 

In trouh'e fo be troMbled,

Nor did these remarks end here ; for, making observa- 
tions Hpon my iniprovemei^.t, and on my condition at first, 
iniinitely wrrse than thtirs, he told me, that Englishmen 
hatf, in (heir, distress, greater presence of mind than those 
rt'any other counfry that he Ivid met with; and that they 
and the Fortugues^^ were the \v<!rs'. mt n in the world to^. 
struggle under misf^Mtuncs. When ihey landed among the,| 
savages, ihey found bui little provision, except they would'^ 
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs with 
Utile substance in them, and of vvl^icU the natives gave theui

but very sparingly. Many were the wavr, they took to 
civilize and leach the savages, bat in vain ; for they wonld 
not own them to be their instructers, whose lives were ow- 
ing to their bounty. Th?ir extremities were very great-, 
being many davs entirely without food, the savages ihcre 
being more indolent arvd less devouring than those ul.o 
bad better supplies. When they went out lo battle, they 
were obliged to assist these people, in one of which my 
faithful S.aniard being taken, had like to have been de- 
voured. They had lost iheir ammunition, which rendered 
their fire-arms useless: nor could they use the bows and 
arrows that were given them, so that while the armies were 
at a distal ce they had no chance, but when close, then they 
could be of service with halberts, and sharpened sticks put 
into the nmzzlcs of their muf^kets. They raaoe themselves 
targets of wood, covered with ihe skins of wild beasts; and 
■when one happened to be ki;ucked down, the rest of the 
company fought over him tih he recovered :. and then stand- 
ing close in a line, they would make- their way tlirough a 
thousand savages. At the return of their friends, who they 
thought had been entombed in the bowels of their enemies, 
their joy w^as- inconceivable. Nor were they less surprised 
at the sight of the loaves of bread I had sent ihera, things,, 
that they had not seen for several years, at the same time 
ciossing and blessing it, as though it was manna sent from 
Heaven : but when they knew the errand, and perceived 
the boat which was to carry them to the person and place 
from v^'hence such relief came, this struck- them w ilh such 
a- surprise of joy as made- some of them faint away, and 
others burst out into tears. 

This was the summary account that I had from thera. — 
I shall now inform the reader what 1 next did for them, an J 
in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion 
that as (he savages would scarce troiji>le them any more, so 
we had no apprehensions on that score. I told them 1 was 
come purely, to establish, and not to remove them; and 
upon that occasion, had not only brought them necessaries 
for convHjnience and defence, but also artificers, and other 
persons, both for their necessary employments, and to add 
to their number. They were all togettier when I thus talked 
to them : and before I delivered to them the stores I brought, 
I- asked them one by one,, if il)ey had entifely forgot theit^

first animosities, would engage in (he strictest friendship, 
and shake hands with one another? On this Will Atkins, 
with abundance of good humour, said, ihey had aiTiictions 
enougli to make thera all sober, and enemies enough to 
make them all frien.is : as ti-.r himself, he would live and 
die among them, owning tkat what the Spaniards had done 
lo him, his own mad humour had made necessary i'or them 
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occasion to justify tiieir pro- 
ceedings fo me: but they (old me, that since Will Aikirrs 
had behaved himself so valiantly in fight, and at o(her times 
showed such a regard to the common interest of thera all, 
xb.ey had not only forgotten all that was past, but thougbt 
he ought as mach to he trusted with arms and necessaries 
•as any ot them, which they testified by making him next in 
command to the governor: and they most heartily embraced 
the occasion of giving me (his solemn asssurance, that they 
would never separate their interest again as long as they lived. 
After these kind declarations oF Friendship, we appointed 
all of us (o dine together the next day • upon this I caused 
the ship's cook arcd his mate to come on shore for that pur- 
pose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought from 
ihe jhip six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together with 
our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and in particular I 
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of English 
beer, which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniard.-i 
added to our feast five who'e kid';, which beitig roasted,, 
three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sailors on board, 
and the other two we eat ourselves. After our merry and 
innocent feast was over, I began to distribute my cargo 
among thera. First, I gave tiiem linen sufficient to make 
^^'ery one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard's request 
made thera up six. The thin English stuffs i allotted to 
make every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to the 
climate, and left them such a quantity as to make more upon 
their decay; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and stockings. It 
is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfaction which s^at 
upon the countenances of these poor men, when they per- 
ceived v^hat care I took of them, as if I had been a common, 
father to them all ; and they all engaged never to leave the^ 
island, till I gave my consent for their departure. 1 then': 
presented to them the people 1 brought, viz, the tailor^j 
smith, and the two carpenters ; but my Jack-of-all-Trades 
was the most acceptable present 1 could make them. Mj 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 ■) I 

(aibr fell inimecllalely to work, and made every one of them 
a shirt; after which, he leaYned the women how to sew and 
stitch, thereby to become the more helpful to their hu-ibands. 
Neither were the carpenters 1-ess useful^ taking in pieces their 
clumsy things; instead of which thev made convenient and 
handsome tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, Icckers, and 
shelves. But when 1 carried them to see Will Atkins'x 
basket-house, they owned they never saw such a piece of 
natural ingenuity before : " I am sure/^ said one of the car« 
penters, ^* the man that built this has no need of us ; you 
" need, Sir, do nothing but give him tools '* 

I divided the tools among them in this manner r to every 
man I gave a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as havinj^ 
no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate place a pick- 
av, a crow, a broad ax, and a saw, w ith a store for a general 
supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left them also 
nails, staples, hinges,, hammers, chissels, knives, scissors, and 
all, sorts of tools and iron work; and lor the use of the 
smith, gave them three tons of unvvrought iron, for a sup- 
ply ; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored them even to 
profusion; or, at k-ast, to equip a sufficient little army 
against all opposers whatsoever.. 

The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved 
to death) together with the maid, a pious and well educated 
young woman, seeing things so well ordered on shore, (for 
i made them accompany me,) and considering they had no 
occasion to go so far a voyage as to the East- Indies, they 
both desired of me, that f would leave them there, and 
enter them among my subjects. This 1 readily agreed to, 
ordering ihem a plat of ground, on which were three little 
houses erected, environed with basket-work, palHsadoed 
iike Alkins*s, and adjoining to his plantation. So contrived 
were their tents, that each of them had a room apart to 
lodge in, while their middle tent was not only their store- 
house, but their place for eating and drinking. At this 
time the two Englishmen removed iheir habitation lo their 
former place ; so that now the island was divided it.to three 
colonies: first, Those I have just now mentioned ; secondly. 
That of Will Atkins, where there were four- families of 
Englishmen, with their wives and children, the widow and 
her children; the young man and the m.aid, who, by the 
way, we made a wife of before our departure ; three sa- 
vages, who were slaves; the tailor, smith, (who served also 



192 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

asa gunsmith,) and my olher celebrated person calfed Jack- 
of-all-Trades: Thirdly, My chief colony, which consisted of 
the Spaniards with Oid Friday, who still rtmained at my 
old habitation, which was my capital city ; and surely never 
•was theie such a metropolis, it being now hid in so obscure 
a grove, that a thousand men might have ranged the island 
a month, and looked purposely for it, without being able ta 
find it, (hough the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries, 
both without and within, in a most surprising manner. 

But now I ihi^^k it high lime tospeak of the voung Frencb 
priest, of the order olSt. Benedict, whosejudiciousand pious 
discourses, upon sundry occasions, merit an extraardinary 
observation; nor can his being a French P.ipist prie«t, 1 pre- 
sume, give offence to any cii" my readers, when they have 
this assurance from me, that he was a person of a most 
courteous disposition, extensive charity, and exalted piety. 
His arguments were always agreeable to reason, and his- 
conversation the most acceptable of any person that I had 
ever yet met with in my life. 

*• Sir,'* said he, to me, one day, " since, under God,"' 
at the same time crossing his breast, *'yoa have not only 
"saved my lifej bul by permitting me to go this voyage,. 
♦' have granted me the happiness of free conversation, i 
^ think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, to save 
** what sods I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of 
*' some catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation; and sinee 
** these people are under your immediate government, in 
"gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you have done 
"for me, 1 shall offer no farther points in religion, than. 
♦* what merit your approbation.** Being pleased with the 
modesty of his carriage, 1 told him he should not be worse 
used for being of a different persuas^ion, if upon th.at very 
account we did not differ in points of faith, not decent in 
a part of the country where the poor Indians ought to be 
instructed in the kno\vte4^e of the true God, and his Son 
Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation might 
easily be separated from disputes; that he would discourse 
with me rather as a gentleman than on religion : but that, 
if ue did eiiter uj)on religious arguments> upon my desiring 
(he same, I would give him liberty to defend. his own prin- 
ciples He farther added, that he would do aU that became 
him in his office, as a priest as well as a Christian, to pro- 
cure the happiness of all that were in the ship : that thpugh-

he cruld n'^t pray vvltli, he wouM pray for us on ail occa- 
sions ; and then ho* (old me several extraordinary events of 
his life, within a levy jears past; but particularly in this 
lasf, which was the most remarkable : 'hat in this voyage, 
he had themisfortune to be five times shipptd and unshipped : 
his first de^ign was to have j^one to Martinico; for which 
takintr ship al Si. Ma'oes, he was forced into Lisbon by bad 
weather, the vessel running a-gr<iund in the mouth of the 
Tagus ; that frwm thei.ce he went on board a Ptrluguese 
ship, bound to the Madtiras, whose master being but an in- 
diftVrent mariner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove 
to Fia', where selling thelrccmmodity, wh'ch was corn, they 
resolved to lake in their loading at the isle of May, and to 
sail to Newfoundland ; at the Banks of which, meeting a 
French ship bound U> Quebec, in the river of Canaaa, and 
from thence to Mariinico, in this ship he embarke.! ; the 
master of which dying at Quebec, that voyage was sus- 
pended; and lastly shipped himself for France, this last 
ship was destroyed bv fire, as before has been related. 

At this time we talked no further; but another morning 
he comes to me, just as 1 was going to visit the English- 
men's colony, and tells me, that as he knew the prosperity 
of the island was my principal desire, he had soa^.ething to 
communicate agreeable to my design, by which perhaps he 
might put if, more than he yet thought it was, in the way 
of the benediction of Heaven. ** How, Sir!" said 1, in a 
surprise, " are we not yet in the vv^ay of God's blessings, 
after all these signal providences and deliverances, of which 
you have had such an ample relation?" He replied, "1 hope,, 
Sir, you are in the way, and that your good design will 
prosper: but still there are some among you that a:e not 
equally right in theif actions; and remember, I beseech 
you, Sir, that Achan, by his crime, removed God's blessing 
from the camp of the children of Israel; that thr-u^h six 
and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became the ob- 
jects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of his punish- 
ment accordingfy." 

"So sensibly was f touched with this discourse, and so sa- 
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his soul, that I 
desired him to accompany me lo the Englishmen's planta- 
tions, which he was very glad of, by reason they were the 
subject of what he designed to discourse with me a^^out : 
and while v\e walked on together, he began in the follow- 
ing manner : 



1^4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

** Sir, said he, I must confess it as a jg^reaf unhappiness 
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion ; but 
surelv both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God, 
\vho having given us some stated rules for our service and 
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend 
him ; either by neglecting what he has commanJed, or by- 
doing what he has forbidden. This tr;iilh every Christian 
owns, that when any oiie presumptuously sins against God's 
command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from 
him ; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent 
such neg'ect of, or sin ag:^inst, God and his comnaands. I 
thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concern 
for us, and desired him to explain the particulars of v\hat 
he had observ-ci, that according to the parable of Achan, I 
** might remove that accursed I hi ng from among us," Why 
then, Sir, said te, in (he first pl.ice, you have four English- 
roen, who have taken savage women to iheir wives, by 
whom they have several children, though none of them are 
legally married, as the law of God and man requires; they^ 
1 say, Sir, are no less than aduUerers, and as they still live 
in adultery, are liable to the curse of Goi], I know, Sir, 
you may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of any 
kind; as also, pen, ink, and paper, to write down a con- 
tract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But 
reilher I his, nor what the Spar.ish governor has told you of 
their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor 
any more than an agreem.ent to keep them from e}uarrelling 
among themselves : for, Sir, the essence or sacrament of 
matrimony (^o he cal'ed it) not only consists in mutual con- 
sent, but in the legal obligation which com]iels them \o 
own and acknowledge one another, to abstain from othei* 
person >, the men to provide for iheir wives and children>^ 
and the wometi to the same and like conditions, mutatis mu^ 
iandis^ on their side: whereas, Sir, these men,, upon their 
own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those women, 
and marry others,, and by disowning their children, fUlTer 
them utterly to j)erish " "Now, Sir,'* added lie, "can 
God be honoured in such an unlawful liberty as ttus? how 
can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if men are 
allowed to live in so licentious a way \^ T was inoeed struck 
with the thing m)self, and thought that they were much to 
blame, that no formal contract had been made, though it 
had been but breaking a stick between them, to engage'

ihera lo live as and man wife, never to separate, bat lore, 
cherish, and comfort one another all iheir lives.'" " Yet, 
Sir," said I, *' whenUu^' took these women, I was not here, 
zm\ if it is adultery, it is past my remedy, and I cannot help 
it.^ *' True, Sir,'' answered the \0un5 priest, •' you can- 
not be charged with that part of the crime which was done 
in your absence : bat 1 beseech you don't flatter yourself, 
that you are under no obligalion now to pul a period to it : 
which if yOu neglect (o do. ike guilt will be entirely on you 
alone, since it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to 
alter their condition/' I must confess, 1 wns so dull, that I 
thought he meant I should part them, and knowing that 
this would put the whole island into confusion, 1 told him 1 
could not consent to it upon any account whatsoever. " Sir,*' 
said he, in great surprise, *' X do not mean that you should 
separate, bui marry them, by a written contract, signed by 
both man and woman, and by all the witnesses present, 
which all the European laws decree to be of sufficient ef- 
ficacy." Amazed with such true pie:y and sincerity, and 
x^onsidering the validity ofa written contract,! acknowledged 
all that he said to be very just and kind^ and that I would 
discourse with the men about it; neither could I see what 
reason they could have not to let him marj-y them, whose 
authority in ^hat afi'air is owned to be as authentic as if they 
.were married by any of our clergymen in England. 

Tlie .next complaint he had tx) make to me was this, that 
though these English subjects of mine have lived with these 
women seven years, and though ibey were of good under- 
i;tanding, and capable of instruction, having learned not 
only to speak, but to read English, yet all this while they 
;had never taught them any thing of the Christian religion, 
.or the knowledge of God, much less irii what manner he 
ought to be served. And is not this an unaccountable 
jieglectr" said he warmly " Depend upon it, God Al- 
mighty will call them to account tor such contempt. And 
though 1 am noi of }oar jeligion, yet I should be glad tt> 
.see these people released from the De-viPs powder, and be 
saved by the pri:u:ipJes of the Christian religion, the know^ 
ledge of God, of a Redeemer, the resurrection, and of a 
future state. JBut as it is not too late, if you please to give 
Die leave to- instruct them, I doubt not but 1 shall supply 
this great defect, by bringing them into t^e ^reat circle of 
Chrisiianily, even while you continue in the island. 



196 LIFE AND ADVENTCRES 

I could hold no longer, but embracing liim, tuld him,' 
with a thousand ihanks, I would grant whatever he request 
ed, and desired him to proceed in the third article, vshich 
be did in the following manner: 

*^ Sir/' said he, '• it should be a maxim among all Christ- 
ians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propagated 
b_y ail possible means, and an all occasions. Upon this 
account our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and 
China, men who «ire willing to die for the sake ot God and 
the Christian faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the 
way of salvatiou. Now, Sir, as here is an opportunity to 
convert seven and thirty poor savages, I wonder iiow you 
can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is really 
worth (he expense of a man's wiiole life." 

I must confess I was so confounded at tliis discourse, (hat 
I could not toll how to answer him. ''*Sir," said he, seeing 
me in disorder, "' I shall be very sorry if I have given you 
offence.*' '^ No, Sir,** said I, " 1 am rather confounded ; 
and you know my circumstances, th.at being bound to the 
East-Indies in a merchant ship, 1 cannot wrong the owners 
fo much, as to detain the ship here, the men laying at vie- ■ 
tuals and wages on their account. If I stay above twelve 
days, I must pay 3/. sterling /i^r diem demurrage, nor must ' 
the ship stop above eight days more; so that i am anable 
to engage in this work, unless I would leave the sliip, and ' 
be reduced to my former condition.*' The priest, though 
he ovvnexi this was hard upon me, yet laid it to my con- 
science, whetlrer the blessing ol saving seven and thirty; 
souls v^-as not worth venturing all that I had in the world }' 
^' Sir,'' said I, *' it is very true : but as you are an ecclesicts. 
lie, it naturally falls into your pr^">fession ; why, therefore, 
don't you rather offer to undert;<ke it yourself, than press 
me to il.'*' upon this he turned about, making a very low 
bow, ** I most humbly thank God and you, Sir, (said he) 
for so blessed a caii; and most wilijngly undertake so glo- 
rious an ofhce, which wili sufficiently compenwite ail the 
liazards and difficulties I have gone through in a long and 
uncomfortable voyage.** 

While he was thus speaking, I coisld discover n rapture 
in his face, by his colour gosng and coming; at the same 
time his eyes sparkled like fire, aai all the signs of the; 
most zealous transports. And when I asked whether hel 
was in earnest ? " Sir/* said he., " it was to preach to th« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 197 

Indians I consented to come along with you ; these infidels, 
even in this Jiltle Island, are infinitely of more worth than 
my poor life: if so that 1 should prove the happy instrument 
of saving these poor creatures' souls, I care not if 1 never 
see my native country again. One thing I only beg of you 
more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to be my 
interpreter, without whose assistance neither of us will 
understand each other." 

This request very sensibly troubled me : first upon Fri- 
day's being bred a Protestant ; and, secondly, for the af- 
fection I bore to him for his fidelity: But immediately th* 
remembrance of Friday's father coming into my head, I rcr 
commended him to hira as having learned Spanish, which 
the priest also understood j and so was thoroughly satisfied 
with him. 

When we came to the Englishmen, after I had told them 
what necessary things 1 had done for them, I talked to them 
of the scandalous life they led ; told them what notice the 
clergyman had taken of it, and asked them if they were 
married men or bachelors? They answered, two of them 
were widowers, and the other three single men. But said 
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by 
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully 
married ? They all said, that they took them before the 
Governor, as such, having nobody else to marry them, which 
they thought as legal, as if they had had a parson. No 
doubt, said I, but in the eye of God it is so : but unless I 
am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these poor 
creatures, 1 can do nothing more for you, neither can you 
expect God's blessing while you live in such an open course 
of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who spoke for the rest, 
told me, that they believed their wives the most innocent 
and virtuous creatures in the world; that they would never 
forsake them while they had breath; and that, if there was 
a clergyman in the ship, they would be married to them 
%Vith all their hearts. I told you before, said I, that I have 
a minister with me, who shall marry you to-morrow morn- 
ing, if you are willing; so I would have you consult to- 
night with the rest about it. I told him the clergyman was 
a Frenchman, and knew not a w^ord of English, but that I 
would act as clerk between them. And indeed this busi- 
neys met with such speedy success, that they all told me. 



198 ilFE AND ADVENTURES 

in a few minutes after, that they were ready to be formaHj 
xnarried, as soon as I pleased; with which informing thej 
priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced. 

Nothing now remained, but that the women should hi 
made sensible of the meaning of the thing ; with which be- 
ing well satisfied, they, with their husbands, attended at my 
apartment the next morning; there was my priest, habited 
in a black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round 
it, much resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter. 
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he 
made of marrying the women who were not baptized, gave 
Ihem an exceeding reverence for his person : nor, indeed, 
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to 
discourse both with the men and women, and then he told 
ihem, That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the 
sense of the laws of society, they had lived in open adultery,' 
which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or final 
separation, could put an end to; and even herewasadiffi- 
culty with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, ii 
marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater, ur 
baptized ; but yet there was time enough to-nnake thei 
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could b 
done ; that, besides, he believed tliey were very indifferent 
Christians: and consequently had not discoursed with their) 
Avives upon that subject; and that unless they promised 
him to do so, he could not marry them, as being expressly 
forbidden by the laws of God. , »., 

AH this they had heard attentively, and owned readily. 

"But, Lord, Sir," said Will Atkins to me, ** how should 

we teach them religion, who know nothing of it ourselves? 

How can we talk to our wives of God, Jesus Christ, hea^ 

ven and hell > why they weuld only laugh at us, who neveC 

vet have practised religion, but on the contrary all manne* 

' of wickedness." '' Will Atkins,'' said I, ** cannot you tell 

your wife she is in the wrong, and that her gods are idols, 

which can neither speak nor understand; but that our God, 

who has made, can destroy all things; that he rewards lb€ 

good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us tC 

iudement: cannot you tell her these things?" " That f 

true," said Will Atkins, '' but then she'll tell me it is utterlj 

false since I am not punished and sent to the devil, whc

ance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and 
qualify him to preach on the mercy and long-suffering of a 
mercilul Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and 
even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will lead 
him (o the doctrine of the resurrection, and will make hiin 
an excellent preacher to his wife." I repeated this to Atkins, 
who being more than ordinarily affected with it, replied, 
" I know all this, Sir, and a great deal more ; but how can 
I have the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when my 
conscience witnesses against me?" '* Alas!'-* said he (witn 
tears in his eyes, and giving a great sigh) " as for repenting, 
that is for ever past me/' *' Past you! Atkins," said I, 
♦' what do you mean?" " You know well enough," said he, 
*' what I mean ; I mean it is too late." 
. When I told the priest what he said, the poor affectionate 
man could not refrain from weeping; but recovering 
himself, *' Pray, Sir," said he, *' ask him if he is contented 
that it is too late ; or is he concerned, and wishes it were 
not so?" This question I put fairly to Atkins, who repliecl 
in a passion, *' How can I be easy in a state which I know 
must terminate in my ruin? for I really believe, some tim?: 
or other, I shall cut my throat, to put a period both to my 
life, and to the terrors of my conscience.*' 

At this the clergyman shook his head : "Sir,-" said Jie, 
*' pray tell him it is not too late ; Christ will give him re- 
pentance, if he has recourse to the merit of his passion.— 
Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy ? 
There may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no 
longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this 
world." I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who 
then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we dis- 
coursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in reli- 
gious matters: yet all of them promised to do their endea- 
vours to make their wives turn Christians: and upon which 
promises the priest married the three couple. But as At- 
kins was the only sincere convert, and of more sense thaa 
the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him : 
" Sir," saTd he, ^' let us walk out of this labyrinth, and I 
dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife 
already.-" And indeed we found it true; for coming to the 
edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife 
sitting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse;

he pointed to Ihe sun, to the quarters of the eartli, tohlmseTfji 
to her, the woods, and the (rees. Immediately we could 
perceive liim start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, 
and lift up both his hands ; at which the tears ran down my 
clergyman's cheeks: but our great misfortune was, we 
could not hear one word that passed between them. Ano- 
ther time he would embrace her, wiping the tears fro"hi her 
eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both 
kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of 
joy did this occasion in my young priest, that he could 
scarcely contain himself: And a little after this we observed 
by her motion, as fre^^uently lifting up her hands, and laying 
them on her breasf, that she was mightily ailected with - 
his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight. 

When we came back we found them both waiting to be 
railed in ; upon which we agreed to examine him alone, and 
sol began thus to discourse tohim. ** Prithee, Will Atkins," 
said r, "what education have you? What was your Father?** 

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be ; he was, Sir, a 
clergyman, who gave me good instruction, or correction, 
which I despised, like a brute as I was, and murdered my 
poor father. 

Pr. Ha ! a murderer! 

[Here ike PriiSt started and looked pale , as thinking he had 
really killed his Father '\ 

R. G. V^ hat, did you kill him with your hands? 

W. A. No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke his heart 
by the most unnatural turn of disobedience to the tenderest 
and best of fathers. 

R, C. Well, I pray God grant you repentance: I did 
not ask you to extort a confession; but I ask you because I 
see you have more knowledge of what is. good than your 
companions. 

W. A. O Sir, whenever I look back upon my past life, 
crnscience upbraids me with my father : the sins against 
our parents make the deepest wounds, and their weight lie* 
the heaviest apon the mind. 

R. C. Youtalk, Will, too feelingly and sensibly for me; 
I am not able to bear it. 

W. A. You bear it, Sir ! you know nothing of it. 

R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do ; and every shore, valley, 
and tree in the island, witness the anguish of ray soul tor

ed likewise: yet my repentance falls infinitely short of 
yours. Bat, Will, how comes the sense of this matter to 
touch you just now? 

W. A Sir, the work you have set me about, has occa- 
sioned it; for talking to my wife about God and religion^ 
she has preached me such » sermon, that I shall retain it in 
lasting remembrance. 

R. C. No, no, it is your own moving pious arguments to 
her, has made conscience fling them back upon you. But 
pray, Atkins, inform us what passed between you and your 
\vife, and in what manner did you begin. 

W. A, I talked to her of the laws of marriage, the reason 
of such compacts whereby order and justice is maintained ; 
without which men would run from their wives and chil- 
dren, to the dissolution of families or inheritances. 
R. C. Well, and what did she say to all Ihis ? 
}y. A. Sir, we began our discourse in the following man- 
ner, which I shall exactly repeat according to my mean ca- 
pacity, if you think it worth your while to honour it with 
your attention.

HIS WIFE, IN THE WOOD.

Wife. No; great old Benamuckee God is. in my country, 
not yours. 

W. A. My Dear, God is in heaven, which he made; he 
also made the earth, the sea^ and all that is therein. 
Wife. Why you not tell me much long ago? 
W. A. My dear, I have been a wicked, wrelch, having 
a long time lived without the knowledge of God in the 
world. 

Wife.V^hdii, not know great God in own nation? No 
do good ting? No say O to him? that «; strange! 

W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there was no God 
, in heaven for all that. 

Wife. Why God suffer them ; why makee not live w^lL? 
W. A. It is our own faults, child.

W. A. No, 1 have neither thanked him for his mercy, nor 
feared him for his power.

W, A. Alas ! must my wicked life hinder you from be-

W. A, Yes, my dear, he hears us speak, sees wliat we

W. A. He pities and spares us : as he is our great Crea- 
tor, so he is also our tender Father.

went a little distance, and kneeling down, prayed earnestly 
to God to enlighten her mind^ and to pardon his sins; when 
this was done, they continued their discourse thus.) 

JVife. What you put down knee lor ? For what hold u^

/r. A. My dear, I bowed in token of submission to him 
that made me, and prayed that he would open your eyes

promise that he will hear us. 

tVife. When did he bid you pray } What ! do you hear 
him speak ? 

fV. A. No, my dear, but God has spoken formerly to 
good men from heaven: and by divine revelation they have 
written all his laws down in a book. 

Wife. O where that good book. 

W. A. I have it not now by me ; but one lime er other I 
shall get it for you to read. Then he embraced her with 
great affection. 

Wife. Pray tell mee, did God teachee them write that 
book I. 

W. A. Yes„ and by that rule we know him to be God. 

Wife. What way, what rule you know him ? 

W. A: Because he teaches what is good, just^ and holy ; 
and forbids all wicked and abominable actions that incur 
his displeasure. 

Wife. O me fain understand that, and if he do all things 
you say he do, surely he hear me say O to him; he makee 
Die good if i wish to be good ; he not kill me if I love him | 
me tink, believe him great God ; me say O to him, along 
with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man fell upon his knees, and made her 
kneel down by him, praying with the greatest fervency, 
that God would instruct her by h;s holy Spirit ; and that 
God, by his providence, would send them a B;ble lor botb 
their int>tructions. And such was the early piety of this 
new convert, that she made him promise never to forsake 
God any more, least being made dead^ as she called it, she' 
shuuld not only want her instructer, but himself be miser* 
able in a loug eternity. 

Such a surprising account as this was, proved very af- 
fectiug to us both^ but particularly to the young clergyraanj 



204 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

who was mightily concerned he could not talk toherhimself^ 
*' Sir," said he, "there is something more to be done to 
this woman than to marry her: I mean tiiat she ought to 1 
be baptized." To this I presently agreed : *' Pray,'* said 
he, *' ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to her of 
Jesus Christ, the salvation of sinners-, the nature of faith, and 
redemption in and by him, and of the Holy Spirit, the resur- 
reciion, last judgment, and a future state ;" but the poor 
fellow melted into tears at this question, saying that he had 
said something to her of these things, but his inability to 
talk of ihem, made him afraid, least her knowledge of them 
should rather make her contemn -religion, than be benefited 
by it ; but that it I would discourse with her, it would be 
"very evident my labour would not be in vain. Accord- 
ingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter be- 
tween the religious priest and the woman, I entreated him 
to go on; but surely never was such a sermon preached by 
any clergyman in these latter days, with so much zeal, know- 
ledge, and siacerity: in short, he brought the woman to 
embrace the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by 
him, with so surprising a degree of understanding, that she 
made it her own request to be baptized. 

He then performed his office in the sacrament of baptism, 
first, by saying some words over to himself in Latin, and 
then asking me to give her a name, as being her godfather ; 
and pouring a who'e dishful of water upon the woman's 
head, he said, *' Marj/, I baptize thee in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ;'* so that 
none could know of what religion he was. After this he 
pronounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman 
being made a Christian, he married her to Will Atkins : 
v\hich being finished, he affectionately exhorted hira to 
lead a holy life for the future j and since the Almighty, for 
the convictions of his conscience, had honoured him to be 
the instrument of his wife's conversion, he should not dis- 
honour the grace of God, that while the ravage was con- 
verted, the instrument should be cast away. Thus ended 
a ceremony, to me the roost pleasant and agreeable I ever 
passed in my life. 

The affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing to 
go on board, when the young man (whose mother was starv- 
ed) came to me, saying, that as he understood I had a cler- 
gjman with me, who had married the Englishmen with. 



or BOBINSON CRUSOE. S05 

savages, he had a match to make between two Christians, 
which he desired might be finished before I departed.— r 
Thinking that it was he himself that had courted his mother'5 
maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing rashly upon the 
account of his solitary circumstances; that the maid was aa 
unequal match for him, both in respect to substance and 
years; and that it was very probable he would live to re- 
turn to his own country, where he might have a far better 
choice. At these words, smiling, he interrupted me, thank- 
ing me for my good advice; that as he had nothing to beg 
cl me but a small settlement, with a servant or two, or some 
new necessaries, so he hoped I would not be unmindful of 
him when I returned to England, but give his letter to his 
friends ; and that when he was redeemed, the plantation, 
and all its improvements, however valuable, should be re- 
turned to me again. But as for the marriage he proposed, 
that it was not himself, but that it was between my Jack-of- 
all-trades and the maid Susan. 

I was indeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this 
match, which seemed very suitable, the one being a very 
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and 
sensible housewife, fit to be governess of the whole island: 
so we married them the same day ; and as I was her father 
and gave her away, so 1 gave her a handsome portion, ap- 
pointing her and her husband a convenient large spot of 
ground for their plantation. The sharing out of the land I 
left to Will Atkins, who really divided it very justly, to 
every person's satisfaction; they only desired one general 
writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused to be 
drawn up, signed, and sealed to them, setting out their 
bounds, and giving them a right to the whole possession of 
their respective plantations, with their improvements, to 
them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as 
my own property, and a cenain rent for every particular 
plantation, after eleven years. As to their laws and go- 
vernment, I exhorted them to love one another; and as to 
the Indians who lived in a nook by themselves, I allotted 
three or four of them plantations, and the rest willingly 
chose to become servants to the other families, by which 
means they were employed in useful labour, and farecj 
much better than they did before. Besides the savages be- 
ing thus mixed with the Christians, the work of their con- 
version might be set on foot by the latter, ia-lhe clergy- 



20(J LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

man's absence, to our equal satisfaction. The young priest; 
however, was a little anxious lest the Christians should not 
be willing to do their parts in instructing these poor Indi- 
ans; I therefore told hira we should call them all together; 
that he should speak to the Spaniards who were Papists, 
and I to the English who were Protestants, and make them 
promise that ihey would never make any distiuction in re- 
ligion, but teach the general true knowledge of God, and 
his Son Jesus Christ, in order to convert the poor savages. 
And this, indeed, they all promised us accordingly. 

When I came to Will Atkins's house, I found his baptised 
wife, and the young woman newly married to my Jack-of- 
all-trades, were become great intimates, and discoursing of 
religion together. *' O, Sir," says Will Atkins, " when 
God has sinners to reconcile to himself, he never wants an 
instructer; 1 knew I was unworthy of so good a work, and 
therefore this young woman has been sent hither as it were 
from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a whole nation of 
savages." The young woman blushed, and was going to 
lise; but I desired her to sit still, and hoped that God 
would bless her in so good a work; and then pulling out 
a Bible (which I brought on purpose in my pocket for him,) 
*' Here Atkins/' said I, '* here is an assistant that perhaps 
you had not before.*' So confounded was the poor man, 
that it was some time before he could speak; at last turning 
to his wife, *' My dear/' said he, *' did I not tell you that 
God could hear what we said? Here's the book I prayed 
for, when you and I kneeled under the bush ; God then 
heard us, and now has sent it." The woman was surprised, 
and thought really God had sent that individual book from 
heaven ; but I turned to the young woman, and desired her 
to explain to the young convert, that God may properly be 
said to answer our petitions, when, in the course of his pro- 
vidence, such particular things came to pass as we petition- 
ed for. This the young woman did effectually ; but surely 
Will Atkins's joy cannot be expressed; no man being more 
thankful for any thing in the world, than he was for his 
Bible, nor desired it from a better principle. 

After several religious discourses, I desired the young 
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when 
she was starving to death with hunger; to which she rea- 
dily consented, and be^an in the following manner: 
' V " Sir," said she, ** all our victuals being gone, after 1 had 
fasled one day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at the ap- 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 207 

proach of night, I was inclined to yawning and sleepy. — 
When I slept upon the couch three hours, I awaked a lit- 
tle refreshed: three hours after, my stomach being more 
and more sickly, I lay down again, but could not sleep, be- 
ing very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second day with 
a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with reach- 
ings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, 
buying plenty of provisions, and dined heartily. BuLwhen 
I awakened, my spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself 
in the extremity of famine. There was but one glass of 
wine, which being mixed with sugar, I drank up; but for 
wont of substance to digest upon, the fumes of it got inio 
my head, and made me senseless for some time. The third 
day I was so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten 
a little child if it had come in my way; during which time 
I was as mad as any creature in Bedlam. In one of these 
fits I fell down, and struck my face against the corner of 
a pallet-bed, were my mistress lay; the blood gushed out 
of my nose, but by rny excessive bleeding, both the violence 
of the fever, and the ravenous part oi the hunger abated. — 
After This I grew sick again, strove to vomit i)ut could not j 
then bleeding a second time, I swooned away as dead; 
when I came to myself, I had a dreadful gnawing^pain in 
my stomach, which went off towards night, with a longing 
desire for food. I took a drawght of water and sugar, but 
it came up again; then 1 drank water without sugar, and 
that staid with me. I laid me down on the bed, praying 
God would take me away : after I had slumbered, 1 thought 
myself a-dying, therefore recommended my soul to God, 
and wished somebody would throw me into the sea. A'l 
this while my departing mistress lay by me; the last bit of 
bread she had, she gave to her dear child, my young master. 
The morning after i fell into a violent passion of crying, 
and after that into hunger. I espied the blood that came 
from my nose in a basin, which I immediately swallowed 
up. At night 1 had the usual variations, as the pain in the 
stomach, sick, sleepy, and ravenous; and 1 had no thought 
but that I should die before morning. In the morning came 
on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time I heard my 
young master's lamentations, by which 1 understood his 
mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, ** A 
sail ! a sail!" hallooing as if they were distracted for joy of 
that relief, which afterwards we received from your hands.'' 



20S tIPE ANn ADVENTURES 

Surely never was a more distinct account of starving to 
death than this. But (o return to the disposition of thing"? 
among my people, I did not take any notice to them of the 
sloop that I had framed, neither would I leave them the 
two pieces of brass cannon, or the two quarler deck guns 
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they should 
have separated, or turned pirates, and so make the island a 
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober, pious peo- 
ple: but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a 
promise to send them further relief from Brazil, as sheep, 
hogs, and cows, (being obliged to kill the latter at sea, having 
no hay to feed them,) 1 went on board the ship again, the 
first of May, 1(195, after having been twenty days among 
them; and next morning, giving them a salute of five guns 
at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The third day, to- 
wards evening, there happening a calm, and the current 
being very strong, we were drove to ihe'N. N. E. towards 
the land. Some hours after we perceived the sea covered 
as it were with something very black, not easily at first to 
be discovered : upon which our chief mate ascending the 
shrouds a little way, and taking a view with the perspec- 
tive glass, he cries out, ** An army ! An army I" '^You fool,'* 
said J, ** what do you mean }'* *' Nay, Sir," satd he " don't 
be angry, I assure you, it is not only an army, but a fleet 
too, for 1 believe there are a thousand canoes paddling 
along, and making with great haste towards us.'* 

Indeed every one of us were surprised at this relation ; 
and my nephew, the captain, could not tell what to think 
of it, but thought we should all be devoured. Nor was I 
free from concern, when 1 considered how much we were 
becalmed, and what a strong current set towards the shore; 
however, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the 
ship to an anchor, as soon as we were certain that we must 
engage Them. Accordingly we did so, and furled all our ; 
sails ; as to the savages we feared nothing, but only that | 
Ihey might set the ship on fire ; to prevent which, 1 ordered 
Ihem to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close by 
the head, and another by the stern, well manned, with 
skeet and buckets to extinguish the flames, should it so 
happen. The savages soon came up with us, but there 
were not so many as the mate had said, for instead of a 
thousand canoes there were only one hundred and twenty; 
loo many indeed for us, several of their canoes containing 
f > m Rixleen or seventeen men, , ^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 205 

As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great- 
iBSt amazement, not knowing what to make of us. They 
rowed round the ship, which occasioned us to call to the 
men in the hoats not to suffer them to come near them. — 
Hereupon they beckoned to the savages to keep back, wl.ich 
they accordingly did; but at their retreat they let fiy about 
fifty arrows among us, and very much wounded one of onr 
men in the long-boat. I called to them not to fire upon 
any account, but handing them down some deal hoards, the 
carpenters made theoa a kind offence to shield thcra from 
the arrows. In half an hour after they came so near astern 
of us, that we had a perfect sight of them ; then they rowed 

ittle further out, till they came directly along-side of u*?, 
and then approached so near, that they could hear u? speak: 
this made me order all my men to keep close, and get their 
guns ready. In the rcetn time I ordered Friday to go out 
upon deck, aud ask them in his language what they meant. 
No sooner did he do so, but six of the savages, who were 
in the foremost canoes, st«Joping down, showed us their 
naked backsides, as much as to say in English, Kiss our 

: but Friday quickly knew what this meant, by im- 
mediately crying out they were going to shoot ; unfortu- 
nately for hiiD, poor creature, who fell under the cloud of 
three hundred arrows, no less than seven piercing through 
bis body, killing one of the best servants, and faithfuliest of 
companions in all my solitudes and afflictions. 

So enraged was 1 at the death of poor Friday, that the 
guns, which before were charged ooly with powder, to 
frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with small shot ; nor 
did the gunners fail in their aim, but at this broadside split 
and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which 
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimuiing: the 
others, frightened out of their wits, little regarding thsir 
feJtows drowning, scoured a\v»y as fast as they could. One 
poor wretch our people took up, swimming for his life, an 
hour after. He was very sullen at first, so that he would 
neither eat nor speak; but 1 took a way to cure him, by 
ordering them to throw him into the sea, which they did, 
and then he came twi ram ing back like a cork, calling in bis 
tongue, as I suppose, to s«ve him. So we took him on 
})oar<l, but it was a long time before we could make him speak 
or understand English: yet wheo we had taught hsuj, h& 
old us, they wece going with their kings to fight a great 



210 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

battle; and when we asked him, what made them come up 
to us? he said, /* to makee dc great wonder look;" here 
it is to be noted, that those natives, and those of Airica, 
always add two e's at the end of English words, as makecy 
takee^ and the like, from which it is a very difficult thing to 
make them break off. 

Being now under sail, we took our last farewell of poor 
honest Friday, and interred him with all possible decency 
and solemnity, pulting him in a coffin, and committing 
him to the deep, at the same lime causing eleven guns to 
be fired over him. Thus ended the life of one of the most 
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that ever 
any man was blessed with in ihe world. 

Having now a fair wind for Brnzil, in about twelve days 
time we made land in the latiuide of five degrees south of 
the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in sight of shore, 
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days we 
came up to an anchor off* the Bay of All Saints. 1 had great 
difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence on shore; 
for neither the figure of my partner, my two merchant trus- 
tee?, nor the fame of my wonderful preservation in the 
island, could procure me the favour, till such time as the 
prior of the monastery of the Augustincs (to whom I had 
given 500 mojdores) obtained leave from the Governor, for 
me, personally, \Aiih the Captain and one more, togetlier 
with eight sailors, to come on shore ; upon this condition, 
that w^e should not ^land any goods oat of the ship, nor 
carry any person away without licence: I found means, 
however, to get on shore hree bales of English goods, such 
as fine broad clothe, sluffs, and some linen, which I brought 
as a present for my partner, who had sent me on board a 
present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth 
about (hirtv moidore?, incluJing some tobacco, and three 
or four fine gold medals. 

Here 1 delivered my partner in goods to the value of 
3(^0i. sterling, and obliged him to hi up the sloop 1 bought 
for the use of my island, in order lo send them refreshmt- nts; 
and so active was he in tlis matter, that' he had the vessel 
hnished in a few days, to the nj aster of which I gave par- 
ticular instructions to find the place. I soon loaded hiin 
with a small cargo; and one of our sailors offered to st-itie 
there, upon my letier to the Spanish governor, if I would 
allot him tools und a plantation. This I vvillingiy granted,

and jrave hira the savage we had taken prisoner to be his 
slave. All ihir-^ being ready tor the voyage, mv old 
partner to!d me there was an aajuaintance of his, a ^J^f^^ 
planter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the 
church, and in fear of the Inquisition, which obliged him lo 
be concealed, would be glad of such an opportunity to 
make his escape, vvith his wife and two daughters; and ir I 
would allot ihem a ])!antation in my island, he would give 
them a small stock to begin with, tor that the oflicrs had al- 
ready seized his ttT-cts and estate, and left him nothing but 
a little househoM siafFana two slaves. This request I pre- 
sently granted, cencea'ing him and his family on board oar 
ship, till such time as the sloop (where all the effects were) 
was gone out of the bay, and then we put them on boaro, 
who caiTied some materials, and plants for planting sugar- 
canes, along with them. By this sloop, among other things, 
I sent my subjects three milch cows and five calves aoout 
'J'2 hogs, three sows big with pig, two raares and a stone- 
horse. I also engaged three Portugal women to go fur sake 
of the Spaniards, which, with the persecuted man's tn^o 
dai.ighlers, were sufficient, fmce the rest hao wives of their 
own, though in anotner country ; all which cargo arrived safe 
no doubt to their exceeding comfort, who, with- this addi- 
tion, were about sixty or seventy ])eople, besides children.^ 

At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left 
me-, for a ship being ready to set sail for Lisbon, he asked 
me leave to go thither; but I assure you it was with the 
greatest reluctance I pirted from a person, whose virtue 
and piety merited the greatest esteem. 

From the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic 
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable good 
voyage, steering for the most part S. E. We were on a 
tra'ding voyage, and had a supercargo on board, who was 
to direct all the ship's motions after shg arrived at the Cape, 
only being limited to a certain number of days, for slay, by 
charter party, at the several ports she was to go to. At the 
Cape we only took in fresh water, and then sailed for the 
coast of Coromandel ; we were there inform.ed, that a French 
man of war of 50 guns, and two large merchant ships, were 
sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of them. 

In bur passage, we touched at the island of Madagascar, 
where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce anj Irea

ci)crou.s, and go conslantly armed vvlfh bows- and fance.?^ 
}et for some time ihey treated us riviUy enough; and, in 
exchange for knives, scisi^ors, and other trifles, they brought 
us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took partly for pre- 
sent victuals, and the remainder to salt for the ship's use. 

So curious was I to view every coriier ofthe world where 
I came to, that 1 went on shore as often as 1 could. One 
evening when on shore, we observed numbers ofthe people 
stand gazing at us at a distance. We thought ourseWes in 
no danger, as they had hitherto used us kinaly. However 
we cut three boughs out of a tree, sticking them at a distance 
from us, which it seems in that country, is not only a token 
of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs are set up on 
the other side, it is a sign the truce is accepted. In 
these treaties, however, there is one principal thing to be 
regarded, that neither party come beyond one another's 
three poles or boughs ; so that the middle space is not only 
secure, but is also allotred as a market for traffic and com- 
merce. When the truce is thus accepted, (hey stick up 
their javelins and lances at the first poles, and come on un- 
armed; hut if any violence is offered, away they run to 
their poles, take up their weapons, and then the truce is 
at an end. This evening it happened that a greater num- 
ber of })eop]e than usual, both men and women, traded 
among us for such iO)S as we had, with such great civility, 
that we made us a little tent, of large boughs of tress, some 
, <jf the men resolving to lie on shore all night ; but for my 
part, 1 and some others took our lodgings in the boat, with 
boughs of trees spread over it, having a sail spread at the 
bottom to lie opon. About two o'clock in the morning we 
were awakened by the firing of mujkets, and our men cry- 
ing out for help, or else they would all be murdered. Scarce 
had we time to get the boat ashore, when our men came 
plunging themselves into the water, with about four hun- 
dred of the islanders at their heels. We took up seven of 
lh(j men, three of them very much wounded, and one left 
behind killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so 
thick among us, that we were forced to make a barricado, 
w h boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from 
danger; and, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned 
them a volley, which wounded several of them, as we could 
hear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of 
day, and then making signals of distress to the ship, which 



©F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

my nephew, the captain, heard and understood, he weighed 
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then 
sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us ; but we 
called to them not to come near, informing them of our un- 
happy condition. However they ventured ; when one of 
the men taking the end of a tow-line in one hand, and keep- 
ing, our boat between him and our adversaries, swam to us, 
and slipping our cables, they towed us out of reach of their 
arrows, and quickly after a broadside was given them from 
the ship, which made a most dreadful havock among them. 
When we |^K>t on board, we examined into the occasion of 
this fiay. The men who fled informed us, that an old wo- 
man, who sold milk within the poles, had brought a young 
woman with her, who carried roots and herbs, the sight of 
whom so much tempted our men, that they offered rude- 
ress to the maid, at which the old woman set up a great 
cry; nor would the sailors part with their prize, but carried 
her among the trees, while the old woman went, and 
brought a whole army down upon them. At the beginning 
of the attack, one of oar men was killed with a lajice, and 
the fellow who began the mischief, paid dear enough for 
his mistress, though as jet we did not know what had be- 
come of him ; the rest luckily escaped. The third night 
after the artion, being curious- to understand how affairs 
stood, 1 took the supercargo and iwtnty stout fellows with 
me, and landed about two hours before midnight at the s;ame 
place where those Indians stood the night belore, and there 
we divided our men into two bodies, the bf>atswain com- 
manding one, and I another. It was so dark, that v/e 
could see nobody, neither did we hear any vnca near us; 
but by and by the boatswain falling over a dead body, we 
agreed to halt till the moon should rise, which we knew 
would beanliour alter. We perceived here no fewer than 
two and thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof tv^'o were 
not quite dead. Satisfied with this discovery, I was for go- 
ing on board again; but thp boatswain and the rest told me, 
they would make a visit to the Indian town, where these 
cogs, so ihey called them, resided, asking me at the same 
lime to go along with them, for they did not doubt, besi 'es 
gtiiuig a good booty, but they "should .find Tom Jeffery 
ihare, for that was the unhappy .man we missed. But I 
utterly refused to go, and commanded them back; being 

t> 3 . 



214- LltE AND ADVENTURES 

unwilling to hazard their lives, as ihe safety of the ship 
wholly depended upon them. Notwithstanding all I could 
say to them, they all left me but one, and the supercargo; 
so we three returned to the boat, where a boy was left, re- 
soivirg to stay ti!l they returned. At parting I to!d tbeni 
I supposed most of them would run the same fate with Tom 
Jtftery. To this thty replied, "Comeboys, come along, 
we'll warrant we'll come off safe enough ;" and so awa/ 
they went notwHhslanding all my admonition^, either con- 
cerning their own saiety or the preservation of the ship.-— 
Indeed they were gailanily armed, every man having a 
TTUsket, bayonet, and a pistot, besides cullasse?, hangers,, 
pole-axes, and hand-granades. They,can>e to a few In- 
dian houses at first, which not being the town they expected,, 
they went farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they 
cor.cliided that .^he would be a sufficient guide, and so it 
proved; for aft. r they untied her, she led them directly 
to the town, v-hith consisted of above two hundred houses, 
several faiuilies living in some i)i the huts together. At 
their arrival, all being in a prolound sleep, the sailors agreed 
lo divide themselves into three bodies, and set three parts 
of the townonfireat oncr, to kill those that were escaping, 
and plunder the rest of the houses. Thus despeiately re- 
solved, they went to work; but the first parly had not 
gone far beiore they called to ihe rest that they had found- 
Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran up to tbc place, and 
found the poor le low indeed hanging up naked by one 
9rm, and his throat almost cut in m ear to ear. In a house: 
that was hard by the tree, thty found sixteen or se\eiiteen 
Indians, who had been concerned i:; the fray ; two or ihree- 
of them being wounded, were not gone to sleep: this house^ 
they set on fire first, and in a few minutes alter, five or six 
places more in the town appt-ared in flames. The confla- 
gration spread like vvild-iire, their houses being all of wood, 
and covered with flags or rushes. The poor affrighted in- 
habitants endeavoured to run cmt to save their lives, but 
they were driven back into the flames by the sailois, and 
kdied without mercy. At the fust house above-mentioned, 
alter the boatswain had sldin two with his poie-ax, he threw 
a hand-granade into the nouse. which bursting, made a ter- 
rible havock, kdling and woundin^^ most of them ; and their 
king and most of his train, who were in that house, fell 
Viclims to Iheir fury, every creature of them being either 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2l5 

smothered or burnt. All this while they never fired a gun, 
lest the people should awaken faster than they could over 
power them. But the fire awakened them fast enough, 
which obliged our feilows to keep Irgether in bodies. By 
this time the whole town was in a flame, yet the fury ra- 
ther increased, calling out to one another to remember Tom 
Jtf?try. The terrible light of this conllagration made me 
very uaeasy, and roused my nephew the Caplain, and the 
rest of his men, who knew nothing of the matter. When 
he perceived the dreadful smoke, and heard the guns go 
off, he readily concluded his men were in danger; he there- 
f«-re takes another boat, and comes ashore himself, with 
thirteen men well armed. He was greatly surprised to see 
tne Lnd only two men in the boat, but more so when 1 told 
him the story; but though I urged with him, as I did. 
W'iih the men, about the dangers vt the voyage, the interests 
©f the merchants and owners, and the safety (;f the ship, yet 
my nephew, like the rest, declared, that he would rather 
lose the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men should 
be lost fcr want of help; and so away he went. For m/ 
part, seeing hira resolved to go, I had not power to stay 
behind. He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve 
men mo.re, and then we marched directly as the flame 
guided us. But surely never was such a scene of horror 
beheld, <.r more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver 
Cromwell took Drogheda, in Ireland, whtre he neither 
spared man, woman, nor child. 

The first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of 
one of their habitations, before which lay four men and three 
women kiiled, and two more burnt to death among the fire, 
wh'ch was now decaying. Nothing could appear more 
barbarous than this revenge; none more cruel than the 
authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and the 
cry proceeded in proportion. We hadnotgone much far- 
ther, when we beheld three naked \\omen, follo\^ed by six- 
t-een or seventeen men, fl>irig with the greatest swiftness. 
from cuf men, who shot one of thtra in our sjght. V/hea 
they perceived us, whom they supposed also th«i° murderers, 

ey stt up a most dreadful shriek, and both of them ywoor- 



ed away in fright. This was a sight which might hav 
soltened the hardest heart; and in pity we took some way., 
tt) let them know we ^-ould not hurt them, while the poor 
creatures, with bended kness and iifted-up hands, made 



216 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

piteous lamentations to us to save their lives. I ordered 
our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures whatsoever ; 
but being willing to understand the occasion of all this, 1 
Went among these unhappy wretches, who neither under- 
stood me nor the good I meant them. However, being 
resolved to put an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men 
to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards before we can>e 
up with the boatswain, with four of our men at his heels, all 
of them covered with blood and dust, and in search of more 
people to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we saw them 
we called out and made them understand who we were; 
upon which they came up to us, setting up a halloo of tri- 
umph, in token that more help was come. "Noble Captain," 
said he to my nephew, *' Trn glad you're come; we have 
not half done with these villanous hellhound dogs; we'll 
root out the very nation of them from the earth, and ki'L 
more than poor Tom has hairs upon his head :" and ihas fee 
went on till 1 mterrupted him — " Blood-thirsty dog, '^ said 
J, ** will your cruelly never end ? I charge you touch not one 
creature niore ; stop your hands and stand still, or you're - 
a dead man this moment," " Why, Sir," said he, *' you 
neither know whom fou are protecting, nor what they have 
done: but pray conae hither, and behold an instance of 
compassion, if such can merit your cle-nency;" and with, 
that he showed me the poor fellow with his threat cut, 
hanging upon the tree. 

Jndee i, here was enough to fill their breasts with rage, . 
which, however, I thought had gone too far, agieeabie to. 
these words ol Jacob to Ins sons SiMieon and Levi : *' Cursed . 
be their anger, for it was fit^rce ; and their wraCh, tor it 
was cruel." But this sight made my nej)hew and the 
rest as bad as. they : nay, U'y nephew declaccd, his con-- 
cern was only lor hism<-n: as for the people, not a soul 
of them ought to live. Upon this, the boatswain and eight 
more directly turned about, and went to finish the intended 
tragedy; wliich being out of my power to prevent, 1 re- 
turned hack from the dismal sight, and the piteous cries of 
those unfortnv.ale creatures, who were made victiuis to their 
fury. Indeed it was an egregious piece of full) n aie to 
return to the boat with but one altenoant; anu i. had very 
near paid for it, having narrowly escaped forty armed In- 
dians, who had been alarm^rd by the conflagration; but 
having passed the place where they stood, i got to tiie boat. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOF. 217 

accompanied with the supercargo, and so went on board, 
sending the pinnace back again, to assist the men in what 
might happen. When I had got to the boaf, the fire was 
ahnost extinguished, and the noise abated ; but 1 had scarce 
been half an hour on board the ship, when I heard another 
volley given by our sailors, and a great snioke, which, as I 
afterwards found, was our men falling upon those houses 
and persons that stood between them and the sea ^ but here 
they .spared the wives and children, and killed only the men, 
to the number of about sixteen or seventeen. By the time 
they got to the shore, the pinnace and the ship's boat were 
ready to receive them, and they all got safe on board, not 
a man of them having received the least hurt, except two,^ 
one of them having strained his foot, and the other burnt his 
hand a Iittie; tor they met with no resistance, the poor 
Indians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded. 

I was extremely angry wiih eVery one of them, but par- 
ticularly with the captain, v^ho instead of cooling the rage 
of tlie men had prompted them on to farther mischief: nor 
could he njake me any other excase, but that as he was a 
man, be couH not master his passions at the sight of one of 
his men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest, knowing 
they were not under my command, they took no notice of 
my anger, but rather boasted of their revenge. According 
to all their accounts, they kil!ed or desiroyed about 150 
men, women, ana children, besides burning the town to 
ashes. They took ti.eir companion Tom Jttfery from the 
tree, covered him with some of the ruins, and so left him. 
But however this action of cur men might seem to them 
justifiable, yet I always openly cyndemn^d it with the ap- 
pellation oi' the Massacre of Madagascar. For though the 
natives had slain this Jc;ffery, yet certainly he was the fiist 
aggressor, by aitempling to violate the chastity of a young 
innocent woman, who ventured down to them, on the faith of 
the public capitulation, which was so treacherously broken. 

While we were under sail, the boatswain would often 
defend his bloody action, by saying, tbat the Indians had 
broke the truce the night before, by shooting one of oar 
men without jast provocation; and what if the poor teilevv 
had takee a Hale liberty with the wench, be ougnt not to 
have been murdered in so viilanous a n::annerj and that 
Ihey had acted nothing but what the divine laws commis- 
sioned to be dcoe to such homicides. However i was in 



218 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the same mind as before, telling th'em thai they were mar- 
derers, and bid (hem depend upon it that God wonhi blast 
their voyjge, for such an unparallvrfed piece of barbarity. 

When we canne to the Gulf of Persi,?, five of our nien, 
■vvho ventured on shore, were either killed or made siaves 
by the Arabians, the rest of Ihem havinor scarce time tc 
escape to their beat. This made me upbraid them afresh 
with the rt-tiibution of Heaven for such actions; upni 
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, '* Whcthej 
those men on whom the tower of Siioam fell, were greatei 
sinners than the rest of the Galiileans? and besities, Sir/ 
said he, *' none of these five poor men that are lost wcvt 
with us at the massacre of Madsp-ascar, as you call it, raid 
therefore your representations are vtxy unjust, and your ap, 
plication Improper. Besides/' added lie, *• you are con 
tinualiy using the men very ill upon this account, and, be 
ing but a passenger Nourself, v,e are not obhgcd to bear it 
nor can we te!l what evil designs you may have to bring. | 
to judgment for it in England; and, therefore, if you oj 
riot leave this discourse, as also not concern yourself wiffl 
any of our affairs, I v.iil leave the ship, ar.d not sail amonJ 
such dangerous company,"" j 

/Jl this 1 heard very patiently; but, it being often r^ 
peated, I at length told him, the concern I had on boaj^ 
was none of his business; that I was a considerable own€ 
in the ship, and therefore had a right to speak in commof 
and that 1 was no way accountable to him, nor any boo 
e\sG. As no more passed for some time after, I though 
all had be-en over. At this time we were in the road c 
Bengal, where, going on shore with the supercargo one da) 
in the evening, as 1 was preparing to go on board, one c 
the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble my- 
self to come to the boat, for that the cotkswain and othei 
had ordered him not to carry me on board any more. Th: 
insolent mesj-age much surprised me, yet I gave him n 
answer to it, but went directly and acc|uaiiited the supe 
cargo, entreating him to go on board, and, by acquaintin 
the Captain with it, prevent the mutiny which 1 perceive 
would happen. But before 1 had spoke thi^, the matt« 
was effected on board ; for no sooner was he gone off i 
the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and all l\ 
inflsrior officers, came to the quarterdeck, desiring to spea 
with the Captain ; and there the boatswain made a Ion 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 21Q 

arangue, exclaiming against me, as before mentioned, that 
'I had not gone on shore peaceably for my own diversion, 
ley, by violence, would have compelled me, for their sa- 

faction : that as they had shipped wilh the Captain, so 
ley would faithfully serve him; but if I did not quit the 
lip, or tlie Captain oblige me to it, they would leave the 
lip, immediately : hereupon, turning his face about, by 
-ay of signal, they all cried out, '- ONE and ALL! ONE 
nd ALL!^' 

You may be sure, that though my nephew was a man of 
reat courage, yet he could not but be surprised at their 
idden and unexpected behaviour; and though he talked 
Outly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them, 
latin common justice to me, who was a considerable own- 
r in the ship, they could not twrn me as it were out of my 
^n house, which might bring iheir lives in danger should 
ley ever be tfken in England; nay, though he invited the 
.^atswain on shore to accommodaie matters with me, yet 
1 this I say signified nothing; they would have nothing to 
5 with me; and they were resolved to go on shore if I 
ime on board. <' Well," said my nephew, ** if you are 

resolved, permit me to talk with him, and then 1 have 
)ne;" and 59 he came to me, giving m.e an account of their 
solution, how one and ail designed to forsake the ship 
hen I came on board, for which he was mightily concern- 
1. *' I am glad to see you, nephew," said I, " and rejoice 
is no worse, since they have not rebelled against you; 
only desire you to send my neces>arv things on shore' 
sth a sufficient sum of money, and Lvvi'll find ray way to 
-igland as well as 1 can.'' Tijough this grieved my ne- 
lew to the heart, vet there was no remedy but compliance: 

short all my necesfaries were sent to me, and so this 
^tter was over in a few houfvS. 

I think 1 was now near a thousand leagues farther off 
J^lana by sea, than at my little kingdom, except this dif- 
-ence, that 1 might travel by land over the Great Mogul's 
untr;, lo Surat,^from thence to Bassora, by sea up* the 
!rsian Gulf, then take the way of the caravans over (he 
•absan desL-rt lo Al-.-ppo and Scanderoon, there take ship- 
ng to Italy, and so travel by land into France, and from 
^•iice across the sea to England. 

•My Be phew left me two persons to attend me; one of 
em was his servant, and the other clerk to the purser, 



220 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

•who engaged to be mine. I took lodgings in an English 
\voman\s house, where several French, one English, and two 
Itaiian merchacls resided. The handsome entertainment 
I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months, con- 
sidering what course I should take. Some English goods 
I had with me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of 
eight, and a letter for more, if there was such necessity. — 
The goods I soon disposed of to advantage, and bought here 
several good diamonds, which I could eisily carry about 
with me. One morning the English merchant came to me, 
as being very intimate logether, *' Countryman/' said he, 
•* I have a project to communicate to you, which I hope 
wiR suit to both our advantage. To be short. Sir, wc are 
both in a remote part of the wofJd from our country ; but 
yet in a place where men of business may get a great deal 
of money. Now, if}ou will put a thousand pounds to my 
thousand pounds, we wilJ hire a ship to our satisfaction; 
you shall be Captain, I will be merchant ; and we'JI go a 
trading voyage to China, for why should we lie still like 
drones, while the whole world is in a continual motion.-" 

This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreeable 
to my rambling genius ; and the more so, because 1 Icoked 
upon my countryman to be a very sincere person; it re- 
quired some time before we could get a vessel to our mind, 
and sailors to man it accordingly; at length we bought a 
ship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a 
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-men j and, 
for want of others^ made shift wiih Indian seamt^n. \Yq first 
sailed to Achin, in the Island of Sumatra, and then to Siam,. 
where we bartered our wares for some arrack and opiuraj 
the last of which bore a great price among the Chinese; in^ 
a word, we went up to Suskan, making a very great voyage ; 
and, after eight months time I returned to Bengal, very well' 
satisfied with this adventure^ having not only got a sufficient 
quantityofmoney,but an insight of getting a great deal more. 

The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go j 
among the Spice Islands, and bring home a lo&d of cloves., 
from the Manillas, or thereabouts; Islands belonging part- 
ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerabl}'. 
We were not long in preparing for this voya^^e, which we 
mad e no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo, 
and several other places which I do not perfectly remem- 
ber, and returned home in about five months time. W^1 



©F KOBINSON CRUSOE. 2^1f 

soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some 
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away 
for the Gulf; and, in short, making five to one advantage, : 
\ve were loaded with money. 

Not long after my friend and I had made up our account?, 
to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster 
from Batavia, of about two hundred tons. The crew of 
this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that there were 
not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage ; and the Captain 
having given out that he intended to go to Europe, public 
notice was given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner 
did this come to our ears, but we bought the ship, paid tiie 
master, and took possession. We would also have very 
willingly entertained some of the men; but they having 
received their share of booty, were not to be found, being 
altogether fled to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's resi- 
dence: and from thence w^ent to travel to Surat, and so by 
the sea to the Persian Gulf. And indeed they had reason 
to fly in this manner: for the truth of it was, the pretended 
Captain was the gunner only, and not the commander; 
that having been on a trading voyage, they were attacked 
on the shore by the Malayans, who killed three men and 
the Captain ; after whose death the other eleven men run 
away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate 
and five men more on shore ; but of this afiair we shall 
have occasion to speak more at length hereafter. 

However they came by the ship, we thought we bought 
it honestly : neither did we suspect any thing of the matter; 
when the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship (undoubt- 
edly forged) to one Emanuel Clostershoven, which name he 
•went by. And so without any more to do Ave picked up 
some Dutch and English seamen, resolving for another voy- 
age for cloves among the Phillippine and Molucca islands : 
in short we continued thus five or six years, trading from 
port to port with extraordinary success. In the seventh . 
year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch 
at Siam, and buy some rice by the way. in this voyage 
contrary winds beat us up and down for a considerable time 
among the islands in the Straits of Molucca, No sooner 
were we clear of those rugged seas, but we perceived 
our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into th« 
river Cambodia, which lies norlhvyard of the Gulf, and 
i;oe8 up to Siara.

f22 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

One day, as I was on shore refreshing myself^ tijere 
eamc to me an Englisliman, who was a gunner's mate on 
board an English East-India ship, riding up the river near 
the city of Cambodia: **Sir/' said he, "you may wonder 
at my business, having never seen me in your life; but tho' 
I am a stranger I have j>omething to tell you that very near- 
ly concerns you ; and indeed it is the imminent danger you 
are in has moved me to give you this timely notice* — 
" Danger !'* said I, ♦'what danger? I know of none, ex- 
cept my ship being leaky, for which I design to have her 
run aground to morrow morning." *' I hope you will be 
better employed when you shall hear what I have to say to 
rou. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen 
eagues up this river; about three leagues on this side of it, 
there lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would 
you venture here without considering what strength you 
have to engage them?" I knew not what he meant by this 
discourse, and turning short upon him, **Sir,'* said I, ** 1 
know no reason I have to be afraid either of any Dutch or 
English shrps. 1 am no interloper, and what business have 
they with me?" '^ Wei!, Sir," said the man, *' if you do 
think yourself secure, all as I can say, you must take your 
chance ; however I am very sorry you are so deaf to good 
advice; but I assure you, if you do not put to sea immedi- 
ately, you will be attacked by five long boats full of men, 
hanged )Ourself for a pirate, if ycu are taken, and the par* 
ticulars examined afterwards. I thought, Sir," added he, 
** I might have met a better reception for such a singu- 
lar piece pf xservice." ''Sir/' said I, "I never was un- 
grateful to any man; but pray explain yourself, and l*il go 
on board this minute, whether the leak be stopped or no/* 
*' Why, Sir/^ said he, " to be short, because time is precious, 
the matter is this : You know well enough that you was 
with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain was murdered 
by the Malayans, with three of his sailors ; and that either 
Vou, or some who were on board you, ran away with the 
ship, and are since turned pirates at sea. Isow. Sir, this 
is the sura of what 1 have to say j and 1 can posrtively assure 
you, that if you ore taken, you will be executed without 
»uch ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be sen- 
sible what litde law merchant ships show to pirates, when- 
ever they fail into their hands." 

"Sir,** said I, *' I thank you for your kind information; 
and though I am sure no man could come more honestly 



OF RODNSON CRUSOB. 2J4 

by the ship than I have done, yet knowing their cnterprize^ 
and being satisfied of your honest intention, I'll be upon my 
defence." '' Pr'ythee, Sir,*' said the man, '* don't talk of 
being upon your defence, the best lliat you can make is to 
be out of danger; and therefore if you have any regard for 
your life, and the lives of your men, take the advantage, 
without fail, of putting out to sea at high-water : by which 
means, as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone 
too far out of their reach before they can come down.'* 

*'I am mightily well satisfied,'* said 1, *' in this particular; 
find for your kindness, which merits my great esteem, pray. 
Sir, what amends shall I make you?" He replied, "I know- 
not what amends you are willing to make, because yon 
may have s(^me doubts of its certainty : but, to convince 
you of the truth of what I say, 1 have one offer to make to 
you. On board one of the English ships, I have nineteen 
months pay due to me, and this Dutchman that is with me, 
has seven months pay due to him, which if you will make 
good to us, we will go along with you. IC yon shall find 
that there is nothing in what we have said, then we shall 
desire nothing; but when you are convinced that we have 
paved the ship, your life, and the lives of the men, we shall 
leave the whole to your generosity,*' 

So reasonable did this every way appear, that I immedi- 
ately consented, and we went directly on board. As soon 
as we came on board, my pirtner calls joyfully out, ** That 
they had stopped the leak!" ♦* Well, thank God," said 1, 
♦'but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith. — ** Weigh!" 
said he, *' what is the meaning of this hurry r*' *' Fray ask 
no questions," said I, "but ail hands to work, without 
Josing a moment's time." Upon which, in great surprise, 
the Captain was called, who immediately ordered the anchor 
to be got up : and though the tide was not quite down, 
yet being assisted with a little land breeze, we stood to sea, 

I then called to my part er into the cabin, and related the 
story at large, uliich was confirmed and more amplified by 
the two men X had brought on board. Scarce had we 
fiiiUhed our discourse upon this head, but a sailor came to 
the cabin door, with a message from the Captain, that we 
were chased by five sloops full of armed men. '*Very 
well," said I, '*it is plain now there is something in it,*'— 
A\)4 80, going upon deck, I told all the men there was %i

design for seizing the ship, and of executing us for pirates; 
and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us, 
and by one another?^' To which they unanimously replied, 
** That they would fight to their last drop of biood." I 
then asked the Captain^ which way he thought best for us 
"to manage the battle? **Sir/' said he-, <• the only method

put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but finding 
them crowding after us, till they came within shot, we took 
in our white, and hanging out the red ilag, immediately 
i|red'~.at thep.i with ball : we then called to'them with a 
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril keep otF. 

But ail this sigu'fied nothing; for depending upon the 
strength that followed them, they were resolutely bent for 
mischief: hereupon i ordered them to bring the ship to, by 
■which meanc,, they lying upon our broadside, vve let fly at 
them at once, one of whom carried away the stern of the 
hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to take down 
their sail, but made them all run to the head of the boat, to 
keep them from sinking, and so she lay by^ haviug enough, 
of it. In the mean time, we prepared to welcome the fore- 
most boat in the same manner. While we were doing this, 
one of the three hmdermost boats cam.e up to the relief 6f 
that which was disabled, and took the men out of her. We 
again called to parley with them ; but, instead of an answer, 
one of the boats came close under our stern ; whereupon 
our gunner let fly his two chase guns, but missing;, the men 
in the boat shouted, and waving their caps, came on With 
greater fury. To repair this seeming disgrace, the gunner 
soon got ready, and firing a second time, did a great deal«£ 



OF ROBiNSON CRUSOE, 22^1 

itiischlefanifl^ng the enemy. M'e waved again, and bring- 
ing our quarter to bear upon them, fired three guns more, 
when we found ;he boat a sinking, and several men already 
in the sea; hereupon. n:!anning our pinnace, I gave orders 
to save as many as they could, and instantly to come on 
board, because the rest of their boats were approaching: 
accordingly they did so, and look up three of them, one of 
whom was a'most past rfcovery; and then crowding all the 
sail we could, after our men came on board, we stood out 
farther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the 
chase, when they came up to the first two. Thus delivered 
from imminent clanger, we changed our course to the east- 
ward, quite out of the course of all European ships. 

Being now at sea, and inquiring more particularly of the 
two seamen, the meaning of all this, the Dutchman at once 
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who sold 
us the ship was an errant thjef, wh'> had run away with her; 
that the captain was treacherously murdered on the const 
of iVfolucca by the natives there, with three of his men; 
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to 
have recourse to thev^oods for their safety, at length escaped 
by means of a Dutch ship, in its way to China, which had 
sent their boat on shore for fresh water: Thar, after this^ 
he went to Batavia, there two of the seamen belonging to 
the ship (who had deserted the rest In their travels) arrived, 
and there gave an account that the fellow who ran away 
with the ship had sold her at lienga! to a set of pirates, who 
went a cruising, and had already taken one English and 
two Dutch sliips richly laden. 

Now, though this was absolutely false, my partner truly 
said, that our deliverance was to be esteemed so much th« 
more, by reason, had we fallen into their hands, we could 
have expected nothing from them but immediate death, 
considering our accusers would have been our judges; and, 
therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal, 
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we came 
by the ship, of whom we bought her, and the like, and 
where we were sure (f some justice j at least would not be 
hanged first and judged afterwards. I was at tlrst of my 
partner's opinion, but when I had more seriously consider* 
ed of the matter, I told him, we ran a great hazard in at- 
iemBting to return, being on the wrong side of the Strait? 

T3 



S2S LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of Molucca, and that, if, upon alarm given, we should be 
taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English elsewhere, our 
running away would be a sufficient evidence to condemn us. 
This danger indeed startled not only my partner, but like- 
wise all the ship's company ; so we changed our former re- 
solution, and resolved to go to the coast of Tonquin, and 
so to that of China, where, pursuing our first design as to 
trade, we might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of 
the shjp some way or other, and to return to Bengal in any- 
country vessel we could procure. This being agreed to, 
we steered away N. N. E. about 50 leagues off the usual 
course to the east, vv-hich put us to some inconveniences. 
As the wind blew steadily against us, our voyage became 
more tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provi- 
sion ; and what was still worse, we apprehended, that as 
those ships, from whose boats we had escaped, were bound 
to China, they might get before us, and have given fresh 
information, which might create another vigorous pursuit. 
Indeed, I could not help beirg grieved, when I considered 
that I who had never wronged or defrauded any person in 
my life, was now pursued like a common thief, and, if taken, 
to run the greatest danger of being executed as such; and, 
though innocent, I found myself under the necessity of fly, 
ing for my safety; and thereby escape being brought to 
shame, of which I was even more afraid than of death itself. 
Jt was easy to read my dejection in my countenance. My 
mind vvas oppressed, like those unhappy, innocent persons,' 
who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured evi- 
dences, wickedly resolved to take away their lives, or ruia 
their reputation, have no other recourse in this world to 
ease their sorrow, but sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner' 
«seeing me so concerned, encouraged me as well as he could; 
and after describing to me the several ports of that coast, j| 
he told mcj he would either put me in on the coast of Co-* 
chin China, or else in the Bay of Tonquin, from whence we 
might go to Macao, 'a town once possessed by the Porta* 
guese, and where still many European families resided. 

To this place we steered, and early next morning came 
in sight of the coast j but thought it advisable to put into 
a small river where we could, either overland, or by the 
ship's pinnace, know what vessels were in any ports there- 
abouts. This happy step proved our deliverance : for, next 
morning;, tjiere canie to the Bay of Tonqtiin two Dutch- 



OF KCBINSON CRUSOE. *1^ 

ships, and a third, without any colours; and in the evening- 
two English ships steered (he same coarse. The river 
where we were was but small, and run hut a few leag-ues up 
the country northward; the counlrv was wild and barbarous 
and the people thieves, having no correspondence with any 
other nation; dealing only in fish, oil, and such gross com- 
modities; and one barbarous custom ihey still retained, that 
when any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked upon their 
coast, they make the men prisoners or slaves ; ^o that now 
• we might fairly say we were surrounded by enemies both 
by sea and land. 

As the ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity, iu 
this place, to search her, and to stop up the places which 
let in the water. We accordingly lightened her, bring- 
ing our guns and other moveable things to one side, we es- 
sayed to bring her down, that we might come to her bot- 
tom; but, upon second consideration, we did not think it 
safe to let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the 
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used to such 
a sight as,to see a ship lie down on one side, and heel in to- 
wards the shore, and not perceiving the men, who were at 
work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-side, 
presently imagined the ship had been cast away, and lay 
fast on the ground. Agreeable to this supposition, they 
surrounded as with ten or twelve large boats, with a reso- 
lution, undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and carry away 
those they found alive for slaves to their king. But when 
they perceived our men hard at work on the ship's bottom 
and side, washing, graving, and stopping her, it filled them 
all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as though they 
were confounded. Nor could we imagine what their de- 
sign was; however, for fear of danger, we handed dowa 
arms and ammunition to those at work, in order to defend 
themselves ; and, indeed, this precaution was absolutely 
^ necessary ; for, in a quarter of an hour after, the natives, 
concluding it was really a shipwreck, and that we were sa- 
ving our lives and goods, which they thought belonged to 
them, came down upon our men, as though it had been ia 
line of battle. We lay at present but in a very unfjt posture 
to fight; and before the stages could be got down, or the 
men in the boat came on board as they were ordered, the 
Cochin Chinese were upon them, and two of their boats 
boarding our long-boat, they began to lay hold of our men 



f2t tIFE AND APVENTURES 

as prisoners. The first they seized was a stout Engljshl 
sailor, who never fired his musket, like a fool as I imagined,; 
but laid it down in the boat : but he knew what he was! 
doing; for, by main force, he dragged the Pagan out of the" 
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains out 
against the boat's gunnel; a Dutchman that was next hin> 
snatched up the musket, and knocked down five mor« with 
the butt-end of it; however, this was doing very little to 
iheir number; but a strange unexpected accident, which 
father merits laughter than any thing else, gave our men a 
complete victory over them. 

It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the 
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he 
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two kettles just let 
down in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the 
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship- 
wrig:hts use ; the carpenter's man had a great iron ladle 
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff, 
and as twq^of the enemies entered the boat where the tel- 
low stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boiU 
jng liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked, made 
tb-era roar^out, and jump into the sea. ** Well done, Jack," 
fays the carpenter, *♦ give them the other dose : and so 
stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping it into 
4he pitch pot, he and his man so plentifully flung it among 
ihera, as that none escaped being scalded ; upon which they 
all made the best of their way, crying and howling in such 
a frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never heard 
ihe like. And, indeed, never was 1 better pleased with 
any conquest than I was with this, there being so little 
bloodshed, and having an aversion to killing such savage 
wretches, (more than was necessary,) as knowing they came 
on errands, which their law and customs made them think 
were just and equitable. By this time, all things being in 
order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so^ 
they did not venture a second attack. Thus ended our 
merry fight, and, having got rice, bread, roots, and sixteen 
good hogs on board the day before, we set sail, not daring 
to go into the bay of Tonquin, bat steered N. E. toward 
the island of Formosa, or as tho' we would go to the Ma- 
nillas, or Philiipine islands, for fear of meeting with any 
JKuropean shipsj when we anchored at the isle of Formosa, 
tJi^ inhabitants not only ccufteously supplied us with pro- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ?2§ 

Visions and fresh water, bat dealt very fairly and honestly 
with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place 
we steered north, keeping stiil o(F the coast of China, till 
we were beyond all its ports wiiere European ships usually 
rt)me; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty 
degrees, wc resolved to put into the first trading port we 
sKould come al; and {^landing for the shore, tt boat came oft* 
two lea^ue^ to us* with an old Portugu*3S© pilot on board, 
^vhQ offered hi^ sfetvic^j we very gWV?y accepted him, %nd 
.s^nt the boat back again. And nuv\\ having the old man 
on board, I talked to hini of ft'^^^^g ^^ N^nquin^ the roost 
t^orihward part of the coast of China, ** What wili you do 
ther^r* s^aid he, smilin^^. I told him \v© would sssU our 
cargo, and purchase calncoe.*, raw and wrous^ht !?ilk^, tea, 
8cc. and so return the same way baek. <* O,** said he^ ** you 
had better put in at MaeaO;, where yvxx may buy Chiaa wares 
as cheap as at Nanqain, and sell your opium at a greater 
advance.** ** But/* said I, " we are gentUmer., a^s well as 
merchants, and design to see the great city of Pekin, and 
the magnificent court of the monarch of China.** *» Why, 
then,'* said he, ** \ou should go to Ningpo, v\here there is 
a navigable river that goes through the heart of that vast 
einpire, two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea, 
which crosses ail the rivers, passes considerable hilis, by 
the help of the sluices and gate'^, and goes even up to the 
city of Ptikin. You maygo to Nanquin, if you please, and 
travel to-Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound 
that way." At't!)e name of a Dutch or English ship, I was 
struck with confusion; they being as great a terror to me 
in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to ihem in the 
Mediterranean. The old man Hnding me troubled, "Sir,/* 
said he, *' I hope the Dutch are not now at war with your 
nation.'' " No," said I, " but God knows what liberty they 
may take when out of the reach of the law.*' " Why," says 
be, " what occasion is there for peaceable merchants to fear ? 
For, believe me, they never meddle with any but PIRATES?'* 
At the mentioning the word Pirates^ Yay countenance 
turned to that of scarlet; nor was it possible for me to con- 
ceal it from the old pilot ; who taking notice of it, <'Sir,'* 
said he, *^ take what course you please,- I'll do you all the 
service I can." '^' Seijjnior," said I, "lam a little con- 
cerned at your mentioning pirates; I hope there are none 
such in these seas, because you see in what weak conditiaa 



230 LIFE AND ADVENTCRES 

we are to defend ourselves." " O, Sir/'said he, " if that's 
all, don't be concerned; I don't remember one in these seas 
these fifteen years, except about a month ago one was seen 
in the bay ot' Siam, but he is gone to the southward ; nei- 
ther was she built for a privateer, hut was run away with 
by a reprobate Captain, and some of his men, the right 
Captain having been murdered by the Malayans. 

** What !" saJd I, (as though ignorant of what had hap- 
pened) "did they kill the Captain V *' No," said he, '* it is 
geneially thought the Malayans murdered him ; but perhaps 
they might procure them to do it, and therefore ihev justly 
deserve hanging. The rogues were lately discovered in 
the Bjy of Siam, in the river of Cambodia, by some Dutch' 
men who belonged to the ship, and had much ado to escape 
the five boats that pursued them, but they have solemnly 
sworn to give no quarter to the Captain or the seamen, but 
hang iht-m every one up at the yard-arm, without any for- 
niai business of bringing them to a court of judicature," 

Being sensible that, having the old man on board, he 
was incapable of doing me any mischief, "Wei', Seignior," 
said I, ** it is for th»s very reason I would have )Ou carry 
us up to Nanquin, where neither English nor Dutch shijis 
come; and I must tell you, their Captains are a parcel of 
rash, proud, insolent rascals_, that neither know what belongs 
(o justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God 
or nature direct; fellows that would prove murderers to 
punish robbers, and take upon them to judge innocent 
nivn to death, without any proof to prove them guilty ; but 
perhaps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place 
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed," 
And so I told him all the story ot buying the ship, and how 
we were saved by the means of two men; that the murder, 
of the Captain by the JVIaiayans, as also the running away: 
with the ship, I believed to be true; but that we, who 
bought it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover 
their cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked 
lis ; and the blood of those men we killed in our own just de^ 
ience lay at their door, who were sent toattack us by surprise, 

*'Sir," said the old man, amazed, "you h^ve taken the 
right course to steer to the north, and if 1 might advise 
you, I would have you sell your ship in China, and buy or 
build another in that country ; and I'll procure people to., 
buy the «jne and sell th^ other," *' Well, but .SeiguiQri'*;^ 



or ROBINS13N CRUSOE* HSl 

9VLid 1, ** If I sell the ship in this manner, I may bring some 
innocent persons into the same dangers 1 have gone through, 
perhaps worse, even death itselt : whereby I should be as 
guilty of their murder as their villanous executioners.** — 
•* That need not trouble you,*' says the old man, "Tlf find 
a way to prevent that ; for these commanders, you talk of, 
I -know very well, and will inform them rightly of the mat- 
ter as you have related, and am persuaded they will not 
only believe me, but act more cautiously for the future." — 
•* And will you deliver one message from me to them ?" 
**yes," said he, " if you will give it under your hand, that 
J may prove it is not of my own production.** Hereupon 
1 wrote a large account of their attacking me in their long- 
boat, the pretended reason and unjust design of it; that 
they bad done what they might be ashamed of, and could 
not answer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter 
was writ in vain. Providence ordered things another way. 
We sailed directly for Nanqi>in, and in about thirteen days 
sail, came to an anchor at the south-west point of the great 
gulf of that place, where we learned, that two Dutch 
ships were gone the length before us, and that we should 
certainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great loss 
in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on shore 
almost any w'here; but our old pilot told me, that if I 
would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues, 
there was a little port called Quinchang, where no Euro- 
pean ships ever came, and where we might consider what 
was further to be done. Accordingly we weighed anchor 
the next day, calling only twice on shore by the way to 
get fresh water. The country people very courteously 
sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. After 
five days sail we came to the port, and landed with unspeak- 
able joy. We resolved to dispose of ourselves and effects 
in ary other way possible, than enter on board that ill-fated 
vessel DTore ; for no state can be more miserable than a 
continued fear, which is a life of death, a confounder of 
cur understandings, that sets the imagination at work to 
form a thousand frightful things that may never happen. 
And we scarce slept one night, without dreaming of halters, 
yard-arms, or gibbets, of fighting, being taken, and being 
killed; nay so violent were our apprehensions, that wo 
would bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the 
cabin, as though actually engaged. Th« story of the Dutch

cruelty at Amboyna, often came into our thoughts whe» 
awake ; and, for my part, I thought my condition very 
hard, thaf^after so many difficulties and such signal deliver- 
ances, I should be hanged in my old age, though innocent 
of any crime that deserved such punishment; but then re- 
ligion v^'ould seem to represent to mle, as though the voice t 
of it had said, consider, O man ! what sins you have been| 
formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account , 
for, to expiate with thy blood ! And as to thy innocence, . 
what art thou more innocent than thy blessed Redeemer - 
Jesus Christ, who suffered for thy offences, and to whose - 
providence you ought to submit, let what vf ill happen? 
After this, natural courage would inspire me to resist to 
the last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer myself to i 
be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to 
torment beyond death itself. 

But now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore, our old pilot 
procured us a lodging and warehouse for our goods ; it 
was a little hut, with a large warehouse joining to it, all 
built with canes, and pallisadoed round with large ones, to 
keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that 
country. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during 
the night, and we employed a centinel with a kind of hal- 
bert for threepence a day. The fair, or mart, we found 
had been over for some time; however, there remained in 
the river four junks and two Japan ships,, the merchants of/ 
the latter being on fliore. In the first place, our old , pilot 
brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests, 
who were converting the people to Christanity : two of 
them were reserved, rigid, and austere, applying themselves 
to the work they came about with great earnestness ; but 
the third, who was a Frenchman, called Father Simeon, was 
of a freer conversation, not seemingly so serious and grave, 
yet no worse Christian than the other two, one of whom 
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese. Father Simeon, 
it seems, was appointed to go to Pekin, the royal seat of 
the Emperor of^the Chinese ; and he only waited for ano- 
ther priest, who was ordered from Macao to accompany 
him. We never met together, but he was prompting me 
to accompany him in that journey: "Sir," said he, "I 
will show you the glorious things of this mighty empire, 
and a cily? the city of Pekin, far exceeding London and 
Paris, put thera both together. One day in particular, be-

ing at dinner with him, I showed some ir.clination to go; 
which made him press the more upon nie and mv p.irtner, 
to gain our perfect consent. *' But, Fad'.er Simeon,'" said 
rny partr.er, '* what satisfaction can you have in otir com- 
pany vthom you esteem as heretics, and consequently objects 
not worthy your regard:" " O," said he, •* you may be as 
good Catholics in time as those I hope to convert to our 
reh'gion." *•' And so," said I, *' we shall have y(.ur pj-cach- 
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with adescrrp- 
lion of the country." "Sir," said he, "however our reli- 
gion may be viliiied by some people, it is very certain it 
neither divests us of good manners or Chrisiian charily; 
and as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse toge- 
ther, w.ilhout making one another uneasy/' 

But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and 
the merchandise which we had to dispose of. There was 
but very litt'e trade in the place where we were; and I 
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilani, and 
so to the city of Nanquin; but Providence ordered it other- 
wise, by our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant lo us, to 
see what goods we had. He immediately bought oar opiiun, 
lor which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight, 
some wedges of which were about ten or eleven ounces. 
It came into my head that perhaps he might buy the ship 
too; and I ordered his interpreter to propose it to h'm.~ 
He said nothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders ; yet 
in a few days alter he came, accompanied by a missionary 
priest, who was his interpreter, with this proposal, '" That 
as he had-bought a great quantity of our goods, he h5d not 
mor.ey enough to purchase cur "ship ; but if I plea -ed he 
would hire her, with ail ray men, to go to Japan, a^-.d from 
thence with another loading to the Philippine islands, the 
freight of w^hich he would very willingly pay to us beibre • 
and at their return to Japan, would buy the' ship." Upon 
this we asked the Captain and his men, if they weic wriii.g 
to go to Japan ; to which they unanimously agreed. VVhiie 
this was in Bgitalion, the young man, my nephew iett to 
attend me, told me, *•' That as I did not care to accept this 
prospect of advantage, he would manage it for me as i 
pleased, and render me a faithful account of his success, 
which would be wholly mine." Indeed I was very unwil- 
lhi» to part with hini; "but considering it might be for It^

young man's good, I discoursed with my partner about It, 
who, of his own generosity, gave him his share of the vessel, 
Mso that I could do no otherwise than give him mine: but, 
however, we let him have but the proper half of it, and 
preseived a power, that when we met in England if he 
had obtained success, he should account to us for one half of 
ihe pr( fils of the ship's freight, and th« other shu>uld be his 
own. Thus having taken a writing under his hand, away 
he sailed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly 
.by hirr, got him a licence to come on shore, sent him loaded 
to the Philippines with a Japanese supercargo, from whence 
be came back again loaded with European goods, cloves., and 
other spices. By this vo)age he cleared a considerable 
sum of money, which determined him not to sell his ship, 
but to trade on his own account; so he returned to the Ma- 
nillas, where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, 
was hired by the governor privately to go to Acapuico in 
America, on the Mexican const, with a Hcence to travel to 
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned cut greatly 
to account, and my friend finding means lo get to Jamaica, 
.returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England. 

In parting with the ship, d comes in course to consider 
of those men who had saved our lives when in the river ot^ 
Cambodia ; and thc^ugh, by the way, they were a couple of 
rogues, who thought to turn piiales themselves, )et we 
paid ihem what they had before demanded, and gave each 
of them a small sura of money, making ihe Englishman a^ 
gunner, and the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they 
were very well contented. 

We were now about 1000 leagues farther from heme 
than when at Bengal. All the comfort we could expect 
was, that there being another fair to be kept in a month's 
time, we might not only purchase all sorts of that country's 
manufactures, but very possibly find some Chinese junk>\, 
or vessels from Tonquin, to be sold, which would carry us 
and our goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hope?, 
we resolved to continue; and lo divert ourselves, we look 
several little journeys in the country. About ten days after 
we parted with our ship, we tra-velled to see the city ot 
^'anquin. The city lies in latitude SOdegrtes north ot the 
lir.e- it is regularly built, and the streets are exacti) straight, 
and cross one anolJ^.er in direct lines, which sets it out to 
■the greatest advanttc^ . At our return, we found the priest

wa? come from' Macao, that was to accnrnpary father Si- 
Jiieon lo Pekii). That faiher earnestly S'-liciteii me to ac- 
company hiQ), and I referred him to my pciitPier. In short, 
vie both agreed, an-d jueparcJ accordingly ; and we were 
so lucLy as to have liberly to travel a:nong the retinue of 
cne of their Mandarines, who is a principal magisliale, and 
roach reverenced by the people. 

We were five and twenty days travelling throu<Th ! his miser- 
able country, iiifiiiitelv po-;ulou"=, but as indifiVrently cui- 
tivaled ; and yet their pride is infmttelv greater than llieir 
poverty, insomuch that the priests themsi^lves deride them. 
As we passed by ti^.e house of one of their country genlle- 
oien, two leagues uf[ Nanquin, we had the honour, forsootii, 
to ride with the Chinese squire, about two miles. Never 
was Don Quix<^te so exactly imilaied! Never such a com- 
pound of pomp arid poverty seen before ! 

His habit, ma^^je of cahco, was dirty, greasy, and very 
proper for a Mt rry Andrew or ScaraiD.ucii, with all its 
tawdr) trappings, as hanging sleeves, lasofls, 8.:c. though 
lorn and rent in almost every part ; his ve.s,l_uucjerneath it 
was no less dirt), but more greasy, resembling the m )st ex- 
qaisite sloven or greasy butcher: his hr-rse (worse than Ro- 
sinanle, or the famous steed of doughty Hudibras) was a 
poor starved, decrepid ihing, that would nut sell for thirty 
shillings in England ; and yet this piece of worshipTul pom,p 
was attended with ten or twelve slaves vvho guarded their 
master to his country seat. We sLopped at a little village 
for refreshment; and when we came oj the country seat of 
this great man, we found him siting under a tree before his 
door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of 
garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by 
him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece 
of lean mutton in ii: this was his worship's repast : but 
pray observe the state of ihe f^'od! two women slaves brought 
him his food, \Ahich being laid bel'bre him, two others ap- 
peared to perform th^ir respective offices ; one fed him 
with a spoon, while the other scraped off what fell upon his 
beard and taffety vest, and gave it to a particular favourite 
to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased with the con- 
ceit of our admiring bis magnificence, which rather merited 
our scorn and detestation. 

At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accom- 
panied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot, whose

rhar<res we bore, and who served us a*; an interpreter hj 
the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but he 
comes laughing to us, ^" Ah t Senior Inglise/' said he, 
** me something telt you make your h<art ^lad, but make 
Jne sorry; for you bring me here twent.-five days journey, 
and now you leave me go back alone j and which way 
shall I make my poit at»er, without de ship, without de 
horse, without pecuner" so he Colkd money in his broken 
Latin. He then informed me, that there was a great ca- 
ravan of Muscovite ami Polish merrloaiits in the city, who 
wrre pre;>aring to set oui for Muscovy by land within six 
Wfeks: and, that he was certain we vv u!d fake this oppor- 
tunity, and consequently Miat he must go home, by himself. 
Indeed this nevvs infinitely surprised and pleaded me. — 
'* Are you certain of this?^' said 1. *' Yes, Sir," says he, 
** me sure its true.'* And so he told me that having met 
an old acqus'niance of his, an Armenian, in the street, who 
was among tiien;. and who had come from Astracan, wrth 
a design t.. go :'> Tonquin, but for certain reasons having 
a'tered his resotu'ioM^', he was now resolved to go with the 
caravan, and to rep.jirn bv the river Wolga to AUracan.-— 
" Well, Seignior,'* ^aid I," diDnt be discontented about 
your returning aione : ar.d if, by this means, I can find a 
passage to England, it w;:] be your own fault ?f you return 
to IMacao at all.''' Anci so C':)nsulting wim my partner what 
was best to be done, he rclerrLd it to me as 1 pleased, hav- 
ing our affairs so well setil-rd ai Bengal, that, if he could 
convert the good voyage he had made in China silks, 
wrought or raw, he would be safisfied to go to England, 
3r.d so return to Bengal in tii ■ (.'impany's ships. Thus re- 
solved, we agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we 
would bear his charges either to ivioscow, or England; and 
to give him in a present the sum of one hundred and seventy 
pounds sterlh g. Hereupon we called him in, and told 
him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if he 
would accompany us with the caravans; and, therefore, we 
desired to know his m.ind. At this he shook his head, 
*' Great long journey,*' said he, '* u>e no pecur^e carry me 
to Moscow, or keep me there." But we soon put him out 
of that concern, by making hira sensible of what we would 
give him here to lay out to the best advantage; and, as for 
his charges, we would set Inm sale on shore, God willing, 
either in Muscovy, or England, as he pleased, at our own 



CF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

charge, except the carriage of his goods. At this proposal, 
.he was like a man transported, telling us, he would go with 
us all the world over; and we made preparations for our 
journey; but it was near four months before all the mer- 
chants were ready. 

In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express 
to the port where we first put in, to dispose of what goods 
had been left there, w hi'e I accompanied a Chinese mer- 
chant who was going to Nanquin, and there bought twenty- 
nine pieces of damask, with about three hundred more of 
other fine silks ; and by the time my partner returned to 
Pekin, 1 had t'lem all carried thither; our cargo in silks 
amounted to i-jOOl. sterling, which, together with tea, fine 
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for 
our share, besides what we rode upon, with two or three 
spare horses, and two more loaded with provisions; the 
company now was very great, making about four hundred 
horse, and above one hundred and twenty men, well armed 
and provided. We were of several nations, among whom 
■ were live Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, aud 
W€tl experienced in trade. 

We set out from Ptkin the beginnirgg of February, our - 
jtyle ; and in two days more, we passed through the gate ■ 
of the great Cnina wall, which was erected as a fortifica- 
tion against the Tartars, being one hundred English n:iles 
long. We llien entered a country not near so populous, 
chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, several com- 
panies of whom we perceived riding on poor starved horses, , 
contemptible as themselves, without order cr discipline. — = 
One time our leader, for the day, gave us leave to go. a 
hunting ; but what do you think we hunted.'' only a parcel . 
of sheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for wild- 
ncss and swiftness; but while we were pursuing this game, 
it was our chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who 
no sooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn, at : 
the sound of whnrh there soon appeared a troop of forty or 
fifty more, at about a mile's distance. Hereupon one of 
the scotch merchants (who knew their ways) ordered a.s to 
advance towards ihem, and attack them immediately^ As ■ 
w-e advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happily 
fell a little short of us ; this made us halt a little, to reluiii 
the complimfirit with. bullets^ and .then being led up b^ -

the bold Scot, we firerl our pistols in their faces, and drew 
out our swords; but there was no occasion ; for they flew 
like timorous sheep, and only three of them remained, 
beckoning to tlie rest to come back. But our brave com- 
mander gailoped up to them by himself, shot one dead, 
knocked another off his horse, while the third ran away; 
and thus ended our bailie with the Tartars, -f 

We travelled a month more through the Emperor of 
China's dominions; and at length coming to one of their 
towns about a day and a half's journey from the cilv of 
Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The jierson 1 spoke to 
would have brought me one, bu(, like a fool, I must go 
along with him, about two miles from the village. My. 
old pilot and 1 walked on foot, forsooth, for some variety, 
when comitg to the place v^here the camels were kept a^ 
in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed 
and bought one, which the Chinese nian that came along ; 
with me led along the road. But we had not gone far, be-j 
fore we were attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horse-] 
back, two of whom seized the man, took the camel from ■ 
him, and rode away, while the other three approached us, ■ 
the first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my* 
sword, the second knocked me down, but my old trusty ■ 
Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which 1 knew-.^ 
nothing of, and coming up lo the fellow that struck me, he- 
with one hand pulled him off his horse, and then shot him-, 
dead upon the spot; then taking his cimeter, he sruck. 
at the man that stopped us, but missing him, cut otF one of< 
his horse's ears, the pain of which made him throw his 
rider to the ground. The poor Chines'e who had led the 
camel, seeing the Tarlar down, runs to him, and seiz-ing- 
Dpoi; his pole-ax, wrenched it from his hands, and kiwckedj 
his brains out. But there was another Tartar lo deal with, 
who seeming neither inclined to fight or fly, and my old 
man having begun to charge his pistol, the sight of it struck 
such a terror into the wretch, that away he scoured, leav- 
ing my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an 
ab;^olute victory. 

By I his time being awakened from my trance, I began 
to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having quite 
forgot all that passed ; but my senses returning, and feeling 
a great pain \\\ my head, and seeing the blood was runniitig 
over my clothes, 1 instantly jumped upon my feet, and 



OF ROBtKsoN CRirsoe. 259 

grasped ray sword in my hand, with a resolution to take re- 
venge: but no fc-nenaies now remained, c:;cept the dead 
Tartar, with his horse standing by hira. The old man 
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards 
me, and embraced me with the greatest tenderness, al the 
same time examining into my wound, which was far from 
being mortal. When we returned to liie village, the man 
dem.anded payment for his camel, which i refusing, we 
brought the caa>e before a Chinese judge, who acted with 
great impartiality : Having heard both sides, he asked the 
Cliinese man that went with me, whose servant he was ? 
" Sir,'* said he, " I am nobody's, but went with the stran- 
ger at hisrequtst:" " Why then," said the judge, '* you 
are the stranger's servant for the time, and the camel be- 
ing delivered to his servant, it is the same as though de- 
livered to himself, and accordingly he must pay tor it."-^ — 
Indeed the case was so fairly staled, that I had nothing to 
object to it; so having paid for that I was robbed of, I 
sent for another, but did not go myself to letch it, as I had 
enough ot that sport before. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese E-rapire, so 
fortint-d, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars can- 
not baiter down their walls; by v^hich certainly one might 
think one of our cannons would do more execution than all 
their legicns. 

When we were within a day's march of that city, we 
had information that the guvemor had sent messengers to 
every part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans 
to halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the nu- 
merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the 
city. The news put us into great consternation: bul, 
obeying the orders, we stopt; and two days after, there 
came two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese, 
and three hundred more from N:»um ; thus guarded both 
in the front and rear, with our own men in the flanks, we 
boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat witii 
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared. 

Early next morning, in our march from a little well situ* 
ated town called Changu, after having f)assed a river, and 
entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
we soon beheld, by a cloud of djst that was raised, that 
the enemy was approaching. This much dispirited the 
' Chinese. My old pilot took notice of it, and called out. 



240 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

" Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be encouraged, or they^'. 
■will ruin us ail; avd I am afraid if the Tartars attack us> 
they will all run away.-" *' Why, Seignior," said I, " wUat j 
shall be done in this case?'-' "Done," says he, " why let 
fifty of our men advance, and flAnk them on each wing. I 
know the fellows will fight well -enough in company. We 
accordingly took his advice,. and marched fifty to the rigiit* 
"winof, and the same number to the left, and with the rest * 
made a line of reserve, leaving the last two hundred men | 
10 guard the camels, or to assist ui, as occasion required. 

Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward, view- ■ 
ing our posture, and traversing the ground on the front of' 
our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move 
on, and give them a salute with their shot ; which acconl- 
jngly was done. This put a stop to (heir proceedings; 
for immediately wheeling off to their left, they all marched 
away, and we saw no more of them. They had undoubtedly - 
given an account of their companions of what reception 
they might expect, which made them s© easily give over 
their enterprize. 

Vvhcn we came to the city of Naum, we returned the 
governor hearty thanks, and distributed a hundred crowns- 
among the so'diers that guarded us. We rested thete one 
day, and then proceeded- on our travels, pa-sing several 
greet rivers and deserts; 'and on the 13th ofi^pril we came, 
to the Irontiers ot Mo^covy, the first town of which was 
called Argun. 

This happy occasion, as T thought, .of coming into a 
Christian country, made me- congratulate the b-cots ,mer-> 
chant upon it. He sih-led at that, telling me not to rrjotce 
too scon; *'for," said he, "except the Russian soldiersin 
garri.son, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon .the road^ 
all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles,. is 
inhabited by the most ignorant and baibSrous Pagans.'' 

We advanced from the river Arguna by moderate jour- 
re) s, ana found convenient garrisons on the road, filled with 
Christian said iers, for the security of commerce, and for 
the convenient loJgings of travellers: but the inhabitants 
oflhtcountrv were mere Pagans, worshiping the sub, moon, 
and stars". We particularly observed this idolatry near the . 
river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Kii^jsians, 
called Nensiiike). Being curious to see their way of liv- 
ing vNhile the caravan continued to rest themselves m that

citv, I wpnt to one of their villages, where there was 
to be ojie of their sclemn sacrifices. T.-'cre 1 beheld, 
upon the stump of an old tree, an idol of wooci, lijoreugly 
than the reprc-sentation of the devi! hiir. -..l: : itf head 
resembling no living creature; its ears wert* hs big and as 
high as goats' horns, a crooked ncse, four-cornered moutb, 
and hornb'e teeth: it was clothed m sheep skins, had a 
great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing mroagh it, 
and was eight feet high, wi'h.^.ut l^et. !ej<s, or picportioiT. 
Belore this idol there lay sixieen or seventeen people, who 
brought their oftVrir.gs, and were making their prayers, 
while at a distance stood three men, and one bullock, as 
victims to (his ugly morister. 

Such stupendous sacrilege as this in robbing the true 
God of his honour, filled me with the greatest astonishment 
and reflection : which soon turning to rage and fury, I rode 
up to the imsge, and cut in pieces the bonnet that was upon 
his head with my sword, so that it hung down by one of 
the horns, while one of my men that wa?. with me pulled at 
it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an hideoas 
howling and outcry ran tiirough the village, and two &t 
■three hund.ed people coming abcut our ears^, we were 
obliged to fly for it. 

But I had not done with the monster; for the caravan 
being to rest three nights in fhe town, I told the Scots mer- 
chant what I had seen, and that 1 was resolved to take tour 
or tive men well armed with me, in order to destroy the 
idol, and show the people how little reason they had to trust 
in a god who could not save himself. At firj.t he laughed 
at me, representing the danger of it; and when it was 
destroyed, what tjme had we to preach to them better 
things, whose zeal and ignorance were in the greatest degree, 
and both unparalloledr that if 1 should be taken by them, I 
should be served as a poor Russian who condemned their 
worship; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top 
of the idol, there shot at with arrows till miy body was full 
of them, and th'rn burnt as a sacrifice to the monster; "but 
Sir," said he, " since your zeal carries you so far, rather 
than you should be alone I will accompany you, and bring 
a stout I'ellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist you in. 
this design: and accordingly he brought one captain Rich- 
ardson, who, hearing the story, readily consented; but my 
partner declined it, being altogether out of his way : and 
so we three, and my servant, resolved, to execute this ex-

ploit about midnight; but upon second thoughts we defer- 
red It to the ne»t night, by rea-on iliat the caravan being 
to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of 
the governor's power. The better tot-ffectaate my design, 
1 procured a Tartar's sheep skin robe, a bonnet, with bow 
and arrows, and every one of us got the liice habits. The 
first night we spent in mixing combustible mritler with aqua- 
vita?, gunpowder, &.c. having a good quantity of tar- in a '^ 
little pol: next night we came up to the idol about eleven, 
o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding 
it; but we perceived a light in the house, where we had 
seen the priests before. One of our mea wis for firing the 
but, another tor killing the people, and a third for mak- 
ing them prisoners, while. the iJo! was destroyed. We 
agreed to the latter;, so knocking at the door, we seized 
the first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and t)'ing 
his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the l^ke 
manner : and thtn the Scots merchant set tire to the com- 
position, which fVightened th.em so raucii that we brought 
them all avva) prisoners to their wooden god. There we 
fell to work with him, dauiiing him all over with tar mixed 
with tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and 
Piouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire ia 
his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. AH this be- 
ing done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set 
the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, (he 
shape of it w-as deformed, rent, and split, which the forage 
utterly consumed: for we sla)'ed to see its destrwction, lest I 
the ignorant, idolatrous people should have thrown them- 1 
selves into the flames. And thus we came away undisco- 
vered, in the Hiorning appearing as busy among our fellowr 
travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other, hat- 
Ihat we had been in our beds all night. 

Next morning we set out, and had gone but a small 
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of 
people of the country to the gates of the city,. demanding 
satisfaction of the Russian governor for insulting their priesti;, 
and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in 
the sun, and no mortal would violate this image but some 
Christian miscreants; and being already no less than thirty- 
thousand strong, they announced war against him and all 
bis Christians. 

The governor assured them he was ignorant of the mat- 
ter, afld that none of his garrison had been abroad j that in- 



OF ROBINSON CRtJSOt. 24-3 

•Seed there was a caravan that went away that morning, and 
that he -would send after them to inquire into it; and who- 
ever was the oifender, should be delivered into their hand?. 
This satisfied them for the present, but the governor sent 
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, we should make ' 
all the haste away possible, while he kept them in play as 
long as he could. Upon this we marched two days and 
two nights, slopfiir.g but very little, till at last we arrived 
«t a village called Plothus, and hastened toJeravvena, another 
of the Czar's coiocies. On the third day, having entered 
the desert, and passed the lake called Shaks Oser, we be- 
held a numerrus body of horse on the other side of it to the 
north, who supposed we had passed on that side of the lake; 
but either having found the mistake, or being certainly in- 
formed of the way we took, they came upon us towards tha 
dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp be- 
tween two little but very thick woods, with a little river 
running before our iVont and some felled trees with which 
we covered our rear; a precaution we always took, and 
which we had just finished when the enemy came up. — 
They did not fall on us immediately, but sent three messen- 
gt^rs, demanding the men who had insulted their priests, 
and burnt their god Cham Chi-Thaungu, that they might 
be burnt with fire; that if this was complied with, they 
would peaceably depart ; but if not, they would de- 
stroy one and all of us. Our men stared at one another 
on receipt of this message, but Nobody was the word, as 
indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Upon which 
Jthe leader of the caravan returned for answer, " That they 
'Weie peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of their 
priests and gods; and therefore desired them not to disturb 
us, and put us under the necessity of defending our<:elves." 
But so far was this from satisfying them, that tlie next morn- 
ing coming to ourjight, they let fly a volley of arrows among 
us, which happily did -not hart any, because we sheltered 
iourselves behind our bagg^ige. We expected however to 
come to closer engagement : but were happily saved by 
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, who obtain. ng leave of the 
leader to go out, mounts his horse, rides directly from our 
rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars, as 
though he had been sent express, and tells them a tormal 
slory, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham Chi- 
Thaungu, were gone to Shiheilka, with a resolution to burn the 



244- LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

god Shal-Isar, belonginfr to the Tongueses. Upon which>. 
believing this cunning Tartar, who was servant to our Mus- 
covites, away they drove to Shiheilka, and in less than three 
minutes were out of sighf, nor did we ever hear of them more. 

When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five 
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held us 
twenty three days march, infested with several small com- 
panies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had the 
courage to attack us. After we had passed over this desert, 
we found several garrisons to defend the caravans from the 
violence of the Tartars: In particular the Governor of Adin- 
skoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if 
we apprehended any danger. The people here retained 
the same paganism and barbarity, only they were not so 
dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The cloth- 
ing, both of men and women, is of the skins of beasts, iiring 
under the ground in vaults and caves, which have a com- 
munication with one another. They have idoh almost in 
every family; besides, they adore the sun and stars, water 
and snow ; and the least uncommon thing that happens iti; 
the elements, alarms them as^much as thunder and lightning^j: 
does the unbelieving Jews. 

Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through this 
country. When we had gone through the desert, after iwo 
days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city, 
on the great river so called, which we were told parted Euv 
rope from Asia, The inhabitants here were very little bet^ 
ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won- 
der will cease, when I inforui my reader of what was ob- 
served to me, that the Czar rather converts the Tartars 
with soldiers than clergymen, and is more proud to make 
them faithful subjects, than good Christians. 

From the city to the river Oby, we travelled over a 
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want 
of good management and people, and those few arc mostly 
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite erimtoals 
are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next 
city we came to, was the capital city of Siberia, called T«- 
boiski, when having been almost seven months on our jour- 
ney, and winter drawing on apace, my partner and I con- 
sultedabout our particular affairs, in what manner we should 
dispose of ourselves. We had been told of sledges and 
rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the winter season,

the snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges can run 
upon the surface without any danger of going down. As I 
was bound to England, I now behoved either to go with tlie 
Caravan to Jercslaw, iVom thence west to Narva, and the 
gulf of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark; or 
else I must leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwitia, 
and so to Archangel, where I was certain of siiipping eitlier 
to England, liollanrl, or HamK-n-gh. One night I happened 
to get into the company of an illustrious, but banished Prince, 
whose company and virtues were sucii as made me pro- 
pose to him a method how he might obtain his iibertv. 

*' My dear friend,'' said he, '^as I am here happily free from 
my n»iseral)ie greatness, with all its attei.danis of "pride, am- 
bition, avarice, and luxury, if I should escape from this place, 
those pernicious seeds may again revive, to my lasting dis- 
quietude ; therefore let me remain in a blessed confinement, 
for I am but fl«sh, a meie man, with passions and affpctions 
as such: O be not my friend and tempter too!"' Strucli 
dumb with surprise, I stood silent awhile; nor was he less 
in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to give vent to 
his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and ^o withdrew. 
But about two hours after he came to my apartment : '' Dear 
friend," said he, "though I cannot conserit to accompany 
you, I &liall haye this satisfaction in parting, that you learc 
me an honest man still; but as a testimonv of my affectioa 
to you, be pleased Jo accept this present of sable?." 

In return for his compliment, I sent my servant next 
morning to^his Lordship with a small present of tea, two 
pieces of China damask, and four little wedges of gold • 
but he only accepted the tea, one piece of danfask, and one 
j>iece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that was 
upon It. Not long after he sent for me, and told me that 
what he had refused himself, he hoped, upon his account, I 
would grant to another, whom he should name: In short it 
was his only son, who was about two hundred miles distant 
from hmi, on the other side of the citj^ whom he said he 
would send for, if I gave my consent. This I soon com- 
plied with ; upon which he sent his servant next day for 
Ins soa, who returned in twenty davs time, brinoino- .even 
liorses loaded with valuable furs, it night the ySun'^cr Lord 
was conducted incognito into our apartment/where his fa* 
ther presented him to me. We tk?ii concerted the \>cp.

wavs for travelling, and after having bought a considerable- 
«[uai)tity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, &c. 
(which I sold at Archangel at a good price) we set out from 
ihii city the beginning of June, making a small caravan, be- 
ing about thirty-two horses and camels, of which I repre-^ 
dented the head. My yomig Lord bad m ith him a very 
faithful Siberian servanti well acquainted with the road.s. 
We shunned the principal towns and cities, as Tumen, Soli^ 
Kamoskoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness 
in examining traveller?, lest any of the banished persons of 
distinction should e'scape. Having passed the river Kama, 
we came to a city on the European side, called Soloy Ka- 
moskoi, where we found the people mostly Pagans as before. 
We then passed a desert of about two hundred miles over* 
but m other places it is near seven hundred. In passing 
this wild place, we were beset by a troop of men on horse- 
back, and about i^ve and forty men armed with bows and 
arrows. At first they looked earnestly on us, and then 
placed themselves in our way. We were above sixtcf-n 
men, and drew up a little line before our camels. My 
young Lord sent out his Siberian s:ervant, to know who 
they were; but, when he approached thejn, he neither 
knew a word they said, nor would they admit him to comfe 
near th«m at his peril, but prepared to shoot him. At his 
return, he told us he believed th^m to be Calmn(?k Tar- 
tars; and that there were more upon the desert. This was 
but a small comfort to us ; yet seeing a little grove, about 
a quarter of a mile distance, we moved to it, by the old 
-Portuguese pilot's advice, without meeting with any oppo- 
sition. Here we found a marshy piece of ground, and a 
spring of water running into a little brook on one side, 
which joined another like it a little farther ofT, and these 
iw^o formed the head of the river called Writska. As soon 
as we arrived, we went to work, cutting great arms off the 
trees, and laying them hanging not quite efi" from one tree 
to another. In this situation we waited the motion of the 
enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made 
towards us. About two hours before niglit, being joined | 
"by some others, in all about fourscore horses, among whom ■ 
we fancied wai'e some women, they came upon us with great 
fury. We fired without ball, caUing to them in the Russian , 
tonoue, to know their business; but they eitlier not know- * 
ingT or -seeming not to understand us, came directly to the

wood-side, not considieriug that we were so fortified, as that 
they could not break in. Our old pilot, the Portuguese, 
proved both our captain and engineer, and desired us not 
to fire till they came within pistol shot ; and when he gave 
the word of command, then to take the surest aim; but he 
did not bid us give fire, till they were within two pikes length 
" of us, and tlien we killed fourteen of them, wounded seve- 
ral, as also their horses, having every one of us loaded our 
pieces \Aith two or three bullets at least. So much were 
they surprised at our undaunted nevs that they retired about 
a hundred roods from us. In the mean while w« loaded 
our pieces again, and sallying out, secured ft)ur or five of 
iK'jiir horses, whose riders we ftouad were killed, and per- 
c^tved thmi to be Tartars. About an hour after, they 
m^4e aa«lher attempt, to see where they might break in; 
hm fiatjtiig as reJidv to receive them, they retired. 

AU that night w^ wrought hard, in strengthening our 
situatjoo, and barrieadmg the entrance into the woods; 
bat when daylight caine, we had a very onwekome dt^-^ 
cot^^ry ; for the f nenay being encourage t by tneir num- 
bers, had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of a camp, 
about three ciuarters of a mile from us. I must c^>ntess, I 
was ueTer more concerned in ray life, giving myself an4 . 
aU that I bad aver for lost. And luy partner declaral, that 
s^ the loss of his goods would be his luin, before they should 
be taken from him, he would fight to the last drop of his 
blood. As. we could not pretend to force our way, we had 
recourse to a stratagem; we kindled a large fire, which 
burnt all night; and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued 
our journey toward'^ the poie, or north st>!r ; and travellino' 
ftil nighr, by six o'clock in the morning we came to a Rus- 
«an village, , called Kertza, and from thence ca:ne to a largft 
town named Ozonzoys, where we heard that several troops 
of Calmuck Tartars had been abroad upon the dc^erf, but 
that we were past all danger. In five days after we came 
to Veuslima, upon the river V/itzedga ; from thence we 
came to Lawrenskoy, on the third of Jaly, where, provi- 
ding ouweives with two lu^'gage boats, and a convenient,

CHAP. I, 

OF SOLITUDE, 

Howeveh solitude is looked upon m-^ Ymix»,mA to tbe- 
pleasure of the world, in company and convfrsation, yet it 
js a happy state of exemption from a sea of traiihie, su 
jnunc]dti;n of vanity an^ vexation, of confus'oa and disap' 
pointment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the joy nor 
so; row of other men affect us: We are then at liberty, 
with the voice of our soul, to speak to God. By this we 
shnn such freqtjent trivial discourse, as often becomes an ob- 
struction to viitue: and how often do we fm?i th:it we had 
reason to wish we had not been in company, or said nothing 
when vve wtre there? for either we olHn'hd God by' the ini- 
pitiy of our discourse, or lay ourselves open to the violence 
of designing people by our unguarded expressions; and 
frequenlly feel the coolness and treaciiCry of pretended 
friends, when once involved in trouble and affliction ; of j 
snch unfaithful intimates, (I should say enemies,) who rather } 
by false inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon ms, than 
honestly assist us vvh<n under the hard hand of adversity. 
But in a srate of solitude, when our tongues cannot be lu-ard, 
except from the great Majesty of Heaven, how happy are 
we, in the blessed enjoyment of conversing with our Ma- 
ker! It is then we inake him our friend^ which sets g^

above the envy and Gontempt of wicked ni?H, When a 
man converses with himseU, he is sure that he does r:ot 
converse with an enemy. Our retreat should he to good 
companv, and good books. I mean not by solitude, that 
a man should retire in'o a cell, a de>ert, ©r A monastery ; 
which would be altogeiher an useless and.unprotuable re- 
straint : for as men are rbrir.ed for society, and have an 
absolute necessity and dependence \}\mn one another, s,Cr 
there is. a retirement of the soul, with which it converses \rt 
heaven, even in the midst of men ; and indeed no man i^ 
wore fit to speak freely, than he who can, without any 
violence. to hi-niself, refrain his tongae,-Qr keep silence alto* 
gether. As to religion, it is by this the soul gets acqaaint- 
ed with the hidden mysteries of fhe holy writings; here 
she finds those floods of tears, in which good men wash them« 
selves day and ni.ijht, and only makers a visit to God, arvd 
his holy aui£els. In this conversation the truest peace and 
mBSt solid joy are to be found ; it is a continusl feast of 
contentment on earth, and the raea.as of attaining everlasting 
happiness in heaveu. . ' 



CHAP. II. - 

OFHONESTVr 

Hbnesty is a virtue beloved by good men, and pretended 
to by all other persons. In-this there are several degrees; 
to pay every man his own is the common law of honesty; 
but to do good to all mankind, is the chancery law of ho- 
nesty; and this, chancery court is In every man's breast, 
where his conscieryce is a Lord Chancellor. Hence it is, 
that a miser, though he pays every body their own, cannot 
be an honest man, when he does not discharge the good 
offices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous 
person: for, saith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xxxii. ver. 7, 8. 
"The instruments of a churl are evil: he deviseth wicked 
devices to destroy the poor with lyirig words, even when 
the needy speaketh right. But the liberal soul deviseth 
liberal things, and by liberal things shall he stand/' It is 
certainly honest to do every thing the law requires; but 
frkould we U sow tvery p^r debtor into prison till he hag

paid the utmost farthing, hang erery malefactor without 
mercy, exact the penahy of every bond, and the forfeiture 
cf every indentme, this" would be downright cruelty, and 
BOt honesty; and it is contrary to that general rule, ''To do 
to another, ihat which you would have done unto you." Some- 
times necessity makes an honest man a knave ', and a rich 
m-jn an hgnestman, because he has no occasion to be a knave. 
The trial of honesty is this: Did you ever want bread, and 
had your neighbour's loaf in keeping, and would starve ra- 
ther than eat it? Where you ever arrested, havhig in your 
custody another man's cash, and would rather go to gaol, 
than break it? if so, this indeed may be reckoned honesty. 
For King Solomon fells us " That a good name is better 
than life, and is a precious ointment, and which, when a 
isan has once l«st, he has nothing left worth keeoing.'' 



€HAP. III. 

0f the present state of RELIGION in the World. 

1 doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than reli-» 
gion in the world; more adoration than supplication; and 
more hypocrisy than sincerity: and it is very melancholy 
to consider, what numbers of people there are furnished 
with the powers of reason and gifts of nature, arid yet aban- 
doned to the grossest ignorance and depravitv. But it would 
be uncharitable for us to imagine (as some Papists, abound- 
ing with too much ill-nature, the only scandal to religion, 
do) that Ihey will certainly be in a state of damnation after 
this life: for how cati we think it consistent with the mercy 
and goodness of an infinite Being, to damn those creatures, 
when he has not furnished them with the light of the gos- 
pel ? or ho\y can such proud, conceited, and cruel bigots, 
prescribe rules to the justice and merey of God ? 

We are told by some people, that the great image which 
King Nebuchadnezzar set up to be adored by his people, 
held the representation of the sun in its right hand, as the 
principal object of adoration. But to wave this discourse of 
Heathens, how many st^H'-contradicting principles are there 
held among Christians? and how do we doom one another 
to the devil, while all profess to wot^hip the siime Deity^ 
and to expect th« same salvatien ? 



OF ROBINSON CRLSOE. Qj i 

^Vhen I was in Portugal, tliere was held at tliat time the 
court of justice of the inquisition. All the criminals were 
carried in procession to tlie great church, where eight of 
them were habited in gowns and caps of canvas, whereon 
the torment'? of hell were displayed, and they were con- 
denmed and burnt t\;r crimes aga nst the Catholic faith and 
bles-ed Virgin. 

I ain sorry to make an\^ reflections upon Christians; but, 
indeed in Italy the Roman religion seems the most cruel 
and mercenary upon earth; and a very judicious person, 
who travelled through Italy from Turkey, tells, " That 
•' there is only the face and outward |;on:»p of religion there : 
" that the church jjrotects murderers and assassins, and 
" then dehvers the civil magistr-ites over to Satan for doing 
" justice ; interdicts whole kingdoms, and shuts up the 
" churches for want of paying a few ecclesiastical dues, and 
'' so puts a stop to religion for want of their money : that 
" the court of inquistion burnt two men for speaking dis- 
''honourably of the blessed Virgin; and the missionaries 
" of China tolerated the worshiping the devil by their new 
" converts : that Italy was the theatre, where religion was 
*' the grand opera; and that th» Popish clergy were n© 
" other than the stage players.^* 

As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be the 
Messiah, or that the Messiah Las come in the flesh. And 
as to their Protestants, they are the follovvcrs of Lselius 
Socinus, who denied «ur Saviour's divinity ; and have no 
concern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 

In Muscovy their churches are built of wood, and in- 
deed, they have but wooden priests, though of the Greek, 
church; they pray as much to Saint Nicholas, as the Papis's 
do to the Virgin Mary, for protection in all their diliiculties 
er afflictions. 

As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans in 
believing consubstantiation, instead of transubstantiation ; 
but, like them, they are much pleased with the external gal- 
lantry and pomp, more than the true and real practice of it. 

In France I found a world of priests, the streets every 
where crowded with them, and the churches full of women: 
but surely never was a nation so full of blind guides, so ig- 
norant of religion, and even so void «f morals, as those 
people who confess their sins to them. 

Does it not seem strange, that, while all men own the 
Divine Being, there should be so naanv diflerent opinions 
d 



25*2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

as to the manner ©f paying him obedience in the Chrlstiair 
church ! I know not what reason to assign for this, except 
it be their difTerent capacities and facuhies. 

And, indeed^ upon this account, we have perceived, in 
all Christain countries, what mortal feuds have been about 
religion; what v,ars and bloodshed have molested Europe, 
till the general pacification of the German troubles at the 
treaiy ot Westphalia; and since those times, what persec«« 
tion in the same country among the churches of the Luthe- 
rans; and should I take a prospect at home, what unhappy 
divisions are between Christians in this kingdom, abeut 
Episcopacy and Presbytery; the church of England and 
the Dissenters opposing one anether like St. Paul and St, 
peter, even to the face; that is, they carry on the dispute 
to the utmost extremity. 

It might be a question, -v.hy there are such differences in 
religious points, and why these breaches should be more hot 
and irreconcilable ? All the answer I can give to this, is, 
that we inquire more concerning the truth of religion, thaii . 
any other nation in the world ; and the anxious concern we 
have about it, makes ns jealous of every opinion, and tena- 
cious of our own; and this is not becawse we are xriora 
furious and rash than ether people; but the truth is, vv-a arfl 
more concerned about them, and being sensible that tha 
scripture ig the great rule of faith, the standard for life and 
doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves^ without submit- 
t'mg to any pretended infallible judge upon earth, 

There h another question pertinent to the former, and 
that is, What remedy can we apply to this malady? And to 
this I must negatively answer, i\ot to be less religious^ that ■ 
we may diiter the less. This is striking at the very root of 
»U religious ditTerences; for, certainly, were they to b«r 
carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be informed, 
om' variety of opinions would not have the name of differ- 
euces ; nor should we separate in communion of charit)', 
though we did not agree in several articles of religion. 

Nor is there a leas useful question to start, namely, Where 
will our unhappy religious uitTerences end ? To whicii, I 
hope, I niay answer, in Heaven ; there all unchristian and 
unbrotherly dif»erences will jind a period; there we shall 
embrace many a sinner, that here we think it a dishonour 
to converse v.ith; and perceive many a heart we have bro- 
ken here with censures, reproachings, and revilings, made 
wUole again by th# balm of the same Redeemer's y.OQ^-^ 



©r ROBINSON CRUS6E. 2.53 

Here we .«hall perceive there have been other flocks than 
those of our fold ; that those we have exconimunicated have 
been taken into that superior communion and in a word, 
that those contradicting notions and principles which we 
thought inconsistent with true religion, we shall then find 
rVconcilable to themselves, to one anothtr, and to tht 
fountain of truth. If any man ask me, Wliy our diftercmces

Befm^ I coneiud© thi^ chapter, I sh^U brg leave to dis-

Phari§ef, vvith=Got.i, I thank tht^e ; it i^ a piece of religi-

positive YiGe: for it Is either a niask to deceive others, *>r a

atives, thus argue-^: I am not siueh a drunkard as my land- 
♦a'd, such a thief as my tenant, such a sw&arer u§ h s neigh-

& highwayman-; no! I live ^ §ober, regular, retired life; I 
am a goml man, I go-to church; God, I thank thee% Now, 
thougl% a man boasts of his virtue in contradiction tj the 
■vices mentioned, yet a person had better have them alto- 
gether than the man himself; for he is fuil of himseU, so 
persuaded thai he is good and religious enough already, 
that he has no thoughts of any thinir, except it be to pull otf 
his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thnnk him that 
he has no occasion for him; and has the vanity to think 
that his neighbours must imagine well of him too. 

The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in-» 
toxicated with the pride of his own worth; a good ueigh- 
bour and peace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in his 
own; appears in a churcli for a show, but never falls upon 
his knees in his closet ; does all his ahris before men, to be 
seen of them; eager in the duties of the second table, but 
regardless of the first : appears religious, to be taken notice 
of by men, but without intercourse or communication

CHAP. lY* 

Of Uiiening to the voice of Providence, 

The magnificent and wise king Solomon bids us cry after 
L'nowledge, and lift up our voice for understatiding ; by 
which is weant^ religious knowledge j for it follows; '* TUea 



• F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 235 

shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the 
knowledge of God." By which undoubiedly he meant lo 
inquire after every thing he has peimilted us to know, and 
not search into those ways that are unsearchable, and are 
tifectuully locked up from our knowledge. — Now, *' as 
listening to ihe voice of Providence'* is my present subject, 
I fntend, in the first place, to write to those who own — I, 
That there is a God, a first great moving cause of all things, 
aii eternal power, prior, and consequently superior to all 
created power or being.— 2. That this eternal power, which 
is God, is the sovereign creator and governor of heaven and 
eart^. 

To avoid all needless disitinctions, what persons. in the God- 
head exercises ihe creating, and what the governing power, 
I offer that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. G. where the whole 
Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work: and therefore, 
in the next place, I shall lay.down these two propositions: 

I. That the eternal Good guides, by his Providence, the 
Khole universe, which was created by his power. 

U. That this Providence manifests a particular care over, 
Snd concern in, the governing and directing man, the most 
noble creature upon earth. 

It is plain, that natural religion proves the first, by inti* 
Inating the necessity of a Providence guiding and govern- 
ing the world, from the consequence of the wisdom, justice, 
prescience, and goodness of the Almighty Creator : for 
otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God should 
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in 
guiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the order 
of his creation. 

Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and con- 
cern of his providence, by the climate^s being made habit* 
able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all 
•vegetative life made medicinal* and all tliis for the sake of 
man, who is made viceroy to the King of the earth. The 
short description I shall give of Providence is this: *' That 
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice, 
and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs, and 
directs, not only the means, but the events of all things, 
which concerns us in this sublunary world; the sovereignty 
of which we ought always to reverence, obey its motions, 
observe its dictates, and listen to its voice. The prudent 
man foreseeth the evil, and kideth himself ; tha^ in, as I take

it, there is a secret Providence intimates to us, that some 
danger threatens, if we strive not to sh«n it," 

The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull 
against the royal Martyr King Charles I. the same day Sir 
John Hotham was put to death by the parliament for that 
very action: The same day that the King himself signed the 
vvarrant for the execution of the Earl of Strafford, the same 
day of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood- 
thirsty Oliverian crew : and the same day that King James H. 
came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the same 
day he was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the 
throne filled with King WiUiam and Queen Mary. 

The voice of signal deliverances from sudden danger, is 
not only a just call to repentance, but a caution against fall- 
ing into the like danger; but such who are utterly careless 
of themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature, 
which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at 
least living in a contempt of Heaven, when he receives 
good at the hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from 
whence it comes, or to thank the bountiful hand that gave 
it; ne'lier, when he receives evil, does it alter his manner 
of life, or bring him to any state of humiliation. 

We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con- 
demned to death in Fanders. The General being prevailed 
upon to spare one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon 
the drum head for their lives; the fust having thrown two 
sixes, the second fell a wringing his hands, having so poor a 
chance to escape ; however,' having thrown, he was surpris- 
ed when he also threw other two sixes. The officer appoint- 
ed to see the execution, ordered them to throw again; they 
did so and each of them threw fives; at which the soldiers 
that stood round, shouted, and said, neither of them av as to 
die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war, 
who ordered them to throw a third time, when they threw 
two fours: the General being acquainted with it, sent for 
the men, and pardoned them; I love, said he, in such ex- 
traordinary cases, to listen to the voice of Providence. 

We read in the holy writings, how God speaks to men 
by appearances of angels, -or by dreams and visions of the 
night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacob: 
so angels hav.e appeared to many in other cases, as to Ma- 
noan and his wife, Zachariah, the Virgin Mary, and to the 
Apostles; others have been warned in a dream, as Kin^ 
Abimelech, the false profit Balaam, and many others. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, *• What we 
shall be after this life?" for there is scarce a doubt that 
there is a place reserved for the reception of our souls after 
death; for if we are to be, we must have a where, which 
the scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus. 
The doctrine of spirits was long believed before our Sa- 
viour's time; for when the disciples of the blessed Jesus 
perceived our Saviour walking on the sea, they were as 
much surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay, in 
those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter- 
meddled in the aflairs of mankind; and throughout the Old 
Testament, I do not find any thing tiiat in the least con- 
tradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned men 
have taken, to contule the story of the witch of Endor, and 
the appearance of an old man personating Samuel, cannot 
make such apparitions inconsistent vvitii ralure or religion; 
and it is plain, ihat it was either a good or a bad spirit, that 
prophetically told the unfortunate king whal should happen 
the next day ; for, said the sp'rit, *• The Lord will deliver 
'* thee into the hands of the Pnilistines; and to-morrow *halt 
*' thou and thy sons be with rae." 

Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was 
in the desolate island ; especially on a moonshine night, 
when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a man on 
horseback. When 1 crept into the dismal cave where the 
old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem- 
bled those of a rtan, how was I surprised! my blood chil- 
led in my veins, a cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead, 
my hair stood upright, and my joints, like Belshazzar's 
knees, struck against one another. And, indeed, though I 
afterwards found what it was, the remains of this surprise 
did not wear off for a great while ; and I had frequently 
returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some- 
times without any occasion at ail. 

One night, after having seen some appearance in the air, 
as I had just laid down m my bed, one of my feet pained 
tne ; after that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling 
in my blood; when on a sudden I thought something alive 
lay upon me, from my knee to above half my leg. Upon 
this I ilung myself wt of bed where I thought the creature 
lay ; but finding nothing, " Lord, deliver me from an evil 
spirit," said I ; " what can this be ?'* When I lighted a 
candle, I could perceive no living creature in the place

with me, but the poor parrot, who being frightened, cried 
ijut, *' Hold your tongue,*' and *' WhatVthe matter with 
your'* which words I had taught him by saying so to him, 
when he had made such screaming noises as I did not like. 
*' Lord," said 1 aloud, '* surely the devil has been here.** 
" Hold }our tongue,'* says Poll. I was then mad at the 
bird, and putting on my clothes, cried, " I am terribly 
"" frightened." " What's the matter with you?" says Poll. 
** You load,*' said I, '*ril knock your brains out.** '*' Hold 
** your tongue,'* cried he again, and so fell a chattering, 
and called Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But, after 
I had composed myself, and went to bed again, I began 
plainly to see it was a distemper that afiected my nerves, 
and so mv terrors vanished at once. 

How intelligences are given or received, we do not know j 
nor are we sensible how they are conveyed from spirits em- 
bodied to ours that are in life; or, on the contrary, from us 
to them; the latter is certainly done without the help of the 
organs, ar.d the former is conveyed by the understanding, 
and the retired faculties of the soul. 

The spirits, without the help of voices, converse, and the 
more particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, seem 
to me as tullow : to wit, dreams, voices, noises, impulses, 
hints, apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c. 

Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself wa« 
pleased to warn men what services to perform. and what to 
shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to 
Egypt; and so were the wise men warned in a dream to 
depart into their own country another way, to avoid the 
fury Xjf Herod. 1 am-not like those who think breams are 
the mere designs of a delirious head, or the relics of a day's 
perplexities or pleasures; but on the contrary, I must beg 
leave to say, I never met with any capital mischief in my 
life, but 1 had some notice of it by a dream; and had I not 
been a thoughtless, unbelieving creature, I might ha\re taken 
many a warning, and avoided many of the evils I after- 
wards fell into, merely by total neglect of those dreams. 

I was once present at a dispute between a layman and a 
clergyman, upon the subject of dreams. The first thought- 
no regard should be given unto them ; that their communi- 
<'ation from the invisible to the visible world was a mere 
chimera; without any solid foundation. For, firfit, said he, 
if dreams were from thc^ agency of any prescient being, the 



\ 



CF ROBINSON CRUsOlf, 2.59 

motives would be more direct, and the dificoverie? more 
plain, and not by allegories and emblematic fancier, cx» 
pre-sing things imperfect and obscure. 2. Since, with the 
notice of evil, there was noi a power given to avoid it, it 
is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous. 

3. Thnt the inconstancy of such notices, in cases equally 
imoortant, prov. s they did not proceed from any such agent.^ 

4. That as our most distinct dreams had novliing in them of 
any significancy, it would be irrational and vain to think 
that tjuy came from heaven. Ai^d, 5. Th.t as men were 
not alvvdvs ihus warned or supplied with notice of good or 
evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them ; and what 
reason ci>u!d we give, why one man or one woman should 
not liave the snme hints as another? 

T<. all this the clergymiu gave answer: 1. That as to 
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them, 
as being dark and doubttui, they are expressed generally by 
hiero^iy,.)hical representations similies, allusions, and figura- 
tive emblematic ways, by which means, for want ot inter- 
pretation, the thing was iiot understood, and, consequently, 
the evil not shur.ned. 2. 'J hat we eharge God foolishly, 
io -Nay, that he ha''> giv^n the noiice of evil, without tha 
power to avoid it ; for, if any one had not power to avoid' 
the evd, it was no notice to him; and it was wantof givmg 
due heed to that notice, that men first neglected themselves, 
and then charged the Judge of all the earth with injustice. 
3. That we ought not to find fault with the inconstancy of 
these notices but rather with our weak understandings, 
by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and negli- 
gent when the voice really spoke to us for oar good. It is 
a mistake to say dreams have no import at all: we might, 
with more reason, have said, none that we could perceive 
the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence, 
too secure at one time, and too much alarmed at another; 
so that the spirit, which we might be said to be conversing 
with in a dream, was constantly and equally kind and care- 
ful; but our powers are not always in the same state of 
action, not equally attentive to, or retentive of the hints 
that were given. And, 5. To answer the last question. 
Why people are not equally supplied? This seems to be 
no question; for Providence itselt might have some share in 
the direction of it, and then that Providence might be li- 
mited by a superior direction j that as to the converse of

5*pi»its, he coul(} not caH it a stated converse : such a thing 
there was, but why fheie was so much of it, and no more, 
was nor.e c;f his business, and that ub such discovery had 
ereryet been made to mankind. Nor were we to imagine 
kss <if W-ikini? dreams, trance.-, visions, noises, hints, im- 
pulses, and aii the waking testimonies of an. invisible world, 
and of the commuiiication thiit tljere is between us and 
them, wh'ch commonly entertain us with onr open eyes. 

One time my fancy scared on hi^h, to see what disco- 
veries I could make in those clearer regions, I f->und that 
>uch immense bodie"? as the sun, stars, planets, and moon, 
m the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being 
found in the study ef nature on the surface of the earth. 
Here [ saw many things th.t we can entertain little or no 
notion f'f, in a stale of common life, and the euipiiness of 
our nofion, thi:t the plan^ ts are habitable world'; ; that is, 
creat<d like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man 
ind b' a~t, and the f r^ sei v.ttion id" the veg- tati^e and sensi- 
tive life: No, no; this is I assure you, a world <;f spirits ; 
for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being the 
prince of the pr-vc-,r of the air, keeping his court or camp, 
with inr.umtr;;ble angels to attend him; but his power is 
not so gteat as we imagine, he can tern, t us to the crim?', 
but cannot forc<- us to com nit: Himanum est peccare. Nei- 
ther has the devil jower to force tne world into a rebellion 
'•igainst heaven, though his legious are emplov ed among 
ravage nations, to set up their master for a god, who make 
the hea;hens ettiier vvor-hip liim in person, or by his repre- 
sentative*, id(ds and mens ers, with the cru'l sacrifices of 
human Idood. Now, as to the limita;ions of the deviPs pov/er, 
yoii m.ust under-tand, that, as there are numbers ef evil 
spirits employed in uii-sci)ief, so there are numbers of good 
angels srnt from the higher and blessed abodes to discon- 
cert and oppose iheir mea-ures; and this every Christian, 
I hope, believes, when he prays to God, the fatiier of spi- 
ri»s, to give his angels charge over him while he slumber- 
el h F.nd sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the 
tlevil was not restrained, the earth would be subjected to 
dearth, droughts, and famine; the air infected with noxious 
Tumes; and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed, 
which mi-ht oblige our Mak« r (if I may be allowed the 
expression) to the necessity of a new fiat, or else have rto 
rcore creatures to hon<5ur and worship, him. 



I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 261 

As the devil n«vcr vvanfed irisinuatorSj I shall observe 
that I learned a nay how to make a man dream of what I 
pleased, p'or instance., let us suppose one to be sound asleep; 
let another lay his mouth close to his ear, and whisper any 
thing so softly as not to ^wake hhn, the sleeping man shall 
dream ^f what has been so whispered in his ear ; nay, I can 
assure you, those insinuating (:e\ ils ean do this even when 
we are aw.ike, whith I call impulses of the mind: for from 
whence, but from these insinuators, come cur causeless pas- 
sions, involuntary \^ickednes«, or sinful desire.*? Who else 
form i(!eas in tiie mind of n)an ^^hen he is asleep, or pre- 
sent terrible or btiuuit'ui figures to his fancy? Mr. Milton 
represents the devil tempting Eve in the sh .pe of a toad, 
l^ins: just at her ear, wf en in her bower she lay fast asleep; 
and brings in Eve telling Adam v, hnt a;i uneasy night's 
re t she had, and relating her dream to him. And likewise 
I believe that goo:! srdrits have the same intercourse with 
us, in warning us aj^ainst those things that are evil, and 
promptini:^ us to that which is good. 

Were we to have the eves of our souls opened, through 
the eyes of our bodits, we should st^• this very immediate 
region of air which we breathe in, thronged with spirits 
now invisible, and which otherwise would be the mcst ter- 
rible; we should view the se- ret transactions of those m*^s- 
sesigers who are employed when tha parnng soul takes its 
leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps se^ thngs niUure 
would shrink back froin with tlie utmost terror and amaze- 
ment. In a w^ord, the cur'ain of Providence for the dis- 
position of things here, and ihe curtain of judgment for the 
determination of tlie state of souls hereai'er, would be alike 
d: awn back; and what heart could support here its future 
state in life ; much Less that of its future state after life, 
even good or bad. 

A gentleman of my accjUaintance, being about seven miles 
dis'ant from London, a friend that came to dine with him, 
solicited him 'o go to the city. *' What,''' said the gentle- 
man, " is there any occasion for me?*' ** No, Sir,'' said the 
other, " nothing at all, except the enjoyment of your good 
company:" and so gave over imporiuning him. Just then 
a strong impulse of n.ind urged the gentle.nan, and pursued 
him like a voice, with, "Go to London, Go to London'' 
" Hark ye," says he to his friend, •'* is all well at London r" 
Am I wanted there? Or^ did you a^k me to go with you oa 



262 LIFE ANI> AOVENJURES 

any paiticular acrount ? Are all my f^imlly well?" " Y<iS, 
indeed. 8ir,'^ s?iid he, "I perceived them all very hearty;, 
and I did not ask you io go to London upon any particular 
account whatsoever, except it \^ as lor th-.- s'rike oFyonr good 
company."' Again h^ put off ids resolution: but .-till the 
impul-e suggested to him, " Go to London /* and at lengtii 
he did so. When he came th<-rf», he found a letter, and a 
messtiiger had been thiMe to s-ek him, -find to tell him of a 
particular business, wh'ch was at first and last abov^i a ihou- 
sani! pounds to him, and which nifii- 1 inevitably have been 
lost, had he not gone to London ^h. t 'ipht. 

The obeying of several hints, or .ecret imp^ulses, arjrues 
great wisdom. I knew a mm that was under mis.'ortu-ies 
being guilty of micdemean' rs against the government ; 
when, absconding for fear of his ruin, all uis friei.ds advi- 
sing him not to put hims' If in th« h uids of the law, one 
morning as he awaked, he ft-U a sprung, impulse darting in- 
to h'S mind thus, " Write a letter to them '/' and this was 
repeated several times to his mind, and at last he answered 
to it, as if it had been a voice, *" '^i hom shall I write tor'* 
Immediately it replied, "Write to the Judge:'' and this 
impulse pursued him for several days, till at length he look 
pen, ink, and paper, and sat down lo write to hun:.when 
immediately words flowed from his pen like stuant^ from 
a fair fountain, that charmed even himself vviih hopes of 
success. In short, the letter was so strenuous in argument* 
so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively mi-ring,. 
that when the judge had read it, he sent him, an answer, he 
might be easy, he would endeavour to make that matter 
light to him: and, indeed, never left exertiiig himself till 
lie had stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty 
and family. 

While I am mentioning these things, methinks it is very 
hard that we should obey the whispers of evil spirits, and 
not much rather receive the notices which good ones are 
pleased to give. We never perceived the misfortune of this, 
but when in real danger; and then we cry^ "My mind mis- 
gave me when I was going about it:'* but if so, why do you 
slight the caution.? Why not listen to it as to a voice ? and 
then there had been no reason to make this complaint. 

I remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago (as to 
time I cannot be very positive) there was a young clergy- 
man in the city of Dublin, in Ireland, who dreamed a very 



OF ROBrNSON CRUSOE. 263 

uncommon dream. That a gentltman had killed his wife, a 
relation of his, by stabbing her in several places ; the fright 
ci this awaked hira, but finding: it a dream, he composed 
himself again to sleep, vhen he dreamed a second time the 
same dream. This made h'm a little uneasy; but thinking 
it proceeded from the impression made on his mind by the 
fornitrr, he went to sleep again, and. dreamed the "same 
dream a third time also. So troubled was he at this, that 
he rose, and knockid at his motht^r's chamber, t.}d his 
conct^rn, and his appreteusions that all was not risjht at his 
relation's house. " Dear Son," says the good old it;- ntle- 
woman, "do not mind those foolish dreams; and i very 
much wonder, that )ou, being a person in holy ordf^r'?. -houid 
have regard to such illusions." Upon this he went :. bed 
again, fell asleer, and dreamed a fr)urth time as btibre. — 
And then indeed he put on his night-gown, and wtut to 
Smithfield, ihe place where hiS relation dwelt. Here it 
was,, a!as ! he perceived his dream too sadly ful^lled, by 
seeing his r^^lation, the young lady, big with child, w ho was 
a proiestant, stabbed in -sevtrai places by her barbarous 
husband, Mr. Ev sta-. e, a violent Papist, only for seme dis- 
courses of religion that -happened the day before. After 
the wretch hai stabbed her in three places. Ire went to 
make his escape out at a window ; but she cried out, 
** My dear! don't leave me, come back and J shall be well 
ag;;in.'' At which he returned in a hellish rage, and gave 
her four w« unds mere ; when even in this condition, rising 
from her bed, she wrapped herse f in her night gown, and 
went to the Lord Bi-^hop of Rapho's chamber door, (the 
B:.shop lodging at that time in the house) "My I.ori," said 
she, "O my Lord, m^ike haste unto me:" but rs soon as 
his Lfsrdsh p came, sbe exiired in his arm-, res;gning her 
preci.u^ soul into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel 
wretch, htr hiisrai.d, was shot by the pursaers; too good a 
deetn for one who deserved the gibbet: and the lady was 
un verbally lamtnted by all tender ana religious people. 
And this tragical relation I have mentioned, upon the ac- 
count of that iinpu'^e, or dream, that the clergyman had at 
the fd'al time of the blo' dy action. 

Some people make a v( ry ill use of the general notion, 
that th re are no appiri'ions nor s_ ir.;s at all: which is 
worse than those who fancy they see them upon every oc- 
casion ; for those carry their notions farther, even to an-

hihilat-e the devil, and believe nothing about him,, neither 
of one kind or other : the Hext step they come to, is to 
conclude, *' There is no God," and so atheism t^kes its 
rise ill the same sink, with a carelessness about futurity. 
But there is no occasion to iter upon an argument to prove 
the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power by 
words, who has so many undeniable testimonies in the breasts 
of every rational being to prove his existence: and wehave 
suffi«ient proofs enougli to contince us of the great super- 
intendency of Di\ine Providence in the minutest afl'airs of 
this world ; the manifest existence of the invisible world; 
the reality of spirits ^'id intelMgence between us and them. 
M'hat I have said, I hope, will not mislead any person, or 
be a means whereby they may delude themselves; fori 
have spoken -of these things with the utmost seriousness of 
mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire for tl^e genera!
