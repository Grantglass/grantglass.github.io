, m E FOE published "Robinson Cmsoe" in 1719, under the

"'1 following quaint title : " The Life and Strange Surpris-
ing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner:
who lived cight-nml-twenly years all alone in an unin-
habiled island on the coast of America, near the mouth

_ . of the great River Oroonoque; having been cast oh shore
1. ''''' by shipwreck, wherein all the men perished but himself. '
" With an account how he was at last strangely delivered by Pirates.
{ 'Vritten by himself."

Like "Paradise Inst," this romance, destined to so immediste and
lasting a popularity, is said to have been ofl'eted to "the whole circle
of the trade" before any publisher could be found willing to incur

the risk of producing it. William Taylor, of the Ship, in Paternoster Row,'
finally agreed to purchase it, for, it is believed, a very moderate sum of
money. Eu.- is said to have realised PS1,000 profit. Its success was so great
that four editions were printed in as many months. It appeared, in the first
instance, with the following preface :---

great service in the publication.

There is no truth in the story, so emu repeated, that "Robinson Greece"
was the (int tale [nihlished ins serial form. That it did appear in ajonrlnl called '
' b ix '
"The Original London Post, or Headroote's Intelligence," is a fact beyond
dispute. We have, however, carefully compared the tale as it there appears with

 

the original edition. It is manifestly a pirated copy. Just so much of the work
is printed as contains the story, with all the reflections omitted. Besides, the date
of publication is subsequent, by a fev: months, to the time when we know the
complete work appeared.

The great success of the first part induced De Foe to write a. second, which
was published in August, l7l9; Part I. having appeared in the previous April.
A map of the world arcompaniml it, to give a greater appearance of truth to the
tale, on which the travels of Crusoe were indicated, and its proper place assigned
to the island.

In the following preface to it. the author lashes with deserved severity the
conduct of those who had published pirated and abridged editions of his work :--

The success the former part of "Iii work has met with in tho world has yet been no
other than is acknowledged to be due to the surprising \'arioty ot' the subject. and to tho
agreeable manner of the [wt-famine>>.

.-\II the endeavours of envious people to reproach it with being a romance. to search it
{or errors in geography. inconsistency in the relation, and contradictions in the fact, have
proved abortive, and as impotent as malicious.

Tho just application of every incident. the roligiour and useful inferences drawn from
every part. are so many twimonios to tho good dodgn of making it public, and must
legitimate all the port that may be enllml invention or parable in the story.

The second part, it the Editor's opinion my pass. is (contrary to tho usage of second
ports) every way as entertaining as the first; contain: as strange and surprising incidents.
and as great a variety of them: nor is the application 1w serious or anitublo; and doubtloss
will. to tho sober as well as ingenious reader. be every way as profitable and diverting; and
this makes tho abridging this work as scandalous as it is knuvisb and ridiculous; seeing. to
shorten the book, that they may seem to reduce the value. they utrip it of all those ro-
fleotions. as well religious as moral. which are not only the greatest beauties of the work,
but am calculated for tho intinito advantage of the render.

By this, they leave the work naked of its brightest ornaments; and yet they would
(at the same tinio they pretend that the Author has supplied tho story out of his in-
vention) take from it the improvement, which alone rccoinmondr that invention to wire and
good Int-n.

Tho injury these men do to tho proprietors of works is a practice all honest man
abhor; and they believe they may challenge them to show the diti'oronce between that and
robbing on tho highway or breaking open a house.

If they can't show any difference in tho crime. they will liutl it hard to show why
there should be any difference in the punishment.

A few words on the source whence the author derived the idea. of his romance
will be appropriate in this place. We can hardly doubt that Do Foe conceived
the idea of " Robinson Crusoe " from the story of Alexander Selkirk. This
man's adventures had been made public, and excited considerable attention, seven
years before the publication of " Robinson Crusoe." Wilson, the biographer of

X
 

 

 

Do Foe, says, "His real name was Seleraig, which he changed to that of Selkirk,
when he went to sea. He was born at Largo, in the county of Fife, in 1676,
and, after a common school education, was put to his father's business, which
was that of a shoemaker. Being a spoiled child, he soon discovered a wayward-
ness of temper that gave much uneasiness to his parents; whilst an early pro-'
pensity to the sea rendered his employment irksome. At length an incident
occurred that put him upon indulging his humour; for, being brought under
church-censure for irregular conduct when he was eighteen years of age, rather
than submit, he suddenly left home, and was never heard of for six years. It
is supposed that he was with the buceaneexs in the South Seas. In 1701 we lind
him again at Largo, but the same intractable person as ever, being engaged in
constant hroils with his fiunily. As the sea was his favourite element, he did not
continue long in Scotland, but, going to London, engaged with Captain Dampier
upon a cruising expedition to the South Seas. This was the voyage that rendered
his subsequent history so interesting to the levels of romanw.

" Being appointed sailing-master of the Cinque Ports galley, a companion
to the St. George, commanded by Dampicr, he lefi. England in the spring of
1703, and, afier various adventures, both vessels reached the island of Juan
FeIIIandez in the following February Afier staying some time to re-l'it, they
sailed again in quest of booty , but' a violent quarrel arising between Selkilk and
his commander, Stradling, which settled into a rooted animosity, the i'ormer
resolved to take the first opportunity of leaving the vessel. This occurred at the
beginning of September, 1704, when her crazy state obliged Stradling to return
to Juan Fernandez. for fmsh repairs; which being oompletod, Selkirk bid a final
ndicu to his comrades at the end of the same month. Upon this island he lived
by himself four years and four months, until he was released by Captain Wotxles
Regen, in the month of February, 1709. He was then engaged as a mute on
board of Rogers' ship, the Duke, and accompanied him during the remainder of
the expedition, conducting himself much to the satisfaction of his employer. At
length, alter a lung and fatiguing cruise, Selkirk arrived in England, in the
month of October, 1711, with a booty of PS800, afier an absence of rather more
than eight years." '

Like Crusoe, Selkirk could not settle to a quiet life on shore; his rest-
lees nature drove him again to sea; and he is said to have died on board ship in
1723. On his first appearance in London he attracted a good deal of attention,
and Sir Richard Steele gave an account of his 'mltlcuw on the island, and his

feelings while there, in a paper published in a journal called "The English-
man."

"'c do not attach the slightest inum'tnnco to a story dictated by the male--
volence of De Fee's political enemies, that Selkirk placed a manuscript, detailing
his adventures, in De Foe's hands for publication; but that, instead of doing
justice to him, he applied the materials so obtained to his own use. The best
authorities have deliberately rejected this idle tale.

In so far as Selkirk passed a certain number of years on an uninhabited
island, he may be truly said to have furnished the idea of Crusoe; but if we are
compelled to admit that he is the central figure in the picture, the subordinate
figures, the grouping, and the scenery are altogether due to the genius of
De Foe. Herein he afi'ords an exact parallel to Shakespeare, who derived the
plots of his immortal dramas, now from an Italian romance, now from passing
events.

'Whatever may have been the origin of the tale, however virulent may have
been the attacks made against its author, as he himself says, by political enemies
and senseless critics, the judgment of the most enlightened men of all nations
has placed " Robinson Crusoe " upon a height which no sounds of animosity can
now reach: What pleasure has this wonderful talc given, and still gives, to all
readers! Young and old, rich and poor, find in its pages on unfailing source of
pure delight.

It blends instruction with amusement in a way no other production ot'hulnau
intellect has ever succeeded in doing. thilc depicting a solitary individual
struggling against misfortune, it indicates the justice and the mercy of Providence ;
and while ineulcating the duty of self--help, asserts the complete dependence of
man upon a higher power for all he stands in need of.

If we consider novels in their relation to life, " Robinson Cntsoe " must win
the prize for truthfulness and reality. How naturally the incidents occur:
There is no deference shown by the author to the exigencies of his story, nor
to dramatic cfl'ect. The characters appear as they do in real life--exercise some
influence for good or evil on the principal figure in the tale--and then disappear,
to be seen no more. Take, for instance, Xury. Would not a novelist of less
power have brought him forward, over and over again, after he had once introduwd
him as the faithful friend of the hero? But De Foe saw fit to do otherwise.
Xury is brought upon the stage; assists the escape of the chief personage in the
drama 2 and is seen no more. Is not this the way of real life?

Nor does the effect of reality stop here. So natural are all the vhurucuu'a,

recorded in it.

For these excellenciee the learned and the good have uniformly persisted in
singling out "Robinson Crusoe" for special commendation. To mention only
two--Rousseau held that it was the book In. boy should read first and red longest.
Dr. Johnson remarked, " Wu there ever anything written by mere man that was
wished longer by its readers, excepting ' Don Quixote,' ' Robinson Crusoe,' and

the ' Pilgrim's Progress? "
In conclusion, we present to our renders the touching lines in which Cowper

surpluses Alexander Selkirk on record his feelings :---

I had two elder brothels, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment 1
of foot in Flainlem, fivruxerly commanded by the Eunous Colonel lnckhztrt, and was killed I
at the battle near Dunki gaimit the Spaniards. \Vhat beanie of my second brother
1 never knew, any more than my father or mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head began
to be tilled very early with rambling thoughts: my father, who was very ancient,
had given me a competent share of learning, as Eur as house-education and a country
free-sebum] generally goes and designed me for the law; but I would be satislinl
with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly
. against the will. nay, the commands of my Either, and agiinst all the entreaties
h l and persimsiona of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something
l I' fatal in that propension of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to

befall me.

_ 1 My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent weasel ngaimt
what he tbmw was my design. He called me one morning into his chamber, where
he was confined by the goat, and exlmtulated very warmly with me upon this subject :
he asked me what muons, more tlmn a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving
my father's house and my alive country, where I might be well introduced, and had a
proxpcct of raising my fortune by application and induxtry, with a life of vase and
pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring,
superior fortunes on the other, who went alnuad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise,
and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common mad;
that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine wxu
the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had
found by long experience was the beat state in the world, the mow suited to human
happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and null 'ingx of the
mechanic part of mankind, and not emlzlrnuml with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of the lulllplIlON ol' ,
this state by this one thing, viL, that this wan the state of life which all other people
envied ; that kings have l'mplently lamented the misemble consequence of being born
to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the gmlt ; that the wise man give his testimony to this, as the
just standard of true felicity, When he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.

lle bade me oluerre it, and I should always find, that the calamities of life
were ~ohared among the upper and lower part of mankind; but that the middle station
had the fewest dimsters, and was not exposed to so many vicisuitndea as the higher or
lower pan of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to 80 III distemper: and
nnextsinesa either of body or mind, ax these were who, by vicioux l ing, luxury, and
. n-xtnn'ag'stnem on one hand, or by hard labour, want of neecfiarios, and main ul'
[ iusuilieient diet on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the natural
unnscqueneex of their war of living ; that the middle station of life was allealated for
all kind of virtues and all kind of eujoyments ; that peace and plenty were the hand-
maids ol'a middle fortune ; that telnwntnee, moderation, quietness health, society, all
agremble direntiong and all tleaimlile pleasures, we": the blwings attending the middle
station of life; that this way mvn went silently and smoothly through the world, and
comfermbly out of it, not emlurmseyed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not,
sold to a life of slavery for daily blend, "if lamented with perplexed circumstances
which rob the soul of lance, and the body of rest; nor enmgod with the pisiion of. \'cnvy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circum-
stances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living
without the bitter ; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every'day's experience

~ . to know it more sensibly.

After this he pruned me earnestly, and in the moat afl'eetionate manner, not to play
the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which Nature, and the station of
life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no ncoursity of
seeking my hmul ; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me firirly
into the station of life which he hadth been recommending to me ; and that if I was
not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere into or firult that must
hinder it ; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his
duty in warning rue against measures which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a word,
that us he would do very kind things for me, if I would stay and settle at home as he
directed. so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give mo any
oumumgcmout to go awuy ; and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an
example, to whom he hnd used the mme earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to
run into the nrmy, where ho was killed; and though he said he would not cease to
pmy for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God
would not bit-x5 inc, and I should have leisure hereafter-to reflect upon having neglected
his counsel, when there might be none to mist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I

suppose my father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the wars run . a

down his firm: very pleutifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed;
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to maist me, he was
so moved that he broke oil" the discourse, und told me his heart was so full he could say
no more to me.

I wus sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could be otherwise? and

fiuhcr'sdcsire But, alas! a few days wore it ull off; and, in short, topmvent any of my
father's further imlmrtunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from
him. However, I did not act quite so hastily neither as the first heat of my resolution
prompted. but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant
than ordiunry, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing tho
world, that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with
- it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; 'that I
'. was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a tlade, or clerk to
: an attorney ; that I was sure1 if I did, I should never serve out my time, but I should

certainly run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she

would speak to my {other to let me go one voyage ahrmd, if I come home again, and
' did not like it, I would go no more, and I would promise, by u double diligence, to

recover the time that I hud lost

' This put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she knew it would he to no
purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject ; that he knew too well what wu
my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt; and that she
wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my
fitthcr, and such kind and tender cXpreesions as she knew my father had used to me ;
and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for ine; but I might

depend I should never have their consent to it; tlurt for her pert, she would not have
so much hand in my destruction ; and I should never have it to say that my mother
was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my hither, yet I heard slut-wards that she
reported all the discounts to him, and that my further, after showing a. greet concern
at it, said to her with a sigh : "That boy might be happy if he would stay at home;
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born ; I can
give no consent to it."
It was not till almost a yarr other this that I hrolre loose, though, in the mean time,
I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busiueu, and frequently
expostulstcd with my lhther and mother sbout their being so positively determined
against whnt they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one dny at Hull,
whither I went casually, and without any purpose of melting an elopement at that
time ; but I my, being there, and one of my companions being going by sea to London .
in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the common sllnrement of P ,_ '
n seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my [usage I consulted neither Jfi
father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them
tohesr of it as they might, without ulcing God's blessing, or my firther's, without any
oonsiderstion of circumstances or consequences, sad in an ill hour, God knows, on the
lot of September, 1051, I went on board s ship bound for London. Never my young
adventurer-'3 misfortunes, I believe, began sooner or oontinued longer than mine. The
ship was no sooner got out of the Humber than the wind begun to blow, and the
see to rise in u most frightful manner ; and, us I had never been at see before, I was ~.'
most inexpmssibly Kick in body, and terrified in mind. I begun now seriously to v -'
reflect upon what 1 lord done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
Hesven for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All
the good counsels of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's entrestiee, came ,
now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of .-
', boldness to which it hus come since, mpreuchcd me with the contempt of advice, and

All this while the storm increused, und the son went very high, though nothing like 4
what I have seen muny times since ; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was
enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything I
of the mutter. I expected every wove would have swallowed us up, and that every
time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the no, we
should never rise more : in this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that
if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot
' ' upon dry land agnin, I would go directly home to my father, end never set it intos
ship again while I lived ; that I would take his advice, Ind never run myu-lf into such
miseries us these any more. Now I aw plainly the goodness of his observations about
the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortable he had lived all his days, and
never bsd been exposed to tempest! at sea, or troubles on shore; end, in short, I
resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my Esther.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, snd indeed
sometime after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea Inlmer, and I began
to be a little innred to it: however, I was very grave for All that dny, being also s
little sewsick still ; but townrds night the weather cleared up, the wind was quits over,

I had slept well in the night, and was nowno more seasick, but veryoheerml,
looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, and
could be so calmend co pleamnt in so little a_ time after. And now,lest my good
resolutions ehould continue, my companion who had ended me away comes to me.

"Well, Bob," aye he, clapping me upon the'ahuulder, "how do you do sitar itl I
warrant you were frighted, wer'n't you. last night, when it blew but a upful of

squall of wind as that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a
bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that ; d'ye see-what charming weather-'tia now 1"

To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way ofall sailors ; the punch
was made, and I was made halfvdriurk with it ; and in that one night's wickedness I
drowned all my repentance, ell my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions V
for the future. In a won], as the see was returned to its smoothness of surfinoe and
settled calmneu by tho abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughta being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the see being forgotten, and
the current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot theorem and promises that
I made in my distm I found, indecd,'some intervals of reflection; and the serious
thoughts did, as it wae, endeavour to return again sometimes ; but I shook them 05,
and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself!>> drink-
ing and company, soon mastered the rehrrn of those fits, for so I culled them ; and I
had, in five or six days, got as complete a victory over my conscience as any young
fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another
trial for it still ; and Providence, us in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me
entirely without excuse ; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next war to
be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both
the danger and the mercy. ~

The sixth day of our being at aeawe came into Yaruiouth Beads ; the wind having
been contrary, and the weather aim, we had made but little wny since the storm.
Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz, at-eouth-weet, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many
ships from Newcastle came into the s'ame Roads, as the common harbour where the ships
-, might wait for a wind {or the River.

' We had not, however, rid here so long, but we should have tided it up the river,
but that thewindhlewtoofreah,and,afierwe had lain four or five dayghlewvery

and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the lust
apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, alter the manner of the
lies 3 but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at
work to strike our topmssts, and make everything snug and cloae, that the ship might -
ride as easy as posible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode
forecastla in, dripped never-a1 seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home ; upon which our master ordered out the sheetanehor, so that we'roda with two

lly this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to tea tenor and
amazement in the faces even of tho seamen themselves. The matter, though vigilant in
the business of preaching the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I
could hear him softly to himself say fievcml tinu-s, " Lord, be merciful to us ! we ahall
be all lost! we shall be all undone! and the like. During these first hurries I was
stupid, lying still in my umbin, which was in the steel-age, and cannot describe
my temper. I could ill resume the tint penitence which I lnul so appurmitly tmmpled
upon, and hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of dmth had been put,
and that this would be nothing too, like the fist ; but, when the master himself came by
me, as I saidjust now, and mid we should be all lost, I was dmulfully frighted. I got
up out ot'mv cabin, and looked out. ; but such a dismal right I never mw ; the sea mu
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes When I could look
about, I could we nothing but (listn-ss round us ; two ships that rode near us, we found,
had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship
which rode about a. mile ahead of us was foul-(loved. Two more ships, being driven
from their ant-hols, were run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventurers and that not
with a must standing. The light ships fared the best, as not. so nmeh labouring in the.
sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only
their apritmil out; before the wind.

Towards evening the mute and lumtawain begged the master of our ship to let them
vnt away the fine-mast, which he was very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain protest-
ing to him that if he did not, the ship would founder. he consented ; and when they had
rut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and shook the ahip so much, they
were ohligud to cut that away also, and make a clear deck.

And one mustjudge what a condition I must be in at all this who was but a young
P'flllur. and who had been iv. such a fright before at but a little. Butif I am express at
this distance the thoughts '1' had about meat that time, I was in tenfold more horror of
mind upon account of my former convictions, aml the having mturncd {mm them to
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and lhcse, added
to the terror of the. storm, put me intosurh a condition, that I can by no worth dwcriho
it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury, that the
realm-n themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. "'3 had a good ship,
but she was deep laden, and wallowedin the sea, so that the seamen every now and
then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage, in one respect. that I did not
know what they meant by founder, till I inquire d. llowevcr, the storm was so violent,
that l raw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship
would go to the bottom. Iu the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our
dish-(mes, one of the men that had been down to see, cried out we had sprung a leak ;
number raid, than: was four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the
pump. At that word, my hmrt, as I thought. died within me ; and I fell backwards
upon the side of n:_v_hcd, where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me,
and told me, that I. that was able to do nothing before, was as wellable to pump as
another; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very heartily.
While this was doing, the master seeing wlne light collie-rs, who, not able to ride out
the storm, wem obliged to slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us,
ordered to lire agnn as a signal of distrwa. I, who knew nothing what they meant,
thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so
surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when cverybodyhsd his own
life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me ; but another man
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, letme lie, thinking I hed
been dead ; and it was a great while before I sure to myself.

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the hold. it was apparent that the ship
would founder; and though the storm begun to share a little, yet as it was not po-ihle
she could swim till we might run into any port, so the master continued firing guns for
help ; and a light ship, who had rid it ontjnst ahead of us, ventured a hoot out to help
us Itwns with the utmost heard the boat came near us; hit it wss impossible for us
to get on hoard, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing
very heartily, and venturing their live to save ours, our men east them a rope over the
stem with a buoy toit, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after much
labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stem. nud got all
into their boat. It was to no pnrpon for them or us, aft...- we were in the beat, to
think of renchiug to their own ship ; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her
in towards shore as much nswe could; and our master promised them, that if the hoat
was shaved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly rowing, and
partiy driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost
as for as Winterton Nos.

We were not much more than n qusrter of an hour out of our ship till we saw hu-
sink, and then I understood for the first time what wns meant by a ship thundering in
the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me
she was sinking; fur from the moment that they rather put me into the heat, than that
I might be said to go in, my heart was, us it were, dead within me, partly with fright.
partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the ear to bring the
bout near the shore, we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to
see the shore) a great nmny people mulling along the strand, to assist us when we
should come new ; but we made but slow way towards the shore; nor were we able
to ranch the shore till, heing past the lighthouse nt \Vinterton, the shorn falls of to the
westward, tomls Cromer, and so the land broke ofi' a little the violence of the wind.
Here we got in, and, though not without much difienlty, got all safe on shore, and
wnlhed afterwards on foot to anmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with
great humanity, as wall by tho nmgistratos of the town, who amigned us good quarters,
as by particuhrr merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sutfieient to
carry us either to London or back to Hull, us we thought fit
~ Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, I had
been happy, and my fnthcr, an emblem of our hlemed Surionr's parsble, had even killed
the fsttcd calf for me ; for hearing the ship I went away in wns east away in

- r Ysrmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances that I was not

drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an ohstinscy that nothing could resist; and
though I had several timas loud calls from my reason, and my more eomposedjudgment,
to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what tonal] this, nor will I
urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on to he the instruments of
our own deetnrction, even though it be before he, and that we rush upon it with our
eyes open. Certain ). nothing but some such deemed unavoidable misery attending.
and which it was impoxm'hle for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against

was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to me alter -we were at
Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town to
several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered;
and looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, sml
telling his father who I was, and how I hod some this voyage only {or a trial, in order
. to go Earther abroad : his hither turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone,

seid I, "will you go to see. no morel" "That is snothercase," said he; 'itismy
calling, and therefore my duty ; but as you made this voyage for n trial, you see what

tinnes he, "what sre.you ; and on what noeount did you go to seat" Upon that I
'Jold him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out into astrange kind of

5 my ship? I would not set my foot in the mme ship with tllee' spin for a thonnnd
pounds." This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet
' agitated by the sense of his lea and woe farther than he could have authority to go.
"However, he afterwards talked very gravely to ma, exhorting me to go back to my
hither, and not tempt Providence to my ruin; telling me I might see a visible handof
Heaven against me. "And, young-man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments,
till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."

London by land ; and there, as well as on the read. had many struggles with.myaelf
what course of life I should take, and whether I should. go'home or go to see!

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that ofi'ered to my thoughts;
and it immediately occurred to me how I should he laughed at among the neighbours,
and should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even everybody else;
from whence I have often since observed, how incongruous 'and irrational the common
temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in
such cases, viz, that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; not
ashamed of the action {or which they ought justly to he esteemed fools, but are ashamed
of the returning, which only can make them he utoemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what measures to
bake, and what course of life to leuL An irresistible reluctance continued to going
home; and as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress I had been in were
of; andasthatabnudflheliule motion Ihmlinmydesirestosreturnworeofi'with
it, till at last I quite laid side the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which mn-ied me first away from my father's house, which
hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune; and that
impressed those'ooneeita so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good sdviee,'

V and'to the entreatiee and even the commands of my father: I say, the same influence,
whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of oil enterprises to my view; and Iwent on board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgar-1y all
it, a voyage to Guinea.' '

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship myself as a
sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked it little hnrder than ordinary, yet at
the some time I should have 1.5:... the duty and office of u forcm-nst man. and in time
mighthavo qualified myself for n mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it
was always my fate to choose for the worst, so I did here; for having money in my
pocket, nnd good clothes upon my back, I would ulwnys go on board in the habit of a
gentleman ; and so I neither hull any business in the ship nor learnt to do any.

It was my lot first of ' all to fiill into pretty good company in London, which does
not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as I then was; the devil
genemlly not omitting to lay some snare for them very early ; but it was not so with
me. I first got acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coastof
Guinea; and who, having had very good success there, was resolved to go again ; this
captain taking a. fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that
time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would 'go the voyage
with him, I should be at no expense; I should be his messmltc and his companion;
and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that the
trade would admit; und perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.

I cmbmced the ofl'cr ; and entering into a strict friendship with this captain, who

(3" was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried I. small
adventure with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I
increased very considerably; for I carried {about PS40 in such toys and trifle: as the
cnptnin directed me to buy. This PS40 Iliad mustered together by the assistance of
some of my relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or
at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful] in all my adventures, and
which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the mph-in ; under whom also I
got a competent knowledge of the nmthemuties nnd the rules of navigation, learned how
to keep an account of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, to under-
stand some things that were needl'ul to he understood hya sailor; for, us he took delight
to instruct me, I took delight to learn ; and, in in word, this voyage made me both a
I suilur und u merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my

hip. udrenture, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost PS300 ; and this filled me
with those uspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I was con-

, tinually sick, being thrown into a violent calentune by the excessive hat of the climate;

- our principil tmding being upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north,

' even to the line itself.

I "'xh' now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, in my great misfortune,
dying soon after his urrirnl, I resolved to go the same voynge agniu, and I emhurked in
the sumo vessel with one who was his mute iii the former voyngc, und lnul now got the

Here I modihtetl nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to
efl'ect it; but found no way that had the least probability In it; nothing presented
to make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to' oommuniate it to that would ,
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman there but

I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in panties.

After about two years, an odd cimumshnce presented itself, which put the old
thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in' my head. My patron lying at
home longer than usual without fitting out his ship, which, as I hand, was for want of
money, he used, constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes ottener, if the weather was
fair, to take the ship's pinnaoe, and go out into the road ofi<hing , and as he always
tool: me and a young Moresoo with him to row the 'boat, we made him very mzrry, and
I proved very dexterons in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes he would send me
with a Moor, one of his Huston, and the youth the Moreno, as they called him, to
catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a-fishing with him in a calm morning, a fog rose
so thick, that though we were not halfa league from the shore, we lost sight of it ; and
rowing we knew not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and :1! the next night ;
and when the morning came. we found we had pulled out to sea. insteadof pnl'.ug in for
the shore; and that we were at least two leagues from the land. However, we got
' "II in again, though with . great dal of labour, and some danger; for the wind
began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but partiurlarly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of himself
for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our English ship which he
had taken, he resolved he would not go mfirhing any more without a compass and
some provision; so he ordered the mentor of his ship, who also was an English
slave, to build a 'littlo lute-room, or cabin. in the middle of the long-hoot, like
that of n barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer, end haul home the main-
sheet; and room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed
with what we call a shonlder--ofimutton sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of
i the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to lie, with a
slave or two, and a table to at on, with some small locker-s to put in some bottles
of such liquor as he thought fit to drink ; and particularly his breed, rice, and codes.

We went frequently out with this boat a-fisbing ; and as I was most dexterous '
to each fish for him, he never went without me. It happened that he had sp- .
pointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three
Moors of some distinction in that place, and for whom he had provided extnordi-'
verily, and had therefore sent on board the boat overnight a larger store of pro.
visions than usual ; and had ordered me to get ready three fusils' with powder
and shot, which were on board his ship, for that they designed some spoIt of fowling

' ' us well as fishing.'

I got all things ready as be had directed; and waited the next morning with
' the bunt washed clean, lIer sneientf and pendants out, and everything to smommo-
ditto his guests; when hy-aIId-by my patron ame on board alone, and told Ina his
guests had put ofl' going. from some business that fell out, and ordered me, with
the man and boy, ss usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, for

that his friends were to sup at his house ; he commanded me too, that as soon as I had
got some fish, I should bring it homo to his house: all which I prepared to do.

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts, for now
I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and my master being
gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not {or fishing businma, but for a voyage ; though
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I would steer; for anywhere
to get out of that place was my desim.

My first contrivunce was to make a. pretence to speak to this Moor. to get some--
thing for our sulmistcnee on board ; for I told him we must not presume to eat of our
patron's bread. He said, that was true; so he broughta large basket of rusk or biscuit
of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into tho boat. I knew where my patron's
case of bottles stood, which it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some
English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on show,
as if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a great lump of bau-
wax into the boat, which weighed about half an hundrodweiglrt, Wilh a parcel of twine
or thread, a hatchet, I saw, and a hammer, all of which were of great use to us after-
ward>>, especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which
he innocently came into also - his name was Ismael, which they call Mnley, or Moely;
no I milled to him z--"Moel said 1, "our patron's guns an: all on board the boot;
can you not get a little powder and xlroti It may he we may kill some alwmies (a
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the guuner's atoms in the
ship." " Yes," uys Ire, "I'll bring some :" accordingly, he bmughta great leather pouch,
which held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more 3 and another with
shot, that had live or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat. At
the same time, I had found some powder of my hunter's in the great cabin, with which
I filled one of the large botths in the arse, which was almost empty, pouring what
was in it into another; and thus furnished with everything needl'ul, wo sailed out of
the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we wore,
and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we
hauled in our sail, and sat us down to fish. The wind blow from tho N.N.E., which
was contrary to my desire ; for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made
I ' the cmst of Spain, and at least reached to the" bay of Cadiz; but my moluliomi were,
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid place when: I was, and
leave the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for when I had fish on my hook
I would not pull them up, that he might not see them, I said to the Moor, "This will
not do; our master will not be thua served; we must stand further 061" He, think-
ing no harm, agreed, and, being in the head of the boat, set the sails; and, as I had
the helm, I ran the boat out-near a league further, and then brought her to as if I
would fish ; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was,
and making as it" I stumped for something behind him, I took him by surprise with my
arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose im-
mediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in, telling me
he would go all m'er the world with me. He swam so strong after the bout, that he
would have reached me very quickly, them being but little wind ; upon which I stepped
into the (tibia, and fetching ono of the fowliug-pim, I presented it at him, and told
him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be Ipliet I would do him uone : " But,"
said I, "you swim well enough to reach the shore, and the sea is earn: ; make the
best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm ; but if you come near the
bout, I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to hove my liberty." So he
turned himselfnbout, and swsm for the shore, and I nuke no doubt but he reached it
with ease, for he was on excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have drowned the
boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I turned to the
boy, whom they called any, and said to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll
make you n great man; but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me," that
is, swear by Mnhomet and his father's heard, "I must throw you into theses too."
The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust hilu, Ind
swore to be faithful to me, nnd go all over the world with me.

\Vhile I wee in the view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly
to sea, with the boat rather stretching to windward, that they might think me gone
towards the Straits" month (".5 indeed any one that had been in their wits must
have been xnplxnled to do): fur who would have supposed we were sailing on to the
southward lo the truly harbnrinn court, where whole nations of nogrous were sure
to surround us with their canoes, and destroy us ; where we could never once go on
shore but we should be devoured by ravage busts, or more inercilom euvnges of
human kind l

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, end steered
directly south and by mist, bending my course a little towards the east, that I might
keep in with the xhore : and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth, quiet see,
I made such sail that I believe by the nest day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when
I tilst nude the land, [could not be less than one hundred nnd fifty miles south of
Sullee: qhim beyond the Emperor of Moroeeo's dominions, or indeed of any other king
thermbouhg for we saw no pulpit:

Yet such was the fright I had tuken at the Moon, and the dreadful apprehension
I had of falling into their hands, thnt I would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an
anchor, the wind continuing fnir, till I had sailed in tlmt manner five days ; and then,
the wind shifting to the southwxn-d, I concluded else that if any of our veuela were in
chase of me, they also would now give over; so I ventured to nuke to the coast, and
mine to an anchor in the month of a little river, I knew not whnt nor where; neither
n'hnt latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I neither sow, nor desired
to see any people; the principal thing I wanted wee fresh water. "'0 come into
this creel: in the evening, mlviug to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful

4' noise; of the barking, roaring. and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what

kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with four, and begged of me not to go
on shore till day. "\Vell, any," said I, " then I won't; but it may be we may
see men by day, who will be on bed to no as those lions." "Then we give them the
shoot gun," says Xury, huughing, "make them run wey." Such English Xury spoke
by conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful,
and I gave him 1 dram (out of our putmn'x one of bottles) to cheer him up. Alter
all, Xury'e udvioe was good, end I took it: we dropped our little anchor, and lay
still ell night; I my still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours we new
vast grunt creature. (we knew not whet to cull them), of my aorta, come down to
the see-ohm, and run into the voter, wallowing and washing themaelvu for the

pleasure of cooling thonuwlva; and they made such hideous howlings and yelling>>;
that I never indeed heard the like. .
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both more
. frightcd when we heard one mighty creature come swimming towards our bout;
we could not see him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be u monstrous, huge,
and furious beast. any mid it was u lion, and it might be so for nught I know;
but poor any cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. "No," says I, " Xury ;
we can slip our clble, with the buoy to it, and go to sea; they cannot follow us far."
I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature, whatever it was, within two
N onm' length, which something surprised me ; however, I immediately stepped to the
cabin-door, and taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which he immediately turned
about, and swam towards the shore again.

But it in impossible to describe the horrid noism, and hideous cries and howlinga
that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon
the noise or report of a gun, a thing I have some reason to believe those emtum
hnd never heard before. This convinced me that there was no going on shore for us
in the night upon that coast ; and how to venture on shore in the day was another
question too ; for to hnve [alien into the hands of any of tho savages, had been 98 bad

as to have fallen into the pawn of lions and tigers; at least we were equally appre-
hcuxh'c of the danger of it.

" '-- suoormc A LION. .. - .~
\-- E __--_____
'lii Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left this place ; nnd

once in particular, being eorlyin the morning, we come to an anchor under a. little point
of lend. which was pretty high; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go
; farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, calls
' " soltly tome, and tells me that we had best go farther ofl' the shore; " for," says he " look,
' yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hilloclr, fast nalcep." I looked where
he pointed, and saw u dreadful monster indeed, for it was It ten--ihle great lion that lay
on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a
. little over him. "Xury," says I, " you shall go on shore and kill him." Kin-y looked
5, frighted. and said, "Me kill! he cut me at one mouth;" one mouthful he meant.
I However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him be still, and tool: our biggest gun,
i which was almost musket-bore, nnd loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with
I two slugs, and laid it down ; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and the third
ii (for we had three piceu) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I
. could with the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he lay so, with his leg raised
,1 A little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone.
5 He started up, growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again ; and then
i i got up upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a
little surprised that I had not hit him on the hood ; however, I took up the second
V piece immedintcly, and though he began to move off, tired again, and shot him in
' the hand, and had the pleasure to see him drop; nnd making but little noise, he lay
I struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
1 "Well, go," mid I; so the boy jumped into the water, and taking the little gun in
' one hnnd, svmm to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creature,
t
i
'l

 

put the muzzle of the piece to his cor, and shot him in the head ngnin, which
dispatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry to lose
three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to us.
However, Xury said he would have some of him ; so he comes on board, and asked me
, to give him the lmwhet. " For what, Xury'l" said I. " Me cut off his head," said he.
:' However, Xury could not cut off his head, but he cut oil' n foot, and brought it with

,/ him, and it wns a monstrous great one.

"I," I bcthought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him might, one way or
other, he of some value to us; and I resolved to take oi? his skin if I could. So Xury
and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for I
x , knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us up both the whole day, but at last we

 

got off the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun efi'ectually
\ dried it in two days' time, and it alterwuds served me to lie upon.
i After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days, living
i very sparingly on our provisions, which began to abate very much, and going no ottener
. into the shore than we were obliged to {or fresh water. My design in this was, to make
I the River Gambia or Senegal; that is to say, anywhere about the Cape do Void, where
I was in hopes to meet with some Europe-tn ship; and if I did not, I knew not what
course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there among the negroea. I
knew that all the ships fi-oni Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to
Bmzil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or those islands; and, in a word, I put
>- the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must meet with some
"i * ship, or must perish.

'>>":.;v>"'"'""""" ...I at that distance know what it was. I found quickly the negroea were for eating the

   
 

flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as a favour from inc;
which, when I made signs to them that they might take it, they were very thankful _
for. Immediately they fell to work with him ; and though they had no knife, yet, with
a sharpened piece of wood, they took otl' his skin as readily, and much more readily,
than we would have done with a knife. They offered me some of the fluh, which I
declined, making as if I would give it them ; but made signs for the skin, which
they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provision, which,
though I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then I made signs to them for some
water, and held out one of my I: to them, taming its bottom upward, to show that it.
was empty, and that I wanted to have it tilled. They mllcd innnediatcly to some of

 

their friends, and then: came two women, and brought a great vcxscl made of earth, >
and burnt, as I snplmse, in the sun; this they set down for me, as before, aml I sent l:
any on shore with my jam, and filled them all three. The women- wew as stark i,

naked as the men. I"
I was now furnished with roots aml corn, such as it was, and water ; and leaving Pp."
my friendly negm, I made. forward for about eleven days more, without offering to I
~ .

go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about the
distance of four or tiv leagues before me ; and the. sea being very calm, I kept a huge

 

oiling to make this point. At length, doubling the point at about two leagues from the 7?".
land, I saw plainly land on the Olllt'l' side, to seaward ; then I concluded, as it was E:
most certain indeed that this was the Cape dc "enl, and those the islands called, from "2""
thence, Cape de Vcrd leands. However, they were at a great distance, and I could Ii. __
not well tell what I had best do; for if I should be taken with a fresh gale of wind, I 2?
might neither reach one or other. ' 3 V
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the. cabin,and out me down, Xury PS53: '.

having the helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cn'ed out, " Master, master, a ship with a .--
suil !" and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits thinking it must needs be some A -

I .- of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their ' ', ,

 

* their perspective glasses, and that it was some European boat, which they supposed must

reach. I jumped ant of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but that it
was a. Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, was bound to the coon of Guinea, for
negrocs. But, when I oliserved the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were
bound some other way, and did not design to go any nearer the shore: upon which
I stretched out to the sea as much as I could, molving to speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in their way,
but that they would be gone by before I could make any signal to them: but after I
had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of

belong to some ship that was lost: so they shortened mil to let me come up. I was
encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to
them for a signal of distress, aml fired a gun, both which they saw ; for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they very kindly

brought to, and lay by for me ; and in about three honrs' time. I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French, but I
understood none of them ; but at last a Scotch sailor, who was on board, called to me: ' ,
and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that had made my escape
out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee; they then bade me come on board, and very ' '
, \

 

kindly took me in, and all my goods.

.<< In. -- _ >>.~.1N THE BRAZILS.

It was an inexprwrible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I was thus
delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition a: I
was in ; and I immediately ofl'ercd all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for
my dclivemncc; but he generously told me, he would take nothing from me, but that
all I had should be delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. " For," says he,
" I huve saved your life on no other terms than as I would be glad to be saved myself;
and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition.
lit-sides" arid he, " when I carry you to the Bruzils, so great a. way from your own
country, if I should take from you what you have, you will be starved there, and then
I only take away that life I have given. No, no," says he; "Seignor Inglese" (Mr.
Euglishnmn), " I will czm-y you thither in charity, and these things will help you to buy
your subsistence there, and your passage home again."

As he wins chuvitahlc in this propoml, so he was just in the perfonnaneo to a tittle;
for he ordered the saline)>>, that none should oflcr to touch anything I had : then he took
everything into his own possession, and gave me back un cxact inventory of them, that
I might lmve them, even to my three mrthen jars.

As to my boot, it was :1 very good one; and that he saw, mid told me he would buy
it of me for the ship's use; and asked me what I would huvo for it. I told him, he
hud been so generous to me in everything, thut I could not ofl'er to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him : upon which, he told me he would give me a note
of his hand to puyme eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ; and when it came there, if
any one oll'oved to give more, he would nmke it up. He ofl'ercd me also sixty pieces of
eight more for my boy Xury, which I win: loth to take 5 not that I was unwilling to
let the captain have him, but I wns very loth to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had
ussisted me so fuithfully in procuring my own. However, when I let him know my
ralson, he owned it to be just, and ofi'ered me this medium, that he would give the boy
un obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian : upon this and Xury
suying he. was willing to go to him. I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the Bay de Todoe los
Santos, or All Saints Buy, in about twenty-two days aflcr. And now I was once more
delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life ; and what to do next with
myself I was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough remember:
he would take nothing of me for my pumage, gave me twenty duoats for the leopard's
skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, nnd caused everything I
had in the ship to be punctunlly delivered to me; and what I was willing to sell, ho

-' , bought of me: such as the ease of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of

bees'-\vnx, for I lmd nmdo candles of the rest: in u word, I made about two hundred
and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock, I went on shore in the

' Bruzils.

I had not been long here, but being recommended to the house of a good, honest
man, like himself, who had nu ingmio, as they on." it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-
house), I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that means, with the
manner of their planting and making ofsugar ; and seeing how well the plantar: lived, and
how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I would
turn planter among them ; resolving, in the meantime, to find out some way to get my
money, which I had lelt in London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of
letter of naturalimtion, I purchased as mneh land that was uncured as my money wouldreach, and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement ; such a one as might be
suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but bonr of English parents, whose
name was \Vells and in much such circumstances as I was. I call him neighbour,
because his plantation lay next to urine, and we went on very sociahly together. My
stock was but low, as wall as his ; and we rather planted for food than anything else,
for about two years. However, we began to increase, and our land began to come into
order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large
piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to oorrre ; but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy
Xury.

But, alas: for rrrc to do wrong that never did right, was no great wonder. I had
no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment. quite remote to nry genius
and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, :rrrd for which I forsook my father's
house, and broke through all his good advice; rnry, I was coming into the very middle
station, or upper rltgree of low life, which my father advised me to before, and which, if
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have stayed at home, and never fatigued
myself in the world. as I have done ; and I used often to my to myself, "I could have
done this as well in England, among nry friends, as have gone five thousand miles oil' to
do it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness nml at such a distance as never to
hear from any part of the world that had the least. knowledge of me."

In this rrrarruer I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret. I had
nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work to be done, but
bv the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I livcdjust like a nrarr cast away upon
some desolate island, that. had nobody there but himself. But how just has it been ;
and how should all men rcllcct, that when they compare their present conditions with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced
of their former felicity lry their experience : I say, how just has it been, that the truly
solit: - ' life I reflected on, in an island, or mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so
often r justly compared it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I
had. in all probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation, before
my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back - for the ship
remained there, in providing her lading, and preparing for her voy ge, near three
months; when, telling him what little stock I had left behind me in London, Ire gave
me this friendly and sincere advice :--"&>ignor Inglose," says he (for so he always
called me), "if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me, with orders
to the person who has your money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such
persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring
you the produce of them, God willing, at my return; but, since lrunrau alfairs are all
subject to changes and disasterzg I would have you give orders but for one hundred
pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the
first; so that, if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry,
you rrray have the other half to have recourse to for your supply."

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not but be
convinced it was the best course I could take ; so I accordingly prepared letters to the

gentlcwoman with whom I had left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese
captain, as he desired.r'

Neither was this all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such as cloth,
stufls, heirs, and things particularly valuablo and dean-able iu the country, I found
means to sell them at a very great advantage; so that I may any, I had more than
four times-tho value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour
._1 mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought me
a negro slave, and an European servant also: I mean another besides that which
the uphill blought me from Lisbon.

. But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our greatest
adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with glint sum in my plan-
tation: I misedfiitygmtrollsoftobaccoonmyownground, morethan I had disposed
of for necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a
hundred weight, were well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet kom
Lisbon. And now inmrsing in business and wealth, my laced began to' be full of
projects and undertakings beyond my reach ; such as are indeed often the ruin of the
best heads in business. Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for
all the happy things to have yet bobllen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly described the middle
station of life to be full of; but other things attended me, and I was still to be
the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly, to increase my fault and
double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to
make, all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adheringto my _ '_
foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination, in contradicfion
to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects
and those measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to present me with,
and to make my duty.

As I had one done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I could not be
content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and thriving
man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rush and inrmodmte desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I met myself down spin into the
drcpmt gulf of human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent.
with life, and a state of haillh in the world.

To come then by just degrees to the particulars of this part of my story :--
You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning
to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the
languagq but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as
well as among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which was our port; and that, in
my discourse among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two voyages
to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes there, and how easy it
was to purchase upon the coast for (rifles--such as head; toys, knives, scissors, hatchets,
bits of glue, and the like--not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, kc, but
negroes, {or the service of the Bran'ls, in great numbers

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads, but especially
to that part which related to the buying negroca; which was a trade, at that time, not
only not fit entered into, but, as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assiento,
or perminion of the King of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock; so
that few uegroes were brought, and those exoeanvdy dear. .

It happened, being in company one day with some merchants and planters of my ac- c
quainta'nce, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them (nine to me the next

morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon what I had discern-sod

of with them the last night, and they came to make a secret propoml to me ; and, utter
enjoining me seeresy, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Guinea; that they had all plantatioua as well as I, and were atmiteuetl for nothing so
much as max-rants; that m it want a. trade that could not be. carried on, because they \, .
could not publiel ' "II the neg-mes when they came home. so they desired to make but l
one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them among their own I

; plantations ; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would go their supercnrgo in f
1 the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they ofl'ercd me that ."i
I; I should have my equal xhare of the negroes, without providing any part of the stock. .23
ll This was a. fair pmposal, it must be oonfeued, had it been made to any one that had , I'
l | not had a. settlelnrnt and plantation of his own to look alter. which was in a. fair way :1.
ol'coming to be very considerable, aml with a. good stock uron it. But for me, that :-

h was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, '1

r. England; and who in that time, and with that little addition, could scam: have failed (:1
,1 of being "'0th three or four thousand pounds aterling, and that inenqming too--for me 1'-

~11 to think of such a. voyage was the most preposterona thing that over man in such
4 circumstances could be guilty of. ,

~ But I, that was born to be my own deatmyer, could no more resist the offer, ' '.
than I could restrain my first rambling designg when my father's good counsel was

i 'l but upon me. In award, I told them I would go with all my heart, if they would
undertake to look after my plantation in my abicnce, and would dispose of it as I
should direct, it'I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings.

or covenants, to do so ; and I made a formal will,disposing of my plantation and ell'eet: 1,,
in case of my death, making the utptain of the ship that had saved my life, a: \z't'}
heron-7 my universal heir, but obliging him to dis-wise of my efieeto as I had '

,5 _

directed in nly will; one-half of the produce being to himself, and the other to be
shipped to England.

In short, I took all lumible caution to preserve my edema, and to keep up my
plantation. Had I used half an much prudenceto have looked into my own interest,
and have made a judgment of what I ought to have done and not to have done,
I had certainly never gone away from xo prosperous an undertaking, leaving all'
the pmhable views of a thriving cireulnsmnw. and gone upon a voyage to sea.
attended with all its conunon haumla, to any nothing of the muons I had to ex-
pact lm-tieular misfortunes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather than

my u-axon; and, aeconlingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo finished.
and all things done as by agleement, by my partnem in the voyage, I went on
,- - hoard in an evil hour again, the let of September, 1659, being the some day eight years
'1. that I went from my hither and mother at Hall, in order to act the rebel to their
_ it} authority, and the fool to my own interest.
A Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns, and
fourteen men, besides the mentor, his boy, and myself; we had on hand no largo
cargo of goothz, except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negro",
such as bank bits offglass, shell", and odd trifles, especially little looking-glass"
knives. seistora, Inttcheta, and the like.

The Same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to tho northward

knowledge. It begun from the Ninth-east, come about to the north-went. and than
settled into (ho north-mutt ; from whence it blew in such a terrible nuumor, that for

In this llinirusi \ve luul, besides the turrur of the storm, one of our men dicl of

towards tlmt ofthe river Oniouoquemomlnonly culled tho Grout River; and now he began
to consult with me what ammo he should take; for the ship was leaky, and very much
dimbled, and he was for going directly bwk to the coast of Email.

I was positively ogninst tlmt; nnd looking over the charts of the swcoast of
America with him, we concluded there was no inhsbitod country for us to have
recount.) to till we come within the circle of the Cnrribbee Islnndx, nnd therefore revolved
to stand nwny for Burlindocs ; which, by keeping 091' at sea, to nvoid the iu-draft of the
buy or gnlfol'Mexim, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifleen days sail;
whereas we could not pomibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some
assistance both to our ship nnd to ourselves.

With this design we changed our mum, and Mend'awey NJV. by W., in order to
reach some of our English islnuds, when: I hoped for relief; but our voyage was other-
wise determined ; 'for, being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a
second storm came upon us, which curried us away with the same impetuoeity westwud,
and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce, that had all our lives been saved
as to the ear, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than ever
returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very haul, one of our men early one
morning cried out, " Land !" and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in
hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, then the ship struck upon o send,
and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a
manner, that we expected we should all luwc perished immediately; and we worn
even driven into our close quarters to shelter us from the very foam and spray
of the sea.

It in not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to describe
or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances. We knew nothing where
we were, or upon what land it was we were driven; whether an island or the main. _
whether inhabited or not inhabited As the rage of the wind wasstill great, though
rather lees'than at first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, should
turn immediately about. In a word, we set looking one upon another, and expecting
death every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as preparing for mother world;
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this; that which was our present
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did
not break yet. and that the master said the wind Wn to abate

Now, though we thought thut the wind did a little abate, yet the ship having thus
struck upon the mud, and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off, we were in
a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as
well as we could. We had a boat at our stern just before the storm, but the was first
stared by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke away, and
either sunk, or wua driven oi? to em; so there was no hope from her. We had another
bout on board, but how to get her ofl' into the sea. wus a doubtful thing; however, there
Vine no room to debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and
some told us she was actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel hrys hold of the boat, and with the help of
the rest of the men, they got her flung over the ship's side ; and gettingall into her, let go,
I nd committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy and the wild sea. : for
though the storm was abated considerably, yet the see went dreadfully high upon the
shore, and might be we" called den wild see, us the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw plainly, that the sea
went so high, that the bout could not escape, and that we should be inevitably drowned
As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could we have done anything with it ;
so we worked at the oer towards the land, though with heavy hurts like men going to
execution; for we all knew that when the boat arms near the shore she would
' be dashed in a. thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed
r_ uur souls to God in the meet earliest manner; and the wind driving us towards the
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hunda, pulling as well as we could
' Iownnls laud.

What the shore was whether rock or sand, whether sleep or shoal, we knew not;
the only hope that could mtionally give us the least shadow of expectation, was, if we
might happen into some boy or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by great chance
we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the loud, and perhaps made
smooth water. But there was nothing of this appeared; but as wemnde nearer and
narrer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.

Ailer we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and on half, at we reckoned it,
a raging were, mountain-like, came rolling aster-n of us, and plainly bade us expect the
coup de grace. In a word, it took us with such afury, that it over-net the beat at once ;
and separating us as well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly
to say, " 0 God!" for we were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I sank into the
water: for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so
as to draw breath, till that wave'having driven me, or uther carried me, a vast way on
towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost
dry, but halfdend with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well
as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon myAFTER THE 'TORM.

feet, and endanvoow-d to make on townqu the land as fmt as I could, before another
wave should Nturn and take me up again ; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid
it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and us furious as an enemy,
which l had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to hold my
breath, and misc myselfulx-n tho water, if I could ; and so by swimming to preserve
my breathing, mul pilot myself towards the shore if possible, my greatest conceni now
being, that the wave, as it would carry me a great way towards tho shun: when it came
on, might not carry me back agiin with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep
in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty fame and swiftnem
towards the shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to
swim still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with holding my breath,
when us I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and
hands shoot out above the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds
of lime that I could keep myself on, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and
new courage. I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long but I
hold it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and [again to return, I struck
forward against the return ofthc waver, and felt ground again with my fwt. I stood
still a few moments to recover breath, and till the waters went from me, and then
took to my heels and ran with what strength I had, further towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the pen, which came pouring in after
me again; and twice more I was lifted up by the wan-s and carried forwards as
before, tho shore being very flat.

The last time of these two bad well nigh been fatal to me; for the sen having
hurried me along, as before, landed Inc, or rather dashed me, against a piece ofn rock,
and that with sin-h force, as it 1 ft mo senseless, and indeed helpless as to my own
deliv nice; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite
out of my body ; and had it returned ugnin immediately, I must have been xtmngled in
the water; but I teem-cred a little before the ieturn of the warts, and seeing I should
be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to
hold my bmnth, if poxxible, till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so
high as at find, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched
another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, though it went
over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away ; and the next I'l"I I took,
I got to the main land ; where, to my great comfort, I clumbercd up the clifts of the
shore, and sat me down upon the gram, free from danger, and quite out of the reach of

', the water.

I was now landed, and mfo on r-horc, and began to look up and thank God that my
life was saved, in a cause wherein there was mine minutes before scarce any mom to
hope. I believe it is illllmstilbll: to expn-sg to the life, what the ccstacies and trumpet-ts
ot' the soul are, when it is so mvcd, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not
\voutlcr now at that custom, when n nialefnotor, who has the halter about his neck, is
tied up, and jmt going to be turned MT, and has n. reprieve brought to him--I say, I do
not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very moment they
tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and

overwhelm him.
For sudden joyl, like grids. confound at fit-Al.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being," I may say,
wrnpt up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a thousand gestures end I
motion, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned,
and that there should not be one soul saved but myself; for, as for them. I never saw
than: afterwards, or any aign of them. except three of their hats, one cup, and two shoes
that were not follows.

I cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the sen being so
big. I could hardly see it, it lay so firr off; and considered, Lord! how was it possible I
could got on shore? '

Alter I had solaeed my mind with the comfomble port of my condition, I began to
look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done: nud
I soon found my comforts abate, and tlmt, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance: for
I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to comfort
mo; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that of polishing with hunger, or
being devoured by wild beasts: and that which was particularly afflicting to me wna,
that I had no wuipon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or
to defend myself against any other creature that might dudro to kill me for their-r. In
I. word, I had nothing about me but a knife, is tobacco-pipe, and a. little tobacco in a
box. This was all my provision ; and this throw me into terrible agonici of mind, that
for a while I run about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began, with n hmvy
hurt, to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that
country, seeing at night they 'nlwnyu come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy thnt offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to get up into a thick
bushy tree, like a fur. but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all
night, and consider the next dny whnt death I nhould die, for as yet I new no proqicet
of life I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find my {rah water
to drink, which I did to my great joy ; and hm'ing drunk, and put a little tobacco in
my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to
place myself so that if I should sleep I might not fall. And having out me a short
mick, like u truucheou, for my defence, I took up my lodging; and being excee-
zsivoly fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably on, I believe, few could
have done in my condition, and found myself more refrmhed with it than I think
I ever was on such an occasion.

When I wakod it was bro-id day, the weather clear, and the storm abated. so that
the an did not rage and swell a before 5 but that which sur'prinod me most won, that
the ship was lined ofl' in the night from the and where she lay, by the swelling of the
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I
_ had been so bruised by the wave dashing me ngninxt it. This being within about-2

<< mile from the shore when: I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wiahed
myselfon board, that at least I might save some nweenn-y things for my use.

I \Vhon I come down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me again, and

' the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and son had tow her up,

upon the land, about two miles on my right land. I walked as far as I could upon the

I ' shore to have got to her; but fuund a neck, or inlet, of water between me and the boat

which was about half a mile broad ; so I come back for tho present, being more intent
apou getting at the ship, wherel hoped to find something for my present subsistence.
A little after- noon I found the nee very calm, and tho tido ebbed so far out, that I
could come within a quarter ofa mile of the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing
of my grief; for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all cafe:' "' ' .I
, that is to say, we had all got. safe on shore, and I had not hecn no miscmhle
as to be left emimly destitute of all comfort nml conqnmy, as I now was
This forced war: a; my eyes again ; but as thew- wns little relief in that.
I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled ofl' my clothes for the wetting: m
hot to extremity, and book the water. But when I came to the ship, my difliculty was

still greater to know how to get. on board ; for, IS she lny aground, and high out of the
i water, thermwas nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swnm round her twin, nnd

the second time I copied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I'did not see at first,

whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I know in general what
it contained. '

My next one was for some ammunition and arms. There were two very good
finding-pieces in the grant cabin, and two pistols. These I secured first, with some
lmwder-homs, a small bog of shot, and two old rusty swords. I know there were
three barrels of powder in the ship, but know not where our gunner had stowed them ;
but with much search I found them, two of them'dry and good, the third had taken
water. These two I got tomy raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty
well freighwd, and began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither
mil, our, nor rudder; and the least cupful of wind would have over-sot all my navigstion.

I had three encouragement" first, a smooth, eulm sea ; secondly, the tide rising, and
setting in to the shore; thirdly, what little wind there was blew me towards the lund.
And thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the
tools which were in the chest, two saws, an axe, and a. hammer: with this cargo I put
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my ralt went very well, only that I found it. drive
a little distant from the place where I had landed before; by which I perceived that
there was some indmfi of the water, and consequently, I hoped to find mnne creek or
river there, which I might make use ofas a port to get to land with my mrgo.

As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little opening of the land.
I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as I
could, to keep in the middle of the stream.

But here I luul liked to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think
verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the crust. my raft ran
aground at one end of it upon a shoal, 91nd not being <<ground at the other end, it
wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that was afloat.
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost by setting my back against the chests,
to keep them in their places, but could not. thrust off the raft with all my strength;
neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests with all my
might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water
brought me a little more upon a level; and, n little after, the water still rising. my raft
floated again, and I thrust her off with the our I had into the channel, end then driving
up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on
both side}, and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for l. proper
pluce to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river; hoping,
in time to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to phice myself as near the coast
as I could.

At length I spied a. little cave on the right shore of the creek, to which, with great
pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near, that reaching ground with
my our, I could thrust her directly in. But here I had like to have dipped all my
air-go into the sen agnin; for that shore lying pretty steep--that is to soy, sloping----
there was no place to land, but where one end of my limit, if it ran on shore, would lie
so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again.
All that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with
my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it: fast to the shore, near a flat piece of
ground, which I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. A: soon-s I
found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two hroken' oars
into the ground--one on one side, near one end, and one on the other side, near theNOT AVAILABLE

sheet load ; butthix last vms so heavy I could not hoist it up to get itover the ship's side.

Besides them things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-
top mil. a hammock and some bedding ; and with this I loaded my second run, and
brough' them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort~

I was under some apprehension during my absence from the land, that at last my
provisions might be devoured on shore; but when I came back, I found no sign of any
visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild mt. upon one of the chests, which. when I
came towards it, ran away a little distance, and then stood still. She sat very composed
and unconcemcd. and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with
me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not under-sluud it, she was perfectly
unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which I towed her a bit of
biscuit, though, by the way. I was not very free of it, for my store was not great ; how-
ever, I spared her a bit, I my, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it, and
looked (as pleased) for more; but I thanked her. and could spare no more: so she
marched olT.

Having got my second cargo on shore--though I was obliged to open the barrels of
puvder, nnd bring them by parcels, for they were too hau'y. being large cnsks--I went
to work to make me a little tent, with the sail, and some poles which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil either with
rain or sun ; and I piled all the empty chests and auxin: up in a circle round the tent, to
fortifv it from any sudden attempt. either from man or beast.

\Vhen I had done this I blocked up the door of the tent with some boards within,
and on empty chest not up on end without ; and spreading one of the beds upon the
ground. laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night. I was \'ery weary and heavy ;
for the night before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all (lav, as well to
to fetch those things from the ship, as to get. them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I believe, for one
man; but still I was not satisfied, for while the ship sat upright in that posture, I
thought I ought to get everything out of her that I could; so every day, at low water,
I went on board. and brought away something or other ; but particularly the third time
I went, I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes
and rope twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails
upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the

time as I eould, for they were no more useful to me for sails, but as mere canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still. was that at last of nll,after I had made five
or six such voyages as these, and thought I had not-hing more to expect from the ship
that was worth my meddling with--I say, other all this, I found a great hogsheml of
bread, three large runlets of rum, or spirits, a box of fine sugar. and a barrel of fine
flour: this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more pmyiaions
' except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and
wrapped it up. parcel by parcel, in pieces of the soils, which I cut out ; and, in sword, I
got all this safe on shore also, though at am end timer.

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the ship of what ,ROBINSON MAKES PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE.

was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cable; cutting the great cable into
pieces such as I could move, I got two able and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-
work I could get; and having cut down the apritsail-yard, and the arisen-yard. and
everything I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods and
aruo away ; but my good luck began to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy,
and so overladen, that after I was entered the little cove, when I had landed the feet
of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and
threw me and all my cargo into the water ; as for myself, it was no great harm, for I
was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially the
iron, which I expected would have been of great use to me ; however, when the tide
was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infi-
nite labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very
much. After this, I went. every day on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had now been thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on board the
ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands could well be sup-
posed upable of bringing ; though I verily believe, had the calm weather held, I should
have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece ; but preparing the twelflh time to go
on board, I found the wind begun to rise : however, at low water I went on bean], and
though I thought I had rummugcd the cabin so efl'eotually that nothing more could be
found, yet I discovered a. locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or
three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with sonro ten or a dozen of good knives and
forks ; in another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money--"mo European coin,
some Brazil, some pieccs'of eight, some gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " 0h, drug I" said Ialoud, " what art
than good for! Thou art not worth to rne--no, not the taking off the ground ; one of
those knives is worth all this heap; I have no manner of use for thee,- e'en remain
where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is not worth saving."
However, upon second thoughts, I took it away ; and wrapping all in a. piece of canvaa,
I began to think of making another raft ; but while I was preparing this, I found the
sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter- of an hour it blew a fresh

., gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain topretend to
make a raft with the wind ofl' shore; and that it was my business to be gone before
the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at aIL
Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and sworn across the channel which hry
between the ship and the sand; and even that with difliculty enough, partly with the
weight of the things I had about me, and partly from the roughness of the water; for

' v. the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water it blew a storm.

But I was gotten homo to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth about me
very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and in the morning, when I lookedout,
behold, no more ship was to be seen. I was a. little surprised, but recovered myself with
this artixfactory reflection, that I had lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get
everything out of her that.could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little left
in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of her, except
what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indwd, divers pieces of her alterwards .
did ; but those things were of small use to me. ,

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either savages,

if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island 5 and I had many thoughts
of the method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make--whether I should
makameacaveinthaearth,oratent upon theearth; audio short, I resolvedupon
both ; the manner and description of which it may not be improper togive anncconnt of

I soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, particularly because
it was upon a low moorish ground ncnr the see, and I believed would not be whole-
some, nnd more particularly because there wns no fresh water near it ; so I resolved to
find in more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be proper for me:
first, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned ; secondly, shelter from the heat of
the run ; thirdly, security from ravenous W whether man or beast ; fourthly, a
view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not low any sdvenhge for
my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish my expectation yes

In search of a place proper for this, I found a. little plain on the side of a rising hill,
whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house side, so that nothing could
come down upon me from the top. 0n the side of the rock there was a. hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of n cave ; but there wus not really any
cave, or way into the rock, at all.

On the first of the green, just below this hollow place, I resolved to pitch my tent.
This plain we not above a. hundred yards bread, and about twice as long, and lay like
a green before my door ; and, at the end of it, descended irregularly every way down
into the low ground by tho scoside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it
was sheltered from the heat every day, till it more to the W. and by 8. sun, or there-
abouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew ahalf--circle before the hollow place, which tool: in
about ten yards in its semidiarneter, from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter
from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into the ground
till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the ground above five
feet and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows did not mud above six inch:
from one another.

Then I tool: the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid them in rows,
upon one another, within the circle, between these two rows of stakes, up to the top,
placing other stakes in the inside, lcuning ngainst them, about two feet and a half high
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could
get into it or over it. This cost me it great deal of time and labour, especially to out
the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a short ladder to
go over the top; which ladder, when l was in, I lifted over after me; and so I
was complewa fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and con-
sequently slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done ; though, an
it appeared menu-<<lg there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that
I apprehended danger from

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my riches, all my
provisions, unmunition, and stores, of which you have the account above; and I

awed among the sailsAnd now I lay no mere for awhile in the bed which I had hmught on shore, but
in a. hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and lwlangcd w the mate of the ship. 4 ~

Into this tout I brought all my pmvisiuns, and everything that would spoil hy the
wet; and having: thus enelused all my goods, I made up the enhance, which till now
I had left open. and so passed and relwed, as 1 mid, hy a shunt ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and bringing all the
earth and stones thutI dug down out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence, in
the nature of a ten-ace, so that it mixed the ground \\'Illllll ahnut a foot and a half; and
thus I made me a cave, just behind lny tent, which served me like a cellar w my
house.

It cost me much labour and many days hefin'e all these things were brought to
perfection; and therefore I must go back to some other things which look up some

itself, "Oh, my lmwder!" My very heart sank within me when I thought that, at one

,nblast, all my powder might be dentivyed; on which not my defence only, but the,
ploviding me food, is I thought entirely depended. I was nothing neu- so snxious '-
Iboutmyowndnnger; though, hulthopowdertookfiro, Ihndneverlrnownwho had ,

to W my powder, end to keep it 1 little null n little in s. pared, in hope,
thnt whtever might come, it might not ell take fire at once ; and to keep it so sport,
(list it should not be possible to make one port fire enother. I finished this work,
in shout s fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about one hundred Ind
forty pounds weight, wns divided into no less than n hundred parcels. As to the hem]
that had been wet, I did not apprehend sny danger from that; so I placed it in my
new cave, which, in my fancy, I enlled my kitchen; And the rent I hid up and down in
holes smong the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where
I laid it.

In the inter-vol of time while thin was doing, I went out at least once every
dry with my gun, as well to divert myself, so to see if I could kill anything fit for
food ; And, as near ss I could, to neqneint myself with what the island produced.
The first time I went out, I presently discovered tlmt there were goats in the island,
which we: a grout sntisfuctiou to me; but then it was nttendod with this misfortune
to me, viz, thnt they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most
dillieult thing in the world to come nt them; but! wns not discouraged at this, not
doubting but I might now nnd then shoot one, as it soon Iurppened; for after I had
found their hnunts n little, I lnid wnit in this mnnfier for thorn: I observed if they
snw me in the alloys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run any, or in n
terrible fright; hut if they were feeding in the vulloys, and I was upon the roclag they
took no notice of me; from whence I concluded, that by the' position of their option,
their night was so directed downward, that they did not mdily see objects (but were
ul:ove them; so afterwards I took this method--I nlwnys climbed the rocks first, to

'C/_ get nbove them, and then lurd frequently 1: fair nurrlr.

my enclosure; upon which, I lnid down the dam, and took the kid in mym and
curried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame ; but it would not mt; so I
was forced to lrill it and eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a. grant
while, for I est sparingly, end uved my provisions, my bread especinlly, us much as
I possibly could.

Roving now fixed my habitation. I found it absolutely necessary to provide 1 plsee
to make 9. fire in, and fuel to burn; nnd what I did for thntms nlso how I enlarged my
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a. full neeouut of in its place; but I

l 43CRUSOE'S CALENDAR.
__--________________----------------
Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life.
The tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these reflections ; and some-
times I would expostulato with myself why Providence should thus wnrpletely ruin its
creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, and so
entirely deprased, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts, and to
reprove me; and particularly one day walking with my gun in my hand by the see.-
side, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition. when Reason, as it
were, put in expostulating with me the other way, thus -. "\Vell, you are in a. desolate
condition, it is true; but, pray remember, where are the rest of you 1 Did not you come
eleven of you into the boatl Where are the ten? \Vhy were not they saved, and you
lost! \Vhy are you singled on" Is it butler to be here or therei" And then I
pointed to the sea. ' All evils are to be considered with the good that is in them and
with what worse attended them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my sulniateuce, and
what would have been my case if it had nut happened (which was a. hundred tbnmsand
to one) that the ship floated from the place where first she struck, and was driven so
near to the shore, that I had time to get all these things out of her? What would have
been my case, if I had been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at first
came on shore, without neeeseu'iu of life, or any means to supply and procure them '3
" Particularly," mid I aloud (though to myaelf), " what should I have done without a,
gun, without ammunition, without any tools tomake anything, or to work with l with-
out clotllmglurdnlillg, a unit, or any manner of covering; 1" and that new I had all these
to a. sullieient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide nrywlf in such a numner as to
live without my gun, when my ammunition was spent : so that I had a tolerable view
of subsisting without any want as lung no I livod ; for I unwiduved from the beginning
how I would provide for the accident: that might happen, and for the time that way to
come, even not only alter my ammunition should be spent, but even after my health
and strength should decay.

I ('nllfuu I had not then entertained any notion of my ammunition being destroyed
atone blast--I mean, my powder being blown up by lightning; and this made the
thnnghla of it surprising to me, when it lightened and thundered, as I observed just
IIO\\'.

And now, being to enter into :L melancholy relation of a scene of silent life, such,
perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its beginning,
and continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, when, in
the manner as above mid, I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the sun being
to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head: for I reckoned myself,
by olm-rvntion, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty two minutes north of
the line. .

After I had been there about km or twelve days, it cune into my thoughts that I
should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen, and ink, and should even
forget the Sabbath-day from the working-(hiya ; but to prevent this, I cut it with my
kmfe upon a laugepnst, in mpital letters; and making it into n, great cram, I set it up
on the shore where I first lauded, viz, " I came on shore here on the 30th of Sep-
temln-r, l659."

Upon the sides of this square post I out every dnya. notch with 'my knife, and every
seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as longIn the next place, we ere to observe, tblt umong the many things which I brought

' , from the ship in the several voyages which, as above mentioned, I nude to it, I got

several things of less value, but not at all less useful to me, which I omitted setting
down before ; es, in particular, pens, ink, and paper ; several parcels in the captain's
mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or four campuses, some mathematical
instruments, dinlx, pernlmetives, charts and books of nevigstion; all which I huddled
together, whether I might want them or no: sleo I found three very good Bibles,
which came to me in my cargo from Euglnud, end which I hnd [lucked up nmong my
things ; some l'nrtugueie books nlxo ; and, among them, two or three I'opish pruyen-
lmokx, nnd sen-ml other books; all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget
thut wu hnd in the ship ndog and two cuts, of whose eminent history I must have oom-
aion to any something in its place, for I carried both the cats with me ; and us for the
dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, end swnm on shore to me the day afler I
went on shun.- with my first urge, and mo trusty sci-vent to me my years ; I vented

nothing tlmt he could fetch me, nor any compnoy that he could make up to me; I only ' i '2

wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I observed before, I found
pens, ink, and peper,nnd I husbnnded them to the utmost; and I nhsll show that while
my ink lnsicd, I kept things very exact; but nftcr thst wnsgone I could not, forI could
not make uny ink by any menus thst I could devise.

And this put me in mind that l wanted mnny things, notwithstanding all tint I had
finesse-l together; and of these, ink was one : us also a spade, pick-ante, end shovel, to
dig or remove the mirth ; needles pins, and thread: us for linen, I soon learned to mt
that without much dificulty. '

This went of tools mudc every work I did go on heavily; and it was nenr I. whole
year before I had entirely finished my little pole, or surrounded habitation. The
piles or striker, which were its iltill'ylls i could well lift, were a long time in cutting and
preparing in the woods, und more, by fur, in bringing home ; so tlmt I spent sometimes
two days in cutting and bringing home one of thaw mats, and a third dsyin driving it
into the ground; for which purl-me, I got 1. heavy piece of wood at first. but at last
bethought mysell'of one of the iron crown; which, however, though I found it, yet mule

thoughts from daily poring upon them, and nlllieting my mind : and as my men begsn
now to muster my deepondeney, I began to comfort myselfas vrcll us I could, and to set

nomxsbx causoz. '. '-and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that way before, and that with infinite
labour. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree,
act it on nu edge before me, and how it flatou either-side with my axe, till I had brought
it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by th'u
method I could make but one board out of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for
but patience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it
took me up to make a plank or board : but my time or labour was little worth, and so
it was as well employed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I obsen'ed above, in the filst place;
and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft from the
ship. But when I had wrought out some boards as above, I made largo shelvu, of the
breadth of a foot and on half, one over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all
my toohs nails, and iron--work on; and, in a. word, to selulrate everything at large into
their phwcs that I might come easily at them : also I knocked pieces into the wall of the

rock, to hang my gum and all things that would hang up : no that had my cave been to I

be zwen, it looked like a g -neml mugauzine of all ucctxm'y things; and Ihad everything
so rmdy at my hand. that it wasa great pleasure to me tome all my goods in such order,
and mlwially to find my stock of all uecmrica so great.

And now it was when I began to keep a. journal of every day's employment ; for.
indeed, at that, I was in too much hurry, and not only an hairy as to labour, but in too
much discomposure of mind ; and my journal would have been full of many dnll things:
it 'oxample, [must have said thus: "Sept. (In: SOUL--Ml" I had gotto shore, and had
(waited drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, baring tint
vomitnl, with the gmut quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach, and
mourning myselfa little, I run about the shore wri: aing my hands and beating my
head and face, exclailning at my misery, and crying out I Was undone, nndouo! till,
tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground to rcpoxe, but durst not sleep,
for fear of being devoured."

Some days after this, aml after I had been on board the ship, and had got all I
could out of her, yet I could not forhmr getting up to the top of a little mountain, and
looking out to ml, in hopes of seeing a ship: tlu-n fancy at a vast distance I spied
a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and then, afier looking steadily, till I was
almost blind, hue it quite, and sit down nml weep like a child, and thus increase my
misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things in some mmsurc. and having Settled my house-
hold rtufl' and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me
an I could, I began I say to keep my journal; of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars over again), as long as it lasted; for at
last, having no more ink, I was forced to leave it 01!:

THE JOURXAL

Syrbrilbcr 30, lGSD.--I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, during
a dmulful storm, in the oiling, came on shore on this dismal, unfortunate inland, which

I called "The Island of deair ;" all the rest of the ship's company being drowned.
and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afilicting myself at the dismal circumstanca I W88
brought to ; viz, I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to; and, i"
deslriir of any relief, raw nothing but death before me: either that I should be devollml

by wild beasts, murdered by savages. or starved to desth for wt of food. At the
approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures ; but slept soundly, though
it rained all night.

October l.--In the morning I saw, to my greet surprise. the ship luul floated with
the high tide, and was driven on shore again, much nmrer the island; which, Is it was
some comfort, on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, And not broken in piecea I hoped,
if the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some food nod neamries out of her
for my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades,
who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, st least,
that they would not have been ell drowned, as they were; end that, haul the men been
saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have
carried us to some other pert of the world. I spent great port of this day in perplexing
myself on these things; but, at length, seeing the ship nlmost dry, I went upon the and
as near as I could, and then swnm on board. This day also it continued ruining. though
with no wind at all.

Fm>> the let of October to (he Ellie--All these days entirely spent in many seven!
voyage: to got all I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood,
upon rafts. Much rain Also, in these days, though with sonic intervals orbit weather ;
but it seems this wns the rainy mason.

0a. 24.--I ovemet my raft, end sll the goods I had got upon it ; but being in shoal
writer, end the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide
was out.

Oct. 25,--It rained all night snd all dny, with some gusts of wind; during which
time the ship broke in piewg the wind blowing a little harder tlmn before, nnd was no
more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low wnter. I spent this day
in covering and securing the goods which I loved, that the min might not spoil them.

Oct 26.--I walked about the shore almost nll day, to find out a place to fix my
habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from soy attack in the night, either from
wild beast: or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and
marked out n semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen "with a
work, well, or fortification, made of double piles lined within with cables, end without
with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying all my goods to my new
habitation, though some part of the time it mined exceeding herd.

The 3180., in the morning. I went out into the islsnd with my gun, to see for some
food, and dimmer the country; when I killed a. shew", and her kid followed me home,

'1, which I anorwnrds killed also, because it would not feed.

Nonnum- 1.7--1 set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the first night;
making it as large as I could, with stokes driven in to swing my hammock upon.

Nov. 2.--I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber which made
my mils, and with them formed a fence round me, a little within the pluoe I had morkcd
out for my fortification.

Nov. 3.---I went out with my gun, and killed two {owls like ducks, which were very
good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a table.

Nov. 4.--This mornixlg I began to order my times of work, of going out with my
gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion; W'L, every morning I walked out with my
gun for two or three hours, if it did not rein; then employed myself to work till about

eleven o'clock; then ate what I had to live on; end from twelve to two I lay down to .b 'In r/Iaumm .'.-A a

sleep, the "Tether lwing excmive hot; nnd then. in the evening, to work again. .
The working part of this day and the next were wholly employed in hulking this 7' ,
table, for I was yet but it very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me a
complete natnml mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any one else.

Nov. 5.--This day I went Abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a wild
cat ; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every creature I killed,
I took 021' the skins and preserved them. Coming back by the sea-shore, 1 saw
mzmy sorts of sat-(owls, which I did not understand ; but was surprised, and almost
frighted, with two or three seals, which, while I mu; gazing at, not well knowing
whzlt they were, got into the sea, and escnped me for that time.

Nae. G.--.~\fter my morning walk, I went to work with my table again, and
finished it, though not to my liking ; nor was it long before I lenrned to mend it.

."ur. 7.7--Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, mm, and

1 part of the 12th (for the llth was Sunday according to my reckoning); I tool:

wholly up to make me a. chair, and with much <<do bmught it to a tolerable shape,
but never to plane me ; and even in the making I pulled it to pieces several times.

Nola--I man neglected keeping Sundays; for, omitting my marl: for them on
my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. iii--This day it ruined, which refreshed me exceedingly, and cooled the
earth ; but it wa's accompanied with terrible Ilmmler and lightning, which frighud medreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I resolved to se-pomte my '
stock of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nun. H, 1.3, IG.--Thcw three daya I spent in making little sqnnre cheats, or boxes>>.
which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most. of powder; and so, putting
the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another as possible
On one of these three days I killal a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.

Nov. li'.--This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to make room for
my further conreniency.

Nola--Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work ; via, a pickaxe, a shovel,
and a. whcellxrrmw, or basket; to I desisted from my work, and begrn to consider how
to supply that want, and make me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I made use or the
iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy ; but the next thing was it nhorel,
or spade; this was so nbsolutely nemry, that, indeed, I could do nothing efl'ectually
without it ; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

Now. iii--The next day, in marching the woods, I found a tree of that wood, or
like it, which, in the Brazila, they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding haul-ream ; of this,
with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home,
with difliculty enough, for it was exceeding bury. The cxcmivo hardness of the wood,
and having no other way, made mea long while upon this machine, for I worked it
ell'ectually by littl- -nd little into the form of a shovel or spade; the bundle exactly
shaped like ours in Enghnd, only that the board part baring no iron shod upon it at
bottom, it would not hut me so long; however, it served well enough for tho mm; which
I had oocmdnu to put it to ; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion:
or so long making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a whecllxrrmw. A basket I could
not nm e by any means, har lg no such things as twigs that would bend to make
wiekcr-ware-nt lead, none yet found out; and as to the wheellxrmrw, I i'nncied I could
make all but the win-cl; but that I had no notion of; neither did I know how toga

about it; besidex I had no pusiihic way to make iron gndgwns fur the spindle or
' XIX." of the wheel to run in; so I g ' it over and so, for carrying away the earth which
I dug out of the care, I made me a thing like a hod. which the labourers carry mortar
in. when they serve the hrieklayers. This was not so dillieult tn Inc a>> the making the
shovel; and yet this and the shovel, and the attempt w I I made in vain to make a
wheelbarrow, took me up no Ie-s than four daya, I mean always excepting my morning's
walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also of bringing home
something fit to eat.

Nov. 23.--.\ly other work having stood still, lwmuse of my making threa- look
when they \ inishr-d I went on, and working every day, as my Irr-ngth and time
all m-ed, I spent erg rtr-en days entirely in widening and deeper 5 my (:rre, that it
might hold my goods commmlioualy.

Nola--During all this time I worked to make this room, or <<we, spacious enough
to acculnnlodnu' me as a warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and n cellar.
.-\.~& for a lodging, I kept to the tent; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the
war, it minul .so haul, that I could not kce myself dry, which caused me afierwartls
tn mver all my place within my pale with ong poles, in the form of rafter-a, lwuiug
agrinst thr- rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.

Dr'ccytber 10.--I began now to think my care or vault finished, when on a suddenCRUSOE FURNISHING HIS HOUSE.

_--_----____'--------~

(it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of enrth fell down from the top and

one side ; so much that, in short, it frighted me, and not without reason, too ; for if I

llzvl been under it, I had never wanted a grave--digger. Upon this disaster I had a.

great deal of work to do over again, for I imd the loose earth to carry out ; and. which

was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more
' would come down.

D c. ll.--This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two shores or posts
pitched upright to the top. with two pieces of boon] acme over each post ; this I
finished the next dny, nnd setting more posts up with boards, in about a. week more
1 had the roof secured ; nud the mats, standing in rows, served me for partitions to
part ofl' my house.

Dec. lT.--From this dny to the 20th I placed shelves and knocked up nails on the
posts, to lmng everything up that could be hung up ; and now I began to be in some
order within doors.

Dec. 20.--No\v I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish my house
and set up some pieces of board like a dresser, to order my \'ictunls upon ; but board
began to be very source with me : also I made me another table.

Dec. '24.--.\Iuch min all night and all day ; no stirring out.

Dec. 25.--Ruin oll dny.

Dec. 2G.--No min, and the earth much cooler than before, and plensanter.

Dec. 27,--Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that l catehed it. and led it
home in n string ; when I lnnl it at home, I bound nnd splintered up its leg, which was
broke.

NJL--I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as
ever; but by nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my
door, and would not go awny. This was the first time tlmt I entertained a thought of
breeding up some toms crentures, that I might have food when my powder and shot
were all spent.

Dec. 28, '29, 30. 3l.--Great heats, and no breeze, so that there was no stirring
nlmxnl, except in the evening, for food; this time I spent in putting all my things in

-- order within doors.

Jan. l.--Very hot still: but I went abroad enrly and late with my gun, and
lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going further into the valleys which
1ny towards the centre of the island, I found there was plenty of goats though ex-
ceedingly shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring
my dog to hunt them down.

Jun. 2.---Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him upon the
' goats ; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog, and he know his
danger too well, for he would not come near them. ->>
er. 3.--I began my fence, or wall ; which, being still jmlous of my being attacked

by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.

AIR--This wall being described before, I [rurlmly omit what was said in the
Journal ; it is suflicient to observe that I was no lees time than from the 3rd of January
to the 14th of April working. finishing. and perfecting this wnll, though it was no more
than about twenty-four yards in length. being a half-circle, from one place in the rock
to anolher place, about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days, nay, sometimes
 

weeks together; but I thought I should never be perfectly secure till this will was
finished ; and it is entree credible what inexpressible labour everything was done with,
especially the bringing piles out of the woods, nud driving them into the ground; for
I made them much bigger thnn I needed to hevedone.

\thn this well was finished. and the outside double-fenced. with n turf well raised
up close to it, I persuaded myself thut if any people were to eome on shore there. they .
would not pereeive anything like a bnbitntiou ; nnd it was very well I did so, as my
be observed herenfler, upon u very remarkable occasion.

During this time I undo rounds in tho woods for game every day, when the
ruin permitted Inc, nnd mode frequent discoveries in these wulks of xomething or other
to my advantage; larticulnrly I found It kind of wild pigoonx, which build, not as
wood pigeons in n tree, but mther n4 house pigeons. in the hole; of the rocks; and teking
some young ones, I endeavoured to breed thorn up tame, uud did so; but when they
grew older they flew ull nwuy, which perhaps we nt first for want of feeding them, for I
had nothing to give them ; however, I fro picntly found thoir nests, and got their young
ones. which were very good meat.

And now, in the managing my household rim-ire, I found myself muting
in many thingx, which I thought at first it was iunioexible for me to make ;
es, indeed, as to some of them it was: for iusntuee, I could never make n eesk
to bo hooped I haul n nnmll ruulet or two, as I observed before; but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though I spent muiy weeks about
it; I could neither put in the lit-rubs nor join the stoves so true to one another no to
make thorn hold water ; w I gave thut ulso over.

In the next place, I won at e. grout loss for mindless ; so that as soon so it
wnx dnrh, which woe genenllly by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I
remembered the lump of booed-mix with which I made candles in my African
adventure; but I hid none of thnt now ; the only remedy I had was,. that
when I had killed n gort I rowed the tnllow, and with n little dish nuule of cley,
which I barked in the sun, to which I added u wick of some ouknm, I nude me n
hunp; nml this gore rue light, though not a cluirluteuly light like A eondlo. In the
middle of all my labours it huppeued lllut, nrnumging my things I found it little bug,
which, M I hinted bel'om-1 had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry--not for
this voyage, but before, ll'iI nuppoee, when the nhip mine from Lisbon. \tht little n:-
mniuderuf corn had been in the bug wus ull devoured by the may and I an>> nothing in
the 5 but hirsks and dust ; end being willing to have the bug for some other use (I
think it "nor to put powder- in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some
such use), I shook the hunks of eorn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the
rock. i '

Itwnsnlittle before the great rainsjust now mentioned tlutt I throw this stuff
nvmy, taking no notice of nnythiug. and not so muoh as remembering that I had thrown
anything there, when, nboutu. month after, or tlierenbouts, I raw some few stalks ofeomo-
thing greeushooting upon the ground, which I fiurcied might beeorne phrntI had not seen ;
out I was surprised, and perfectly nttorriehed when, after n. little longer time, I new
about ten or valve can; come out, which were perfect green barley, of the ssrne kind
us our Europmn--nay, as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts on this
ooenzdon ; I luul hitherto ueted upon no religious foundation at all ; indwd, I hnd very
few notions of religion in my heed. nor hnd entertained my sense of anything that had

befallen me, otherwise than :u a chance, or, as we lightly my, what pleases God, without I (I
so much as inquiring into the oral of Providence in them things, or his order in .
governing events in the world. But after I saw barley grow there in a climate which "\
I knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it
startled me strangely, and I began to snggfit that God had miraculously cursed this
grain to grow without any lwlp of seed sown, and that it mu so directed purely for my
sustenance in that wild, miserable place.

This touched my hmrt a little, and brought tans out of my eyes and I begin to
blesa myself that such a prodigy of Nature xhoul-l happen upon my aeeoImt; aml this
1 was the more strange to me, bemuso I srw near it still, all along by the side of the
I] rock, some other stmggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew,
I beauty: I had seen it grow in Africa, when I "amok-hon: there.

l. I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my support, but not
l

       

 

doubting but that when: more in the place, I went allover that part ol'tha island where

I, I had been before. peering in on y corner and under evrry rock, to ace for more of it,

". but I could not Iind any. At last it occurred to my thoughts that I had shaken the

J bag of chickens' "not out in that place; and the wonder began to canto; and I must

)1 mute" my religious thankl'uluexi to God's providence lxgun to abate too, upon the

discovering that all this was nothing but what was common; though I ought to have
been ax: thankful for so strai "e and unlilresrcn providence, as if it had been
miraculous; for it was really ll work of Providence as to me, that should order or
appoint that ten or twelve grams of corn should remain nnstnniled, When the rate had
deatmyx-d all the reil, as itit had been dropped from heaven; as also that I should .'
throw it out into that pavtir. ar place, Where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it
sprang up immediately ; whereas it' I had thrown it anywhere else at that time, it had
been burnt up aml destroyed.

I mretirlly sired the max of this corn, you may be sure, in their season, which was
about the end of June; and 1 Ill ' up every corn, I resolved to xan' them all again,
hoping in time to have some qla ', autlirieut to supply rue with bread. But it was
not till the fourth r that I would allow m_ Ifthe least grain of this corn to cut. and
even then but sleliiiugly, as Ishall my anon .n-ds in its order; forl lost all that l
sowed the first sermon, by not observing the proper time; for I sowed itjust before the

in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice, which I
pn'served with the soot- (are, aml whose uxc wax of the same kind, or to the same d"
purpose, vi7.., to make me bmrd, or rather food; for I found w. ya to Look it up \vithuut ,'H

But to return to my Journal ~---

I worked cxcmnsive hard these three or four months to get my wall done; and
the 14th of April. I closed it up, mntriving to go into it, not by a door, but over a :3!
wall, by a ladder, that there ht be no sign on the outside of my habitation. '6

pulled it up after me, and let it down on the inside : this was a cmiplete enclosure In
me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without.
unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was Iinishul. I had almost. had all my labour .

inside of it, behind my tent, just in the entrance into my care, I was terribly frightened
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed: for, all on a. sudden, I found the earth
came tumbling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head,
and two of the posts I had yet up in the cave cracked in a. frightful manner. I was
heartily scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause, only thinking that
the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had done before : and for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran forwanls to my ladder, aml not thinking myself cafe there neither,
I gut over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I exlwcted might roll down
upon me. I was no mncr stepped down upon the firm ground, than I plainly saw it
was a terrible earthquake ; for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight
minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood upon the earth ; and a great piece of the
top of the rock, which xtood about half a mile from me. next the sea, fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. I perceived also the very m
was put into a violent motion by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the
water than on the island.

I wax so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like, or dis-
eomsed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or stupefied ; and the mution
of the. earth made my stauuuch sick like one that was towed at sea ; but the noise of the
f ling of the rock awakwl me as it mac, and rousing me from the atupcfied condition
I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling
upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at once ; and this sunk my
very soul within me a second time. i

A her the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I began to take
mun-go ; and yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall gain, for fear of being
bu ed alive, but still mt upon the ground, greatly mat down and discoumlaw, nut
kluu vhat to do. All this while, Iliad not the least serious religious thought;
nothing but the common "Lord, have mercy upon me I" and when it was over, that
went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, mul it- grew cloudy, as if it would ruin;
soon after that, the wind arose by little mul little, so that in hm than half an hour it
blew a most dreadful hurricane of wind : the sea was, all on a sudden, covered with
foam and froth ; the shore was covered with the breach of the water; the trees were
torn up by the roots ; and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours, and
then began to abate; and then in two hours more it was calm, uml begun to rain very
hard. .-\ll this while I sit upon the ground very much terrified and dejected; when
on a sudden it came into my thoughts. that these winds and rain being the consequences
ol'the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might Venture into
Ill. rave again. \Vith this thought, my spirits began to revive; and the min also
helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent; but the rain WM so
violent, that my tent was ready to be lulteu down with it; and I was forced to go
into my cave, though very much afmid and unmsy, for fear it should fall on my haul.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, \i7., to cuta hole through my new fortifi-
cations, like a sink, t) let the water_ go out, which would else have drowned my
cave. After I had been in my one some time, aml fouml still no more shock: of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And now to support my spirits,
which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small xnp of
rum ; which, however, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no
more when that w. -r gone. It continued raining all that night, and great port'of the
next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more computed, I
began to think of what I had best to do; concluding, that if the island was subject
to these earthquakesl there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of
building me some little but in an open place which I might xnrronud with a wall, as
I had done here, and so nuke my ~lf Secure from wild bmsts or men ; for I concludrd
if I xtavrd where I wm, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

\\'ith these thoughts I rewlved to move my tent from the place where it now
xtood, which w <<just nml ' the l angiug precipice of the hill; and which, if it should
bea on at, u, would cex iinly fall upon my tent: and I apent the two next days,
being the 19th and :anh of April, in contriving whom and how to remove my
habitation. The 1' tr of bo' lg swallowed up alive made me that l HI'VI'I' rlept in quiet ;
and yet the apprehemiuns of lying abroad without any fence were ahnoat equal to it :
but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in order, how plezmntly
eonecalul I \ and how mfe {mm danger, it made me loth to remove. In the mean-
time. it menrrnl to me that it would require a vtut deal of time for me to do thin, and
that I must he van-tented to run the venture where I was, till I had formed a uuup for
mywll', and had secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I composed
myself for a lime, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a
wall with piles and cables to, in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it, when it
"as lllliztllt'tl 5 but that I ooold venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and
lit to rename to. This mix the 215K.

April flit--The next morning I began to consider of means to put this resolve in
execution; but 1 Wm at a great lost about my tools. I had three large axes, and
abundance of hatehets (for we cu'riml the llalchrts for tmllie with the Indians); but
with much chopping and culling knotty hard wood, they were all full ofnulchex, and
dull : and though I had a griudatone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This
cost me a< nun-h thought as a stair-small would have bestowed upon a grand point of

how it was done, though since I lun oba wed it was very common tlu-re ; besides that,
my grindxloue wm very large and lo. . This machine cut-at me a full Week's work to
bring it to lwrfwtion.

something lie on the ahore bigger than ordinar' Ind it looked like a cuk; when
I came to ii, I found a. s all barrel. and two or three pin-vs of the wreck of the ship,
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towanls the wreck
itself, I tln-ugbt it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined
the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a. burn-l of gunpowder;
but it had unken water, and the powder was caked :N hard a l atone: however, I rolled
it farther on xhore lor the present. and went on upon the minds, as near as I could to
the wreck of the ship, to look for more."'hen I came down to the xhip, I found it strangely removed The foreclstle,

I which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least xix feet, and the stern,

which was hmken to pieces and parted from the rest by the fame of the sen soon '
after I h: d left nuamaging of her, was tossed, nsit were, up, and cast on one side ;
and the sand was tluown so high on that side next the atom, that whereas there

 

, was a great place of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her when the

tide was out. 1' was surpriwl with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done
by the earthquake; and as by this violence the <<hip was Int-re hmken open than
formerly, so many things mum daily on share, which the son had lime-lied, and .
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my habitation,
and I onsied myself mightily, that day ewecially, in searching whether 1 could
make any way into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind,
for that all the imidc of the ship was choked up with sand. However, as I had
learned nut to dexpair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I

' could at the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her would beef

exceeding thinn-y ; liowever, in; I had no woun- in my whole hnbilntion, I won foreed to lie
till morning, nud went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I hnd this terrible dream:
I thought thnt I me: sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wnll, where I out when
the slonu blew ul'wr the wthquuke, nnd that I mw a mob descend from u greet block
cloud, in a bright tlnme of live, nml light upon the gmund : he won all over as bright as
n Home, so thut I could butjust hair to look towards him : his eouutennneo was most
inexpmibly dreadful, impossible for wordn to dewribe ; when he stepped upon the ground
,>> with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just no it had done before in the eurthquuko,
:md all the air looked, to my apprehension, us if it lnnl been filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner lnnded upon the earth, but he moved forward: towards me, with a. long
slur or weupon in his hand, to kill me; and when be mine in a rising ground, nt some'
distance, he spoke in rue--or I heurd n voice at terrible that it is impossible to express
the terror of it. All that I am my I understood won this :--" Seeing all these things
have not brought thee to repentunce, now then nhnlt die ;"---ut which words, I thought
he llllL'd up the spur that wngs in his hand to kill me.

No one that nhnll ever ran! this aeeouut will expect that I should beuble to describe
the honors of my soul at this terrible vision. I mean, that even while it m 1 dream,
I even dreamed of those horrors. Nor is it any more pounibleto describe the impression
thnt remnined upon my mind when I awaited, and found it was but a dream.
 

I had, ohm! no divine knowledge. What I quI received by the good instruction of
my father was then worn out lry an nninterrnph-d series for eight years, of sarfnriug
wickedness and a constant convehmtion with none but knell as were, like myself. wicked

, and profane to the lust degree. Ido not rcmeluber thatI had, in all that time, one
thought thatao much as tended either to looking upwards towards God,or inwards
awards a reflection: upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity of will, without desire
of good, or conscienceof evil, had entirely overwhelmed me ; and I was all that tho nu st
hardened, unthinking. wicked crunturc among our common sailors am be supposed to
lie--not having the least sense, either of the fear of God in dangers, or of thankfnlneau
to God in delivers-noes.

In the relating what is already part of my story, this will be the more easily believed
when I shall add, that through all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen
me, I never had so much as one thought of iLa being the hand of God, or that it wax u
just pnni nnuut for my sins--my rebellions behaviour against my father--or my
pursuit sins which were great--or so much as a punishment for the gem-rid Conn-o of
my wicked life. ""heu I was on the doswrnte expedition on the desert nhores of
Alrica. I never had no much on one thought of whnt would become of me, or one wish
to God In direct me \vhitln-r l should go, or to keep me from the danger which
uplulrently aurmnluhnl me, on well lrom w-rueionx cmlturca an cruel savages; but!
was nu-roly thoughtlem of God or a l'lovi 'noeal noted like a nun-o brute, from the
principle>> of nntnrvo1 and by the dictates ofeonuuon reuse only, and indeed hardly that.
When I wan; delivered and taken up at sea hydro Portugal captain, well used, and dull!
finally and houonmbly with, as well an eluuilahly, 1 lnul not the least thnnkf-Ilness in

thoughts. \Vhen, again, I was shipwrecked, mined, and in danger of drowning on

aloud, I was as far from rel-ionic, or looking on it as njndmneut. I only said to
myself often, that I' was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always mirremblc.

It is true, when I got on shore first how, nnd found all nrynhip'a crew drowned, and
myxclf slurred, I was surpriml with a kiml of <<army, and some tmlnrports of Hull, which,
had the grim of God nmiuled, u ' t have come up to true thankfulnw ; but it ended

r where it began, in a mere eoum I llight of joy, or, as I nmy my, being glad I was
alive, without the least reflection upon the dislingniahing goodnesc ofthu llund which llml
pnnervcd me, and lnul xiuglod me out to he pnzwvvml when all the rest were deitmyed,
or an inquiry why l'mridu-nce had been thux merciful to me. Eventh tho sumo
eonnuon wrt of joy which women generally have, alter they have got safe ashore from n
xhi nwnzek, nll which they drown in the next howl ufpuneh, and forgot almost an soon
unit mover ; and all the nest of my life was like it. Even when I want afterwxmlx, on due
mnsidemtion, made nenxilnle of my eondi on, how I was mat on this dmulful place, out
of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect oi redemption, as soon
on I saw a pmhuhility of living, nud that l xhonld not starve and perish for hunger,
all the sense of my afllictiou wore elf; and I began to be very any, applied myself
to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and was Err enough from being
ulllieted at my condition, as njudgrucnt from Heaven, or an the Inrnd of God against
me: these were thought; which very wldom entered into my haul.

The growing up of the 00?", M is hinted in my journal, had, at first, some little
influence upon me, and began to ail'ect me with soriouxneau, as long as I thought it had
mmethiug min-enlous in it ; but as noon as ever that part of the thought was removed,
all the nupn-mion which was mined from it were off aha), as I have noted already. Even
the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more imme-
diately directing to the invisible Power which nloue directs such things, yet no sooner
<<was the first fright over, but the impression it had mule wont otl'also. I had no more
sense of God, or Ilis jndgmonni--mneh less of the present nfiliction of my cireumstuuces
being from "is hnnd--thon if I lnul been in the most prosperous condition of life.
llnt new, when I begun to be sick, and o leisurely view of the miseries of dmth came
to plnec itself before mo; when my spirits begun to sink under the burden of n strong
distemper, mud nnture was cxhnmited with the violence of the fever, conscience, that
hard slept so long, begun to nwnlze, and I began to reproach myself with my post life, in
which I hnd so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God why
me under uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive n mnnner. Thme
reflections oppmml me from the second or third day of my distemper; nnd in the
violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful repronehee of my conscience, extortod
some words from me like praying to (ind, though I cannot my they were either a pmyor
nttended with dad" or with hopes : it was mther the voice of more fright Ind distress.
My thoughts were confused. the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of

g in such n miseruhle condition "lined vapours into my head with the mere nppro-
l . ions; and in than: hurrits of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might expras.
But it wns rather exelnnmti-ul. such m5 " Lord, whnt a misomble creature um I ! If I
should be sick, I :dmll wrtuinly die for want of help, and whnt will become of moi"
Then, the tars burst out nl'my eves, null I could say no more for a. good while. In this
intervnl, the good advice of my fnther mme to my mind, mid presently his prediction,
which I mentioned at the beginning of this story, via, thnt if I did take this foolish
step, God would not blue me, and I would have leisure hereafler to reflect upon hnving
neghxtcd his counsel, when then: might be none to nseist me in my recovery. " Now,"
mid I aloud, "my dear hither-'3 words um come to puss; God's justice hos m'ormken
me, nnd I hnve none to help or hair me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had
mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I might have been happy and
easy ; but I would neither see it Inysell, nor learn to lmow the blessing of it from my
mutants. I lelt them to mount over my folly; and now I am left to mourn under the
conmqnenoai of it. I refused their help and unmistnnee, who would hnve lifted mo into
the world, and would have made everything esisy to mo ; and now I lmvo dillicultiu
to struggle with too it for even nnturo itself to support, uud no wismnoo, no help,
no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out, "Lord, be my help, for 1 nm in great

dishes" This was the first pmyer, if I might coll it so, that I hud mule for nmny - ..

yum. But I return to my Journal :--

Jum 28.--aning been somewhut refreshed with the sleep I had had, and the lit
being entirely oil, I got up; and though the fright nud terror of my drunn was very
great, yet I considered thut the lit of the nguo would return again the next day, nnd
now won my time to get something to refresh nod support myself when I should be ill :
and the first thing I did, I filled in huge squane case-bottle with writer, and set it upon
my table in reach of my bed; and to take 011' the chill or lguinh disposition of tho
water, I put about 1 quarter of n pint of rum into it and mixed them together. Then
I got me n piece of tho goat's flesh, and broiled it on the M but could out very little.
I walked about, but was very wank, nnd withnl very and nnd heavy-binned in the
sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day.
At night, I mule my supper of three of tho turtle's eggs which I routed in the ushes,

nnd eat, as we on" it, in the shell, and this was the first bit of moot I had ever oshod i

God's blessing to. even, us I could remember, in my whole life.A cum-2 FOR BODY AND MIND. '

After I had cute", I tried in walk, but found myself so weak. that I could hardly

sit down upon the ground. looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very

Inu appointed all this to hefnll me. Nothing occurred to my thoughts to coutnuliet any
of tlll'so conclusions, and then-fore it rested upon me with the greater force, that it must
needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought to this
mixer-able circumstance by his direction, he having the sole [mu-er, not of me only, hat
of everything that happrm-d in the world. Inuuedtately it folIowed,--\\'hy has (ind

What use in make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, or whether it was good

i for it or no ; but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was molred it should heal
one way or other. I that took a piece of leaf, and chewed it in my month, which, iudeed,
at first, almost stalwlied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had
not been much need to it. Then I took some and steeped itnn hour or two in some rum,

"are I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sieknem'l from the most dis-

how could I exlieet greater delivenmee? This touched my hunt very much; and
immediately I kneelul down, and gave (ind thanks ulond for my recovery from my
siekuem.

JuIy <<la-Iii the morning, I took the Bible; and lmginning at, the New Testament,
l lat-gnu seriously to read it, and imlmzwd upon myself to rrwl awhile every morning
and every night; not lying my. l to the, numher of chapters, but. as long as my
thoughts should cngugo me. It, was nut, long after I set seriously '0 this work, till
I found my heart. more deeply and sincerely afl'ected with the wickedness of my past
life. The imlmrssiun of my dream ievived; and the words, " All these thing: have
not brought thee to repentance," nu seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly

begging of God to give me repentance, when it. happened providentinlly, the very day,
65 '
that, reading the Scripture, I came to than words: "He is exalted a Prince and a
Saviour, to give repentance and to give remission. I threw down the book ; and
with my heart as well its my hands lifted up to haven, in a kind of eextacy of joy,
I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou Son of David ! Jean; thou exalted Prince and Saviour!
give me rew-ntanret" This was the finst time I could say. in the true sense of the
wordx, that I prayed in all my life: for now I prayed with a sense of my condition.
and with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of
God ; and from this time, I may say, I begin to have hope that God would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " 'all on me, and I will
deliver thee," in a dill'vrent some from what I had ever done before '. for then I had
no notinn ofanything being called (lrlirtmnoc, but my being delivered from the capti

it in another senae : now I looked hack upon my [wit life with such horror, and my
sinx appeared so dn-adful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance from the
load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life. it wart nothing ;
I did not >0 much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it ; it was all of no

shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things they will find deliver-

But, leaving this part. i retnni to my Journal :--

.\Iy condition began now to be. though not has miserable as to lny way of living,
ye' much easier to my mind : and my thoughts being directed, by a constant mdin':
the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of
comfort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of; also, my health and strength
returned, I bestxirred myself to furnish myself with everything that I Wanted, and make
my way of living as regular as I could.

From the -l|h of July to the Hill, I was chiefly employed in walking about with my
gun in my hand. a little and a little at a time, an a num that was gathering up his
strength after a Ill. of . . : for it is hardly to be imagined how low I wan. and 10
what weahnrs< I wae redtne l. The application which I made use of was pcrfeclly new,
and perhulN \vhal h.ul never cured an ague before; neither can I rwommend it to any
one to praet. , by this experiment : and though it did carry oil the lit, yet it rather
contributed to weaken me: for I had frequent convulsions In my nerves aml limbs
for some time; I learned from it alw thix in particular, that being abroad in the rainy
season was the most pernie' na thi g to my health that could be, especially in those rainx
which came attended with .\tnl'm< and hnrruanes of wind ; for as the rain which came
in a dry season was always nuut accompanied with such storms, so I found this rain
me; much more danzvmu>>: 1h lII th ruin which fell in September and October.

I had now been in this no my i<land ahove ten months; all possibility of do
liverauce from this coudi'ion >er ed to be eutin ly taken from me; and I firmly believed
that no in m rllnpi' had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured my
habitation, as [ thought. fully to my mind. I had a great desire to make a more perfect
dismwery of the island, and to see what other productions I might find, which yet I
knew nothing of.

It was the 15th of July that l IK'fiilll to take a more particular survey of the '
island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my nits on shore.
I found, alter I <<me about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher; and

A SURVEY OF THE ISLAND.

 

that it was no more than a. little brook of running water, and very fresh and good : but
this being the dry season, there was hardly my water in some psrtsof it; at least not
enough to run in any stream, no as it could be perceived. 0n the hanks of this block:
I found many pleasant ssvannss of meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass;
and on the rising parts of theanext to the higher grounds, where the Water, as itmight
be supposed, never overllowed, I found a, great deal of tob wco, green, and growing to a
great and very strong stalk ; there Were divers other plants, which I had no notion of
or understanding about, nnl might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could
not lind out. I scarchul for the manna root, which the lndisns in all that climate
make their bread of, but I could lind none. I saw large phmts of IIOES, but did not then
understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myself with thesedimveries for this time, and came back, musing
\vith myselfwlmt coum: I might take to know the virtue and gomlum of any ofthe fruits
of plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no conclusion : for, in short, I
lind made so little observation whilr I was in the Bnizils, that I knew little of the plants
of the field ; at leust, very little that might serve Inn to any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 10th, I went up the same way again; and after going something
further than I had gone the day before1 I found the brook and savannas cease, and
the country became more woody .hnn before. In this part I found dill'erent fruits, and
particularly I found meluns upon the ground, in great abundance and grapes upon the
trees : the vine; had spread indeed over the trees, and the cluster: of grapes wersjnst
now in their prime, very ripe and ricln This was a surprising discovery, and I was
exceeding glad of them ; but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them,
remembering that, when I was ashore in Barb try, the cutting of grapes killed several of our
Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes nnzl fevers. But I
found an excellent use for these grapes ; and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun,
and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as
indeed they were, as wholesome and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be had.

I spent all that evening there, and wont not back to my habitation, which, by the
way, was the first night, as I might say, I lml Iain from home. In the night, I took
my first contrivanee, and got up into a tree, where I slept well ; and the next morning
proceeded upon my discovery, tmvelling nearly four miles as I mightjudge by the length
of the valley, keeping still duo north, with n ridge of hills on the south and north side
of me. At the end of this march I calm to an opening, where the country seemed to
descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which imucd out of the side of line
bill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,

', so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdnre, or flourish of spring, that it

looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley,
surveying it with a. secret kind of plaunre, though mixed with other nfliicting
thoughts, to think that this was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this
country indcfmibly, and had a right of pomion ; and, if I could.convey it, I might
have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of 3 humor in England. I raw here
abundance of cocoa new, orange and lemon, and citron trees; but all wild, and
feW bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, the green limes that I gathered
were not only pleasant to <<at, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice ofierwards
with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now
I bad business enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a. store, as

well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season. which I knew '

was approaching. In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one phwe.
a lcmer heap in another place, and a great parcel of limel and lemon in another place;
and taking a few of each with me, I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again, <<
and bring a bag or sick, or what I could make to carry the rest home. Accordingly,
having spent three days in this journey, I come home (so I must now all my tent and
my awe); but before I got thither, the groom were spoiled; the richness of the fruit,
and the weight of the juice, having broken them and bruised them, they were good for
little or nothing: as to the linux, they were good, but I could bring hat a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two amall bugs to bring
home my harvmt; but I mu aurprisod when, coming to my hoop of grapegwhich were
so rich and line when I gathered them. I found them all apruul abroad, troddeu topieoee,
and dragged about, some here, name there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By
this I concluded there wen: some wild creaturea thombouta, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not. However, as I found there wan no laying them up on
heaps, and no carrying them away in a much, but that one way they would be dcatroyed,
and the other way they would be cnmhcd with their own weight, I took another course;
tor I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hang them upon the out bmncha of
the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun ; and as for the limes and lemons, I
carried as many book as I could well atmd under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure the fruit-
fulueaa of that valley, null the pluwrntnw of the situation; the security from storm
on that aide of the water, :qu the wood : null concluded that I had pitched upon a place
to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole,

l began to consider of removing my habitation, and to look out for a place equally
safe as where now I was uitnaw, if lumiblc, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the
island.

This thought I'lIII long in my bend, and l wu exceeding fond of it for some time,
the pleaanutm-m of the place tempting no; but when I came to a nearer View of it,
l conaidered that l was now by the am side, where it was at lean. lmoaible that some-

Iight happen to Inv advantage ; and that the same ill fate that brought me hither,
might bring some ulln-r unhappy wrewlies to the same place ; and though it was mm
probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills
and woods in the centre of the inland, was to anticipate my bondage, and to render
such an afihir not only impvolsible, but impomiblo; and that therefore I ought not by
any means to remove. However, I was no ennmoured with this place, that I :_ic:|t much
of my time there for the whole remaining part of the mouth of July; and though,
upon mind though", I reudved as above not to remove1 yet I built an: a little kind
of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge,
as high an I could reach, Well staked, and filled between with brunhwood ; and here I
lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights together, always going over it with a
ladder as before; so that l fancied new I had my country house and my neacoaat
house ; and this work took me up to the beginning of August.

I had but newly liniahed my fence. and began to enjoy my Ialmur, but the rains
came on, and made me stick close to my first Imbitation ; for though I had made me a
tent like the other, with a piece of a. sail, and apmd it very Well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from stoma, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when
-' the rains were extmnlinnryi
About the beginning of August, as l mid, I had finished my bower, and began to
enjoy myself The 3rd of August, I found the grspes I hid hung up were perfectly dried,
and indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun ; so I begun to tske them down from
the trees, end it was very happy that I did so, for the ruins which followed would have
spoiled them, And I had lost the best port of my winter food; for I had shove two
\ hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I tslceu them ell down, and curried
most of them home to my cave, but it begun to ruin ; end from hence, which was the
l-lth of August, it ruined, more or less, every day till the middle of October, and
sometimes so violently, Ihnt I could not stir out of my cove for sevenl days

'In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my Emily; I hsd been
concerned for the low of one of my outs, who no swsy from me, or, as I thought, luul
been (laid, and I heard no more tidings of her, till, to my sstonishment, she ensue home
about the end of August, with three kittens. This was the more stmrgo to me, bemuse,
though I had killed is wild eat, as I allied it, with my gun, yet I thought it was o quite
difi'erent kind from our European cuts; but the young mm were the some kind of
housebneed'ss the old one ; and both my cute being females, I thought it very strange
But from these three aux I ufterwunls enmo lo be so pestered'with pets, that I was
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as
much ns possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and
was now very eureful not to be much wet. In this confinement, I began to be
sunitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one dsy killed n. goat; and the lust tiny,
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food
was regulated thus :--I ate s bunch of raisins for my breakfast; n piece of tho goat's
flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I had no
vessel to boil or stew anything), and two or three of the turtlc's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked dsily two or three
hours at enlarging my cove, end by degrees worked it on towards one side, till I mum
to the outside of the hill, and made 0. door or way out, which ensure beyond my fence or
well ; and so I came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly easy It lying so
open; for, us I had managed myself before, I win I. perfect iucloeuro; whom.
now, I thought, I lsy exposed, and yet I could not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear; the biggest creature thst I had yet seen upon the island being 3
goat.

Sept. 30.--I was now come to the unllsppy anniversary of my lsnding. I cost up
the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three hundred and minty-live
duys. I kept this dny as u solemn first, setting it nlurt for religious exercise, pm
tinting myself on the ground with the most serious humiliation, confusing my sins to
God, scknou'ledging his righteous judgment upon me, and praying to him to have
mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and having not tested the least refreshment for
twelve houm even till the going down of the sun, I then an a biseuibarke and I bunch

of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I began it. I had all this time
observed no Sabbath-day; for as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I lnul, after some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by mnking u longer notch than
ordinnry for the Sabbath--day, und so did not really know whnt any of the days were;
butnow,hnvingeust up the days so shove,l found I llll-l been there a year; so I
divided it into weeks, end not upsrt every seventh dsy for e Sabbath ; though I found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two in my reckoning. A littleufler this,
myinkbegsntofsilme,undso I contented myself!>> use it moresperingly, end towrite down only the most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily
memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me, and I
leanied to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I bought all my
experience before I had it. and this I am going to relate was one of the most dis-
coumging experiments that I made at all. ~

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley aml rice which I bill so
surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves; and I believe there were
about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper
time to sow it, after the rains, the sun being in his southern position, going from me.
Accordingly. I dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and
dividing it into two parts I sowed my grain ; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred
to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not know when was
the proper time for it, so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed. lowing about a handful
of each. It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one gmin'ol'
that I sowed this time came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain alter the seed was sown, it had no moisture to moist its growth, and
never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had
been newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined
was by the drought. I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial in,
and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the mt of my seed in
February, a little before the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months of
March and April to water it. sprung up very plumntly, and yielded a very good crop ;
but having part of the seed lelt only, and not daring to sow all that I had got, I had but
a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck ofeeeh ltind.
But by this experiment I was made master of my businem, and knew exactly when the
proper seasmi was to sow, and that I might expect two seed times and two harvests
every year. While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use to me
afterwnnls. As soon as lee rains Were over, and the weather begun to settle, which
was about the month of November, I made a Visit up the country to my bowcr,
where, though I had not been some months, I found all things just as I lelt them.
The circle or double hedge that I had made was not only lirm and entire, but the stakes
which I had cut off of some (not: that grew therenbouts were all shot out and grown
with long bmnches as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the lirst year after lapping
its head. I could not loll what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was
surprised, and yet very well pleased. to see the young trees grow : and I pruned them,
and led them up to growns much alike as I could ; and it is scarcely credible how
beautiful a figure they grew into, in three years; so that though the hedge made acirclo
ofubout twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, forsuch I might now call them, soon
covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
'Thi! made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a
semicircle round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I did ; and placing
the new or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence.
they grew presently, and were at firsts fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served for a. defence also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found new that the smous of the year might generally be divided. not into

summer and winter, as in Europe, but intoxhc rainy season: and the dry seasons, which
were generally thus :--.' I : h _ A, ' > .. i- an

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

The half of Febnmry, the whole of March, and the half of April--rainy, the sun being
then on or near the equinox.

the sun being then to the north of the inc.

The rainy scamus sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened to blow,
but this waa the geneml observation I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill

on, when another business took me up mon- time than it could be imagined I could
spur"l montionud before that. I had a great mind to see the whole island. and tlmt I had 1:

rmvcllcd up the brook, and so on to where I built my bowur, and where I had an
opening quite to the son. on the other side of the island. I now resolved I>> travel
quite across to the su-sluore on that. side; :10, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my
dog. and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual. with two biscuit-cakw and
a glcat. bunch of mixing in my pouch for my store, I begun my journey. \thn
I had named the vale when! my bower stood, as above, I came within View of the sea
to the west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly dcscricd land--whetlwr an island
or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very high. cxwuding from the \V. to thu
\\'.S.\Vl, at a very grunt distance; by my gum it. could not be less than fifteen or
twenty leagues 01?.

I could not tell what. part of the world this might be, otherwise than lhnl. I knew K
it. must. be part of America, and, us I concluded, by all my observations, mum. be near the a
Spanish dominiona, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where. if I should have /
landed. I had been in a wohte condition than I was now; and therefore I amllliescal in tho ,fi

223dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered everything i
for the but; I my I quieted my mind with this, and let! inflicting myself with
frnilltm wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair. I considered that if this land was the
Span'uh coast, 1 should certainly, one time or other, see some vessel pass or repose
one way or other; but if not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish
country and the Bmzils, which were indeed the worst of savages; for they are canni-
bal>>, and fail nut to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands>>

""ith these musithmtions, I walked very leisurely forn'nnl. I found that side of
the island where I now was much pleas-Inter than mine--the open or kwannah fields
sweet, adorned with flowem and gum>>, and full of Very fine woods. I saw abundance
of parrots, and faiu would I have caught one, if poeuihle, to have kept it to bo tame,
and taught it to spank to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young-parrot, for
I knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but it was
mute years before I could make him speak ,' however, at laat, I taught him to call me
by my name very famili: ly. But the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will
he very diVerting in its pl ce.

I was exeemliugly diverted with this journey. I found in the low grounds hares
(Is I thought them to he) and fox ; but they difl'emd greatly from all the other kinda
I had met with, nor could I satisfy myself to mt them, though I killed several. But I
had no need to he ventnruuzg for I had no want of food, and of that which was very
good, ton, eqiecially these three sorts, viz, goats pigeon); and turtle, or tortoise, which,
added to my grapes, L'eadenhall Market could not have furnished a table better than I,
in proportion to the company; and though my case was deplorahle enough, yet I had
great nurse for thankfnlnes that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had
rather plenty, even to duinties.

I never tmvelled in this journey ahovc two miles outright in a day, or thermhouts ;
hut I took so many turns and returns to see what discoveries I could make, that I came
weary enough to the place when: I Molvod to sit down for all night; and then I either
reprised myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or N) M no wild creature could come at me
withoutwa ' 5' am. As soon as I eann: to the sea-shore I was surprised to see that I had
taken up my lot on the womt wide of the island, for here, indeed, the share was
covert-d with innuun-mhle turtles whereas on the other side I had found hut three in
a year and a hall'. llem u \0 :m infinite number of fowla of many kinds, mule of
which I had not seen In , d many of them very good meat, but such art I knew
not the names ..r, e ept those called lwxrgllills.

I could harl- >hot .is many pleased, but was very sparing of my powder :md
' shot, and then-finn- had In- ! mind to kill a she-gout, if I could, which i could hettrv
' feed on; and though there were many goals here, more than on the other side of the
skull], yet it \\':|:( with muvh more dillicully that I could come near them, the. country
being llat and eve and th 1w me much sooner than when l was on the hills.

I confess this side of ti . 'ouutry was much pleasanwr than mine; hut yet I had
u--L the lice-t inclination to remove, [or as I was fixed in my hahitation it became
natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here to he as it were upon .1 journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the xhore of the sea towards the east, I
suppme ahout twelve'miltw uul then setting up a great p- le upon the shore for a mark,
l concluded I would go hom Igaia, and that the next journey I took should he on theCRUSOE AT HOME AGAIN. '

 

other side of the island east from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my post
again, of which in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily keep all
the island so much in my view, that I could not miss finding my first dwelling by
viewing the country ; but I found myself mistaken, for, being come about two or three
miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley, butso sun-minded with hills,
and those bills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my way by any
direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unlm I knew very well the position of
the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to my further misfortune, that the
weather pmvcd hazy for three or four days while I wusin this valley, and not being able
to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find out
the sca~sidc, look for my past, and come back the same way I went: and then, by may
journeys, I turned homewnrd, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammu-
nition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a. young kid, and seized upon it, and I running in
to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to .
bring it home if I could, for I had often been musing whether it might not be pomihlc . ;
to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats which might supply me when
my powder aml shot should be spent. I made a collar to this little creature, and
with a string, which I mado of some rope'yarn, which I always carried about me, I led
him along, though with some ditlicnlty, till I came to my bower, and there I incloscd
him and lolt him. for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
absent above a month.

I cannot express what a. mtisfilction it was to me to come into my old hatch, and
lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey, without settled place of
abode, had been so unplmmnt to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a
perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it rendered everything about me so
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a great way from it again, while it should
be my lot to stay on the Iolflllll.

I rcposed myself here a week, to nest and regalo myself aher my long journey;
during which, most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage
for my Poll, who began now to be a more domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the poorkid which I had pent in within my little
circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food; accordinglyI went, and
fonml it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved for want
of food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and brancnm of such shrubs as I could find,
and threw them over, and having fed it, I tied it u I did'before, to lead it away ; but
it was so tame with being hungry, tlutt I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me
like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so
fund, that it became from that time one of my domestics also, and would never leave
nu.- afterwards.

Tho rainy sermon of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the 30th of
September in the same "solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of my landing
on the island, having now been there two yean, and no more prospect of being
delivered than the first day Icame there. I spent the whole day in humble and thankful
acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave
humble and hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me that it was

' '75 'possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition than I should have ban in
aliberty of society, and in all the plenum of the world: that He could fully make
up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want at human society, by his
presence, and the connnunimtion of his grace to my soul; supporting, condoning, and
rnconmging me to depend upon his providence here. aml hope for his eternal presence
hereafter.

It was now tlull. I began wuail-ly to feel how much more happy the life I now led
was, with all its miserable circulnslzlueex, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led
all the pan part of my days; and now having changed both my sorrows and my joys;
my very (lesll't'x altered, my alfcetions changed their gusts, and my delights were per-
fectly new from what the were at lint coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.

Define, as I walked about, either on my hauling, or for viewing the country, the
anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon Inc on a sudden, and my very
heart would die within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in,
and how I was a priwner, locked up with the eternal bat-5 and bolts of the ocean, in an
uninhabited wildernesg without redemption. In the midst of the greatest composure:
of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me. wring my
handx, and weep like a child; sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work,
and I would imnnnliatclr sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or
two together; and thi still worse to me, for if I could bnmt out into tears, or vent
myself by wonlsg it would go all", and the grief having exhausted itself would abate

But now I lN'gIIII to exercise myself with new thoughts I daily read the Word of
God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state, One morning, being very
sad, I opened the Bible upon tin-so words, "I will never leave thee, nor foriake
thw." Immediately it occurted that these words were tome; why else should they
be directed in such a manner, just at the moment when I was Innurni g over my con-
dition, as one fora-\ken of God and man? "Well, then," said I, " if God does not
forsake me, of what ill mmupn-nre mu it be, or what matters it, though the world
should all forstke me, swing. on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose
the fin'onr and lilt'sallx'c' of God, then: would be no comparison in the loan 1"

From this monwnt I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for me to
be more happy in this form .en, a ulitary condition, than it was probable I should ever
have been in any other par: state in the World ; and with this thought I was going
to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but
something shocked my mind at that thought, and Idurst not speak the wonls. " How
canal. thou become such a hypocrite," said 1, even audihl "' to pretend to be thankful

, for a condition, which, however thou maycat endeawour to be contented with, than

: wouldst rather p y heartily to be delivered from I" So l atopped there; but though I
could not my I thankwl God for being there, yet I sincerely giro tlmuks to God for
opening my tag by wlxate\ r atllicting providence-s, to see the former rendition of my
life, and to mourn for my wickedness and reg-cut. l newer opened the Bible. or shut
it, but my very soul within me bless-ml God for directing my friend in England. without
may order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me alterwarda to
save it out ot~ the wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this tlislmsilioll of mind, I begin: my third year; and though I have
not given the rmdrr the trouble of so particular an account of my works this your as
the first; yet in general it may be obserrcd that I was very seldom idle, but having
regularly divided my time according to several daily employmcuts that \vere before

me, such nzt, first, my duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly
set apart some time for, tln'iee every day ; xxx-orally, the going abroad with my gun for
food, which generally tool: up three hours in er y morning, when it did not ruin;
thirdly, the ordering, curing. preserving, and muvkiug what I had killed or caught for
my supply : these took up great lnrt of the day also, it is to be considered, that in the
middle of the day, when the sun was in the zunth, I' 3 violence of the heat was too
great to alll'ullb; so that about. four hours in the eve ing was all the time I could be
suppmted to work in, with this cxv uion, that aonietinn-s I changed my hours of
hunting and working. and went to work in the morning. and abroad with my gun in
the afternmn.

To thi 1th time allowed for labour, I desire may he added the exceeding laborious-
ues' of Int" work ; the many Imlll'i which for want of tools, want of help. and want of
skill, or hi I did took up out of my time : for example. I was full two-and-
t'orty d- x m u king a board for a l - shelf, which I wanted in my cue; whet-ms
two saw_ m with their tools and a raw nit, would have cut six of them out of the some
tree in hall'a day.

My ea<e was thin~ : it was to he a large tree which was to be cut down, IK'CRIIISC my
bnanl \\ \- to be a brood one. This tree I was three days a cutting down, a rd two
more eutti all the Laughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. "'ith inert.
pre5<ihle l . "in; and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips till it began to
be light enough to more; then I turned it, and made one xi ie of it smooth aml tlat :u
a board from end to end; then turning that side downward, cut the other side till I
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one
mxy judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work; but labour and patience
carried me through that, and many other things 3 I only observe this in particular, to
show the run-on why no much ol'my time went away with so little Work, \'i7.., that what
might be a little to be done with help and took, wzu a vast labour aml required a pm-
digious lime to dual-me, and by hand. But notwithstanding this, with patience nml
labour, I went through many things, and indeel everything that my circumstance: made
necessary to me to do, as will nppmr by what follows.

I was now in the months of Novemlwr and December, expecting my crop of barley
and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for them was not great; for, as I
observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of halfn peek, for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry . -n : but now my crop promised Very well, when on
a sudden I found I was in dam r of losing it all agaiu by enemies of several sorts,
which it mu scarcely imatible to keep front it; as, first, the grants, and wild creatures
which I called hart-:5 whivh, t ting the sweetncu of the blade, hay in it night and day,
mt soon as it came up, and eat it no close that it could get no tim: to shoot up into
stalk.

This I mw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure about it with a hedge, which
I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it required a great deal of speed ;
the creatures daily spoiling my corn. However, as mynruble land was but small, suited
to my crap, I got it totally well fenced in about three weckx' time ; and shooting some
of the ereatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to
n stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long; an in a little time
the enemies forsoolt the place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to
ripen apaee.

But as the beasts mint-:1 me before, whih; my corn am in the bhtde, so the birds were

I

A,>>how it throw, I saw my little crop surrounded With fowls, of I know not how many
sorts who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone. l immediately let Ily
among them, for I always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose
up a little cloud of fowls, which I had nut seen at all, from among the corn it.le

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would devour all
my hopes ; that I should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all ; and what
on do I coulzl not tell ; however, I re<olved not to lose my eon), if lmiblo, though I
should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among it, to see what damage
was already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet
too green for them, the loss was not so great, but the remainder was likely to be a good
crop, if it could he mvetl.

I stayed by it to load my gun, and than coming away, I could atsily see the thieves
sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away, and
the event proved it m be so; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out
of their sight, but they dropped down one by one into the corn again. I was so
provoked that I could not have p ttieuee to stay till more came on, knowing that every
grain that they out new mu, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence ;
but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This was what- I
wisheNl fur ; x0 I took them up, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in '
[in and, vi7., hanged them in chains, for a terror mother: It is impassihle to imagine
almost. that this should have had such an effect as it hml. for the fowls would not only
not come at the earn, but, in short, they forsonk all that part of the island, and I could
newer see a bird near the place tut long as my searecmws hung there. This I was Very
glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end of December, which was our mound
harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.

I was sully put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I could do want to
make one, as well as I could, out of one of the brood-swords, or euthmcs, which I awed
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no
great ditlieulty to out it down ; in short, I rcapml it in my way, for I cut nut-hing ofi '
but the aunt, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbel it
out with my hands; anvl at the eml of all my harvesting, I found that out at my half-
peek ofseed I had nmr twu bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley;
that is to say, by my gun's", for I had no nn-asnrt- at that time.

However, this was' a grait encnumgement to me, anl I foresaw that in time it
would plume God to supply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed agiin. for
I neither knew how u- gn'nd or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and
part it ; nor, if made into mud, how to make bread of it ; and it' how to make it, yet
Iknew not how to bake it; these things being added to my desire of having a good
quantity for atom, and to secure a constant supply, I "solved not to taste any of this
emp, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and, in the mean time, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this gmt work of providing
myself with corn and broad.

It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. It is a little wonderful,
and wl t I believe few people have thought much upon, viz, the strange multitude of
little things necessary in the providing. producing, curing, timing, making, and finish-
ing this one article of bmld.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily discourage-

79 '
ment and was made mole and more sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the
first handful of seal-corn, whirh, as I have mid, come up unexpectmlly, and indeed
to a surpri. .

First, I had no plough to tum up the earth; no spade or shovel to dig it "'ell,
this I conquered by making me a wooden Sllflllt', as 1 observed before; but this did my
work but in a wooden manner; and though it out me a great many days to make it,
yet for want of iron, it not only Wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and
made it be perfornn-d much worse. However, this I bone with too, and was content to
work it out with patience. and bear with the badnem of the perfommnct'. "'hen the
corn wau sown, I had no han'ow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy buugh ot'a live over it, to scratch it, as it may be tailed, rather than rake or bar-
row it. When it was gmwing, or grown, I have observed already how many things
I Wanted to Fence it. set-lul- it, mow or map it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it
from the than", and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, aml an oven to bake it in; and all these things I did
\vithout, as shall be observed; and yet the com wmt un incatimable comfort and
advantage to me too. But thixs as I said, made everything laborious and tedious to
I 2; but that there was no help for; neither was III\' time so much lost to me, lwcmzk',
as I had divided it, a certain part of it wax even y aplminted to these works; and
as I had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me.
I had the next si\' months to apply myself wholly. by labour and invention, to l'uruiah
myself with lllcllails proper for the [mrformii a all the ope atioiw necessity for making
the corn, when I had it, lit for my use.

But first l mu to pn-[un' more land. for I had now .xeed enough to now have an
acre of ground. Before Idid this I had a week's work at least to make inn. slxule,
which, when it wa> done, \\':|:< but a Mary one indeed, and very heavy. and required
double labour to work with it. However, I went through that, and sowed my seed in

two large flat pieces of ground, :Lx' near my house at I could find them to my mind, ~ Id
fenced them in with u gnod hedge, the stakes of which were all cut of that wood

which I had set before, which I knew would grow; so that, in one yo '5 time. I knew I
should h: e a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. This work was
not so little as to take me up lest than three montlw, because great part of that time

and teaching him (I ~lx<i '; and I quickly leamt him to know his own name, and at last
to speak itout pretty loud, " l'ull." which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the

indeed, l wanted Noely, but knew not where to come at them. However, considering
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but it' I could find out any , I might
butch up some such pot as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough and strong
enough to ln::u' handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and required to be kept
so ; and M this was )luL'tNkll'y in prelnriug com, meal, the, which was the thing I was
upon, I rtN-lvul to make mine as large as I could, and lit only to atand like jars, to hold
what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many awkward\ ways I [oak to raise this pane; what odd, misshapen, ugly

things I made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell out--the

clay not being slill' enough to lxmr its own weight; how many cralcked
by the orer~riolent heat of the sun, being set out {no hastily; and how
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well bcfmv as alter they wen:
dried; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the clay--
lo dig it, to temper it, ta bring it home, and work it--I could not make
above two large earthen ugly things (I cmnmt call them jars) in about two
momhs' labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and haul, I lined them very
gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which I had
made on purpose for them, that they might not break ; and as between ll": not
und the basket there was a little room to spare, I stufl'ed it full of the rice and
barley straw ; and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.

patle, or heater, of the Wood culled the iron-wood ; Ind this I prepnred and laid by
train" I haul my next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or rather
pound my com or meal. to make my bread.

My next dillicnlty was to make a sieve, or ~iiervze, to drum my meal, and to part it
from the [mm and the husk; without which I did not see it lmssiblel could have any
bread. This Was 3 mutt diflicnlt thing, so much in! but to think on. for to be sure I hm]
nothing like the neat-<<try things to muke it with; I mean fine thin callus, or stuff,
to sir-me the meal through. And here I was at it full stop for runny months; nor did I
rullly know what to do. Linen I haul nono left but wlmt was more rugs; I had goatvf-
hair, but. neither knew I how to weave or spin it; end lmd I known how, here were no
tools to work it with. All the remedy thut I round for this was, thnt at lust I did
remember I had, among the senmen's clothes which were awed out of the ship, some
neckcloihs of calico or muslin ; uud with some pieces of these I uunle three snutll sieves,
but proper enough for the work; mul thus I made shift for some years: how I did ulter-
wards, I shnllshow in its place.

The bu g port was the next thing to be considered, und how I xhuuld muke bread
when I mine to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast ; as to that part, as there was no
supplying the want,so I did not concern myself Inueh ubont it. But for nnoreu, I was
indeed in gnnt puiu. At length I found out an experiment for that also, which wus
this: I made some earthen vowels very brand, but not deep, tlmt is to say, about two

 

 

' fwt diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I burned in the tire, its I lutd

done the min-

 

nnl laid them by ; and when I wanted to bake, I mnde a great lire upon
the lu-urth, which I had paved with some square tilt>>, of myown making and burning
:dm: but I should not cull them squnre.

When the lire-wood wus burned pretty much into embers, or live coals, I drew them
forward upon this heurth, so us to cover it all over, and here I let them lie till the
hmrth was re ' hot; then sweeping :twny oil the embem, I set down my loafor 11mm,
and "'lll'lllll a luwn the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers nll round the outside
ol' the pot, to keep in :nnl add to the hurt; and thus, m: well as in the beat oven in the
world, I lutkfil my burlr-y-hnves, and bet-nine, in little time, .1 good lumtry-cook into the
ltiiguin : for I made myself reread cakes mid puddingvt ol'the rice ; indeed I made no
I nuitlu-r hard I anything to put into them, supposing I hnd, except the flesh either
oi luwls or goals

It need not be wondered ut ifnll these things took me up most part of the third year
of my abode he : for, it is to be ole't'fl'fil (hut, in the intervals of these things, I had
my new Imrn nul hmbnndry to ul:|n:"e; for I reaped my corn in its stimuli, and
curriml it linllw < well as I could. and laid it up in the air in my lnrge baskets, till I
had time to rub it out, for I had no floor lo tlmush it on, or instrument to tin-uh
it with. .

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build my barns
bi- er ; I wunted a plnee to lay it up in, for the increase of the corn now yielded me so
much, that I luid of the barley ubout twenty bushels and of the rice us much, or more;
insomuch that I now rewolrml to begin in use it freely; for my bread hud been quite
gone it great while; also I resolved to see what niumtity would be snflieient for me a
wilule year, and to sow but once :t your. -

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barleymnd rice were much more
than I could consume in n year; so I resolved to sow just the name quantity every year.

wood, I might with great trouble cut it down, if after I might beable with my tools to
hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat. and burn or cut out the innide
to make it hollow, m as to make a boat of it--if, after all this. I must lave it just
there where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the water! _

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon my mind of
my eircnmstaneea while I was making this boat, but I should have immediately thought
how I should get it into the flea ; but my thoughts were no intent upon my voyage over
the sea. in it, that I never once considered how I should get it ed' the land: and it was
really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five mila of sea, than
about forty-five fathom: of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the voter.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did, who had any
of his aeusm awake I pleased myself with the dung", without determining whether I
was ever ahle to undertake it; not but that the difiiculty of launching my boat came
often into my head; but I put a. stop to my inquiries into it, by this foolish answer
which I gave myself : " Let me first make it; I warrant I shall find some Way or other
to get it along when it is done."

This was a most preposterous method ; but the eagernes of my fancy prevailed, and
to work I went, and felled a cedar-tree. I qmstiou much whether Solomon ever had
such a one for the building the Temple at Jenimleni; it was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the
end of twenty-two feet ; alter which it lesieued for a while, and then parted into
launches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty
days hacking and hewiug at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limhs and the vast apmdiug herd of it cut oil} whieh I hacked and howed through
with my axe and hatchet, and inexpreasible labour; alter this, it cost me a month to
shape it and dub it to a proportion, and tosomething like the bottom of a boat, that it
might swim upright an it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear the
inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it: this I did, indeed, without fire,
by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be u
very handsome perigua, and big enough to have carried six-und-tweuty men. and
consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

\thn I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it. The boat
was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or pen'agna. that was made of one tree,
in my life. Many a wary stroke it had cost, you may be sure--for them remained
nothing but to get it into the water ; mid had I gotten it into the water, I make no
quation but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be
perfonned, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost infinite
hhour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water, and not more ; but the
lint inconvenience was it was up hill towards the creek. Well. to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity.
This I began, and it cost me a prodigious dad of pains (but who grudge pains that have
their deliverance in view I); but when this was worked through, and this dilheulty
managed, it was still much at one, for I could no more Itir the canoe thin I could

the water. Well, I began this work; and when I began to enter into it, and calculate
how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the Stuff was to be thrown out, I found

_ that, by the number of hands I hail, being none but my own, it must have been ten or <<

twelve years before I could have gone through with it ; far the shore lay no high that
at the upper end it mutt have be a at least twenty feet deep; so at length, though
with great reluctzmcy, I gave this attempt over also.

This grieved me heartily, and now I saw, though too late, the folly of beginning a
work beloro we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go
through with it.

III the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and kept my
anniversary with the some devotion, and with as much comfort as ever before ; for, by
a constant study and serious application of the \Vord of God, and by the "instance of
his grace, I gained a difl'crent knowledge from what I had before. I entertained
different notions of things. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which
I had nothing to do with, no expectation from. and. indeed, no desires about: in a
word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to II: o. So I thought it
looked. as we may perhaps look upon an hereafter, viz.. as a plaee I had lived in, but
was come out of it; and well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, " Between
mo and thra- is a moat gulf fixed." ' '

In the that place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world hero ; I had
neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life. I had nothing
to covet, for I had all I was now capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole
manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole country
which I had possession of. There were no rivals ; I had no competitor, none to dispute
soven-ignty or command with me. I might have "fiscal shiploadings of corn, but I had
no us" for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tor-
tuim or turtles enough, but now and then one was as much as I could put to any use.
I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had gmlx-s enough to have
made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been
built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to at and to
supply my wants, and what was all the rat to mel If I killed more flesh than I
Could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin ; if I sowed more com than I could eat, it
must be spoiled ; the trees that I cut down were lylng to rot on the ground; I could
make no mono use of them than for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my
food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just reflection,
that all the good things of this world are no further good to us than they are for our
u<c ; ant. that, whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, we enjoy as much as we
can use, mid no more. The most covetous, griping raiser in the world would have
been cured of the vice of coi'etousnm, if he had been in my case; for I possessed in-
finitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire, except it was
of things which I had not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of great use to me.
I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver. about thirty-six
pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, Sony, useless stufi' lay! I had no manner of
,bnziness for' It; and I often thought with m\self that I would have given a. handful of it
for a gloss of tobacco- -pipes: or for a hand- mill to grind my' corn ,nay, I would have
gh en it all for sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a. handful ,
of pars and beans, and n bottle of ink, As it was I had not the least minutes: by It.
or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, sud grew rnouldy with the dump of the
cave in tho wot sermons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the '
some cute, they had been of no manner of rxduo to me, because of no use.

I hnd now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself thnn it was no first.
and much mier to my mind, us well as to my body. I frequently sat down to meat
with thankfuluesx, nnd admired tho hand of God's providence, which had thus spread
my table in the wilder-nest I learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition,
and less upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjnyed rather thnu what I wanted ;
and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, thnt I cannot express them; and
which I take notice of here, to put those discontented purple in mind of it, who ennuot
enjoy comfortably Whut God has given them, because they sec and covet something that
he has not given them. All our discouteuts nbout what we not appeared to me to
spring from the want of thnukfulnms for what we hove.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would heso to any one that
should fall inwsuch distress as mine was ; nnd this wns, to compare my present condition
with what I at first expected it would be; hay. with what it would eertniulv lmve been,
if the good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be oust up nearer
to the shore, when: I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got out of
her to the shore, for my roliefnud comfort; without which, I had wanted for tools to
work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I umy say whole days, in representing to myself, in the most
lively coluunx, how I must have acted if I hnd got nothing out of theship. How I could
not have so much ns got any food, except fish and turtles; Ind that, as it was long
before I found any of them, I must have perished first; that I should hnve lived, if I
hnd not lmrisln-d, like n more sn'uge ; thnt if I hnd killed (goat or a fowl, by any cun-
trivnucc, I hzul no way to llny <<open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the bou'els,
or to cut it up; but must gnnw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a. bout.

These rclluctiuns made me Very sensible of the goodnas of Providence to me, and
very thankful for my present condition, with nll its hardships and misfortunes: and this
part ulna I mnnot but recommend to the reflection of those who urc apt, in their misery,
to say, " Is nuy affliction like mine l" Let them consider how much worse the cow of
some people are, and their case might hare been. if Providence had thought fit.

I had another reflection; which assisted me also to comfort my mind with hopcs ;
and this was comparing my present situation with what I hid deserved, nud had there
fore reason to expect from the lnmd of Providence. I had livcdadmnlful rile. perfectly
destitute of the knowledge nnd fear of God. I lnrd been vn-ll instructed by farther and
mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in their early endeavours to infuse 9.
religious awe of God into my mind, n sense of my duty, and whnt the nature and end
0! my being ruluired of me. But, alas! Culling curly into the soafirriug life, which, of
all liven in the most dutituto of the fear of God, though his terrors are always before
them ; I my, falling curly into the seafaring life, and into sum-ring company, sll thnt
little sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my mes-mute: ;
by s hardened dotpkirrg of dragon. and the views of death, which grew hnbituol to me ;
by my long absence from all nmnner of opportunities to convene with anything but
what was like myself. or to hear anything of what was good, or tended towards it

So void wss I of everything that was good, or of the least sense of what I was. or was
to be, that, in the greatest deliver-once I enjoyed--such as my ewpe from Sauce; my- .\\

being taken up by the Portuguese master of the ship; my being planted no well in the
Bmzils; my receiving the cargo from England, and the like--I never once had the
words, "Thnnl: God !" so much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the greatest
distreso had I so much thoughts as to pray to him, or so much as to any, "Lord, have
mercy upon me 1" no, not to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by, and
hlaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, no I have already oborved,
on the account of my wicked and hardened life must; end when I looked about me, and
considered what [articular providunees had attended me since my coming int this place,
and how God had dealt bountifully with rue--had not only punished me less than my
iniquity had deserved, but had so plentifully provided for mo--thix guve me great hopes
that my repentance was aocophxl, and that God had yet inereim in store for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to resignation to the will of
God in the present disposition of my circumstances but even to u xineero tluu-L'fulnens
for my condition ; Ind that I, who was yet in living man, ought not to complain, neeiug I
had not the due punishment of my sins. That I enjoyai so many mercies which I had
no reason to huve expected in that place. That I ought never more to repino at my con.
dition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that duily bread, which nothing but a
crowd of wonders could have huought. Thnt I ought to consider I had been fed even by
a miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah hy ravens; nay, by along series of

miracle; And that I could hardly have named a phsoe in the uninhabited port of the '

world where I could have been out more to my advantage; a plum where, u I hid no

society, which was my afllictiou on one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious . ,Wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous creatures or poisonous, which I might
have fed on to my hurt ; no savages to murder and devour me. In a word, as my life
was a life of sorrow one way, so it Who a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing
to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of God's goodnas to me,
and care over me in this condition, be my daily comolstion ; and after I made a just
improvement of those things, I went away, and was no more ml. I had now been here
no long, thnt many things which I brought on short for my help were either quite gone
or very much wasted and near spent.

My ink, an I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little, which I ekcd
out with water, a little and n little, till it was so pale, it scaroe left any appearance of
black upon the paper. As long as it lasted I made use of it to minute down the days
of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to Inc; and that, by mating up
times past, I remembered that there was 9. strange concurrence of days in the various
providences which befall me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe
days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had mason to have looked upon with a great
deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the some day that I broke away from my father sud my
friends, and nan away to Hull, in order to go to sea, theumeday aflerwards I was
token by the Solleo man-of-vmr, and nunle n slave ; the same day of the year that I
mped out of the wreck of that. ship in Yarmouth Ronda, that mine day'of the year
afterwards I made my escnpe from Snlloe in a. boat; the same day of the year I was
horn on, viz, the 20th of September, the some day I had my life no miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this island ; so that my wicked life
and mliun-y life began both on a duy.

The next thing to my ink being wastrel, was that of my hrerul--I main, the biacuit
which I brought out of the ship; this I hrnl hltsbnntled to the last degree, nllo'lfing
myself but one who of bread a <<Lay for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread
for a year before I got any corn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to
miraculous.

My clothes too, began to (leery mightily ; as to linen, I had had none a good while,
except some chequered shirts which I found in the cheats of the other serum, and which I
carefully prmerved ; because many times I could bear no other clothes on hut-n shirt ; and
it wnsa very great help to me that I had, union; all the men's clothesof the ship, almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch~oonts of the seamen's which
were left behind, but they were too hot to wear: and though it is true that the weather
was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked--
no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not ; nor could I slide the thoughts of
, it, though I was all alone. One mson why I could not go naked was, I could not hear

~ the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin ; when-as, with a shirt on, the air itself made some
motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No more
could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat ; the
heat of the sun, heating with such violence as it does in that place, would give me the
headache presently, by darting so directly on my head, without 3 cap or hat on, so that
I could not hear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would preoently go any.

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few mg: I had, which I
called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoat! I had, end my busi- , .. - ___ ' --.~ . i'l".

nest was now to try if I could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I
had by me, and with such other materials as I had ; no I act to work, tailoring, or
rather, indeed, botehing, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made ahiftw }
make two or three waistcoat-s which I hoped would serve me a great while ; as for
bmcehcs or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterward&

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the Quantum that i killed, I mean
four-footed ones, and I had them hung up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by which
nun-n: some ofthom were so dry and hard that they were fit for little, but othoni, it seems,
were very useful. Tho first thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with
the hair on the outside, to about 011' the rain ; and this I performed so well, that alter, I
made me a suit of clothes wholly of those skinx--thut istosaym waistcoat, and breechei
open at the knew, and both loose, for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to
keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge thut they were wrelehodlymnde ; for
if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worm tailor. However, they were such as I made a
very good shift with, and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, tho hair of the
waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella. I was in-
deed in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had seen them made in
the Brazil); where they are very useful in the great heats which me there, and I felt the
heats every jot as great here, and greatevmo, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the minus the
lit-nu I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while before I could make any-
thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three btk
fun: I made one to my mind. But at last I made one that answered indiil'ereudy well ;
the main dillieulty I found was to make it to let down. I could makeitxprcad, but if it
did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be portable for me any way but just over
my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer. I _
owned it with skins, the hair npu'unlgso that it cost oll' thermin like a punt-house, and i _
kept olI the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with
greater :ulvuntago than I could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it, I
could close it, and carry it under my arm. -

Thus I lived mighty comfintil: my mind being entiwly composed by resigning
to the will of God, and thmwing In_ self wholly upon the <<linxxmtl of his providence. '.
This made my life better than amiable, for when I began to regret the want of couver- I
mtion, I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, .ili
and (as I hope I may say) with even my Maker, by ejaculations and pctitionr, was not 32$
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world? 't .' '

I cannot say that, after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing happened to me, ,
but I lived on in the same courage, in the same posture and plaoc,jurt as before. The chief Ii
thing I was employed in, beddea my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and
curing my mixing--of both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of
the year's provision beforehand--I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour of
going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make me a canoe, which at last I finished ;
so that. by digging a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it with-
out eonsidering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be able todauuehit, so, never
being able to bring it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to lot it lie .5
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time. Indeed, the next

    
 

  

 

 

Itime, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in I place when I could not
got the water to it at any has distance than, on I hove mid, of near hall's rnile, yet, no
I new it was practicable ut hurt, I never gave it over; and though I was our two years
about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having n bout to go 03' to ace. Lt
lest.

' However, though my little periogun woe finished, yet the eize of it was not nt ell
mwemble to the design which I had in view when I nude the first ; I mean ofventur.
ing over to the term firma, where it was nbore forty miles brood; accordingly, the
smellum of my boot asisted to put on end to lhnt design, Ind now I thought no more
ol'it An I had A boot, my next <<Inigo woe to make a. tour round the island; for u I
had been on the other side in one place, erasing. I8 I hve already described it, over
the land, so the discoveries I made in tlnt journey made me very eegor to one other
parts of the coast; and now I bed a boat, I thought of nothing but .iling round the
inland.

For this purpoee, end that I might do everything with discretion nnd consideration, I
fitted up a little most in my bent, and Inude e sail to it out of some of the pieces of the
ship's soils which hey in store, mid of which l luul o greet store by me. Huv-ing fitted

hollow place I cut in the inside of the boot, where I could buy my gun, mnking I flap
to hung down over it, to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella alto in a step It the stern, like n must, to stood over my head,
end keep the heat of the sun offer me, like an awning. And thus I every now and then
took a. little voyage upon the sen ; but never went G-r nut, nor fur from the little creek.
At hut. being atger to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour; and uoenrdingly I victunlled my ship for the voyage, putting in two down of
loaves (cakes I should rather (:l" them) of barley braid, nn earthen pot full of lurched
rice (u food I ate a great dad of), n liltle bottle of rum, hull'u goat. nnd powder with shot
for killing more, and two huge wnwh-oxmu, of those which, no I mentioned before, I had
saved out of the scamcn's chests ; thm I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover
me in the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the qixth your of my reign, or my captivity, which

' you please, tlurt I set out on thin voyage, nnd I found it mneh longer than I expected;

, for though the island itself vrns not very huge, yet when I mum to the east side of it,

_ I. found is great ledge of rock: liu out ubont two league: into the sen, xome above water,

When I first discovered them, I won going to give over my enterprise, and come hock
ngnin, not knowing how fiir it might oblige me to go out to bee; and, above all, doubt-
ing how I should get back again ; so I come to an anchor; for I bud medenlrind ofnn
anchor with a piece of 3 broken gmppling which I got out of the ship.

lluving secured my beet, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up n hill, which
seemed to overlook that point whereI saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the eon, from thut hill where I stood, I perceived 3 strong and, in-
deed, A most furious current, which nu to the east, and even me close to the point;

would have been so; for there was the mine current on the other sixlo of thu island,
nuly that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there wus a strong eddy under the

boot along with it with such violence thnt all I oonld do could not keep her I0 mneh an
on the edge of it ; but I found it hurried mo further and firthor out from the eddy, which
was an my left bend There was no wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with
my puddles signified nothing. And now I began to give myself over for lost; for on the
current was on both sides of the island, I knew in n few lenguee' distenee they mnst'juin
again, and then I wee irreeovemble gone ; nor did I see my poaihility of avoiding it ;
so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing. not by the gen, for that we>>! eelrn
enough, but of starving from hunger. I hid, indeed, found n tortoise on the shore, no
big nlmoet as I could lift, and had tossed it into th bent; end I had n greotjnr of fresh
wear, that in to any, one of my earthen pots ; but what was ell this to being driven into
the vast ocean, when, to be sure, then was no shore, no mainland or inland, for 3
thousand lenguee at leut'l

And new I euw how euy it was for the providence of God to make the most
miseruble eendition that mankind could be in worse. Now I looked back upon my
desolate, xolitnry island as the meet pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness
my heart could wish {or was to be there gain. I stretched out my hands to it, with
anger wishes " 0 happy desert !" said I, " I shall never see thee more. 0 miserable
creature! whither em I going 1" Then I ropronched myself with my unthnukl'ul tem-
per, end how I hnd mpiued nt my solitary condition ; nud now what would I giro to
be on shore there again! Thus, we never see the true state of our condition till it in
illuxtmted to us by its oontraries, nor know how to value whnt we enjoy, but by the
want of it. It is namely possible to imagine the constenmtion I was now in, being
driven from my beloved ielnnd (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean,
uhueet two lei-gum, end in the utmost despair of ever recovering it ognin. However, I
worked hnrd till, indeed, my strength was nhnost exhausted, end kept my bout a much
to the northward--that in. towards the side of the current which the eddy luy on--ae
poexibly I could ; when about noon, on the sun posed the meridian, I thought I felt a
little brew of wind in my thee, springing up from the SSE This cheered my hunt n
little, nnd especinlly when, in about hulf nu hourmore, it blown pretty small, gentle gale.
By this time, I lnul got at a frightful distance from the island; and had the least cloudy
or hazy weather intervened, I lull been undone mother woy.too ; for I hul no compos-
on been], and should never have known how to have steered townrdn the inlund, if I
had but once lost sight of it. But the weuther continuing clear, I applied myself lo get
up my meet again, and nprmd my mil, otonding away to the north on much u poaible,
to get out of the current.

J net as I hml set my must and nail, and the bent begun to stretch away, I new even
by the clenrnm of the water some nltemtiun of the current wee near; for where the
current was no strong, the water wxv; foul ; but perceiving the writer cleur, I found-
the current nbntc; nnd prisently I found to the out, at about half n mile, 3 breech
of the m upon some rocks. These rocks I found canned the current to pint nguin. end
as the main sum of it run nwny more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north--emf, no
the other returned by the repulse of the rock, and nude 1 strong eddy, which run book
ngnin to the north-west, with n very ehnrp stream. .

They who know whut it is to have a. reprieve brought to them upon the ladder, or
to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who huve been in IlchI ex-
tremities, my guess what my prerent surprise of joy was, and how glndly I put my bent
into the min of this eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.'This eddy err-vied me about a league in my way back again, directly towards
the island, but about two leagues more towards the northward than the current lay
which carried me away at first ; so that when I came near the 'ndaud, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to
that which I went out from.

\Vlren I had made something more than a league of way by help of this current
or eddy, I found it was spent, and saved me no farther. However, I found that being
between two great currents, viz, that on the south side, which had hurried me away, and
that on the north, which lay about two leagues on the other side ; I my, between these
two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way ;
and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,
though not making such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being than within about a league of the island, I
found the poiutof the rocks which occasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described
lwfirre, to the southward, and casting off the current more southerly, had, of course,
made another eddy to the north ; and this I found very strong, but directly setting
the way my course lay, which was due wmt, but almost full north. However, having a
fiedr gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west ; and in about an hour arms
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water, I soon got to land.

\Vhen I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my deliverance,
resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself
with such things as I had, I brought nry boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I
had spied under some trees and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour
and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat! I had run so
much humrd, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting it by the way I
went out ; and what might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor
had I any mind to run anymore ventures. So I resolved on the next morning to make
my way westward along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay
up my frigate in safety,so as to have her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles
or thermbouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or hay, about a. mile over,
which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very
convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in s. little dock
made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went
on shore to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been before, when I
travelled on foot to that shore; so, taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and
umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began my march. The way was comfortable
enough after such a. voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old bower in
the evening, where I found everything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in
good order, being, as I said before, my country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs, for I was very
weary, and fell asleep. But judge you, if you am, that read my story, what a. surprise
I must have been in when I was awakod out of my'sleep by a voice, eslling me by
my name several times: "Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe! poor Robin Crusoe! Where
are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you? \thre have you been?"

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or paddling, as it is called,
the first part of the day, and walking the latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly;

95
and dozing hi-tivi-ou sleeping and waking. thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me;
hut as the \'oici- wutiiiIu-d to repeat, " Rohiii Crusoe ! Robin Crusoe l" at laxt I hogan tn
awnko mum pi-ifwtly, ainl was at first (Imult'iilly frightened, and stark-d up in the iitiuont
conswmation. But no sooni'r were my eyes (upon, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top
of tln- ln-dgr- id iniiiu-dinu-ly know that it was liietliat spoke to am; for just in such
lu-xnoanin-c e - I had used to talk to him, and teach him; and he had learned it

ay, " l'oor lluhin Cram" Where an: yonl "'th have you btcnl How me
you hon. " and such things aii I had taught him.

How 'or, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could he nobody
else, it was a good whilo before I could ooniposo uiyiwlt'. First, I was minimal how the
eneitun' got thither ; and than, how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere
t-lsi- : hut a>> I was well sitisticd it could he nohody but honest Poll, I got over it; and
holding out my hand, aml calliig him by his name. " Poll," the sociable cmtum came
to me, and hit upon my thumb, as ho maul to do, and continued talking to me, " Poor
Robin mec! and how did I come howl and when: had I been I" just as if he had
been overjoyed to lice me again 3 and so I uirricd Iiiiii homo along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to ma for some time, and had enough to do for
many days, to sit still, mid rcllrot upon the danger I had been in. I would have been
very glad to have hail my boat again on my sidi: of the island ; but I knew not how it
was pnwt-iuiblc to get it about. Ax to the cast tide of the island, which I had gone
round, I know well rnough than: was no venti g that way ; my very heart would
shrink, mid my \'i-ry Idaod i-uii 'hill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of the
island, I did not know how ii i glitl>> thaw. Iliit supposing the current ran with tho
mine furco xigninstthr xlion-zit the must as IL Irma-d by it on the other, I might run
the muu- risk of bring driven down the atrium. and un-riod by the island, as I had hoon
lit-furt- of lxsiiig (:irrii-d away from it. So with (lit-st- thoughts I contained niyiwll' hi hi:
without iy boat, though it had hot-Ii (In: pmliict of so many iiiuutlis' labour to make
it, and of so many mom to gi-t it into thi- mi.

In this govenuucnt of my temper, I I'I'lllilllll'fll near a year; lived a very sedate,

\y .: as well an my invention showed me; though not very handsome, yet they were such as /

.r' were very handy and convenient for laying things up in, or fetching things home. For t,
example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and \
cut it in pieces and bring it home in a. basket : and the like by a turtle; I could cut it ,
up, take out the eggs, andn piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring 4
them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, largo deep baskets were \l'}
my receivers for my corn, which I alwnyx rubbed out as soon as it was dry, and cured;
and kept it in grutt baskets, instead nt'n granary. Q

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably ; und thism awnnt which i,'
it was imlxmsiblc for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what I must do "y
when I should have no more powder; that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. '
I htttl, as I obtervetl in the third year of my being here, kept at young kid, and bred her '1'
up tame; I was in hopes of getting n lie-kid: but I could not by any means bring 3.
it to pass, till my kid grew on old goat; and as I could never find in my heart to lcill
lIL'l', idle died at last of more Age.

But being now in the eleventh ymr of my residence, untl, its 1 have said, my
ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trup nnd snare the goats, to
see whether I could not much some of them alive; and particularly, I wanted it she.
gout great with young. To this purpose. I made snares to hamper them ; end I
believe they were more than once tuken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I
had no wire. nnd always found them broken, and tny bait devoured. At length, I
reSulved to try n. pitfnll : so I dug oeveml large pits in the earth, in places where 1 had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits I placed httrdlu, of my own making
too, with a great weight upon them; and several times I put ears of barley and dry
rice, without setting the tmp ; and I could czmily perceive that the gents had gone in
' 3 and eaten up the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet At length, I not three

". traps in one night, and going the next morning. I found them all standing, and yet the

| v' bait eaten and gone: this was very discouraging. However, I nltercd my traps; and,
not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one
of them a large old he~goat; and in one of the others, three kids, a male and two
females

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was so fierce, I durst not
go into the pit to him; that is to my. to go about to bring him away alive, which
was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was not my busiuefi, nor would
it answer my end ; so I even let him out, and he mn away as if he had been frighted
out of his wits; but I had forgot then whnt I learned afterwards, that hunger will tame
a lien. If I had let him stay there three or four dnys without food, and then have
carried him some water to drink, and then a little com, he would have been as tame as
' one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, troetahle creatures, where they on
well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time : then I went
to the three kids. and. taking them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and
with some difficulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some sweet corn, it.
tempted them, and they began to be tome. And now I found that if I expected to
supply myself with goats' flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up
tame was my only way; when, perhaps. I might have them about my house like a flock
of sheep. But, then, it occurred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else

they would always run wild when they grew up; and the only way for this was to have
some inclesed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them up so
ell'eetually, that those within might not break out, or those without break in.

This was 5 great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I_ saw there was an
absolute necessity for doing it, my first piece of work was to find out a proper piece of
ground ; viz, where there was likely to be harbage for them to eat, water for them
to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Them who understand such inelosures will think I had very little contrivanee, when
I pitched upon a plnce very proper for all these, being a phiin. open piece of meadow
land, or savanna (as our people call it in the western colonies), which had two or three
little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I say, they will smile
at my Ereeust, when I shall tell them I began by inelosing of this piece of ground in such
a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about. Nor was
the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to
have time enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild
in so much compass as if they had had the whole island, uud I should have so much
room to chnse them in that I should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards, when this thought
occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the first beginning, I resolved to
int-lose a piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards
iu breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable
time, so, as my flock increased, I could add more ground to my inclosure.

This wus acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. I was
about three months hedging in the first piece ; and, till I had done it, I tethered the
three kids in the best part of it, and used them to feed as new me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very oiten I would go and carry them some can: of barley, or a
handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; so that, after my incloaure was finished,
and 1 let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a hand-
ful of com.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of about twelve
goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had three-aud-forty, besides several that I
took and killed {or my food ; and after that, I inclosed five several pieces of ground to
feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted them, and
gates out of one piece of ground into another.

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goets' flesh to feed on when I pleased,
but milk too--e thing which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as think of,
and which, when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise ; for now
I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as
Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to
make use of it, so I, that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw butter or cheese
made, very readily and handily, though after a great many essays and miscarriages, made
me both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully
can our Creator trent Ilia creatures, even in those conditions in which they seemed
to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can He sweeten the bitter-3st providencas.
and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and prisons! Whnt a table was here
spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a Stoie smile to have seen me and my little family sit down to
dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island; I had the

frequently stood still to look nt nIyseli',I could not but smile at the notion of my
travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipuge, and in much a dress. Be plensed
to take a nketeh of my figure, as follows :--

I had in grant high Almpelm cup, mudu ot goat's skin, with .1 flap hanging down
behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the min ad from nlnning into my
neck; nothing being no hurtful in these clinnites as the min upon the flesh under
the clot-hut .

I bud in short jacket of goat's skin, the xkirts coming down to about the middle of
the thighs, and a pair of own-lineal breechen of the same; the bleechu were made of
the akin ot'nn old lie-gout, whme lmir hung down xuch u length on either side, that, like
luntnloonx, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and shots I had none, but
, Innl mndc me o pair of mniediiugx, I name knew wlntt to call them, like blushilml to
llnp orcr my legs, and lace on either side like ulnittenhuhw, but of it most burbm-omt
shape, on indeed were oil the rest of my clothes.

I had on a. broad belt of goutfx skin dried, which I drew together with two thongs
of the uunc, instead of bucklul ; and in n kind ol'n frog on either side of this, insteud of
a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and u lmtchet, one on one iiide1 one on the
other. I had another belt not so bmud, nnd fastened in the some manner, which hung
orer my xhuulder ; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two winches, both made
of goat's skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my
buck I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy,
ugly, gout-skin umbrella, but which, after ull, was the most necessary thing I
had About me next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was "any not somulatto-lilze as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it. and living within
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. .\Iy board I had once sufl'ered to grow till it was
about a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both scissors and razors sull'icient, I had
cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a
large pair of .'Iahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by mmo Turks at Sallec,

But all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few to observe me, that it
was of no mannerofcoxmqueuce, so I say no more tothat part. In this kind of drefi I
went my new journey, and wau out live or six days. I travelled first along the sea-
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get up upon
the rocks; and having no heat now to take care of, I went over the land a. nurcr way
to the same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the point of the
rock which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as I said above,
I was surprised to see the sea all muooth and quiet--no rippling, no motion, no current,
any more there t in other places I was at n strange loss to understand this.
and resolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of
the tide had oeuuioned it ; but I was presently convinced how it was, viz, that the tide
of ehb setting from the West, and joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the neuwion of this current; nnd that nooonling mi the
wind blew more forcible from the wext or {mm the north, this current came new, or
Went farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabont: till evening, I went up to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb lull)"; made, I plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran farther oll', being near half a league from the shore, whereas in
my case it set close upon the shore, and hurried me in my mnoe along with it, which
at another time it would not have done.

This observation wilvincul me that I had nothing to do but to obxerve the ebbing
and the flowing of the tide, and I might very mily bring my boot About the island
again ; but when I began to think about putting it in practice, I had such terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I could not think of it
again with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was
more safe, though more laborious--and this was, that I would build, or rather make
me another paring-Ia or canoe; and so have one for one side of the inland, and one
for the other.

, You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two plantation: in the
island ; one my little fortification or tent, with the well about it, under the rock, with
the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into Ieveml apartment-e, or
ewes, one within another. One of these, which was the drimt and largest, and had a
door out beyond my wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall joined
to the rock, was all tilled up with the large cirthen pots, of which I have given an

account, and Will: fourteen or fifteen great lxishets, which would hold five or six bushels

' each, where I laid up my atom of provision, especially my corn, name in the ear, cut
ofl' short from the xtmw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall, made, ms before, with long stakes or pile; thou piles grow all like
trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so very much, that there Wu not
the least appearance, to any one's view. of any habitation behind them.

I0:CRUSOE'S COUNTRY HOUSE AND PLANTATION.

Near this dwelling of mine, but alittle farther within the land, and upon lower
ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and
which duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and whenever I had oeaaion for
more corn, I had more land adjoining, as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable plantation there
also; for first, I had my little bower, as I filled it, which I kept in repair--that is to
say, I kept the hedge, which circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual height the
ladder standing always in the inside; I kept the trees, which at first were no more
than my stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always so cut, that they might
spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did
efl'ectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a
piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I had made me 8 equal) or couch, with the skins
of the creatures I had killed. and with other soil. things, and a blanket laid on them,
such as belonged to our seal-bedding, which I had saved; ands great watch-math cover
me ; and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my
country habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my goat ; and
as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and inclose this ground, I was so
anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off
till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,
and so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce
room to put a hand through between them ; which afterwards'when those stakes grew,
as they all did in the next rainy season, made the incloenre strong like a wall, indeed
stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains to bring to
pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support; for I considered the
keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine
of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be
forty years ; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting
my inclosurcs to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which,
by this method, indeed, I so efl'ectually secured, that when these little stakes began

to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced to pull some of them ' '

up again,

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depended on for my
winter store of raisins, and which I never biled to preserve very carefully, as the but
and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and, indeed, they were not agreeable only,
but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the place where I
had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way thither, for I used
frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all things about, or belonging to her, in very
good order. Sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous
voyages would I go, scarcely ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds,
or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life.

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised
with the print of a man's naked foot on the share, which was very plain to be seen on
Ihe sand. I stood like one thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened,ROBIN ().\' CkL'SOl-Z.

 

"l I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, nor see. anything ; I went up to a riaing

I could see no other impnwion but that one. 1 went to it again to see if there were
. any more, and to observe if it alight not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that,
I for there was exactly the print of a foot--toes, heel, and every part of a fooL How it

would have defaced entirely. All tl' seemed illCflllt'lalt'lllr with the thing itself, and
with all the notions we a Ily enlert. ol' the subtlety of the devil.

' should perish at Inst for mere want.
Thus my far banished nll my religious hope; all that former confidence
S in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I hnd had of his
w ! goodness, now vanished ; as if He that had fed me by min-ole hitherto, could not
_ preserve by His power the provision which He had made for me by His goodness.
'1 I reproached myself with my lna'nex, that would not sow'nuy more com one
7 year tlmn would just serve me till the next season, as if no accident eould inter-
l'l rene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground ; and this I thought
so just n reproof, that I resolved for the future to have two or three yenrs'

I of bread.

we shun ; today we desire \vhat to-mormw we fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehen-
sions of. This was: exemplified in me at this time in the most lively manner imaginable ;
for I. whose only affliction was that I secured banished from human society, that l
wasalone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut oil' from mankind, and condemned
to what I on" silent life ; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be
numbered among the living, or to appear amongst the rest of his creatures ; that to have

and the gmatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of mlvation.
Could bmtow ; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a.
man, and was ready to rink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a
man having set his foot on the island.

Such is the uneven slate of lunuan life ; and it ufl'onlul me a great many curioux
speculations afterwards, when I had a little movcml my first surprise. I considered
that this was the station of life the infinitely wine and good providence of God had
determined for me ; that as I could not foresee what the end of Divine wisdom might
be in all this so I was not to dispute Ilia sovereignty, who, as I was Ilia creature, had
an undoubted right by emtion to goveni and diste of me absolutely as He thought
lit ; and who, as I was a creature who had ofl'cnded I'Iim, had likewise a judicial right to
condemn me to what punishment He thought lit ; and that it was my part to submit to
bear His indignation, because I had sinned agiinxt Him. I then retlected, that God, who
was not only righteous, but Omnipotent, as lie had thought [it thus to puuixh and afllict
me, so He was able to deliver me; that if He did not think fit to do it, it was my
unquestioned duty to rcaign myself-absolutely and entirelyto His will ; and, on the other
hand, it was my dutyalso to hope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend the dictates
and directions of Ilia daily providence.

Them thoughts tool: mo up many hours, days nay, I may my weeks and months ; and
one particular cfl'oct of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit,- viz, one morning
early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from the appearance
of swag", I found it discompm-ml me very much ; upon which those words of tho
geripture came into my thoughtx : " Call upon me in the day of trouble : I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify met" Upon this, rising cheerfully out of bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I mu guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God
for dclivemnce : when I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to rend,
the first words that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord : be of good courage,
and He shall strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to
cxpnas the comfort this gave me, and in return I thankfully laid down the hook,nnd waxt
no more sad, at least, not on that occasion.

In the middle of those oogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it came into my
thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this (not
might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat: this cheered
me up a little, too, and I bog-m to persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it was
nothing else but my own foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as
well as I was going that way to the boat? Again I considered also, that I could by no
means tell for certain whch had trod, and where I had not; and that if, at knit. this
was only the print of my own foot, I had played the port of those fools who try to make
stories of spectres and apparitionx, and then are themselves frighted at them more than
anybody else.

Now I begin to take courage, and to poop abroad again, for I hml not stirred out of ,

{06ANOTHER VISIT TO THE SHORE.

my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to starve for provision; for I had
little or nothing within doors but some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew thst my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my evening diversion; and the
poor creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed, it
almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.

Hearteuing myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print
of one of my own feet, and so I might be truly said toslart at my own shadow, I began to
go nbrosd ngnin, and went to my country-house to milk my flock ; but to see with What
fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now and
then, to lay down my basket, and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thorrght I was hnuntcd with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly
frightod ; and so, indeed, I had. However, as I went down thus two or three days, and
having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing
in itbut my own imagination; butI could not persuade myself fully of this till I should
go down to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see
if there was any similitude or fitnem, that I nright be assured it was my own foot. But
when I came to the place--first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not [wibly be on shore anywhere thercnbouts : secondly, when I came to
measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal.
Both these things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapours spin
to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague ; and I went home
ngnin, filled with the belief that sonre man or men had been on shore there ; or, in short,
that the island was irrhubitedmnd I might be surprised before I wns aware; and what
course to take for my security I knew not.

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when pmessed with fear! It deprives
them of the use of those mmus which reason offers for their relief. The first thing I
proposed to myself was, to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild
into the woods, tlrnt the enemy might not find them, and then frequent the island in
prospect of the some or the like booty: then the simple thing of digging up my two corn-
fields, that they might not find such a. groin there, and still be prompted to frequent the

. island; then to demolish my bower and tent, thnt they might not see any vutigee of
habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subjects of the first night's cogitntions, after I was come home again
while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and my
head was full of vapours as above Thus, fear of danger is ten thousand times more
terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of
unxiety greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about : but, which was
worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble, from the resignation I used to
pmctisc, tlurt I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Soul, who complained not
only that the I'hilistinee were upon him, but that God had forsaken him ; for I did
not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying in God in my distress, and rest--
ing upon His providence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance : which
if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise,
and perhaps carried through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept are waking all night; but in the morning I fell
ash-op; and having by the amusement of my mind been, as it were, tired, and my
spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and awnked much better composed than I had
orer been before. And new I begin to think sedately; and, upon the utmost debste
with Inya-ll', I concludul that this island (which wusso exceeding pleasant, fntitful, and Ito
farther from the tnain land than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might
imagine ; that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that
there might mmetilues conic boata oil from the shore, who, either with design, or perhaps
never but when they were driven by crow wintbt, might come to this place ; that I had
lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any
pimple yet ; and that, if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable they
went an. _'ag:lin as soon as over theycouldmeeing thcyhad never thought fit to fix here
upon any occasion to this time; that the most I could suggut any danger from was,
from any cuu- accidental landing of stntgling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, wero hrre against their wills; so they made no stay
here, but went off agtin with all possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore,
lest they should not have the helpof tho tida and daylight back again; anti that,
therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should
see - y savages land upon the spot.

n\\' I began mn'iy to repeat that I had dug my care so large as to bring a door
thmngh again, which door, as I mid, came out beyond where my fortification joined to
the reek. Upon matnn-ly consit 'ing this therefore, I mired to draw me a second
lirrtilictuion, ill the mun: manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall,just when
I had planted a double row of trees about twelve yams before, of which I made mention :
these trees having been planted so thick before, there wanted but few piles to be driven
between them. that they ahould be thicker and stronger, mul my wall would be soon
finished. So that I had now a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with
pieces of timber. old athlcx, and everything I could think of to make it strong, having
in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm outat. In the inside of this.
I thickened I ~ wall to about ll'll feet thick, continually bringing earth out of my
cave, and la. ug t at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got seven on
slime out of the allip; these, I my, I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into
fumes, that hold them like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in two
minutes' time. This wall I was litany a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought
myselfstfe till it was done.

When this wax done- I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great way every

way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osienlike wood, which I found so apt to grow. . '

as they could well stand; insomueh that I believe I might set in near twenty thotmnd
of them,hm--ing a pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have
room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they
attempted to approach my outer w: .

Thus, in two yeam' time, I had a thick grove; and in live or six ymrs' time I had a
Wood befolo my dwelling grown so monstrous thick and stmng that it was indeed
lu-rfwtly impamtblc : and no man, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there
was anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to
myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it wan by setting two ladders, one to a
p-n't of the melt "'ltit'll was low,:u|tl then broke in,and lul't room to place another ladder
upml that ; so when the two ladders were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without misehicfing himself; and if they had come down, they were still on
the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own preservation 3

and it will be seen, at length, that they were not altogether withoutjust reason ; though
I foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other afl'airs; for I had a
great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were not only a present supply
to me upon every occasion, and began to be sufiicient for me, without the expense of
powder and allot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and I
was loth to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways to preserve
them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to
drive them into it every night; and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and a: much concealed as I could, where I might keep
about half a dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the
flock in general, I might be able to mine them again with little trouble and time : and
this, though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I thought was the meet
lutional design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the meet retired parts of the island; and
I pitched upon one which was as private indeed as my heart could wish : it was a
little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow and thick wooda, where, as is
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to come back that way from the
eastern part of the ishtnd. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, no sur-
rounded with woods, that it was almost an enclosure by Nature; at least, it did not want
near so much labour to make it so, as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and, in loss than a month's
time, I had so fenced it round that my dock, or herd, call it which you please, which
were not so wild nowaa at first they might be supposed to be,were well enough secured
in it. So, without any further delay, I removed ton she-goats, and two he-goats,
to this piece ; and, when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had
made it as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me
up more time by a great dual.

All this labour I was at the expenac of, purely from my apprehensions on the

any human creature come near the island; and I had now lived two years under this
uneasinem, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as
may well be imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear
of man. And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the discompoaure ot' my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts 5 for the dread and
terror of (idling into the hands of savages and cannibal: lay so upon my spirits. that I
seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker ; atleast, net with the
sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do: I_ rather prayed toGod
as under great amiction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in
expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must
testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace. thankfulness, love, and afl'eetion, is

j much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and disoompoeure ; and that

under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit foracomforting performance
of the duty of praying to God, than he is for repentance on a nick bed; for these
discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body: and tho discompoaure of the
mind must necessarily be as great a dinbility as that of the body, and much greater ;
pmying to God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.FRAGMESTS OF A CANNIBAL FEAST.

But to go on: alter I had thus secured one part of my little living stock, I went
about the whole island, searching for another private place to make such another deposit ;
when, wandering more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet, and
looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the mute great distance. I had found
a [mislmtive glam or two in one of the seamen's ehesta, which I saved out of our ship,
but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer:
whether it was a hint or not, I do not know; but as I descended from the hill I could see
no more of it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more out without a
perspective glam in my pocket. I

When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never
been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not
such a stmugo thing in the island MI imagined; and but that it was a special providence
that l was camtupou the side of the island where the savages never uune, I should easily
have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, when
they happenul to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island
for harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having
taken any prison-mg would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all eannihala, they would kill and eat them ; of which hereafter.

\Vheu l was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the S.\V. point
of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it poaiblc for me toexprexs
the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore aprmd with skulls, hands feet, and other
bones of lunnau bodies ; and particularly, I observed a place where there had been a fire
made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage wrotehos
had sit down to their inhuman {matings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight. of these things, that I entertained no notions of
any danger to myself from it for a long while : all my apprehensions were buried in the
thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy
of human nature, which, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a view
of before ; in short, I turned away myfaec from the horrid spectacle ; my stomach grew
sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach ; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but
could not hear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the
speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island, Istood ntill awhile, as amazed,
and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with
a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first let in a part of the
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these ; and that though
I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts
in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of : and this, above all,
that I had, even in this miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of
Himself, and the hope of His blessing: which was a. felicity more than snficiently
equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or could sufl'er.

In this frame of thankfulnws, I went home to my castle, and began to be much
easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed
that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get. ; perhaps
not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything here ; and having often, no doubt.
been up in the covered, woody port of it, without finding anything to their purpose. I
I : knew I had been here now ulrnmt eighteen years, and never new the lunst footsteps of \i
human creature there before ; and I might. be eighteen years more as entirely concealed
as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion
to do ; it. being my only buaintm to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, llllIt'JSS
I fouml u better sort of ereatum than mnnibals to make inyaelf known to. Yet I
entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and
of the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I
continued pensiv nd sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost two yeah;
after this: when I my my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, vi7.., my castle.
my country-scat (which I called my bower), and my enclosure in the woods: nor did I
look after this for any other use tlmn as all cneloaure for my goats; for the nvenion
\\'llIt'Il nature gave me to thew hellish wretches was such. that I was an fearfirl of roving
theln as of seeing the devil himself, nor did I so much . a go to look after my boat in all
tbivt time, but began rather to think of making me another; for I could not think of ever
making anymore attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should
meet with mine of those emutuves at sea; in which true, if I had happened to have fallen
into their hand>>, I knew what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being discovered
by these people, begin to wear oll' my unantinest about them ; and I began to live jnmt
in the same conumed manner ax before, only with thin difl'erence, that I used more
caution, and kept my eym more about me than I did before, lost I should happen to be
seen by any of them; and lmrtieularly, I was more cautious in firing my gun, leat any
of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it ; and it was, thereforem very good
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had
no need to hunt anv more about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of
them after this, it as by train and snares, as I had done before: so that for two years
after this, I believe I never llh'tl my gun once off, though I never went out without it;
and, which was more, as I had served three pistols out of the ship, I always mrried them
out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise
furbished up one of the grant enthuses that. I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to
put it on alm; an that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myxelf, the particular of two pistols, and
a great brood-sword hanging at my aide in a belt, but withouto ambbard.

Things going on thin, as I have slid, for some time, I seemed, excepting those
millions, to be reduced to my former calm nedate Way of living. All thme things tended
to show Inc, more and more, how 1': ry condition was from being miserable, couurared
to some othera; nay, to many other particulate of life, which it might. have plowed God
to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining the": would be
among ruankind at any condition) of life, if people would rather compare their condition
with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always comparing them
with those which are better, to waist their munnuvings and complainingst

As in my present condition there were not really many things which I wanted, so,
indeed, I thought that the fright; I had been in about these savage wretches, and the
concern I had been in for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own mnvenienees; and I had drapped a good design, which I had once beat
my thoughts upon, and that was to try if I could not make some of my barley into

4' malt, and their try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsiml thought, and
'- * I reproved myself often for the aimplicity of it : for I presently saw there would be the4 mun. of sci-end things necessary to the making my beer, that it-1 - I

' would be impossible for me to supply; as. first, tasks to preserve iv. in, which
was n thing that, n: I have observed already, I could never compass ; no, though
I spent. not many (hiya, but weeks, my months, in unempling it, but to no
pmposc. In the next place, I had no hope to make it keep, no yeast to mnkc it

work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet had not all those things >>>>

intervened--I menu the {rights and terrors I was in about the savages--I
had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it m [was too ; for I seldom gave uny-
lhing over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my haul enough to
begin it. But myinvcntion now nu quite another way; for, night and day, I '
could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these mountain in theirtodestmy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be,
to set down all the eontrivnnees I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for
the destroying these emtnrev, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their
coming hither any more: but all was abortive; nothing could be possible to take
rill-ct, unlezu I was to be them to do it myself: and what could one man do among
them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them tagether with their darts,
or their bows and arrow; with which they could :=hoot as true to a mark as I could
with my gun 1

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they made their tire,
and putting in live or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire,
"'uuld consequently nuke fire, and blow up all that was near it: but as, in the first place,
I should he unwilling to waste so nmeh powder upon them, my store being now within
the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I M sure of its going off nt any certain
time, when it might surprise them ; aml, at best, that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their rant and flight them, but not sulficient to make them forsake
the place : so I laid i'. aside; aml then proposed that I would place myself in ambush
in some convenient place, with my three guns all double loaded, and in the middle of
their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps
two or three at every shot; and (hen falling in upon them with my three pistols and
my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them all. This
f: ' pleased my thoughts for some weekg and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed
u l , aml sometimes, that I wasjust going to let fly at them in my sleep. I went so
far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself several days to find out proper
plat-rs to put myself in nvnhuscade, as I mid, to watch for them, and I wont frequenlly
to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me; but while my mind was
thus filled with thoughts of Wren-gt- and ofa bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to
the sword, as I y call it, the horror I had at the place, aml at the aiguals of the
lvarlxirous rtehes devouring one another, abetted my malice. "'ell, at length I
found a pl. e in the ride of the hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I
an any of their boats coming; aml might then, even before they would be ready to
come on share, canvey my>elf unseen into some thickets of trees, in one of which
there wa~z a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and
ohscrve all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were
so close together as that it Would he next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or
that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot. In this place, then,
I resolved to fix my design _: and accordingly, I prepared two musket: and my
ordinary hurling-piece. The two markets I lonled with a brace of slugs each, and
four or live smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bulleu; and the feuding-piece I
loaded with near-a handful of swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols
with about four hullels each ; and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a.
second and third charge. I prepared myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put it in
practice. I continually made my tour every morning to the top of the hill, which was
from my castle, as I called it, about three milw, or more, to see if I could observe any
boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over towards it; hut I began
to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my
watch, hut came always back without any discovery 5 there having not, in all that."",/ I"r_~,g ' , ,p_-'

HE ABANDONS HIS DESIGN AGAINST THE SAVAGES. 'H

time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the whole ocean,
ax far no my eye: or glass could mach every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I kept up the
rigour of my design, and Iny spirits xeemod to be all the while in a suitable frame for so
outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence
which I had not at all entered into n Iliscumion of in my thoughts, any farther than
Iny pasions were at first fired by the horror Ieoneeich at the unnatural custom of the
people of that country , who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, In "is wise dis-
position of the world, to have no other guide than that of their own abominable and
\ itintod memoirs; and, consequently, were left, and peIlIaps had been so for some ages,
to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but natuIe,
entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have
run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitlm
cxeumion which I had made so long and so for every morning in vain, so my opinion of
the action itself began to alter ; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider
what I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend to he judge
and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Haven had thought fit, for'so
many ages, to suffer, unpuuished, to go on, and to be, an it were, the executioner: of
llix judgments, one upon another ; how far these people were ofl'eudenr against me, and
what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously
upon one another. I debated this very often with myself thus 1--" How do I know what
God hiInsell'jIIdgcsiu this part-icnhIrensci It is certain than people do not commit
this as a crime 3 it is not against their own consciences veproviug, or their light
rel-reaching th , they do not know it to be an oll'ence, and then commit it in
defiance of Divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no
more; crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; or to rat human
flesh, tlnm we do to cut mutton."

\Vhen I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was certainly in the
wrong in it ; that these people were not murderers, in the sense that I had before cons
demuel Ihem in my thoughts, anymore tlmn those Christians were murderers who alien
put to death the prisoueIs Iaheu in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions,
put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw
down their arms and sulnnitwd. III the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the
umge they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to
me. These people had done me no injury; that if they attempted me, or I saw it
"coccsary, for my immediate pmeervntion, to fall upon them, something might be mid for
It : but that I was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and
eonmluently no design upon me ; and, therefore, it could not bcjnst for me to fall upon
them. That thin would junil'y the conduct of the Spaniards in all their borbaritics
practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these people ; who, however
they were iduluturs and barbarians, and had eerernl bloody and barbarous rites in their
customs, Much as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, a: to the Spaniards,
\'eI; innocent people ; and that the rooting them-out of the country is spoken of with
the utmost nbhon--ence and dctestation by even the Spaniards themselves, at this time,

    

 

' and by all other Christian nations in Europe, as It mere hatchery, a bloody and unnatural

piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man ; and such as for which the very name

of n Spaniard is Ieckoucd to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity or of

Christian compassion ; as if the kingdom of Spain Were particularly eminent for the

the n i at.

' ' an considemtionx mlly put me to n mum, and ton kind ofa full stop ; and I began,
by liuh. and little, to he all' my dexign, and to conclude I had taken wrong memorial in
my resolution to attack the es; and that it was not my busincm to meddle with
them, I lest they that att. me; and thin it was my business iflmible, to prevent :
but that it' I were disco" alnml attacked by them, then I knew my duty. 0n the other

e entirely to ruin and destmyi If; for, unless I was sure to kill every one that not
. only should he on shore at that time, but that should ever rune on shore afterwards, if
but one of them escaped to tell their country--people what had h..ppened, they would
<<one over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only
bring upon myself: certain destruction, which, at present, I had no manner ofoeeaxion
for. Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one
way or other, to concern myself in this atl'aiv; that my husiues was, hy ull pastime
inn-aux, to conceal myself from them, and not to have the least Sign for them to guess
by that then: were any living era-tum upon the island--I mean of human shape.
lie ' vion joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was convinced now, many
ways that I wax perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemes for
the destruction of innocent cmttnM--I mean innocent as to me As to the crimes
they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them ; these were
national punishments to make a just retribution for national oll'ences, and to bring
public judgment upon thaw who ofl'end in a public manner, by such ways as best -

3 please God. This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater sltis-
i.0 faction tu me than that I had not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so
1' ,, much rub-on to believe would have been no hes a sin than that of wilful murder, if I
had connnittul it ; and I gave must Innnhle thank, on my knew, to God, that He had
thus deliv - -;l me fnnn hloml-guiltiness ; lie-swelling Him to giant me the protection of
"is providence, that I might not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that I might
not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear all from Heaven to do it, in
defence of my own life.

In this dixpositiou I continued for near a year after this; and so far wnaI from
desiring an oectsion for falling upon these wi that, that in all that time I never once
went up the hill to see whether there wen: any of them in sight, or to know whether
any of them had been on shore there or not, that I might not be templed to renew any
of my wntrivnnees against them, or he provokul by any advantage that might
present itself, to fall upon them: only this I did; I went and removed my boat,
which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it down to tho that end of
the whole island, where I run it into n little cove, which I found under name high
melts, and when: I knew, by reason of the curieuta, tho savages d-nat not, at least
' would not, come with their boats upon any account whatever. \Vilh my boat I carried
. away eve 'thiug that I had left there belonging toher, though not newsmry for the
have thither, via, a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an
anchor, but which indeed could not be allied either anchor or grapnel ; however, it was
the heat I could mah: of its kind: all thine I mmoved, that there might not be the
least shadow for discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any habitation upon
the island Besides this, I kept myself, as I mid, mom retired than ever, and seldom '
  
 

 

 

went from my cell, except upon my constant employment, via, to milk my ahe~gmtt.e,' \v]
and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part at" the
island, wax out of danger; for certain it is that these savage people who sometimes
haunted this island, ncver canto with any thought: of finding anything here, and .' ~ ,
eunsmptently never wandered otl' from the coast. and I doubt not but they might have i'l
been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautions, , "
:6 well as before. Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what
my condition would have been, if I had chopped upon them and been discovered
ltefom that; when, naked, and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded oitcn

 

it only with small allot, I walked or . where, pooping and peering about the island to see
1 what I could get; what a surprise should I have been in, if, when I discoterod tho

 

print of a l an's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty aavagea, and found
them panning me, and hr the swiftllevt ot' thtir running, no lmibility of my
escaping them! The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, and
dislrt-ml tny mind so much that I could not soon recm'cr it, to think what I should
lune done, and how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even
should not h: e had presence of mind enough to do what I might. have done; much
lo." what now, after so much connidcnttion and prelumtion. I might be able to do.
Indeed, after serious thinking of these things. I would be Very melancholy, and,
mine-titties it would last a g t while; but I resolved it all, at last, into thank-
l'uhteas to that" Providence which ltad delivered me from so many unseen dangem, and
had kept me from them misehiefs which I could have no way been the agent in
delivering myself from, because I had not the lent notion of any such thing depend-
ing. or the least supposition of its being lauszsible.

This renewed a contemplation which often had come into my thoughts in former
times when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers
we run through itt this life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we ltnow
nothing of it; how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), a. doubt or he tion

'3'THE CAVE IN THE WOODS.

embodied and those unembodied, and such a proof as can never be withstood ; of

which I shall have occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the remainder
of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the render of this will not think it strange if I confess that these
anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was now upon me,
put an cml to all invention, and to all the oontrivaneex that I had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon hands
than that of my food. I cared not to driven nail, or chopa stick of wood now, for
fear the noise I should make should be heard; much hm would I fire a gun for the
same reason: and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray me For this
reason, I removed that part of my business which required fire, such as burning of
pols and pipes <<kc, into my new apartment in the woods; where, after I had been
:<<nnc lime, I found to my unspeakable consolation, a more natural cave in the earth,
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the month
of it, would be so hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a mfe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by mere
accident (I would say, if I did not see almudant unison l0 ascribe all such things now
to Providence). I "'st cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;
and before I gr on I must observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which
was thaw--I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before;
and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking my mart, d'c ; so
I contrned to burn some weed here. as I had seen done in England, under turf, till
it became chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to
carry home, and perfonn the other services for which fire was wanting, without danger
of smoke. But this is by the bye: \Vllile I was cutting down some wood here, I
perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or nnderwood, there was
a kind of hollow place: I was curious to look in it; and getting with difficulty into
the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand
upright in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must confess to you that I made
more haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the place, and which was
perfectly dark, I snw two broad shining eyes of some creature--whether devil or man
I knew not--which twinkled like two stars; the dim light from the cave's mouth
shining directly in, and making the reflection. However, after some pause, I
recovered myself, and began to all myself a thousand fools, and to think that he
'1 that was afraid to see the devil, was not lit to live twenty years in an island all
alone; and that I might well think there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than mysclfi Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebnmd,
and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps
in, before I was almost as much frightened as before; for I hard in very loud sigh,
like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words
half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck
with such a surprise that it put me into aoold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head,
I will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it ofl'. But still plucking
up my spirits as well as I could, and eneouming myself a little with considering that
the power and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped
forward again, and by the light of the firehrand, holding it up a. little over my head, I
saw lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goagjnst making his will, as we
say, and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of more old age. I stirred him a little to
act: if I could get him out, and he emyed to get up, but was not able to raise himself;
and I thought with myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened me, so
he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any one of them should be so hardy
as to come in there while he had any life ill him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when I found
the care was but very small, that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in
no manner of xhnpr, neither round nor square, no hand>>: having ever been employed in
making it hut those of mere Nature I observed also that there was a place at the fur-
ther side of it that went in further, hut was so low that it required me to creep upon
my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no
mudle, I gave it over for that time, hut remlved to come again the next day provided
with candles and a tinder-box, which] had made of the lock of one of the muxketv, with
some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my own making
(for I made very good candles now of goats' tallow, but was hard not for mndle-wiek,
using sometimes rags or rape-yarn, and sometimu the dried rind of nweed like nettles);
and going into thin low place I mu obliged to creep upon all-fours, M I have said, almost
ten yards--which, luy the way, I thought was It venture bold enough, considering that I
knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. \Vhen I had got through the
strait, I fimnd the roof mac higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never was such
a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare my, in it was to look round the sides and roof
or this vault or cave ; the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two
cunllo-s. \Vhat it WM in the rock--whether diamonds, or any other precious stones or
gold--which I rather supposed it to be--I knew not. The place I was in was a most
delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, and had
a sort ofa small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creo-
ture to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides ox roof; the only (lilti-
cnlty in it was the entmnce--which, however, as it was a place of security, and such xt
.-' retreat as I wanted, I thought was a convenience--so that I wan really rejoiced at the
discovery, and rexolved, without any delay, to bring aome of them things which I was
most anxious about to this place; lnrticularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine
of powder, and all my spare arms; via, two fowliug-pieccs--fm' I had three in all----
and three muskets--for of them I had eight in all; so I kept in my caxtle only five,
which stood mady mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost defence, and were
ready . -o to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing my
ammunition, I happened to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea>>.
and which had been wet, and I found that. the Water had penetrated about three or four
inches into the powder on every side, which ouking and growing hard, had preserved
the insidelikc a kernel in the shell, no that I had near xixtyponuds of very good powder
in the centre of the cash; and this was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; no
I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me
in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind ; I also carried thither all the lead I had
left for lnIlh-tst

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were and to live in caves
and ho'ea in the rocks, where none could. come at them ; for I persuaded myself, while
I was here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out--or if they did, they would not venture to attack me here. The old goat whom I found
expiring died in the mouth of the ewe the next day after I mule this discovery; and
I found it much cussiur to dig 3 gm: hole there, and threw him in and cover him with
earth, thun to drug him out; so I interred him there, to prevent ofi'unce to my nose.

I was now in the twentyvthird year of residence in thin island, and was so
naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I but have enjoyed the
certainty that. no sin-ages would come to the pluee to disturb me, I could have been
content to have capitnluhed for spending the rest of my time there, even to "in lastw..-- c

*'UK ROBIXSON Crusoe.

 

arrived to .wme little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass more
plmsmtly with me a great deal than it did before: first, I had taught my Poll,ns I noted
before, to apt-alt ; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so urticulately and plain, that it
was very pleasmt to me, and he lived with me no less than :ixhnd-twenty years. How
long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in
the Ihazils that they live a hundred years. Perhaps some of my Pol: may be alive there
still, calling after poor Robinson Crusoe to this day : I wish no Englishman the ill-luck
to come there and hear them ; but if he did he would certainly believe it was the devil.
.\I\' dug was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my
ti ac, and then died of more old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed,
to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from
devouring me and all I had ; but, at length, when the old one: I brought with me wens
gone and after some time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no
provision with me, they all run wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which
I kept tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned ; and these were
part of my family. Besides these I always kept two or three household kids about me,
\vllomI taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which talked
pretty well, and would all call " Robin Crusoe," but none like my that; nor, indeed,
did I take the paim with any of them that I had done with him. I had also aeveml
tame sea-fonds, whose name I knew nut, that I wught upon the shore, and out their
wings; and the little stakes which I had plant/ed before my autlowall being now grown
up to a good thick glove, these fowls all livtal among these low trees, and bred there,
which way very agreable tu me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well
contented with the life I led, it' I could have been secured from the died of the savages.
'. But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be emit: for all people who shall meet
'1' with my story to make thisjust observation from it: viz, how frequently, in the course
. " of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun,nnd which, when we are fallen
into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance,
by which alone we can be raised again from the afl'liction we are fallen 'into, I could
give many examples of this ill the course of my unaccountable life, but in nothing
was it more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my hut yelns ot'
mlitary residence in this island.

It w now the month of December. as I said above, in my twenty-third year ; and
this, b g the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of
my harvest, and required me to be pretty much abmod in the fields, when, going
out pretty early in the manning, even before it Was thorough daylight, I was surprised
with seeing a light of some lire upon the shore, at a diatnnco from me ol~ about two
miles towards the end of the "and where I had observed some savages had been, an
behave, and not on the other side, but, to my gn-at atllietion, it was on my side at
the island.

I wan indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my glove, not.
daring to go out. lent I might be surprised ; and yet 1 bad no more peace within, from
the apprehensions I had that if these mvages, in rambling over the island, should find
my core standing or cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately
conclude that there were people in the place, and would then never rest till they had
found me out In this extremity I went. back directly to my castle, pulled up the
ladder after me, having made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.

'C/.SAVAGES ARE DESCRIED.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence; I loaded
all my enunon, as I called them--that is to any, my markets, which were mounted upon
my new fortification, and all my pistols, and reaolved to defend myself to the last gasp--
not forgetting aeriously to commend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to
pray to God to deliver me out of the hand! of the barbarians And in this posture
I continued about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had
no spies to send out. After sitting a while longer, and musing what [should do in this
case, I was not able to hear sitting in ignorance any longer ; so setting up my ladder t n
the side of the hill, whom there wax a flat place, as I observed before. and then pulling
the ladder after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill, and pulling
out my perspective-glans, which I had taken on purpose. I laid me down flat on my
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found there
were no lem than nine naked savagea xittiug round a small fire they had made, not to
warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely hot, but, us I
suplxvsed, to dress some of their lmrlxlroux diet of human flesh which they luul brought
with them, whether alive or dead I could not know.

They had two cuuova with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore ; and an: it
was then ehh of tide, they seemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go away
again. It in not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, especially
seeing them come on my side of the island, and so near me, too ; but when I oomidered
their coming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards lobe more
sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the
flood of tide, if they were not on shore before; and having made this observation I
went abroad about my harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made to the westward, I saw
them all take boat and row (or peddle, as we call it) away. I should have observed,
that for an hour or more before they went off they were dancing, and I could easily
discern their postures and gestures by my glans I could not perceive, by my nicest
observation, but that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them ;
but whether they were men or woman I could not distinguish.

As soon as I mw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and
two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with
all the spread I was able tn make went away to the hill where I had discovered the first
appearance of all ; and as soon as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours
(for I could not go apuce, being so loaded with anus as I was), I perceived there had
been three canoes more of savages at that place; and, looking out further, I saw
they were all at sea together, making over for the nuriu. This was a. dreadful night
to me, especially when, going down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror
which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it, via, the blood, the bones,
and part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those wretchea with
men-hueut and sport. I was no filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to
pn-uu-ditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom or how
many soorer. It seemed evident to me that the visits which they made thus to
this island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any more of
them came on shore there again--that is to say, I neither saw them nor any footsteps
or signals of them in all that time ; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not.
to come abroad, at least not so fir: yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason
of the constant apprehension: of their coming upon me by surprise--from whence I
' obii-i-vc that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the sutl'ering, especially if there
is no room to sluike otl' thnt expectation or tlime apprehensions.
During Itll thin time I Win: in the murdering humour, and spent most of my hours,
which should have been better employed, in contriving how to circumvent and fell upon
l" them the very next timoI should see them--cspecinlly if they should be divided, asthey
. l were the lust time, into two parties ; nor (lid I consider at nll tlint if I killed one party
, --suppoee ten or it dozen--I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill nnother,
ll ' nnilso another, even all ilg/iuilum, till I should he, at length, no lease murderer tlmn they
3 , were in being nunneiiters--nnd perhaps much more so. I spent my day: new in greet
r pei'plexity rind nnxiety of mind, expecting tlnit I should one day or other fnll into the
I .- hiinds of these merciless cmtnm ; and if I did at my time venture abroad, it was not
i a] without looking around me with tho greutat cure and caution irmiginuble. And now I
l I: found, to my greet comfort, how hnppy it was that I had provided It (nine flock or herd
l of genus ; for I dulst not upon any account lire my gun, especinlly nair tluit side of the
_ i island where they usually come, lest I should alarm the savages ; and if they had fled
from rue now, I was rniro to have them come again with perhnpx two or three hundred
mnoee with them in a. few days, and then I knew whet to expect. However, I wore
U out n year and three months more before I ever siw any more of the mvrigu, and then I
E found thorn agiin, an I shall soon observe. It is true they might have been there once
i or twice, but either they made no xtey, or nt least I did not hear them; but, in the
month of May, as near 8-! I could ailculute, mul in my fone--aud-twontieth your, I hrid a
g very strange encounter with them ; of which in its place.
W: The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months interrril was
i very great ; I slept unquietly, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often started out
of my sleep in the night. In the day, greet troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in
the night, I dimmed often of killing the amigos, mid of the rumour: why I might justify
the doing of it. But. to waive all this for awhile It was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think. in well its my poor wooden aleluler would reckun, for I marked
ell upon the post still 3 I say, it wns on the sixteenth of Mny tliut it blew u very grait
storm of wind nll day, with u gmt deal of lightning and thunder, nnd a. very foul night

reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present condi-
tion, I was surprised with the noise of at gun, us I thought, tired nt iii-n. This "113, to
be sure, a surpr'uo of a quite different nnture from any I had met with before ; for the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of unothor kind. I started up in the
gnu-wot lniste inmgiiuible ; end, in n tries, clapped my bidder to the middle plueo of tlio

considered tlint this must be some ship in digtmex, rind that they luul some commie,
or some other rdiip in company, and fired these for signals of dintrcss end to obtnin
help. I lied the pretence of mind, at thrit minute, to think, that though I could not
1 help them, it might be they might help me ; so I brought together rill the dry wood I
J could get at hand, rind, making a good handwme pile, I set it on lire upon the hill.
. The wood was dry, and binned freely; and though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burned flairly out, so that I was certain, if there WM any such thing use ship, they must

my tirc, tilled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined that upon seeing my light,

but that the sea running very high, they might have been cast away. Other timexg I
imagined that they might have lost their boat before, as migbt'bo the ease many wuyx;

i'j to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their

this good rll'ect upon my aide, that it gave Illl' u re and more cause to give thanks to

'\ROBINSON RESQLVES TO VISIT THE WRECK.

I might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me and to
have converged with !" In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so
strong a desire alter the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want
of it.

There are some secret moving springs in the afi'ectionu, which, when they are set
a--going by some object in View, or, though not in view, yet rendered present to the
mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul, by its impetuoaity,'
to such violent, eager embracinga of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were those earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe I
repeated the words, " Oh, that it had been but one !" a thousand times ; and my desires
wereso moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and
my fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I had had any soft thing in
my hand, I would have crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in my head would
strike together, and set agiinst one another so strong. that for some time I could not
part them again. Let the Imturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner
of them. All I an say of them is, to describe the fact, which was even surprising to me,
when I found it, though I knew not from what it should proceed ; it wagdoubtlem, the
ell'ect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realising the comfort which
the oonvemtion of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to me. But it was not
to be; either their fate, or mine, or both, forbade it, for till the last year of my being on
this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no ; and had
only the nlliiction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at
the end of the island which was next the shipwreck He had no clothes on but a
wunuu's wnistcont, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but
nuthing to direct me so much as to gum what nation he was all He had nothing in
his pockets but two pieeu of eight and a tobacco-pipe--the last was to me of ten times
more Value than the first.

It was now calm. and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this wreck.
not doubting but I might find something on board that might be useful to me. But,
that did not altogether pres me so much as the peaiibility that there might be yet some
living creature on board, whose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that
life, comfort my own to the last degree ; and this thought clung so to my heart that I
would not boqnict night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on board this
wreck; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought the impreuion was so
strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from some
invisible direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go.

,, Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, prepared every-

thing for my voyage, tool: a qunntity of bread, a great pot for fresh water, I compare to
steer by, a bottle of mm (for I had still a great deal of that left), and a basket of
raisins; and thus loading myself with everything necessary, I went down to my boat,
got the water out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my mrgo in her, and then went home
again for more. My second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the umbrella to set up over
my hard for a shade, another large pot full of fresh water, and about two doaenof small
leaves, or barley makes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's-milk, and, a cheese : all
which with great labour and sweat I brought to my boat; and praying to God to direct
my voyage, I put out, and rowing or peddling the canoe along the' shore, came at last to
the utmost point of the island on the north-east side. And now I was to lama]: out
into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currentl

which ran <<instantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very

brgan to fail me; for l foresaw that if I was driven into either of those current.' I
xhonld he carried a great way out to um, and perhaps out of my reach, or right of the
island again ; and that tlum, :u my boat wax but small, ifany little gale of wind should
rise, I should be inevitably lost

These thoughts so oppwm-d my miml, that l began to give over my enterprise; and
having hauled my boat into a little crerk on the shore, I stepped out, and sat down rrpon

~x'ing bit of ground, \'ery pensive :uul anxious between fear alrd desire, about my
voyage; when as I "a" musing. I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood
came on: upon which, my going wast impracticable for so many hours. Upon this
presently it occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could
lind, and observe, if I muld, how the u-Le of the tide, or currents lay, when the flood
came in, that I might judge whether. if I wzu driven one way out, I might not expect
to be drirru mmtlu-l' way home, with the some rapidity of the currents. This thought
wax no sooner in my head than I east my eye upon a little hill, which sutliciently over-
looked the sea both \ ~s and from \vhence I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of
the tide. and which \ .|_\' I was to guide rnyselfin my return. Here I found th: s the
current or t-bb set out close by the math point of the island, so the current of the
flood set in close by the above of the north side ; and that I had nothing to do but to
keep to the north olitlu- island in my return. and I thlld do well enough.

Euconmgcd with this olmcr'atiou. I resolved, the next morning, to set out with
the first of the tide ; and rope-flog myseif for the night in my canoe, under the great
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first made a little out to uea, full north,
till I began to feel Ilu- lx-noti ot' tlu- current. which set outward, and whielr carried me
at a great r ul yet did not w hnr L" the current on the south side had done
before, so . s to . e from me all government of the boat; but barring a strong steenlge
with my paddle, I went, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in lost than two
hours 1 anne- rrp to it. It \\. rt a l t . l eight to lool>>: at : the ship, which, byits building,
was Spanish, atuck ' iannncd in between two reeks : all the stem and qnafler of her
were beaten to llit'tts by the sea ; and as her firreeaatle, which atuck in the rocks, had
run on with great violence, her maimna rul foremost were brought by the board, that
is to say. broken short oll'; but hr- ' hrwxprit was sonrul,and the head and bow aplwared
firm. When i more close to Ilt'l',1|tltlg appeared upon her, who, seeing me wining,
yelped aml cried ; and, as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to me: I
took him into the boat, brrt found him almmt dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him
a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a
fortnight in the snow ; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if I
would have let him, he would have llltlfit himself. After this I went on board ; but the
lirxt. sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecostlc of the uhip,
with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when
the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so continually over her,
that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in
of the water, as much as if they had been under water. Buide: the dog, there was
nothing left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I could see, but what were
spoiled by the water. There were some cask: of liquor, whether wine or brandy, I
knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could
*' see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chats, which I believe ,

within night, I reached the island sgnin, wary end fetigued to the lost degree. I
reposed that night in the boot; end in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had
got in my new cove, end not enrry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got
nll my cargo on shore, Ind began to examine the [nrticnlsrs The ask of liquor I found
to be in kind of rum, but not such as we had st the Brnzils ; and, in l word, not at all
good ; hot when I came to open the chests, I found sorernl things of great use to me:
for exnmple, I found in one u tine ease of bottles, of no extraordinsry kind, and filled
with conlinl waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and
were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good suecndes, or sweotmcnts, so
fastened else on the top thnt the salt water bsd not hurt them ; Ind two more of the
same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were rery
welcome in me; und shout I dozen end 5 hslf of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured
neckcloths ; the former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe
my face in n hot dny. Besides this, when I come to the till in the chest, I found them
three great hogs of pieces of eight, which hold about eleven hundred pieoen in all ; end
in one of them, wrapped up in s paper, six deulvloous of gold, end some small lure or
wedge: of gold ; I summ they might all weigh near s pound. In the other chest were
some clothes, but of little value ; but, by the circumstances, it must lnve belonged to the
guuncr's mute; though then:- wns no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glnud
powder, in three small flush, kept, I SIIPPNB' for charging their fowling-piooes on

for as to the money, I had no manner of oeoosion for it; it was to me u the dirt under
my feet, and I would have given it All for three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly Wanted, but had none on my foot for runny yawn

mo whom I new in the mock, and I finind two pair mom in one of the chair, which
were very wn-lmme to me j. but they were not like our English sheen, either for ease or
service, being mthcr what we call pumps than shoal. I found in the woman's chest
about fifty pieces of eight, in riuls, but no geld : I suppose this belonged to s poorer
mun than the other, which seemed to belong to some ofioer. Well, however, I lllggcd
this money home to my are, nnd laid it up, as I hsd done that before which I had
brought from our own ship ; but it wss a great pity, as I said, that the other part of
this ship hsd not eomo to my share ; for I nm sstisfied I might hove loaded my mos
several times over with money; which, if I had ever one-pod to England. would luvs
lain hero safe enough till I might have come ngoin and fetched it.

Having now br.mght all my things on shore, and secured them, I went back to my
host, and rowed er paddhzd her along the show to her old harbour, where I luid her
up, and made the host of my way to my old habitation, when I found everything Info

IT)
and quiet. I began new to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take our of
my family atl'aim ; and for awhile I lived easy enough, only that I was mom vigilant
than I used to be, looked out ofteaer, and did not go abroad so much; and if, at any
time, I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the out part of the island, whern I
was pretty well satisfied the mvages never came, and whore I could go without so
many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with
me if I went the other way. I lived in this condition near two years more ; but my
unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable,
wasall these two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were pomible, I might
get away from this island; for sometimes I was {or making another voyage to the
wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothing lelt there worth the lam-ml
of my voyage ; somatimu for a ramble one way, sometime: another; and I believe
verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Salloo in, I should have ventured to sea
bound anywhere, I know not whither. I have been, in all my circumstances, amenuulo
to those who are touched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for naught I
know, one-half of their miseries flow; I mean that of not being satisfied with the
station wherein God and Nature hath placed them ; for, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opwsition to which
was, as I may call it, my oriyinal u'u, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had
been the means of my coming into this miserable condition ; {or had that Providence,
which so happily scatal me at tho Brazil: as a planter, blesmd me with confined
dull'cs, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have
been by this time, I mean in the time of my being in this island, one ol' the most
considerable planters in the Brazils ; any, I am persuaded, that by the improvements
I had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably hare
made if I had remained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand Inoidoros: and
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a. well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn supermrgo to Guinea to fetch negrees, when patience and time
would have so increased our stock at home, that we could have bought them at our
own door from them whose husineu it was to fetch them i and though it had cost us

_ something more, yet the dill'erenee of that price was by no means worth saving at so

gmt a hazard. But as this is ordinarily tho fate of young heads, so reflection upon the
lolly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or- of the dear-bought experience
of time: so it was with me now; and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my
temper that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring
upon the means and pomibility of my escape from this place: and that I may, with tho
greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be
improlwr to give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish
scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation I acted.

I am new to be supposed retimd into my castle, after my late voyage to the wreck,
my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my condition mtored to
what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but wus not at all
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had before tho
Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the formand~twentieth year
of my first setting foot in this island of solitude. I was lying in my bed or hammock,

uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyeo,'thst is,711/]

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

so as toslcep; no, not awinlt all night long, otherwise than as follows :--It is impouiblo
and nwdlm to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that
groin thoroughfare ol' the brain--the memory, in this night's time: I ma over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I my call it, to my coming
to this island, and also of that part of my life since I came to this inland In my
reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation here, with
the life or anxiety, fear, and cam, which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print
of a foot in the sand ; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island
even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times onshore
there; but I had never known it, and was inmpsblo of any apprehensions about it;
my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the some, and I was as happy in
not knowing my danger as if I had never really been exposed to it. This furnished
my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, mud particularly this one: How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its government of mankind,
such narmw bounds to his sight and knowledge of things ; and though he walks in the
midst of so many thounnnl dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would
distmet his mind and sink his Spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him,

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect seriously
upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this very island, and how l
had walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible tranquillity, even when
pcrhnls nothing but the brow ot' a hill, a great tree, or the easmd approach of night,
Imd been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I
would on a goat or a turtle; and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me
than i did of n pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I
was not ainccrely thankful to my great Presenter, to whose singular protection I
acknowledged, with great humility, all these unknown deliverance: were due, and
without which I must inevitably have fallen into their mere-ills: hands.

"'hen these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in considering
the nature of these wretched creatures, I man the savages, and how it came to pass in
the world, that the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his creatures to
such inhumanity, nay. to something so much below even brutality itself, as to devour
its own kind: but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless npecnlntions, it occurred
to me to inquire, what part of the world these wretches lived in l how far off the coast
wax from whence they came? what they ventured over so far from home for? what
kind of boats they had i and why I might not order myself and my business so, that
I might be as able to go over thither, as they were to come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with myself when
I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the hands of these savages; or
how I should escape them if they attacked me ; no, nor so much as how it was posdble
for me to reach the coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, without
any possibility of delivering myself: and if I should not tall into their hands, what
I should do for provision, or whither Ishould bond my course : none of these thoughts
I say, so much as came in my way ; but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of
my passing over in my boat to the main land. I looked upon my present condition as
the most miserable that could possibly be ; that I was not able to throw myself intonnything but deeth, that could be celled worse ; and if I resched the shore of tho mniu,
I might per-Imps meet with relief, or I might coast elong, es I did on the African shore,
till I come to some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief; end, sfter
all, perhaps I might tell in with some Christian ship that might take me in; end ifthe
worst come to the worst, I could but die, which would put on end to ell these miseries
at once Pray note, all this was the fruit of o disturbed mind, on impatient temper,
mode, as it were, despente by the long continuance of my troubles end the disappoint-
ments I hsd met with in the wreck I hnd been on board 41', sud when I hnd been so
near the obtaining what I so enmestly longed for, namely, somebody to spesk to, end
to learn some knowledge of the place where I was, and of the probable moons of my
deliverance. I say I was sgitsted wholly by those thoughts ; ell my aim of mind, in
my resignmtion to Providence, end waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed
to be suspended ; end I had, us it were, no power to turn my thoughts to anything but
the project of n voyage to the min, which came upon me with such force, and such on
impetuosity of desire, that it wee not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two'hoore or more, with such violence
that it set my very blood into e ferment, end my pulse best In if I had been in n fever,
merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind ebout it, Nature, In! if I had been
futigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of it, threw me into nsound sleep. One
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything
relating to it: but I dreamed that us I was going out in the morning as usual, [mm
my cistle, I saw upon tho shore two csnoee and eleven eevsges, coming to lend, and
that they brought with them snother ravage, whom they were going to kill, in order to
out him; when, on n sudden, the savage thnt they were going to kill jumped nwsy, and
run for his life; then I thought, in my sleep, thst he come running into my little thick
grove before my fortification, to hide himself; end thst I, seeing him clone, end not
perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and smiling
upon him, eneoursged him : that ho hnoeled down to me, seeming to prey me to insist
him; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up it, and curried him into my
one, sud he beanie my servsnt ; end that as soon as I had got this man, I said to
myself, "Now I may certainly venture to the main land, for this fellow will serve me.
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and whither
not to go for fear of being devoured ; whnt places to venture into, and what to eecepe."
I waited with this thought; and was under such inoxpnudble imprtm'ons of joy st the
prospect of my escape in my dream, that the dimppointmenta which I felt upon coming .
to myself, and finding that it was no more then I dresm, were equally extrnvsgent the
other way, nnd threw me into a good dejeotion of spirits

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion ; that my only wey to go about on ettempt
.for an escape wss, if possible, to get s sevnge into my Mon ; and, if possible,
it should be one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be esten. Ind should
bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were sttended with this dificulty, that it
was impossible to ed'eet this without stacking a whole cersven of them, end killing
them all; and this woe not only a very desperm ettempt, end might miscerry, but,

' on the other hsnd, I hsd greatly serupled the lswfulnsuof it to me ; and my heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it wss for my deliver-once.
I need not repeat the erguments which occurred tome sgnim this, they being the some
mentioned before; but though I had other lessons to offer now--viz, that those men
were enemies to my life, end would devour me if they could; that it wee self-ANOTHER ARRIVAL OF CANNIBALS.

preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was
acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like;
I say, though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for
my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile
myself to for a great while. However, at last, afler many secret disputm with myself,
and after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and another,
struggled in my head a long time), the eager prevailing duire of deliverance at length
mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my
hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this
indeed wns very difficult to rawlve on; but as I could pitch upon no probable means
for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on
shore, and leave the rest to the event ; taking such mamlrcs as the opportunity should
present, let be what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts I set myself upon the scout as often as
possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it ; for it was above a year and
a half that I waited; and for great port of that time went out to the west end, and to
the south-west corner of the island almost every day, to look for canoes, but none
appeared. This mu very disconruging, and began to trouble me much, though I
cannot soy that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear otl' the edge
of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more tiger I
was for it: in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these surges,
:uul avoid lniug seen by them, as I was now eager tobe upbn them. Besides, I fancied
myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them
entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being
nble at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I pleased myself with
this nfl'nir; but nothing still presented; all my fancies and schemes come to nothing.
for no sou-ages came near me for a great while. ,

About a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long musing had,
as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occasion to put them in execu-
tion), I was surprised one morning early by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore
together on my side the island, and the people who belonged to them all landed and
out of my sight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and
knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not
tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty men
single-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted However, I put
myself into all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was

' f , just ready for action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, listening

to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at the
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two saga, as usual ;
standing so, however, that my head did not appear above the bill, so that they could
not perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass,
that they were no less than thirty in number ; that they lied a fire kindled, and that
they had meat drcued. How they hnd cooked it, I knew not, or what it was; bnt they
were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own
way, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two miserable

wretehu dngged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now '

brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fall; being _''v '1' , .7".- w "

 

 

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

knocked down, I suppose, with a club, or wooden sword, for that was their way; and
two or three others were at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while
the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him. In
that very moment, this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, and unbound,
Nature inspired him with hopes of life and he started awsy from them, and ran with
incredible swiftnees along the sands, directly towards me ; I mean, towards that part of
the coast where my habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, that I mrrstecknowledgc,
when I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him
pursued by the whole body ; and new I expected that part of my dream was coming to
pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove : but I could not depend, by
any means, upon my dream, that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and
find him there However, I kept my station, and my spirits begun to recover when I
found that there was not above three men that followed him; and still more was I
encouraged, when I found that ho outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained
ground on them; so that, if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he
would firirly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which I mentioned omen in the
first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw
plainly he must necmrily swim over, or the poor wrcteh would be taken there 5 but
when the aavage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then
"1'; bl". plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereahouts landed, and
ran with exceeding strength and xwiftness, \Vhen the three persons came to the creek,
I found that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the
other side, he looked at the others, but went no further, and soon after went sottlyhuck
again; which, as it happened, was very well for him in the end. I ohserved that the
two who swam were yet more than twice as long swimming over the creek then the
fellow was that fled from them. It came very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a. servant, and perhaps companion or
assistant ; and that I was plainly called by Providence to nave this poor crmture'a life.
I immediately ran down the ladder with sll possible expedition, fetched my two guns,

I for they were both at the foot of the ladder. as I observed before, and getting up again

with the more haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sen ; and having a
very short cut, and all down hill, clap'd myself in the way between the pursuers and
the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was ot first perhaps as
much frightened at mean at them ; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back ;
""6. ill the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then rushing
at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I was
loth to fire, because I would not have the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would
not have been easily heard, and being out. of sight of the smoke, too, they would not
have known what to make of it, Having lmocked this fellow down, the other who
pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced tomrds him : but
as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a. how and arrow, and was fitting it to
shoot at me: so I was then obliged to rhoot at him first, which I did, and killed him
at the first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his
enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise
of my piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went backward,
though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than toeome on. I hellooed sgliu to him,
and made signs to come forward. which he easily understood, and fine s little way;

cut off his head as cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner
or hotter; which I though: very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never
new 1: award in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however, it seems, as I
learned aflerwurdrg they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood in
so hard, that they will even cut ofl' heads with them, ny, and anus, nnd thatat one
blow too When he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword 39-min, and with abundnnee of gesture; which I did not understand,
laid it down, vs ith the head of the savage that he had killed just before me. But that
which astonished him most, was to know how I killed the other Indian so far ofl'; to
pointing to him. he made signs to me to let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well
in; I could. When he come to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him. turning
him first on one side, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had mule,
which it seems was just in his breast, where it had made a hole. nnd no great quantity
of blood had followed ; but he had bled inwnrdly, for he was quite dead. He tool: up
his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I turned to go away. and beckoned him to
follow me, making signs to him that more might come alter them

Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might
not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him again to do so.
He fell to work ;-and in an instant he had scrapedahole in the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the first in. and then dragged him into it, and covered him ; and did an by
the otheralso; I believe he hsd buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling
him away, I carried him, not to my Castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther port
of the island; so I did not let my dream come to peas in that part, that he came into
my grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for from his running;
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down tosleep, showing
him a place where I had laid some rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to
sleep upon myself sometimes ; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight, strong limbs,
not too large, tall and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age.
He had a very good countenance, not It fierce nnd surly "met, but seemed to have
something very manly in his face; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of o
European in his countenance, too, upeeinlly when he smiled His hair was long and
block, not curled like wool ; his forehead very high and large ; and a great vivacity and
sparkling ahnrpnmx in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite black, but very
tnwuy 5 and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and
other natives of America are, but of a bright kind of n dun olivmlour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though Anot very easy to describe. His face was round and
plump ; his nose small, not list like the Negroes; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his
line teeth well set, and mi while as ivory. ,

Alter he had elumbcred, rather then slept, about hulf-nmhour, he awoke again, and
came out of the cave to me ; for I had been milking my goats, which I had in the
inclusure just by : when he <<pied me, he came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the ground, with all the lmible signs of an humble, thankful disposition,

' making a great many antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his head tint upon the
8'0"". close to my foot. and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done before;
and alter this, made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude. and Inbmimion
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood

him in nanny things, nnd let him know I was very well planned with him. In a. little
time I began to 11ml: to him, and teach him to spenk to me; null. first, I let him know
his name should be men', which run the day I saved his life : I <<died him Io for the
memory of the time. I likewioo taught him to my Minter, and then let him know that
was tn be my home ; I likewise taught him to my You And No, and to know the meaning
of them. I gave him some milk in nu earthen pot, lll'lll let him rec mo drink it before
him, and mp my bread in it; llltl give him a coke of bread to do the like, which he
quickly complied with, and made sign>> that it was very good for him. I kept them
with him all that night; but, my noon M it won day, I beckoned to him to come with
me, xuul let him know I would give him mine clothes ; at which he seemed very glad, for
he was stark nuked. As we went by the place where he had buried the two men,
he pointed exactly to the place, nnd xhnwed me the marks that ho had made to find
them again, nmking signs to me thnt we should dig them up nguin and cut them. At
this I nplwaml very angry, exprescd my nbhorrence of it, mndc mi if I would vomit nt
the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did
immediately, with great submix-iinn. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to Boo if
his encmiu \\'t'l'0 gone, and pulling out my glass, I looked, and row plainly the place
where they hull been, but no aplnrimncc of them or their mums ; so that it was plnin
they were gone, nnd had left their two comrades behind them, without any search
utter them.

But I was not content with thin discoi' v; but having new more courage, and
consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him the sword in
lllt' hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very
dexteronaly, making him awry one gun for me. and I two for mynelf; and away we
marched to the place where these creatures hnd ln'cn--firr I had a mind now to get
some fuller intelligence of them. \Vllen I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in
my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was n
dmdfnl sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday mode nothing of it. The place
was covered with human Imnes, the ground dyed with the blood, and great pieces of
flesh lcl't here nnd there, lmlf-citcn, mnngled, nnd scorched ; and, in 3110", ull the token)!
of the trimn ant {mat they ha~l been making them, idler a victory over their enemies.

, I saw three skulls, five handy, and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and
nbundnnce of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me under:
stand that they lnought over four primnen; to {inst upon ; that thm: of them were
eaten up, and that ho. pointing to himaelf, was the fourth ; thnt there had been a greut
lmtllu between them nnd their next king, of whose nuhjectr, it aim-Inn, he Inul been
one, and thut they had taken u great number of prisoners; all which were curried
to nut-rend places, by those who lmd taken them in the light, in order to feast
upon them, as wax done here by these wretehea upon those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the sludk, bones, flesh, and whatever remained, and
lay them together on a limp, and muke a great fire upon it, and burn them till to ashes.
I found Friday had still a. hankering stomach otter some of the flesh, nnd was still 3
cannibal in his nature ; hut I dimn'ered so much abhorrenoc at the \ery thoughts ofit,
and at the least nlnlmmiice of it, tlmtho (hunt notdincover it--for I had, by somemeone,
let him know that I would kill him ifhe offend it.

When he bud done this, we came back to our cutie, and there I fell to work for my
man Friday ; and lint of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the
poor gunner": cheet I mentioned, which I found in the wreck, and which, with a littlemy skill would allow (for I was now gmwu a luluraldy good tailor) ; and I gave him a
cap which I made of here's akin, very eunveniont, and I'm-hionnble enough ; and thus he
was clothed, for the pursuit, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see himself
almost in well clothed 13 his mask-r. It in true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at
first; weaving the drawers mu very awkward to him, mnl the xlceves of the wnixtcmt
gulled hia almuldcn and the inside of hix arms--hut a little easing them when
complained they hurt him, and uxiog hinnu-If to them, at length he took to them \
well.

The next day, altar I mum home to my hutch with him, I began to consider
when: I should lodge him; and, th. 2. I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy
myself, I made a little tent for him in the v: mt plat-e bztweeu my two l'ortiliullioux,
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first. Au them was a door
or cntnmco them into my cave, I made u formal t'mnnal doorman, and a door to it
of boards and sot it up in the "mange. a little with I the cntnulce ; uud, taming the
door to open in the inside, I bum-d it up in the night, ta 3 in my laddeng too; so
that Friday could no way come at me in the inxide of n ' in amt wull, without
making so much noise in getting over that it must neodx : wake" mu; for mv linit wall

xbnt it. up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, TM we did not know
by what light and law these should be condemned; but thnt as God m ncemrily,
and, by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if these
ureatnrm were all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on account of sinning
against that light, which, us the Scripture says, was u law to themselves, end by such
rules (is their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not
rliocni't'md to us; and, mmdly, 'l'hnt still, no we are all the eluy in the hand of the
Putter, no vcxm-l could my to Him, "\Vhy hunt thou formed me thusi"

But to rctuni to my new companion : I was greatly delighted with him, Ind mule
it my Imminent to teach him everything that was proper to make him useful, handy, and
helpful; but mpufinlly to mnko him speak, and understand me when I spoke; Ind he
was tho nptcxt eel-"luv that ever WI"; and particularly was so merry, no constantly
diligent, nnd no plmiscd when ho could but understand me, or nmke me understand
him, that it wns very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life began to be so
easy tlmt I begun to my to myself, that could I but have been safe from more savage>>; I
cured not if I we: never to remove from the pluco while I lived.'

After I had been two or three days returned to my 'mstlc, I thought thnt, in order
to bring Fridny oll' fmm hix horrid way of feeding, mul from the relish of :I cunnibal's
stomach, I ought. to let him L'ute other fluih; so I took him out with me one morning
to the woods I went, iudwl, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, flllll living it
home and draw it; but no I was going, I sewn she-gout lying down in the shade, nnd
two young kids sitting by her. I cliched hold of Friday; "Hold," said I, "stand
ntill ;" and made xigun in him not to stir: imm :dintcly I prawnwd my piece, shot, and
killed one of the kids. The poor cmture, who had. ut a d'utance. indeed, seen me kill
the mvnge, his enemy, but did not know nor could imagine how it was done, was
sensihly surprised ; trembled, mul shook, nnd looked no annual thut I thought he would
have sunk duwn. Ho di-l'uot see the kid I uhutut, or perceive I hu-l killed it, but
ripped up hint wnistcout, to feel whether he was not wounded ; and, mi I found pmeutl y,
thought I we: nwdved tukill him : for he come and knee-led down to Inc, and embracing
my knees, said u grout. many things I did not understand ; but I could e-uaily see the
meaning was to pray me not to kill him. i

I soon found n way to convince him that I would do him no harm ; and taking him
up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned
in him to run and fetch it, which he did : nnd whilo he was wondering, Ind looking to
me how the cruiture \rnu killed, I loaded my gun ngnin. Hy-und-by I mw n. gmlt
fuwl, like n hawk, sitting upon u tree \vithin shot; so, to let Fridny undcmtund a little
what I would do, I culled him ta) Iue uguiu, pointed at the fowl, which Wu: indeed o
parrot, tin-ugh I thought. it had been n hawk ; I my, pointing to the lurrot, nnd to my
gun, and lo the ground under the lurrot, to let him rice I would make it full, I made
him undemland lhut I would shoot and kill that bird; nccordi "ly, [ tired, and bade
him look, and iuiulciliutcly he saw the parrot full. He stood like one frightened again.
imtwiihsmnding all I lnul mid tu him ; nud I found he was the more emu-41, became
he did not see me put an) thing into the gun, but thought. that there must be some
wonderful fund of death and destruction in tlltt thing, able to kill nun, beast, bird,
or anything near or far 011'; and the astonishment this created in him was such as could
not wan- off for u long time ; and, I believe, if I would have let him, he wouldFRIDAY BECOMES USEFUL
touch it for several days after; but he would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had
answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to
desire it not to kill him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this,
I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed mme
time; for the parrot, not heiug.qnite dmd, had fluttered away a good distance from the
place where she fell : however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and
m I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge
the gun again, and tolet him see mode it, that I might be rendy furnny elhermnrl: that
might present ; but nothing more offered at that time : so I brought borne the kid, and
the mine evening I took the skin ofl',nnd cut it ontas well an I could ; and having a pot
lit for thntpurpoee, I boiled or stewed some of the duh, nnd made more very good
broth. After I had begun to ent some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad
<<fit, and liked it very well; but that which was atmngest to him was to see me eat
salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt wna not good to eat ; nnrl putting a
little into his own month, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,
washing his mouth with fresh water alter it: on the other hand, I took some meat
into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as
first as he had done at the mlt; but it would not do; he would never core for salt
with his meat, or in his broth ; at lent, not for a great while, and then but avery little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast him the
m-xtdny with roasting a piece of the kid : this I did by hanging it before the fire on a
string, as I had seen runny people do in England, setting two pols up, one on each
side of the lire,and one acres on the top, and tying the string to the em stick, letting
the meat tum continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came to
taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not
but understand him : and at last he told rue, as well as he could, he would never eat
man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and silting it in the
manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and he soon understood how to do it unwell
as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make
bread of; for after that, I let him see me make my bread, and bake it, too; and
in n little time, Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it
royal-If.

I began new to musider, that h: g two months to feed instead of one, I must
p virh- more gn-uu-l for my harvest, plnut nlnrger quantity of com than I used to
do; so I Iunrkul out a larger piece of land, nnd began the fence in the some manner all
before, in which Friday worked not only very willingly and very hard, but did it very
.. cheerfully 2 and I told him what it was for; that it wnl for corn lo make more bread,

' because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too.
He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I had much
more. labour upon me on his aeconnt, than I had for myself ; and that he would work
the harder for me, if I would tell him What to do.

This was the plenmntest year oFall the life I led in this place. Friday began to
talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost everything I had ocutsion to cell
for, and of every plaza I had to send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short
I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which-indeed, I had very little
occasion for before; that is to say about speed). Besides the pleasure of talking to him,
I had asiugularsatisfiction in the fellow himself : his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared

- 143to me more and more every dny, and I began really to love the creature; and on his side
I believe he loved me more than it was posible for him ever to love anything before.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

      

 

ii. , I inquired if he eeuld tell me how I might come from this islsnd, and get among I
~'- these white men: he told me, "Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe." I could not ' ,,
understand what he meant by two ennoe, till at last, with great difliculty, I found he , '
meant it must be in a large, great boat, ss big as two woes. This part of Friday's '
discourse began to relish with me very well; and from this time I entertained some - i
hopes that, one time or other. I might find an opportunity to make my escape from i)
this place, and that this poor savage might be a mans to help me to do it. A
During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he began to '2' ,
_ spook to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to loy a foundation of religious \
,2>> knowledge in his mind ; particularly I asked him one time who made him. The poor
i ' creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked him who was his father:
i but I took it by another handle, and naked him who made the am. the ground we
| walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, "It was one Ben-iniickee, that lived
Ii beyond all;" he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old,
"much older," he said, "than the sea or the hind, than the moon or the stars." I Asked

 

i him then, if this old person had made all things why did not all things worship him?
. He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look of innocence, said, "All things said O!
.i i to him." I asked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere. He
' ' mid, "Yes; they all went to Benninuckee." Then I asked him whether those they eat

"y up went thither too. He slid, " Ya."

.' From those things I began to iustruet him in the knowledge of the true God : I
'1, told him that the great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up towards hmven 3
' that he govcmed the world by tho some power and providence by which he made it;

1 that he mu omnipotent, and could do everything for us, give everything to us, take

' cVerything from us; and thus. by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great

' attention, and received with pleasure the notion of J aux Christ being sent to redeem

9 us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and his being able to hear us,
. > even into heaven. He told me one dny, that if our God could hear us, up beyond the
- 5;. sun. he must needs be a greater God than their Bonsmueltoe, who lived but a little wsy

' oil', and yet could not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to
spook to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to spmk to him He said, " No;
they never went that were young men ; none went thither but the old men," whom he
called their Oowekskee ; that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or
clergy; and that they wont to any 0! (so he enlled saying prayers) and then eome back
and told them what Bennmuekee said. By this I charred, that there is priestcrsft
even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of making
n secret of religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not
only to be found in the Roman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even
among the most brutisb and barbarous savages.

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and told him thnt the pro,
tencc of their old men going up to the mountains to any 0! to their gnd Benninuckce
was a cheat ; and their bringing word from thence what he mid was much more so ; that
if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one there, it must bowith an evil spirit;
and then I entered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his
rebellion against God, his oninity to man, the meson of it, his setting himself up in the
dark ports of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God. and the many
stratageins he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret seeess
to our passions and to our affections, and to adopt his mom to our inelinstions, so as '

to curse us even to be our own tempura, and run upon our own destruction by our
own choice.

I found it was not so easy to Imprint right notions in his mind about the devil as it
was about the being of a God : nature assisted-ll my argumenm to evidence to him even
the necedty of a great I-'imCsuse--en overruling, governing Power--e secret directing
Providence ; and of the equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and
the like: but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit; of his
original, his being, his nature; and, above all, of his inclination todo evil, and to draw
usin to do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner. by s
question merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion
to sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity ; how, as Hehad made us
all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he listened with great
seriousness to me all the while. After this, I had been telling him how the devil was
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good
designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like.
" Well," says Friday; " but you say God is so strong, so great ; is he not much strung.
much might as the devil!" "Yes, yes," says I, "Il'ridny ; God is stronger than the
devil : God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under
our feet, and to enable us foresist his temptations and quench his fiery darts." " But,"
says he again, "if God much strong, much might as the devil, why God no kill the
devil, so make him no more do wicked i" I was strangely surprised at this question ;
end after all. though I was nowan old man, yet I was but ayoung doctor, and ill quali-
fied for a easuist, or a solver of dificultios; and at first I could not tell what to my;
so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he aid ; but he was we earnest for
an answer to forget his question, so that he repeated it in the very some broken words
esabove. By this time I had recovered myself a little, end I said, "God will nt lust
punish him severely; ho is reserved for the judgment, and he is to be cast into the
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday ; but he
returns upon me, repeating my own words, " 'Reseree at (all! ' me no understand : but
_ why not kill the devil now; not kill grant ago I" "You may as well ask me," said I,

V " why God does not kill you or me, when we do wicked things here that ofl'snd Him :
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He muses awhile on this: " Well,
well," asya he, mightily afi'ectionately, " thnt well : so you, I, devil, all wicked, all
preserve, repent, God pardon all." Here I was run down by him to the last degree :
and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though they will guide
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the
' supreme being of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but Divine revelation
can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us ; of a
Mediator of the new covenant, and of an Interceasor at the footstool of God's throne ; I
say, nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in the soul ; and that, therefore,
the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the
Spirit of God, promised for the guide and. sanctifior of His people, are the absoluwa
necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God, and the means
of salvation
I therefore divertedtho present discourse between me and my man, rising up hastily
as upon some sudden ocusion of going out ; than sending him for somethings good
my oh; I seriously pnyed to God that he would enable me to instruct ssvingly thispoor savage ; twisting by His Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive
the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to Himself, and would
guide me to spark so to him from the \Vord of God, that his conscience might be
convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again to me, I entered
into a lung discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of men by the Saviour
of the world, and of the doctrine of the goslrel punched from heaven--viz, of repentance
towanls God, and faith in our blessed Lord Joann I then explained to him as well as
I could why our blown! Redeemer took not on Him the nature of angels, but the seed
of Abraham ; and how, for that rum-n, the fallen angels hrtd no share in the redemption ;
that he come only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like
I had, (ind knows, mun: sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I tool: for this
poor ere ur'o's instruction, and must acknowledge, what I believe all that not upon the
aune principle will find, that, in laying things open to him, I really informed and
ixrsl cred myselfin many things that I either did notknow, or had not fully considered
ln. , but which occurred naturally to rrry mind upon searching into them, for the
irrl'arnration of this poor nrvage ; and I had nr no alf-wtion in my inquiry after things
upon (his mansion than ever I felt before : so that, whether this poor wild wretch was
the better for me or no, I had "arson to be thankful that over he came to me; my grief
eat I or upon me ; my habitation grewcomfortahle to me beyond rrrvasure : and when
l reflected that in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I had not only been
moved to look up to heaven myself, and toseek the lnurd that had brought urelrevve, but
was now to be made an instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for nuglrt I
know, the soul of a poor firvnge, and bring him to the true knowledge of roll "on, and of
the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christdesus, to know whom is life eternal ;
I my, when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran through every part of
my soul. and I frequently rejoicul that ever I was brought to this place, which 1 had to
often thought the most dreadful of all infliction: that could lwibly have befallen me.
In this thankful future I continued all the remainder of nry time ; and the conver-

nation whi r employed the hours between Friday and me was such as made the three
years which we lived then: together perfectly and completely happy, il'any such thing
as complete happiues< turn be found in n sublunary state. This savage was now u good

points of religion, which have made Inch confusion- in the world, would have been to
us, if we could have obtained it; but I must go on with the historical part of things,
and take every part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could under>>
stand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken English, to me, I
acquainted him with my own story, or at least to much of it no related to my coming
into this place ; how I had lived there, and how long: I let him into the mystery, for
such it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him
a knife, with which he was wonderfully delighted; and I made him a belt, with a frog
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and in the frog. instead of a
hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in some onset, but

nmch more useful upon many omnibus. .
I dmibcd to him the countries of Europe, particularly England, which I came from ;

how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in shipa to all parts of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck which I
had been on board of, and showed him, name" as I could, the place where she lny : but
she was all beaten in pieces long before, and quite gone. I showed him the ruins of
our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole
xtmngth then; but was now fallen almost all to piewe. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied
nlmn. At last, rays he, " Me see such bout like come to place at my nation." I did
not understand hilu a good while; but, at lust, when I had emined further into it, I
understood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country
where he lived ; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stm of weather. I
pmntly imagined that some European ship must have been east away upon their coast,
and the boat might get loom and drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once
tlu-ught of men making their eaonpe from a wreck thither, much lees whence they might
come : so I only inquired after the description of the boat.

- Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought me better to understand
' him when he added with some warmth, "' We save the white mans from drown." Then
.. I presently askul if there were any white mans, no he <<lied them, in the boat. " Yea,"
he mid; "the boat full of white maua" I naked him how my. He told upon his
fingers seventeen. I naked him then what became of them. He told me, " They live,
they dwell at my nation."

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I pmently imagined that thwe might be
the men belonging to the IMP that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now
called it ; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock and they saw her inevitably
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among
the savages. Upon this I inquired of him more critically what was become of them.
He assured me they lived still there ; that they had been there about four years; that
the mmges left them alone, and gave them victuale to live. I asked him how it
came to pasethat they did not kill them and eat them. He mid, " No. they make brother
with them ;" that is, an I understood him, a truce ; and then he added, "They no cat
mans but when make the war tight ;" that is to any, they never eat any men but such
as come to fight with them, and are taken in battle.

It was after this some coneidemble time, that being upon the top of the hill, at the
east side of the island, from whence, as! have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered the
main or continent of America, Friday, the weather being very oerene, looks very . .CRUSOE INDULGES lN GROUNDLESS JEALOUSY.

earnestly towsrds the main land, and, in a'kind of surprise, Calls e-jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at some distance from him. I asked him what was the
matter. l'Oh, joy I" says be; "oh. glad! thereue my country, there my nation !" I
observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled,
and his countenance discovered a stunge ugerneas, as if he had a mind to be in his
own country again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which
made me, at first, not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before; and I made
no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he would not only
forget all his religion, bnt'all his obligation tome, and would be forward enough to give
his countrymen on account of me, and come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of
them, nnd make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with
those of his enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest
crcnturc very much, for which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so Gsmilinr
and kind to him as before: in which I was certainly in the wrong too; the honest
grateful creature having no thought about it, but what consisted with the host prin-
ciplea both as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as appeared aflemrds to
my full satisfaction. '

While my jealousy of him lastcd, you may be sure I was every day pumping him,
to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected were in him;
but I found everything he said was sohoneet and so innocent, that I could find nothing
to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely
his own again; nor did he in the least perceive that I wasuneosy, and therefore I could
not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at see, so that we
could not we the continent, I called to him, and said, " Friday, do not you wish yourself

I ' -) in your own country, your own nation?" "Yes," he add, "I be much 0 glad to be
at my own nation." " What would you do there 1 " mid I : " would you turn wild
again. out men's flesh again, and be a savage, as you were before i " He looked full of
concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no; Friday tell them to live good ; tell them
to pray God ; tell them to eat corn-brad, cattle-flesh, milk ; no eat man agnin." " Why,
then," said I to him, "they will kill you." He looked grove at that, and then said,-
" No, no; they no kill me, they willing love learn." Ho meant by this, they wouldbe
willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mus that came in the
boat. Then I asked him if he would go book to them. He smiled at that, and told
me he could not swim so far. I told him, I would make a canoe {orhim. He told me
he would go, if I would go with him. "I go!" says I; "why they will eat me if I
come there." "No, no," says he, "me make them no eat you 3 me make them much
love you." He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his
life, and so he would make thorn love me. Thou he told me, no well as he could, how
kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came
on shore in distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and ace i! I could possibly
join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese;
not doubting but, if I could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent. and a good company together, better than I could from an island
forty miles ofl' the shore, alone, and without help. So, after some days, I took Friday .
to work again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to go back ,

_ 43" '5'
to his own notion ; and, accordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which layon the other
side of the island, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water).
I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it. I found he was a mout
dcxterons fellow at managing it, and would make it go nlmoet as swift and fast again
as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, "Well, now, Friday, shall we go to
your nntion 1" He looked very dull nt my saying so; which it seems was because he
thought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him I had a. bigger; so the next
day I went to the place where the first boot lny which I had made, but which I
could not get into the water. He said that was big enough ; but then, as I had taken
no are of it, and it had lniu two or three and twenty years there, the sun had split
cud dried it, that it was rotten. Friday told me that such a heat would do very well,
and would carry " mueh enough vittle, drink, brad ;"--that was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over with him .
to the continent, thut I told him we would go and make one as big as that, and he
should go home in it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave and and. I
asked him what wns the matter with him. He asked me again, " Why you angry mad
with Friday 1--whnt Ine done 1 " I asked him what he meant. I told him I was not
angry with him at nlL " No nugry ! " my: he, repeating the words several times ; " why
send i-'riduy home awny to my rmtion'l" "Why," seys I, " Friday, did not you any
you wished you were there '1 " " Yes, yes," may; he, " wish we both there ; no wish
Friday there, no neuter there." Ina word, he would not think of going there without
me. " I go there, Friday I" mys I ; "what shall I do therei" He turned very quick
upon me at this " You do grant deal much good," says he; " you tench wild mans be
good, sober, tame nuns; you toll them know God, pmy God, and live new life."
" AIM, I-'ridsy !" says I, " thou kuowcst not what thou auyest; I am but an ignorant
man myself." "Yes, yes," says he, " you who me good, you umhce them good."
" No, no, Friday," says I, " you shall go without me; leave me here to live by myself,
as I did before." He looked confused again at that word ; and running to one of the
helchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. "What must
I do with thisl" says I to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. " Whnt must I
kill you for I" said I again. He returns very quick--"What you send Frirhty nwny
fort Trike kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly that I nw
tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost nfl'eetiuu in him
to me, and a. firm resolution in him, that I told him then, and often alter, that I would
never send him sway from me, ifhe was willing to any with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a. settled nd'ection to me, and that
. nothing could port him from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his
own country wus lid in his ardent afl'ection to the people, and his hopes of my doing
them good ; a thing which, as I had no notion of myself. eo I had not the least thought,
or intention, or desire of undertaking it But still I founda strong inclination to my
attempting an escape, founded on the snppodtion gathered from the former discourse,
thnt there were seventeen bearded men there ; and therefore, without any mom'delay, I
wont to work with Fridny to find out lgreat tree proper to fell, and make 1 large
periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the island to
have built a little fleet, not of peringiuls or canoea, but even of good largo vessels; but
the main thing I looked at was, to get one so nmr the water that we might launch it
when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday pitched '.p m

it; nor can I all, to um day, what wood to call the tree we cut-down, except on it
was very like the true we call rustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for itwas
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was (or burning the hollow or cavity of
this tree out, to make it into a boot, but I showed him how rather to cut it with tools;
which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in about a month's
haul labour, we finished it and made it very handsome ; especially, when, with our axes,
which I showed him how ,to handle, we cut and hewcd the outside into the true shape
of a boat. AM this, however, it cost us near a fortnight'a time to get her along, as it
were, inch by inch, upon greet rollers into the water; but when she was'in, she would
have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, though she was so big. it amazed me to see with what
dexterity and how swiit my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. So I asked him if we would, and if we might venture over in her. ' " Yes," he
said; " we venture over in her very wall, though grat blow wind." However, I had a
further design that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to
fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a must, that waseasy enough to get; so I
pitched upon a straight young <<(hr-tree, which I found nar- ths place, and which there
was great plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail, that was my particular
com I knew I had old rails, or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had
them now six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them,
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but
they were all rotten; and, indeed. most of them wereso. However, I found two pieces.
which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to work ; and with a great deal of
pain, and awkward, tedious stitching. you may he sure, for want of needles, I at length
made a tlrrceeornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton
sail, to go with a boom nt bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
our ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I beat knew how to manage, because it was
such a one as I used in the boot in which I made my escape from Barbory, as related
in the first part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work--via, rigging and fitting my mast
and soils ; {or I finished them very complete, making a small my, and a sail or foresail
to it, to assist if we should turn to windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her to steer with And though I was but a bungling shipwright,
yet as I knew the usefulness, and even the necessity of such a thing,' I applied myself
with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though, considering the
many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost. as much .
labour as making the boat.

Alter all this was done. I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged to the
navigation of my boat; for, though he knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew
nothing of what belonged to a sail and arudder; and wasthe most amazed when he law
rm.- work the bout to and apin in the sea by the rudder, and lime the sail gibbed, and
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, when he saw this.
he stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he beame an expert sailor, except that as to the compass I
could make him understand very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very
little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was the less
occasion for the compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the shore
by day, except in the rainy seasons, and than nobody cared to stir abroad either by land
or sea. '

I was now enter!!! on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in this place ;
though the three last years that I had this creature with me ought rather to be left out
of the account, my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of my
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the more thankfulneaa to God
for his mercies as at first : and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had
much more so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over
me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I had
an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that
I should not be another year in this place. However, I wont on_with my husbandry;
digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did
every necessary thing as before. ,

The rainy season was, in tho meantime upon me, when I kept more within doors
than at other times. I had stowed our new vcmel as secure as we could, bringing her
up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafls from the ship ;
and hauling her up to tha shore at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a, little
dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to.
float in ; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it,
to keep the water out; and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea : and to keep the
min of], we laid a great many bought: of tram, so thick that she was as well thatched as
a house; and thus we waited for the months of November and Dwember, in which I
designed to make my adventure.

\Vhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design returned
with the fair weather, I was prelnrr'ing daily for the voyage. And the firstthing I did
was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for our voyage ; and
intended, in a week or a fortnight'a time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I
was busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid
him go to the see-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we
generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not
been gone long when he enme running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, like
one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and before I had time to
speak to him, he cries out to me, " 0 master! 0 moan-r! 0 sorrow! 0 bad !"
" What's the matter, Riday l" raid 1. " 0h l yonder, there," says he ; "one, two, three
mnoes; one two, three !" By this way of speaking, I concluded there were six; but
an inquiry I found there were but three " Well, Friday," says I, " do not be
frightened." So I heartened him up aa well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow
was most terribly scored, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come back to
look for him, and would cut him in pieces and out him ; and the poor fellow trembled
so thut I scarcely knew what to do with him. I qomfortcd him M well as I could, and
told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me aa well as him.
" But," mid I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight them Can you fight, Friday 1 "
" Me shoot," says he 5 " but there come many great number." "No matter for that,"
said I, again ; " our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked him
whether, if I miolvcd to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just
as I bid him. He said, " Me die, when you bid die, master." So I went and
fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I had been no good a, husband of my ,
rum, thatIhad a great deal left. Whenhohad drunk it,I made him take the two:
fowling-pieees, which we always carried, and load them with large swan-shot, as big
as small pistol-bullets. Then I took four musket-I, and loaded them with two slugs,
and five smnll bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brnoe of bullets eaeh.
I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-glass, and went up to the side
of the hill, to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly by my glaas, that there
were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes ; and that their whole
hueinms seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies ; a
barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than, as I had observed, was uamrl with
them. I observed also that they landed, not where they had done when Friday made
his escape, but nearer to my creek. where the shore was low, and where a thick wood
came close almost down to the sea. This, with the abhorrenoe of the inhuman errand these
wretches come about, filled me with such indignation thnt I earne down again to Friday,
and told him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all ; and asked him if
he would stand by me. He had now got over his fright, and his spirits being it little
rnised with the drum I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he
would die when I bid die.

In this fit of fury I took first and divided the arms which I had charged, as before,
between us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his
shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three myself; and in this posture we
rnnrehed out. I took n small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large
bag with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot. or do anything till I bid him, run! in the mean-
time not to speak or word. In this posture 1 fetched a cempm to my right hand of
near a mile, or well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come
within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my glam it was
easy to (la

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to
abate my resolution--I do not meon that I entertained any fear of their number,
for, us they were naked, unarmed wretchea, it is certain I was superior to them--my,
though I hurl been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, what all, what occasion.
much less whnt ncearsity, I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who hud neither done or intended me any wrong l---who, as to me, were innocent, and
whose barbarous customs were theirown disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God's
lnun'ng left them, with the other nations of that port of the world, to such stupidity, and
to such inhuman courses, but did not tell me to take upon me to be e judge of their
actions, much less on executioner of His justice--that whenever he thought fit He
would take the muse into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish them
for natiounl crimes; but that, in the menntime, it was none of my businoauthnt it
was true Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in a state of
wnr with those very lurticnbrr people, and it was lawful for him to attack them ; but I
could not any the same with reg-ml to myself. These thing were so warmly pressed
upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and place
myself near them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then
as God should direct ; end that unless something ofl'ered that was more a call to me thm
yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible warinesa and ailenoe,
Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood on
the ride which was next to them, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and
them Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was just at
the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he oould see
there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and eame immediately back to me, and
told me they might be plainly viewed there--that they were all about their fire eating
the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the mud a little
from them, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the very soul within me.
lie told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had
told me of, that atmc tothcir country in the boat. I was filled with horror at the \'cry
nruuiug of the white banded ruau ; and going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glare a
white man, who hly upon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with
flags or things like rushes, and that he was a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer to
them than the place where I was, which, by going a little way about, I new I might
come at undiamvcrul, and that then I should be within half a shot of them; no 1
withheld my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going
back about twenty prices, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I mum
to the other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full View of
them at the distance of about eighty yank

I had now not a moment to lose, {or nineteen of the dreadful wretchcs put upon the
ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor
Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb to their lire, and they were steeping
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday ; "New, Friday," stid I. " do
as I bid thee." Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," said I, " do exactly as you see
rue de ; fail in nothing." So I set down one of the markets and the fowling-picco upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other market I took my aim
ut the mrugea, bidding him do the like; then asking him if he was ready, he said,
" Yea." " Then fire at them," said I ; and at the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he shot he killed
two of them, and wounded three more ; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two.
They u'r-re, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them that were
not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or
which way to look, for they knew not from whence their deatruction mule. Friday
kept his eyfi close upon me, that, M I had bid him, he might observe what I did; no, as
soon in the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fending-piece,
and Friday did the like ; he now me cock and present 5 he did the same again. " Are

upon the beach or shore, between the place where they sat and the sea. The two butcher-
whe were just going to work with him had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and
fled in a terrible fright to the sesame, and had jumped into a enuec, and three more of
the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bride him step forwards and lire
at them; he understood me immediately, and running about forty yards to be nearcr
them, he shot at them; and I thought he killed them all, for I saw them all full of a
limp into the beat, though I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed
two of them, and wounded the third so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if
he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the flags that
bound the peer victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him,
in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered, in Intin, Christianus ; but was
so weak and faint that he could some stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my
pocket, and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave
hima piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what oountryman he was, and
he said Espagnole ; and being a little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could
possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. "Seignier," said I,
with as much Spanish as I could make up, " we will talk aflerwards, but we must light
now; if you have any strength loft. take this pisz and sword, and lay about you."
He tool: thorn very thankfully ; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands but, as if
they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had out
two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is. as the whole was a surprise to
them, so the poor creatures were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that
they fell down for more amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt their
own escape, than their fled had to resist our shot: and that was the ease of those live
that Friday shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell with the hurt they received,
so the other two fell with the fright.

I lrcpt my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep my charge
ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I called to Friday,
and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which
lay there that had been discharged, which he did with great swiftness ; and then giving
him my musket, I set down myself to load all the rust again, and beds them come to
me when they wanted. While I was leading these pieces, there happened a nerve
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the amigos, who made at him with one "
of their great wooden swords, the same weapon that wns to have killed him before, if I
had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined,
though week, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut two gmtwounds on
his head ; but the mirage being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown
him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand ; when the
Spaniard, though underniost, wisely quitted the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle,
shot the savage through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was
running to help him, could come near him.

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretchen with no weapon
in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three who, as I said
before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could come up with: and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-piwa, with which
he pursued two of the savages, and wounded them both ; but, as he was not able to run,
they both get from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of ,

'59
them, but the other was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged himself into the sea, and sworn with all his might of to those two who were
leftin the mnoe; which three in the canoe1 with one wounded, that we knew not
whether he died or no, were all that camped our hands, of one-end-twenty. The
account of the whole is as follows :--'l'hree killed at our that shot from the tree ; two
killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat; two killed by Friday, of
those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three killed by the
Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by
Friday in his chase of them; four amped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not
dead--twenty-one in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot, and though Friday
made two or three shots at them, [did not find that he hit any of them. Friday
would faiu have had me take one of their canoes and pursue them ; and, indeed, I was
very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they
should come hack perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by
more multitude; so I consented to pursue them by m and running to one of their
canoes I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe,
I was surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the
Sp'mianl was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was
the matter; for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really little life
in him.

I immediately cut the hfixtcd flags or rushes, which they had bound him with, and
would have helped him up ; but he could not stand or speak, but grooned most piteously,
believing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday
came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out
my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram ; which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him
speak. and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how
Friday kimal him, embraced him, hinged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, snag; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head ; and then
sung and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I
could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when he came a
little to himself, he told me that it was his father.

It is not may for me to exprem how it moved me to see what ecstasy and filial
afl'ectiou had worked in thin poor lavage at the sight of his father, and of his being
dcliVert'd from dmth ; nor, indeed, am I describe half the extravagancu of his affection
after this ; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, a great many times : when
he went in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father'shead
close lo his bosom half an hour together, to no: sh it; then he took his arms and
ankles, which were numbed and stilT with the binding. and chafed and rubbed them with
his handa 3 and I, perceiving what the case WM, gave him some rum out of my bottle to
rub them with, which did them a gmt dell of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canon with the other eat-ages, who were
now gotten almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew
so hard within two hours after, and before they could be got a quarter of their way, and
continued blowing so hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was against them,But in rulurn lo Friduy ; ll" was s>> hm.)- about his father, that. I could nor. find in

I found his price sleeker, bemuse he had something in his hand. \Vhen he come up to me,
I I fond he had been quite home for on earthen jug or pot, to bring his hither some

fresh water, end that he had got two more akes or leave: of breed : the breed he gave

me, but the water he carried to his father ; however, as I was very thirsty too, 1 tool: -

a little sup of it. This water revived his futher more then all the mm or npiritet I had

given him, for Ire we: just fuinting with think.

"'heu his futlrer had drunk, I mlled to him to know if there win any water left :
he srid " Yum" and I bade him give to the poor Spaniard, who we: in In much want
of it rut his father; end I sent one of the cakes, thnt Fridny brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, turd we: rcposing himself upon n. green place under
the shade of a tree ; and whose limbs were also very still, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. \Vhen I new that upon Friday's coming to
him with tho mum, he sit up turd drank. and took tho breul and began to out, I went
to him and gave him a handful of mixing : he looked up in my flee with all the tokens
of gratitude nlltl tlmnkfulnose that could appeer in any countenance; but was so weak,
notwithstanding he had no exerted himself in the light, thlt he could not stand up upon
his feet: he tried to do it two or three times. but was really not able, his ankles were
so swelled and are painful to him ; no I bode him sit still, end armed Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with ruln, us he had done his firther's.

I observed the poor nlfectiouete creature, every two minutes, or perhaps lea, all the
while he was how. tunrcd his head about, to see if his flther was in the some place and
posture as he left him sitting; and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at which he
otnrtcd up, end, without speaking rt word, flew with thnt swiftnus to him, tlmt one eoultl
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground in; he went: but when he come, he only
found he had laid himself down to ee-re his limbs, so Friday came heel: to me
preeently ; and I then spoke to the Sluruiurd to let Friday help him up, if Ire eould, and
l and him to the boot, and then he should urrr)' him to our dwelling, where I would tuke
core of him. But Friday, it lusty young fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his
buck, und carried him away to the bout, turd set him down willy upon the side or

' gunnel of the curve, with his feet in the inside of it; and then lifted him quite in, turd
but him clone to his father; nud prawntly stepping out again, lnnnehed the bout ed,
and paddled it uloug the shun: faster than I could wulk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into our creek, and lmving them in the beet,
runs ewny to fetch the other canoe. As he peat-d rue I spoke to him, turd :rxlvzed him
whither he went He told me, "Go fetch more houtg" so nwny he went like the wind,
for sure never men or home run like him; and he hud the other eunoc in the err-<<k

. nlrnoet as won as 1 get In it by lnud ; so he wofted me over, and then went to help our

7 new guests out of the boat, which he did ; brrt they were neither of them able to well: ;
so that poor Friday knew not what to do.

To remedy thin I went to work in my thought, nnd culling to I-'riduy to bid them sit
down on the bunk while he came to me, I soon unulu u kind of lurid-burrow to luy them

. on, end Frithry and I curried them up both together upon it between mt.

But when we got them to the outxide of our well, or fortifieetien, we were at n
worse less then before, for it was irulxnetiblo to get them over, turd I was resolved not to
break it down ; so I set to work again, end Friday and I, in about two hours' time,
made rt very handsome tent, covered with old stile, nud above that with bought! of trees,
being in the space without our outward fence, and between that and the grove of youngCRUSOE CONVERSES \VlTH HIS SUBJECTS.
wood which I had planted ; and here we made them two beds of each things an I had,
\'in, of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them,
on mch bed.

My island was now peopled, md I thought myself very rich in subject: ; and it was
a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the
whole country was my own more property, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion.
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected : I was abeolutcly lord and lnwgivcr : they
all owed their live. to me, and were ready to lay down their live, if there had been
occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were
of three different religions : my man Friday was a. Protestant, his father was a Pagan
and a cannibal, and the Spaniard wnoa Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience
throughout my dominion-x :--But this is by the way.

As soon as I had secured my two week mencd prieoncrs, and given them shelter,
anda place to rent them upon, I began to think of making some prov'uion for them;
and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a. kid and a
goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed; when I cut oil' the hinder quarter, and
chopping it into emll pieces, I act Friday to work to boiling and itewing, and made
them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth, having put some barley and rice
also into the broth ; and as I cooked it without-doors, for I made no fire within my inner
wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and having act a table there for them, I eat
down, and etc my own dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them

and cncourngcd them. Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed, - i i

to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savage: pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather cupped, I ordered Friday to take one of the canoes
and go and fetch our musket: and other fimrme, which, for want of time, we had left
upon the place of bottle; and, the next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dad
bodiu of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would presently be offensive.
I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could
not think of doing myself: nay, I could not hair to see them, if I went that way ; all
which he pnnctually performed, and defaced the very appearance of the savages being

-. there ; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects; and,
first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of the :avegu
in that canoe, and whether we might expect 3 return of them, with e. power- too great
for us to resist Ilia first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live out
the storm which blew that night they went off, but must, of neccesity, be drowned, or

_ driven south to those other shores where they were as sure to be devoured as they were
. V to be drowned if they were cast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe
on shore. he mid he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise. and the fire, that he
believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning, notby
the band of man ; and that the two which appeared, viz, Friday and I, were two heavenly
spirits, or furiee, come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This he laid
he know, because he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to another ; for
it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dartfirc, and speakthunder, and
hill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as we: done now: and thin old uvage was
in the right; for, u I understood since, by other bands, the augee never attempted to

go over mthe island afterwards ; they were so terrified with the accounts given by those
four men (for it Ree-Ins they did wpe the am), that they believed whoever went to that
enchanted inland would be dentroyed with fire from the gods Thin, however, I ltnew
.' A not; and therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always

'l III a little time, however, no more mum appearing, the fear of their coming were
ufl'; and I began to take |I|_\' former thoughts of a voygo to the main into consideration ; I
being likewiw mended, by Friday's father, that I might depend upon good Image from '1
Iheirnatiun, on his account, if I would go. But my thoughts were a little nupended l
' when I had a serinIuI discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there
I were xixteI-n more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been eIuIt away and
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the nvagug but were
, very were put to it for neeemnriet, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars

i xilver, and to bring back what European goods they could meet with there; that they

I naked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had formed
an dwign of making any escape. lle said they had many consultations about it; but
that having neither verse], nor tools tIIbIIild one, nor proviainns of any kind, their eonnciht
always ended in tears and derquir. I naked him how he thought they would receive a
prolmd from me, which might tend towarda an more ; and whether, it they were all
here, it might not he done. I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery
and ill-umge of me, if I put my Iifein their handa; for that gratitude was no inherent ,
virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always IIquure their dmlingn by the obligatiuna
they had received, so much as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would he very hard that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that they _
should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was '
certain to be made a mritice, what IImity, or what accident IIoever brought him
thither; and that I had rather be delivered up to the ravages, and be devoured alive,
l than fall into the Inert-Hex: claws of tho prieata, and be earried into the Inquisition. I
'i added that, otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
i hands build a barqne large enough to carry us all any, either to the Brands nouth~

when I had put weapons into their hand>>, carry me by force among their own people, I
mightbe ill used for my kindness tothem, and make my one worse than it was before.

He answered, with a grmt deal of caudour and ingennousneaa, that their condition
war: :40 miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor
the thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance; and
that," I pleased, he would go to them, with the old man, and diacouhve with them about
it and return again, and bring me their answer: that he would make conditional with

It was no lees than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange nml unforeseen

fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man Friday came runni a n to me, and

shore, as if they looked for ncreek to thnut in at, for the convenience of landing; how-
ever, as they did not come qnim flir enough. they did not see the little inlet where ICRUSOE DISCQVERS HINSELF YD THC ENCLISN (AFN-KLformerly landed my rails, but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about holfn.
mile from me ; which was very happy for me; {or otherwise they would have landed

' just at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and
perhaps have plundered mo of all I had. \Vhen they were on shore. I woefully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it
did not prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were
nnarmed,aud, us I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of them werojumped
on shore, they took those three out of the boat, as prisonens: one of the three I could
perveim luiug the most passionate gutum of cntronty, affliction, and despair, oven to a
kind of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hand aometimes,
and appeared couccnicd, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly
confounded at the night, and knew not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called
out to me in English, as well a: he could, " 0 master! you see Engliah mans eat primuer
as well as savage mam." " Why, Friday," says I, " do you think they are going to eat
them, then I"---"Yc.v," myx Friday, "they will cut them."--"No, no," my: I, " Friday ;
I am afraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may he saw they will not eat
them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood trembling
with the horror of the night, expecting every moment when the three prisoners nhould be
killed ; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a grunt Cutlass, M the
seamen call it, or award, to strike one of the poor men ; and I exlwetul to nee him fall
every moment 3 at which all the blood in my body seemed to I'll" chill in my veins. I
wished heartily now for my Slntlinnl, and the savage that was gone with him, or that I
had any way to have come undincoronal within xhot of them, that I might have secured
tho three men, for I saw no rim-CH1"! they had among them ; but it fell out to my
mind another way. After I had observed the outrageous Image of the three men by
the ilNdeut seamen, I observed the fellows mu scattering about the land, ax ifthey
wanted to see the country. I OlIM'l'VtYl nlm that the three other men had liberty to go
when) they pleased; but theymt down all three upon the ground, very lmnxive, and

, looked like men in despair. This put me in mind of the first time when I time on
shore, and begin to look about me ; how I gave myself over for load. ; how wildly I
looked round me: What dreadful approhemions I had ; and how I lodged in the tree all
night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. An I know nothing, that night, of the
supply I was to receive by the providentiul driving 0f the ship nearer the land by the
moi-me and tide, by which I have aincc been so long nonrished and supported ; so these
three poor desolate men know nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near it was to them, and how cll'ectually and really they were in a condition of
mfety, at the some time they thought themselves lost, and their clue desperate. So
little do we see before us in the world, and so much maimn have we to depend cheerfully
upon the great Maker of the worn], that He does not leave Ilia creatures so absolutely
destitute, but that, in the worst circumstances, they have alwayx mun-thing to be
tlmnkl'ul for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than the ' imagine; nay, are

' even brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to
their destruction.

It wzujust at the top ofhigh water when these people came on shore ; and while they
rambled about to see what kind of a. place they were in, they had enrolmly stayed. till the
tide was spent, and the water was cbbed consider-ably away, leaving their boat aground.
They haul left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a littlotooDELIVERANCE IN AN UNCOUTH FORM.

much brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the other,
and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who
were straggling about ; upon which they all soon came to the boat; but it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side
being a soft cozy sand, almost like a quieksand. In this condition, like true seamen,
who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and
away they strolled about the country again ; and I heard one of them my aloud to
another, calling them off from the boat, " Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you! she'll
float next tide 3" by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what country-
men they were. All this while I kept myself close, not out>> daring to stir out of my
castle, any further than to my place of observation, near tho top of the hill ; and very
glad I was to think how well it was fortified I knew it was no less than ten hours
before the boat could float ugiin, and by that time it would be dark, and I might be at
more liberty to see their motions, and tohear their (liscoumo, if they had any. In the
meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though with more muticn, knowing
I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first. Iordered Friday also,
whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I
took myself two feuding-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was
very fierce; I had my formidable goutmkin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned.
u. naked sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it was dark ;
but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found, in short, they were all gone
struggling into the woods, and, as I thought, were all laid downtesleep. The three poor
distrusted men, too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down
under the shelter of a great tree. at about a quarter of a mile from um, um], as I thought.
out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and
learn something of their condition ; immediately I marched as above, my man Friday at
a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making Quito 80
storing a spectrelike figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as Icould, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, " What are ye, gentle-
,. men 1 " They surrtml up at the noise, but were ten times more wnfounded when they
saw me, ruid the uncouth figure that I. made. They made no answer at all, but I
thought I perceived them just going to fly from Inc, when I spoke to them in English :
" Gentlemen," said I, "do not be surprised at me : perhaps you may have a, friend near,
when you did not expect it." "He must be sent directly from heaven, then," said
one of them very gravely to me, and pulling at? his hot at the same time; "for our

condition is past the help of man." "All help is from heaven, sir," said I: "but

can you put a atmnger in the way to help you l for you seem to be in some great distress.
I law you when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to the brutes
that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you."

The poor man, with team: running down his face, and trembling, looked like one . ..
astonished, returned, "Am I talking to God, or man? Is it a. real man, or an angel 1"
---" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I ; "if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he
would have come better clothed, and armed alien-another manner than you see me in ; pray
lay aside your fears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you ; you see I

murderers are so neer us :, but, in short, sir, I was wmmander of that ship ; my men ,
have nmtinicd against me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and,
at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with them two men with ms--one
my mate, the other a passenger, where we expected to perish, believing the place to be
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it." "Where are these brutev, your
enemies 't " arid I ; "do you know where they are gone i" " There they lie, sir," said
he, pointing toa thicket of trees ; " my heart trelubles for fear they have seen us,
and heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder us all." "Have they
any fire-arms'l " said I. lie answered, " They had only two pieces, one of which they
left in the boat." " Well then," said I, "leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep ;
it is an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them prisoners?" He told
me there were two dc=perate villains among them that it was sauce safe to show any
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty.
I asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them,
but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct. "\\'ell,"s'tys I, "let us
retreat out of their view or hearing. lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So
they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.

" Look you, sir," grid 1; "it' I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing to
make two conditions with me 2 " lie anticipated my proposals by tcllingme that both he
and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded by me in everything ;
and if the ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the
world soever I would send him _: and the two other men said the same. "Well," said
I, " my conditions are but two ; dun--that while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms in your hands, you will, upon

4.443% ' ' '-

all oomsions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, a '

and in the meantime be governed by my order-s ; secondly,--that if the ship is or may
be recovered, you will carry me and my man to England mange free."

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of a man could devise that
- he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and besides would owe his life to
me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. " Well, then," said I,
" here are three muskcts for you, with powder and boll ; tell me next what you think is
proper to be done." He showed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was able,
but ofl'ercd to be wholly guided by me. Itold him I thought it was hard venturing
anything; but the best method I could think of way to fire on them at once as they lay,

and if any were not killed at the first volley, and nth-ml to submit, we might save them, :

and so put it wholly upon God's prtwidence to direct the shot. He said, very modestly,
that he was loth to kill them, if he. could help it ; but that those two were incorrigible
villains and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if thr ' escaped, \vu
"_ should be undone still, for they would go on board and bring the whole ship's company,
" and destroy us all. " "'ell, then," says I, "neeemity legititnatcs my advice, for it is the
only way to give ourlives." However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I
told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this diseaursewc heard some of them awake, and soon otter we saw
two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of them were the men who he had said
were the heads of the mutiny 1 He said, "No." " Well, then," said I, "you may let
them escape ; and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to save them-
selva Now." says I, "if the rut escape you,it is your fault." Animated with this, he
took the musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two com-
rades with him, with each man a piece in his hand ; the two men who were with him going

'72first made some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned about,
nnd seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for the
moment he cried out. they fired--I menu the two men, the captain wisely reserving
his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded ; but not being
dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other ; but the
captain, stopping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call
upon God to forgive his villany, and with that word knocked him down with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more: there were three more in the

' ~ company, and one of them was slightly wounded. By this time I was come; and

, when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to mist, they begged for mercy.
The captain told' them he would spare their lives if they would give him an assurance
of their ahhorrencc of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be
faithful to him in recovering the ship, and nfieru'nrtls in carrying her back to
J <<mice, from whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of their
sincerity that could he desired; and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives, which I was not against, only I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot
while they were upon the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the bout, with '
orders to secure her, and bring away the ears and sails, which they did ; and by-and-by
three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back
upon henring the guns fired; and seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner, now
their conqueror, they submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete.It now remained that the miptain and I should inquire into one [mother's circum-
stances. l ll'gull first, and told him my whole history, which he heard with an attention
even to mnmunent,--aml lnrticularly at the wonderful manner of my being flirnished
with provisions and amnmnition ; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of
womleet, it all'wted him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and
how I seemed to have been preserved there on put-wee to sure his life, the tun-a run
down hix fare, and he could not apealr a word more. After this communication was at
an end, I curriul him and his two men into my apartments, leading them in just where
I came out, \-in, at tln: {up of the house, where I refreshed him with such provision as
1 had, and showed them all the centrivuuees I had made during my long. long inhu-
biting that place.

All 1 showed them, all I slid to them, was perfectly amazing ; but above all, the
captain admired my furtifimtion, and how perfectly I hurl concealed my retreat with a
grove of trees, which, h: 'ing been now planted near twenty yarn, and the trees growing
much Tester their in l- And, Win; become it little wood, no thick that it was impumblc
in any part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding lunar-age
into it. 1 told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I hud a seat in the
country, as most princes have, whither l ronld retreat upon occasion, and I would show
him that too another time ; but at present our business was to consider how to recover
the ship. lle agreed with me as to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss what
mm'urca to take, for that there were still xix-und-twenty hands on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspintcy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the llt\\',
would he hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that if
they were subdued they should be brought to the gallows M800" as they came to England,
or to any of the English colonies, and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them
with so small a number ax we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had mid, and found it was n very rational con-
clusion, and that therefore something wiu to be resolved on Very speedily, us well todmw
the men on board into some snare for their snrprise,ns to prevent their lundingupon us,
and destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the
xhip'a crew, wondering what was become of their comnulm and of the bout, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and that then, perhapg
they might come armed, nnd be too strong for In; : this he allowed to be rational. Upon
thin, I told him the first thing we had to do wzu to stave the boat, which lay upon the
hunch. so that they n slit not carry her all, and taking everything out of her, halve herso
far uselexs' us not to be lit to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the arm: which
were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found therc,--which was it bottle
of brandy, :nnl another ot'nnu, a few biscuitrcaket, n horn of powder, and n great lump
of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or xix wands); all which was very
Welcmue to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many

"hell we had uu'ried all these thingu on shore (the cans, moat, mil, and rudder of the
bout Were carried away before), we knocked in great hole in her bottom, that if they had
come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry oil' the bout. Indeed, it was
not much in my thought>> that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was,
that if they went away without the boat, i did not much question to make her again
fit to carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in myPREPARATIONS FOR A CONTEST.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main strength, heaved
the heat upon the beach, so high that the tide would not float her off at high~water
mark, and heddes, had broken a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly Mapped, and
were sat down musing what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make A
waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board: but no boat stirred;
and they fired several times. making other signals for the boat. At last, when all
their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the bent did not stir, we saw
them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore;
and we found," they approached, that there were no lea: than ten men in her, and
that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of there as
they came, and a plain sight even of their faces ; because the tide having not them a
little to the cast ofthe other best, they rowed up under shore, to come to the same
place where the otherhad landed, and where the boot lay; by this means I say, we
had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men
in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure,
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that
as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief oflioer among them, and all the rest,
they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate in
their new enterprise ; and terribly apprehensive ho was that they would he too powerful
for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances were post the
operation of fear ; that seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that
which we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the
circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.
" And where, sir," said I, " is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save
your life, which elevated you a little while age? For my part," said I, " there seems
to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it." " What is that 3" says he. " \\'hy,
said I, " it is, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them, which
should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should have thought
God's providence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands ; for depend upon
it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or live as they behave to no"
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it greatly
encoumgcd him ; so we set vigorously to our business

We had, upon the first appearance of the beats coming from the ship, considered
of separating our prisoners; and had, indwd, secured them effectually. Two of them,
of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three delivered men to my cave where they were remote enough, and out of danger of
being lic'nrd or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods, if they could have
delivered themselves; here they left them bound, but gave them provisions; and
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or
two; but that if they attempted their wpe, they should be put to death without
mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were
very thankful that they had such good umge u to have provisions and a light left them :
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comfort; and they
did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned, indeed,
because the captain was not free to trust them ; but the other two were taken into my'1'!" , ' , __ I"

The mph-tin made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of theirs, viz,

 

 

 

  

 

onu what to do, as our.

 

 

 

      

 

 

- "'1" ,/-7' on: 'that perhaps they would all lire a volley again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear,
and that we should all sally upon themjust at the juncture when their pieces were all
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.
I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to
them before they could load their pieces again. But this event did not happen; and we
lay still a long time, very irresoluw what course to take. At length, I told them there
would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and then if they did not return to
the boat, perhaps we might fmd a way to get between them and the shore, and so might
use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a great
while, though very inniatieut for their removing; and were very uneasy, when, after
long mnsultatiou, we mw them all start up, and march down towards the m: it seems
they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place, that they resolved logo
on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their
intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived (ht-in go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as it really was,
that they had given over their search, and were for going back again ; and the captain,
as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it : but I
presently thought of a strutagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end
to a tiltle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little creek westward,
towards the place where the savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them
halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that
as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again ; and
then keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the others halloocd, to
draw them as far into the island, and among the woods, as possible, and then wheel
about again to me by such ways as I directed

They were just going into the bout when Friday and the mate hallooed ; and they
presently heard them, and, answering, ran along the shore westward, towards the voice
they heard, when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the water being up, they
could not get over, and called for the boat to come up and set them over ; as, indeed, I -
expected. When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone npa
good way into the creek, and, an it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of
the three men out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, haring
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished for ;
and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their buxincss, I tool: the rest
with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they
were aware; one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat. The fellow
on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up ; the captain, who was
foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down ; and then called out to him in the
boat to yield, or he waso dead man. There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his commdo knocked down :
besides this wag it scelna, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest
of the crew ; and, therefore, was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to
join rery sincerely with no In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by halluoing and answering,
from one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but luit them where they could not mch back to the boot before it was dark ;
and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came back to us. .THE MUTINEERS CAPITULATE.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall upon
them, so as to make sure work with them It was several hours after Friday came back
to me before they mrne back to their boat ; and we could hear the foremost of them.
long before they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and could also
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to eomeany
faster: which was very welcome news to us At length they came up to the boot:
but it is impossible to exprm their confusion when they found the boot fast aground in
the creek, the tide cbbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to one
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an
enchanted island ; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all be
murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it,and they should be all can'ied away
and devoured. They hallooed again, and mlled their two comrades by their namur a
great many times ; but no answer. After some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in dospair,and sometimes they
would go and sit down in the boat to mt themselves: then come ashore again, and
walk about again, and so the some thing over again. My men would fuin have had me
give them leave to full upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take them
at some adrantge, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially
I was unwilling to hamrd the killing any of our men, knowing the others were very well
armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not selnunte; and therefore, to make sure
of them ; I drew my aruhuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep
ripen their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be
discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly, before they ofi'ered to fire.

They had uotbeen long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was the principal
ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself tho most dejected and dispirited
of all the rest, came walking towards them, with two more of the crew ; the mptain was
so eager at having the principal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue
before ; but when they came nmrer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet,
let fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next man was shot intho
body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the
third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my whole army,
which was now eight men ; viz, myself, generalisaimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general;
the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with
arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number ;
and I made the man they had left in the beat, who was now one of us call them by
name, to try if I could bring them to a paltry, and so perhaps reduce them to terms ;
which fell out just as we desired ; for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition
then was, they would be very willing to eapitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could
to one of them, " Tom Smith ! Tom Smith !" Tom Smith answered immediately, "Who's
that! Robinson 1 " for it seems he knew the voice. The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for
God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all deed men this
moment."--" Who must we yield tel \Vhero are they 1" says Smith again. " Here.
they are," says he ; " here's our captain and tiny men with him, have been hunting you
these two hours; the boatswnin is killed, Will Frye is wounded, and I am aprisoner;
and if you do not yield, youm all iost."--" Will theygive us quarter then 1 " says Tom
Smith, " and we will yield."--" I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield," said Robinson:
so he asked the captain ; and the captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, you

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

know my voice; i!" you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, you shsll have
your liver, all but "'ill Atkins"

Upon this, "'ill Atkins cried out, "For God's sake, captain, give me quarter; what;
have I done? They have been all as bad as I :" which, by the way, was not true ; for,
it seems, this \"ill Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain, when they
first mutiniod, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious
language. However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and
trust to the govemnr's mercy : by which he meant me, for they all mlled me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their lives; and I sent the man
that had parlcyed with them, and two mom, who bound them all ; and then my great
army of lifty men, which, with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized
upon them, and upon their boat ; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight, for
reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship; and as for the
captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he cxpostulated with them upon the
villany of their practices with him, and upon the further wickedness of their design, and
how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows. They all appeared very lmiitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he
told them they were none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island ; that they
thought they . set him on slum.- in a hnrren, uninhabited island; but ithad pleased God
so to direct them, that. it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman ; that
he might hang them all there, if he phased; but as helutd given them all quarter, ho
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there asjustiee required,
except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death,
for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect; Atkins fell
upon his knees, to hog the captain to intereedc with the govemor for his life; and all

~ the rest begged of him, for (iod's sake, that they might not he sent to England.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our delivemnce was come, and that it would
be a most easy thing to bring these fvllows in to ho hmrty in getting lsmexvion of the
ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might not see what kind ofu governor
they had, and called the e. . in to me; when I called, as at a good distance, one of the men
was ordered to speak again, and my to the captain, "' Captain, the commander calls for
you 3 " and presently the captain replied, "To" his Excellency, I am just coming." ,
This more perfectly nmazed them, and they all believml that the connnaxnlerwasjust by, i
with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told him my project for seizing
the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execntion next
morning. But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success I told
him we must divide the prisoners and that he should go and take Atkimg and two more
of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the care when: the others lay. This
was committed to Friday and the two men who wine on shore with the captain. They
convele them to the cave as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially
to men in their condition. The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I
have given a full description : and as it was fenced in, and they pinioued, the place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a parley with
them ; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or
not to go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of the injury done him,of the condition they were brought to, and that though the governor had given them
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England,
they would beall hanged iu chainx; but that if they would join in such an attempt
as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's engagement. for their pardon.

Any one may gueu how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in their
condition ; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised, with tho decput
impmcations that they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over the world; that they would own
him for a father to them as long as they lived. "\Vell," say: the captain, "I must go
and tell the governor what you say, and see what. I ean do tobring him toconscntto it."
So he brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and that he rerily believed
they would be faithful. However. that we might be very secure, I told him he should
go back a-O n and chem-e out five of them, and tell them that they might see that he
did not want men, that he would take out threee five to be his ass'utanta, and that the
governor would keep the other two and the three that were sent prinonera to the turtle
(my cave),a:s hostagew for the fidelity of lhme five ; and that if they proved unfaithful in
the execution, the live hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This
looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in earnest ; however, they
had no way left them but to accept it ; and it was now the business of the prisoners,
as much as of the captain, to persuade the other live to do their duty.

Our xtrength was new thus ordered for the expedition : first, the captain, his mute,
and pasenger; second, then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having "lei?
character from the captain, Ihad given their liberty, and trusted them with arms; third,
the other two whom I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, upon the captain's
motion, had now relerued ; fourth, tlnxc live released at last: so that they were twelvo
in all, besides live we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with them hand: on board the ship;
for as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir, having
seven men left behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder,
and supply them with vietunls. As to the live in the cave, I resolved to keep them

. fast, but Friday went in twiee a day to them, to supply them with neeextwics ; and I
made the other two carry provisionx to a certain distance, where Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages it was with the captain, who told them
I was the perer the govenmr had ordered to look after them; and that it was the
governor's pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; that it'they did,
they would be fetched into the castle, amt be laid in irons : so that as we never suffered
them to see me as governor, I new appeared on another person, and spoke of the
governor, the garrison, the eaxtle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no dilliculty before him, but to furnish his two boats, stop the
breach of one, and man them. He made his pamnger mptain of one, with four other
men ; and himself, his mate, and live more, went in the other; and they contrived
their husinm very well, for they came up to the rhipaboutmidnight. As soon as they
more within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought
oi? the men and the boat, but that it wa u long time before they had found them, and
the like ; holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the mptain
and the mate entering first with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate
and carpenter with the buttAend of their markets, being very faithfully seconded by
their men 5 they secured all the mt, that were upon the main and quarter-decks, andTHE SHll' RECOVERED.

began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below ; when the other host
and their men, entering at the fore--chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
scuttle which went down into the cook-room, making three men they found there
prisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate,
with three men, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who,
having taken the alarm, had got up. and with two men and a boy had got fire-arms in
their hands; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and
his men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a. musket-hall, which
broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate, calling
for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol,
shot the new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, coming out
again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the rest
yielded, and the ship was taken efl'eetunlly, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be fired,
which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success, which, you
may he sure, I was very glad to heir, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near
two o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ;
and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something
surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting up, I heard a man calling me by
the name of " Governor! Governor ! " and presently I knew the captain's voice; when
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood,and, pointing to the ship, he embraced
mo in his arms. " My dear friend and deliverer,"snys he, " there's your ship ; for she is
all yours, and so are we, and all that belongs to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there
she rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore ; for they had weighed her
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought
her to an anchor just gainst the mouth of the little creek ; and, the tide being 3p,
the captain had brought the pinnaoe in near the place where I first landed my rafts,
so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for
- I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was
' not able to answer one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by

him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and immediately
pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave meadmm of cordial, which he had brought on

purpose for me. After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it . ~ '-

brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. All
this while the poor man was in as great an ecstacyas I, only not under any surprise as I
was; and he said a thousand kind and tender things to me, to oompou and bring mete
myself; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into eon-
fusion: at last it broke into tears; and, in a little while after, I recovered my speech ;
' then I tool: my turn, and embraced him ssmy deliver-er, and we rejoiced together. I told
him I looked upon him as a man sent from heaven todeliver me, and that the whole trans-
action seemed to be a chuin of wonders ; that such things as these were the testimonies
we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, audan evidence that the eye
' of an Infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send help
to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness
to Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had. not only in a miracu-
lous manner provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but
from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked a while, the mptain told me he had brought me some little
refreshments such as the ship atl'ordcd, and such as tho wretches that had been so long
his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this, he called aloud to the boat, ond
bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the govemor ; and, indeed, it was n
present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away along with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still, and they were to go without
me. First, he had brought me a also of bottles full at excellent cordial waters, six
,lmgo bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts Inch), two pounds of
excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of was, and about a. hundredweight of biscuit; he also brought mo
a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice,
and abundance of other things. But besides these, and wlmt was :1 thousand timm
more useful, he brought me .six new clean shirts six very good neckclotlug two pair
of gloves, one pair of sheen, I hat, and one pair of stockings, and it very good suit
of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a, word, he clothed
me from head to feet. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may
imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was anything in the world of that kind
so unpleasmt, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to war such clothes at their first
putting on.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were brought into
my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we
had ; for it was worth considering whether we might venture to take them away with
us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last degree ; and the mptain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no
obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, ms malefnctonr, to be
delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come at; and I found that
the captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired
it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request
that he should leave them upon the island. " I should be very glad of that," says the
captain, " with all my heart." " Well," says I, " 1 will send for them up, and talk with

' . them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages for they were new discharged,

their comrades having performed their promise ; I say, I caused them to go to the ave,
and bring up the live men, pinioncd as they were, to the bower, and keep them there
till I came. After some time, I came thither dremed in my new habit ; and now I was
called governor again. Being all met, nnd the captain with me, I caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them I had got a full account of their villouous behaviour

" . to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing tooonrmit

further robberies, but that Providence had cusnarcd them in their own ways, and that
they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. I let them know that by
my direction the ship had been seized ; that she lay now in the road ; and they might
see by-and bye that their new captain had received the reward of his villnny, for that
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm ; that, as to them, I wanted to know what
, the - had to say why I should not execute them as pirates, takeu in the fact, as by my
commission they could not doubt but I had authority to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothingto say but this,
that whenflrey were taken, the captain promised them their lira, and they humbly
implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not what mercy to show them; for as
for myself] had resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had taken passagecould not can')' them to England, olhe!' than as prisoners in irons, to be tried
for mutiny, and running away with tho ship; the consequence of which, they
nnlst need>>! know, would be the gallows ; so tlmt I could not tell what was the
beat for them, unlefi they had a mind to take their fate in the island. If they
dosiml that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it, I had some inclination to
give them their lives if they thought they could shift on shore. They seenml
Very thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture tostay there
than be carried to England to be hanged. So I lefl: it on that inane.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he din-st
not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with the captain, and
told him that they were my prisoners not his; and, that seeing I had offered
them so much favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if he did not
think fit to wnsent to it, I would act them at liberty, as I found them ; and if
he did not like it, he might. take them again if he could catch them. Upon
this, they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and

bade them retire into the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would
18;lave them some fins-(Irma, some ammunition, and some directions how they should live i

very well, if they thought fit. Upon this I pnpured to go on bond the lhip; but (old
the captain I would ably tluit night to pmpero my thing, and desired him to go on
board in the mum time, uud keep all right in the ship, and send the boat on shore
next day for me ; onlering him, in the mean time, to tame the new mptuin, who Wu
killed, to be hanged ut the yurd-urm, that these men might see him.

When the explain was gone, I sent for the men up to me in my nlntrtment, nnd '

entered seriously into discourse with them of their circumstances. I told them I
thought they hud undo I: right choice; but if the uptein had curried them away, they
would certninly be hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging at the ynrd-nrm
of the ship, and told them they hml nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stny, I told them I would let
them into the utury of my living there, and put them into the way of mnking it my to
them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the place, and of my coming to
it ; rhowul them my fortifications, the way I nude my bread, planted my com, cured
my grapes; und, in n word, ull that was neoesnry to Innhe them entry. I told them the
atory also of the sixteen Sirinizmhg thnt were to be expected, for whom I lelt u letter,
and made them promise to trout them in common with themselvw.

I lel't them my lire-urn", VIL, live Innsketn, three fowling-piews und three unionist
l Inul above u lnnel and it half" powder lelt; for alter the first year or two I used but
little, and wasted none. I gave them it description of the Way I Imtnugcd the goats,
and dimetioms to milk and fatten them, and to make both butter and chum. In a word, I
give them every part of my story; uud told them I should prevail with the atptuin
to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, und some garden-<<nabs, which I told them
I would have been very glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of pen; which the e-ptein
hud brought me to mt, und hudo them be sure loaow mid inoraue them.

Having done all thin, I left the next day, und went on board the ship. \Ve
prepared immediately to soil, but did not weigh that night. The next morning early,
two of the five men came swimming to the ship's side, nnd mode the meet lamentable
complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship for God's nuke, for they
should he Innrdewd, und begged the captain to take them on board, though he hunged
them immuliutely. Upon thin, the mptnin pretended to have no power without me;
but nflersome dillieulty, end alter their solemn promises of amendment, they wen! taken
on board, end were, some time utter, soundly whipped uud pickled ; utter which they
pmved very honest and quiet fellows.

Some time allow this, I went with the hunt on show, the tide being up, with the
things promised to the men; to which the euptuin, at my intemaesion, mine-d their
cheeks and clothes to be added, which they kick, and were very thunkful for. I also
cucumugud them, by telling them, that if it lay in my way to send any vessel to take
them in, I would not forget them.

Iiareo longo from among the Moors of Sallee. I n thin vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived
in England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five yearn absent.

When I came to England, I was a perfmt stranger to all the. world, as if I had
never been known there. dIy benefactor and faithful steward, \lequ I had hm. mv
money in trust with, was alive, but had had great mixfortuum in the world ; was
become a widow the second time, and very low in the world. I made. her may as to
what she owed me, mlring her I would give her no trouble ; but, on the contrary, in
gratitude for her former care and faithtillneea to me, I relieved her an my little sack
would nflord ; which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do but little for her : but
I matured her I would never forget her former kindnmtome; nor did I forget her when
I had sufficient to help her, as shall be olmerved in its place. I went down after-
warda into Yorkshire; but my fitther was dead, and my mother and all the family
extinct, except that I found two nialoro, and two of the children of one of my brothers ;
and as I luul been long ago given over for dead, there had been no pmvixiou made for
me ; xo that in a word, I found nothing to relieve or anoint me ; and that little money
I had would not do much for me an to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not exlmc't; and this was, that
the master of the nhip, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the name means; saved
the ship mul cargo, having given a very haudxome account to the owner-a, of the manner
how I had saved the lives of tho men, and the ship, they invited me to meet them and
name other merchants concerned, and all together made mea very handsome compliment
upon the anbject, and a present ofnlmoat PS200 sterling.

But after making aevernl reflectioua upon the circumstancea of my life, and how
little way thin would go towardn settling me in the world, I manlvql to go to Lixbon,
and see if i might not come by some information of the Mate of my plantation in the
Brazihr, and of what was become of my partner, who, I had reason to summer, lrml some
yearn now given me over for dend. "With this view I tool: nhipping for Liabou, when: I
arrived in .April fidlowing ; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these
ramblinga, and proving a moat fitithl'ul aervant upon all ooenaiona. "'hen I came to
Liabon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular natinfnetion, my old friend, the

. captain of the ship, who finlt took me up at sea ofl' the. ahove of Africa. He was now
grown old, and had left the am, having put his son, who was for from a young man,
into his ship, and who still lined the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me;
and indeed, I hardly know him. llut I soon brought myself to hin remembrance, when
I told him who I was.

After some pantienate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I inquired,
you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old man told mo he had not
been in the Ilmzils for about nine yearn; but that he could mum me1 that when he
cuno away my partner was living ; but the trustees, whom I had joined with him to
take mgnimnee of my part, were both dual ; that, however, he believed that I would have
a very good account of the improvement of the plantation ; for that, upon the general
belief of my being east away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the
produce of my part of the plantation to the proeumtor-fiaml, who had appropriated it, in
case I never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and twothinlx to the monastery of
St. Auguatine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the
Indians to the Catholic faith ; but that, if I annual, or any one for me, to claim the
inheritance, it would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual production,
being distributed to charitable uses, could not be watered ; but he mud me that the '
xtewerd of the king's revenue from lamb, and the providers, <<mm of the monastery,
had taken glut care all along that the incumbent, that is to my, my partner, gave every
year a faithful account of the produce, of which they had received duly my moiety. I
asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought the plantation, and
whether he thought it might be worth looking idler ; or whether, on my going thither,
I should meet with any obstruction to my Imaging myjuat right in the moiety. He
told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation wav improved ; but thin
he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but ouc-hnlf of
it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of my part,
which was, it seem>>, granted away to aome other monastery or religion: house, amounted
to above two hundred Iuoidum n ymr: that an to my being restored to nquiet pomiou
of it, there wax no queation to be made of that, my partner being alive to witnua my
title, and my name being also enrolled in the regixtcr of the country ; alto he told me
that the anrvivorx of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy ;
and he believed I would not only have their mixtnuce for putting me in lumiou, hut
wonhl find u very musiderablc sum of money in their hands for my account, being the
pmduee of the farm while their ficthcm hold the trust, ulul before it was given up, an

1 showed myselfu little concerned and uuuuy at this account, and inquired of the
old captain how it unuo to pins that the truateu should than diaponc of my efl'ectv, when
he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my
universal heir, th't'.

lie told me that was; true; but that as there WM no proof of my being dead, he
could not act as executor, until some certain necountahould come of my death ; and that
besides, he was not willing to interlncddlo with a thing so remote ; that it was true he
had registered my will, and put in his claim ; and could he have given any account of
my being dead or alive, he would have acted by proenrntiou, and taken possession ofthe
iugeaio (so they call the augnr-houae), nud hove given hia nun, who was now at the
Brnzilx ordem to do it. "But," mya the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the mt ; and that is, believing
yon were lost, and all the world believing so also. your partner and truatoea did ofl'er to
account with me, in your name, for the lint aix or eight years' profits, which I received.
There being at that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building an
ingenic, and buying xlavea, it did not amount to near so much unherwnnls it produced :
however," says the old mall, " I shall give you a true account of what I hove received in
all, and how I have dixpoaed of it."

After a. few dayx' further conference with this ancient friend, he brought me an
account of the firxt six yeah? income of my plantation, signed by my partner and the
merclmut-truatees, being alwayx delivered in goody viz, tobacco in roll, and sugar in
chests, besides ram, molest-s, the, which is the consequence of a augnr-work ; and I
found by thia account, that every ymr the income consider-ably increased ; but, as above,
the disbursementv being large, the 55qu at first wnaamall ; however, the old nianlet me see
that he wax debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidorea of gold, buideuixty chest:
of sugar, and fifteen double roll: of tobacco, which were lost in hisahip ; he hnvingbeen
shipwrecked coming home to Liabou, about eleven yenm after my leaving the place.
The good man then began to complain of hit misfortunes, and how he had been obliged
to make use of my money to recover hia hues, and buy him a share in a new abip.

" However, my old friend," says he, " you shall not want a supply in your necuaity;
188 '
and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully ntisficd." Upon this he pulls out an
old pouch, and given me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold ; and giving '
me the writings of his title to the ahip, which his son was gone to the Brazil: in,ofwhieh
he was quartenpart owner, and his son another. he puts them both in my hand: for
smrrity of the rent.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindnem of the poor man to be able
to hear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had taken me
up ntsea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions, end particularly how
sincere a friend he Wm! new to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he had
midtome; therefore, first, I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so
much money at that time, and if it would not atraiteu him 1 He told me he could not
say but it might straiten him a little ; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more then he.

Everything the good man said was full of ctl'ection, and I could hurdly refrain from
tars while he spoke; in nhort, I took one hundred of the moidoree, and culled forapen
and ink to give him a receipt for them : then I returned him the rest, and told him if
ever I had possession of the plnutotion I would return the other to him also (as, indeed,
I adorn-ands did); and that an to the hill of rule of his part in his son's ship, I would
not take it by any mama ; but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honart enough
to pay me ; and it' I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect I
would nor-er have a penny more from him.

When this was past, the old nmuhegau to ask me if he should put me into a method
to make my claim to my plantation I told him I thoughttogo over to it myself. He
said I might do so if I pleaacd ; but that, if I did not, there were wuys enough to
men my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use : and as there
were Ihipu in the river of Lisbon just ready to goawny to Brazil, he made me enter
my nnme in n puhlic register, with his aflidavit, ut'u'rming, upon oath, that I was alive,
and that I m the same person who took up the land for the planting the raid
plantation at first. This being regularly attested by a notary, and a proeuntion amazed,
he directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance

, at the place; and then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the
return.

Never vras anything more honourable than the pmceedinga upon this procuratiou;
for in less than seven months I received a large packet from the survivor: of my trustees,

the merchants. for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following particular
loam and papers incloacd.

First, there was the awonnt-cumnt of the produce of my farm or plantation, from
the year when their Either had balanced with my old Portugal captain, being for xix
years; the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores
in my fiwonr.

Secondly, there was the account of four ymra more, while they kept the efl'ects in
their hands, before the government claimed the administration, as being the efl'octs ot'a
person not to be found, which they celled civil death ; and the balance of this, the value
of the plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six
crusadou. being about three thonaand two hundred and forty moidora.

Thirdly, there was the Prior of the Angustines' account, who had received the profits
for above fourteen years; but not being to account for wlmt was disposed 0: by the _
hospital, very honestlydeelsred he lad eight hundred and seventy-two moiderea notdistributed, which he acknowledged to my account : as to the king's part, that refunded
nothing.

There was also n letter of my partner's, congratulating Inc very afl'ectiormtel y upon my
being alive, giving me an account how the ash-to was improved, and what it produced a
yan- ; with the particulars of the number of squares or acres that it contained, how

planted, how many slaves there were upon it : nnd making two-and-twenty crosses for ' "

"Wings, told me he had said so many Ans Maria; to thank the Elma-d Virgin lhnt I
was alive ; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession ofmy own ; and,
in the mean time, to give him orders to whom he should deliver my efl'ects, if I did not
come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family ;
and sent me, as a, present, seven lino leopard! skins, which he luul, it seems, received
from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and which, it seenns had made
a better voyage tlmn I. He lent me also five chests of excellent swoctmcnts, and a
hundred pieces of gold nncoined, not quite so large as moidom. By the same llcot, my
two merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chats of sugar, eight
hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well my now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than the begin-
ning. It is impossible to express the flutteriugs of my very heart when I looked over
these letters, and expecially when I found ull my wealth about me; for as the Brazil
ships come all in fleets, the some ship; which inought my letters brought my goods:
and tho efl'eets were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand. In a
word, I turned pale, and grow sick; and, had not the old man run and {etched Inc a
cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon

the spot : nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some houns till a physician _ 4:

being sent for, and something of the real muse of my illness being known, he ordered
me to let blood; after which I had relief, and grow well : but I verily believe, if
I had not been eased by the vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died.

I was now master,all on a sudden, of above fifty thorumnd pounds sterling in money,
and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brnzils, of above I thoumnd pounds a
year, as sure as an estate of lnnds in England : and, in a word, I was in a condition
which I woo knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment
of. The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old
captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the beginning,
and honest to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent to me ; I told him that,
next to tho providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was owing to him ; and
that it now lny on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first
returned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him ; then I sent for a notary
' and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the four hundred and
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmcst
manner possible. Alter which, I caused a procnration to be drawn, empowering him to
be the receiver of the annual profits of my plantation; and appointing my partner to
account him, and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and
by a clause in the end, made a, grant of one hundred moidores a ymr to him during his
life, out of tho efl'ecta, and tiny moidores a year to his son after him, tbr his life: and
thus I reqnited my old mam

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do with the
estate that Providence had thus put into my hands ; and indeed, I had more care upon
myliead now than I had in my ailentststooflifcin theislnnd, whereI wented nothing
but what I had, nml had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I had now a gmt
charge upon me, and my business was how to meme it. I had not a care now to hide
my money in. or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy
and tarnished before anybody wouhl meddle with it; on the contrary, Iknew not where
to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest,
and that was the only refuge I had. In the next place, my ink-mt in the Brazil:
waned to summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither
till I had erttled my atl'airs, and left my effect: in some safe hands behind me. At first
I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to
me ; but then rho mm in young and but poor, and, for might I knew, might be in debt ;
so that, in a word, 1 had no way but to go back to England myself. and take my effects
with me.

It was some months, however, before [resolved upon this ; and therefore, as I had
rewarded the old captain fully, and to hix sitinfaetion. who had been my former bene<<
factor, so I began to think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first bene-
factor. nml rho, while it was in her power, my faithful steward and instnretor. So, the
lint thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London,
not only to [my a bill, but to go lind her out, and carry her, in money, allundred pounds
from me, nml to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should,
if I lived, have a further supply 2 at the Sum! time, I sent my two shit/era in theconntry
a hundred pounds arch, the ' being. though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
aurncm; one having been married and left a widow ; and the other having a husband
not so kind to harm; ho ahonld be. But, among all my relations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durut commit the gross of my stock, that I
might go away to the Bmzilx, and leave things safe behind me; and this greatly per
plexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have aettled myself there, for I
was, as it were. nntnmlisod to the place ; but I had some little scrnploin my mind about
religion, which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall any more pl't-sently. How-
ever, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the present; and as I had
made no scruplo of being openly of the religion of the country all the while I was
'i , among them, so neither did 1 yet ; only that, now and then, having of la'. ~thonght more
ofit than formerly, uhen I began to think of living and dying among them, I began
to regret my haring professul myselfa Pnpixt, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the
Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my effects behind me; so I
molved at last to go to England with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should
make some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful to me; and,
accordingly, I prepared to go to England with all my werdth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet being just
going away) resolved to giro answers suitable to the just and faithful account of things
I had from thence; and, first, to the Prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter full of
thanks for his just darlings, and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moi-
dorea which were nndisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct;
desiring the good padre's prayem for me, and the like. I wrote next a letter of thanks
to my two trustees, with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty
called for: as for sending them any present, they were far above having any occasion
of it. Instly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the improving the
plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stool: of the works; giving him instruc-
tions for his future government of my part, according to the powers I had left with my
old patron, to whom I desired him to send whstnrer became due to me, till he should
hear from me more Inrticnlnrly ; wuring him that it was my intention not only to
come to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my file. To this I added
o very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for such
the captain's so" informed me he had ; with two pieca of fine English brv ad cloth, the
best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces of block baits, and some Flanders lace of a good
value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my efi'ects into good
bills of cxehnnge, my next difliculty was which way to go to England : I had been
accustomed enough to the see, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to England bysce
at that time; and though I could give no reason for it, yet the difliculty incmsed upon
me so much, thut though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered
my mind, and that not once, but two or thr'ec times.

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and that might be one of the reasons;
but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment :
two of the ships which I had singled out to go in--I mean, more lair-ticulnrly singled out
than any other--having put my things on heard one of them, and in the other having
agreed with the captain; I my two of these ships miscarried; viz, one was Men by
the Alger-ins, and the other wascast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people ~
drowned, except three ; so thut in either of these vessels I had been made miserable, in . ' '
which most, it was hard to say.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I communicated
everything, pressed inc earnestly not to go by see, but either-to go by land to the Groync,
and cross over the Bay of Biscuy to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by hmd to Paris, end so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, nndsoall
', the wny by land through France. In a word, I was so prepoaecesed against my going
by sea nt all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land ;
which, as I was not in hate, and did not value the charge, was by much the pleasantsr
vmy: and to make it more so, my old clptnin brought an English gentleman, the son

of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked

up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the lost I
going to Paris only; so that in all, there were six of us, and five servants; the two
merchants and the two Portuguese contanting themselves with one servant between
two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as o
servant, besides my man Friday, who was womuch e strange-rte hceapablo oI'supplyiug
the place of a servant upon the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company being very well mounted
and anued, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour to all ma captain,
as well because I was the oldwt man, air because I had two servants, and, indeed, was
the origin of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble you now
with none of my land journals ; but some adventures thst hoppencd to usin this tedious
and dificnlt journey I must not omit. _

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers>> to Spain, were willing toWE CHANGE OUR ROUTE.

stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth observing ; but, it being
the latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the
middle of October; but when we come to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at
several towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the French
'side of the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to Parnpoluna,
after having attemme at an extreme hamrd to pass on.

\Vhen we came to Pumpelnna itself; we found it so indeed; and to me, thathad
been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could smrce bear any
clothes on, the cold was insufferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than it was
surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the weather was not
only warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrcncan Mountains
so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger bonunrbing and
[wishing of our fingers and hes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered with snow,
and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in his life. To mend the
matter, after we came to Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much violence. and
so long, that the [maple said winter was come before its time; and the roads, which were
difficult before, were now quite impamble; in a word, the snow lay in some places
too thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern
countries, there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every step.
\Vc stayed no less than twenty days at Pampcluna; when (seeing the winter coming on,
and no likelihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe
that had been known in many years) I proposed that we should go away to Font-
srabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while
I was considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopme
on the French side of the trusses, as we were on the Spanish, had found outagnide, who,
traversing the country near the head of IAngucdoc, had brought them over the mountains
by such ways that they were not much incommodcd with the snow ; for whom they met
with snow in any qrumtity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their
horses. "'c sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same
way, with no hmrd from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect our-
selves from wild beasts ; for, he said, in these great snows, it was frequent for some
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want
of food, the ground being covered with snow. \Vc told him we were well enough
prepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insureusfronr a kind of two-legged
wolves, which, we are told, we were in most danger from, especially on the French side
of the mountains. He satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentle.
men, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to
go, and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluns with our guide, on the 15th of November;
and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instmd of going forward; he aune directly back with
us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles; when, having
passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm
climate again, where the country we pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a
sudden, tuning to his left, he approached the mountains another wsy ; and though it
is true the hills and precipim looked dreadful, yet he made so runny tours, such
meanders, and 'ed as by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the
mountains without being much encumbered with the now ; and all on a sudden, he
nhowed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of Longuedoc and ("resoony, all gmn and '
flourishing, though, indeed, they were at a great diatnnce, and we had Mme rough \ ,
way to pen! atill. "- i

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it moved one whole day and a l 4'
night m fast that we could not tmvel ; but he bid as he guy; we should soon be post "I
it all : we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more north '
than before ; and no, dulwuding upon our guide, we went on.

it w:u nluait two hour: before night, when, our guide beingaoniethiuglmfnm Ins and d
not juxt in xight, out rushed three monstrous wolves and after them u hear, from a
hollow way adju ing to a thick wood ; two of the wolvei flew upon the guide, and, had
he been far before nxs he would have been devoured before we could have helped him ;
one of them faxtcued upon his horse. and the other attacked the man with such violence
that he had not time or pru'cnco of mind enough to draw hie pixtol, but hullooed and
cried out to us most luatily. My man Friday being next Inc, I bade him ride up, and
see what wau the matter. As noon on Friday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out
as loud as theother, "0h,muster! 0h, master 3" but like ahuhl fellow, redo directly up to
the man, and with his pistol allot the wolfthat attacked him in the head.

It was happy {or the poor man that it was my man Friday; for. having been mud
to much creatures in his country, he had no fear upon hilu, but went close up to him and
idiot him ; whereas, any other of us would have fire'l at a further distance, and have
perhaps either misied the wolf, or endangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrilied a bolder man than I ; and, indeed, it alarmed
all our mmlmuy, when, with the noise of Friday's piatol, we heard on both sides the moat
dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to no as if there had been a prodigious number of them ; and perhaps there
wan not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension ; however, as Friday had
killed this wolf, the other that had flattened upon the horse left him innumliotely, and
fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his hood, when the
hum-sof the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man was most hurt ; for the raging

: creature had hit him twice, once in the arm, and the other limo a little above his knee;

he wusjuxt, as it were, tumbling down by the disorder of his home, when Friday came
up and :dlot the wolf.

It is may to xuppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all mended our pee, and
rode up as fut as the way, which was very difficult, would give us leave, to ace whotvroe
the matter. As soon as we came clear of the trees which blinded us before, we saw
plainly what had been the cue, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though
we did not pimutly dim-m what kind of creature it was he had killed.

But never was a. tight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner, as that

. which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were

surprised and afraid for him, the granted diverxion iumgiuuble. As the bear is a heavy,
eluuuly creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, which is swift and light, no he has
two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions; first," to men,
who are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they first attack
him, unit-aw he be exmively hungry, which it is probable might now he the ease, the
ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle
with you ; but then you must take care to be very civil to him. and give him the road,it you are really afraid, your best way in to look another way and keep going on ; {or

sometimes ifyou stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an -
' sfl'ront ; but if you throw or tog anything at him, and it hits him, though it were bate

bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an sfl'ront, and sets all other business
. aside to punue his re\ enge, and will have sntisfirctioa in point of honour--tint is his
first quaiity: the next is, that if he he once afl'ronted, he will never leave you, night or
<<lay, till he has had his revenge, but follow at a good round rate till he overtakes you.

My man Friday had deliI' ercd our guide, and when we came up to him, he was
helping him oil from his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, and indeed
the last more than the first, when on a sudden we espied the baIr come out of the
wood, and a mat, monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I new. We
were all a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy
to no joy and courage in the fellow's countenance : " Oh, oh, oh 1" says Friday, three
times, pointing to him; "0h, master! you give me to leave, me ahalree to hand with
him ; me makeo you good laugh." '

I was surprised to see the fellow so planed: " You foo " said I, " he will eat
you IIp."--" Eotee me up! eatee nu up!" says Friday, twice over again; "me eatee
him up ; me makes you good laugh ; you all stay here, me show you good laugh." So
down he sits and gets his boots 06' in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (us we call
the flat-shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his
horse, and with his gun away he flew, sII-il'tlike the wind.

The hear was walking soltly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till Friday
coming pretty near, mills to him, as if the bear could understand him, " Hark ye, hark
yo," mys Friday, " me xpeokee with you." We followed ata distance, for now being come
down to the Gsseony side of the mountains, we were entered a unit, great forest, where
the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here
and there. Friday, who had, as we say , the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly,
and took up a gruIt stone, and thva it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did
him no more harm than if he had thrown it sgninsto wall; but it answered Friday's
end, for the rogue was so void of fair that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,
and show as some laugh, as he called it. As soon' as the bear felt the stone, and saw
him, he turns shout, and comes after him, taking very long strides, and shaming on ata
<<image rate, so as would have put a horee to a middling gallop ; sway runs Friday, and
takes his course as ifhe ran towards us {or help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon
the bear, and deliver iny man ; though I was angry at him heartily for bringing thehesr
hack upon us, when he was going about his own barium another way ; and specially I
was angry that he had tux-nod the bear upon ussnd then run away ; and I called out,
" You dog! " said I, "is this your making us laugh i Come away, and take your horse, that
we may shoot the creature." He heard me, and cried out. " No shoot, no shoot; stand
still, you get much laugh ;" and as the nimble creature run two feet for the beast's
one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great oek~tree fit for his
purpose, he beckoned us to follow; and doubling his pace, he got nimhly up the tree,
laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the
tree. The hear-soon come to the tree, and we followed st a distance ; the first thing he
did, he stopped at the gun, smelled at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree,
climbing like a out, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought
it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear
getupthetmqweallrodeneartohim.FRlDAY AFFORDS US SOME DIVERSlON.

\Vhen we esme to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small and of a large limb
of the tree, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the bear got out to that
'purt where the limb of the tree wns weaker--" Ha !" says he to us, " now you see me
tencheo the bear dance ;" so be begun jumping and shaking the bongh, at which the
bear began to tatter, but stood still, and began to lool: behind him, to see how he should
get back 5 then, indeed, we did laugh harrtily. But Friday had not done with him by
a greet deal ; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him ugnin, us if he had
suppowd the bear could speak English, " What, you no come farther? pray you come
farther ; " so he left jumping nnd shaking the bongh ; and the beer, just as if ho had
understood what he said, did come 9. little farther ; then he begun jumping again, and
the beer stopped agniu. \Ve thought now was a good time to knock him on the head, and
called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the bear ; but he cried out earnestly,
" 0h, pray ! oh, prey .' no shoogme shoot by and then ;" he would have said hy-and-by:
However, to shorten the story, Friday dnncedsomuehmnd the bear stood so ticklish, that
we had laughing enough indetxl, but still could not inmgine what the fellow would do ; for
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear ofl' 5 and we found the hear was too
cunning for thnt too ; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung
fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be
the end of it, and what the jest would beat lust. But Friday put us out ofdenbt quickly :
for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come
any further, " Well, well," my: Friday, " you no come thrther, me go 3 you no come to
me, me come to you ; " and upon this he went out to the smaller end of the bough
where it would bend with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding down
the bongh till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his
gun, took it up, and stood still. " \Vell," said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now 3
Why don't you shoot himt"--" No shoot," my: Frithiy, " no yet; me shoot now, me
no kill; me stay, give you one more lunghz" and, indeed, so he did, as you will see
presently ; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came buck from the bough
where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree ; then, with the same hinder end fore-
most, he come down the tree, grasping it with his clnws, and moving one feet at a
time, very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind feet
upon the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into
his ear, and shot him dead as n stone. Then the rogue turned about to see if we did
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he began to laugh very
loud. "So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. "So you kill them. " says 1 ;
" why, you have no guns"--" No," say: he, " no gun, but shoot great lunch long
arrow." This was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a. wild place, and our
guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew ; tho howling of wolvu run
much in my head ; end, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have mid something already, I never heard anything that filled me with so
much horror.

These things, nod the approach of night, called us off, or else, us Friday would have
had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous cmture off, which
was worth saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so
we left him, and went forwnrd on our journey. '

The ground was still covered with now, though not so deep and dangerous as on the
mountains ; and the ravenous croutons u we heard afterwards, were come down into
the format and plain country, proceed by hunger, to melt {or food, and had done a great
deal of mischief in the villages, where they nurpriaed the country people, killing a great
ma :y of their sheep and homes, and some people too. "'0 had one dangerous place to
poem, and our guide told us it' there were more wolves in the country we should find
them there; and this was a mnall plain surrounded with woodmnovery aide, and a long
narrow defile, or lane, which we were to palm to get through the wood. and then we
nlluullluolllc to the village when- we were to lodge. It was within half an hour of
sunset when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain :
we met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood
which was not above two liu'lung: over, we saw five great wolves cm the road, full
apt-ed, one otter another, as if the id been in chase or some prey, and had it in view ;
they took no notice of nzs and were gone out of sight in a few momcntit. Upon this,
our- guide, who' by the way, was but a mint-hearted fellow, bid "I! keep in a manly
pmturv, for he believed there were more wolves a-oulniug. \Ve kept our arms ready
aml our eyes about us; but we saw no more \volree till we came through that wood,
which was near halfa. hugne, and eaten-d the plain. As soon as we mine into theplain,
we had occasion enough to look about us: the tint object we met with was a dead
hum: , that is to say a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of
lln'ln at Work, we could not any ta mg him, but picking his bones rather; for they had
eaten up all the Iluzdt betiv . "'1: did not think [it to disturb them at their feast,
neither did they t nnteh notice ot~ us. Friday would have let fly at them, but I
would not antl'er him by any mmua; for I found we were like to haro more htusinos
upon our hand: than we wr-re aware of. "Fe had not gone half over the plain, when
we lwgan to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and
pnw-ntly after we :<<nw about a hundred coming on directly toward: ua. all in a body,
and aunt of them in a line, as regularly as an nnuy drawn up by experienced oflieent.

had not lived, xhould stand ready to give them a almond volley immediately, it' they
continued to advance upon us ; and then that those who had fired at fimt, should not
pretend to load tln-ir filst't'.' ag: i, but etand ready, every one with a pistol, for we wero
all armed with a fiisee and a pair ot'piatola each man ; so we were, by this method, able
to tile <<iv volleyzs hall'ol' In at a little : however, at prezeent We had no net-<<xiii ; {0"
upon in ug the first volley. the enemy made a full soup, being terrified as well with the
noise as vith the tire. Four of them being xhot in the head, dropped ; aeveml others
were wounded, and went bleeding 011', us we could see by the snow. I found they
stop] ed, but did not inn -diatel_v netreat; where-ulna, remembering that I had been
told that the iiL'm'nb emitun'e were terrilit-d at the voice of a man, I trained all the
eomluouy to halloo tut loud ax we could ; and [ l'ouud the notion uotnlthethcrmistaken ;
for upon our ahout thev bega to retin- and turn about. I then onlercdawcoud volley
to be tired in their mu, who-h put them to the gallop, and away tl 'y n'entto the woods.
This gave in leisure to charge our pieces again ; and that we might lose no time, we
kept going ; but we had but little more than loaded our fumes, and put onmlvcx in
readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the stone wood on our let}, only that it mu
farther onward, the ' no way we were to go.

The night was eomi gen, and the light begun to be dusky, which made it the worse on
our side 3 but the noise iucmuiug, we could easily perceive that it was the howling and
yelling of those hellish ereaturea- and, on n sudden, we perceived two or three troops
of wolvea, one on our left, one behind in, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them: howmer, as they did not MI upon us, we kept our nay forward,
as that as no could make our horses go, which, the way being \en rough, was oulya
good hard trot. In this manner, we came in flow of the entrance of a wood, through
which we were to parts, at the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised
when, coming nearer the lane or pang we new a confused number of wolves standing
just at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise
of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a home, with a saddle and n bridle on him,
flyinglike the wind, und sixteen or seventeen wolieu other him full speed. Indeed,
the home had the ad\ outage of them , but as we summed that he could not hold it at
that late, on doubted not but they uould get' up with him at loot: and no question
but they did.

But here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the entrance where the
horse come out. we found the care-rues of another horse and of two men, devoured by
the ravenous creatures ; nnd one of the men was no doubt the some whom we heard
lire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the man, his head and
the upper part of his body wen: eaten up. This filled In; with horror, and We knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved us won, for they gathered about un
preacntly, in hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. It
happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little
way from it, there luy some large timber'treeg which had been cut down the xummer
before, and I suppose lay then: for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those
trees, und placing onIsclvcs in a line behind one long tree, I advised than all to alight,
and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three frontu,
incloaing our horses in the centre. "'0 did so, ond it was well we did ; for never was
a more furious charge than the cream": made upon us in this place. They came on us
with n growling kind of n noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I mid, was
our breuxtwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and thin fury of theirs, it
seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our homes behind us, which was the
prey they aimed at. I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man ; and they
took their aim so sure that indeed they killed seveml of the wolves at the first volley ;
but there was a necesrity to keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils those
behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired a recond volley of our fuxilx, we thought they stopped a little,
and I hoped they would have gone oil', but it was hutamoment, for other: come forward
again ; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings we had
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again.
I was loth to spend ourlnst shot too hastily ; so I called my servant--not my man Friday,
for he was better employed, for, with the gmtest dexterity imaginable, he had charged
my fusee and his own while we were <<rowed--<<hut, as I said, I called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber,
and let itboolnrge train. He did so, and had but just time to get nwoy, when the
u'olVes came up to it, Illlll some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close
to the powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the timber were scorched with it, >

drew back a little ; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and
after that we gave a shout ; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately
upon near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to cutting
them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the crying and howling they
made was better understood by their fellow: ; so that they all fled and tell ua

"'c had, first and last, killed about three-score of them, and had it been daylight we
had killed many more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we made forward again,
for we had still near a league to go. "'c heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in
the wood>> as we went several times, and sometimex we fancied we snv some of them _:
but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. So in about an hour more we came
to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, and all ill
arms ; for, it seems, that the night before, the wolves and some bears had broke into the
village, and put them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard night and
day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and indwd their people.

The next moniing our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much with the
mnkling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther ; so we were obliged to take a
new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant
country, and no xnow, no wolves, nor anything like them ; but. when we told our story
at Toulouse, they told us it Was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at
the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay an the ground; but they in-
quired much what kind ot'a guide we had got, who would venture to bring us that way
in such a severe sermon, and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured \Vhen
we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blanu-d us
exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the
sight of the homes which made the wolves so furious, . *ing their prey, and thatnt other
times they are really afraid ofa gun ; but being cxcmively hungry, and raging on that
accolmt, the eagernesw to come at the homes had made them senaelm of danger; and
that if we had not by the continued fine, and at last by the xtramgem ot' the train of
powder, mastered them, it had been gmit oddx but that we had been turn to piece! ;
whereas had "'0 been content to have rat still on hoiselmck, and fired as horsemen, they

' j _ Would not have taken the homes so much for their own, when men were on their backs,

nsotherwisc; and, withal, they told nx that at last, if we had stood all together, and
left our homes, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might
have come oil'safe, especially having our firearms in our hands, and being so many in
number. For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life ; for. seeing above
three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour no, and having nothing
to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall
never care to cram thou mountains again ; I think I would nmch rather go a thousand
leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my lnlssage through France--nothing
but what other travellers have given an account of with much more advantage than I Y
can I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any considerable stay came to
Cabling and landed safe at Dover the ch of J nnuary, alter having a seven cold
mama to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had ina little time all my new

fancying, upon aome extraordinary circumstances that they see them, talk to them,and
any annwered by them, when, in truth, there in nothing but shadow and vapour in the
thing, and they really know nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to thin hour whether there are any such thinga an real
apparition", apoctm or walking of people after they are dead; or whether tlu-re in
anything in the atoriet they tell an of that kind more than the product of vapours, rick
mindxg and wondering fancies; but this I know, that my imagination worked up to
such a height, and brought me into aueh exem of vapoura, or what else I may call it,
that l aclually supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old eaatle, behind the trot-a ;
mw my old Spaniard, Frirhry'a father, and tho reprobato sailors I left upon the inland ;
nay, I fancied I lalked with thorn, and looked at them steadily, though I wan lm-ad
awake, as at personajust before me; and this I did till 1 often frightened myu-lf with
the image! my fancy repreat-nted to me. One time, in my sleep, I had the villnny ofthe
three pirate nail-Ira aolively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday"): father, that
it was surprising ; they told me how they barlmroualy attempted to murder all the
Spuninrdx, and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpoaoto distresa

and atarvo them ; things that I had never heard of, and that, indeed, were never all of ' '

them true in fact : but it was so warm in my imagination, and no mdiaed to nze, that,
to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was, or would be, tnlo ;
also how I rerouted it. when the Spaniard complained to me ; and how I brought them
to juxliw, tried them, and ordered them all thrve to be hanged. \l'llat there Wu really
in thin shall be soon in its place ; for however I came to form such thingx in my dream,
and what secret convene of rpirits injected it, yet there war, I say, much of it true. I
own that this dream had nothing in it literally and specifically true; but the general
part was so tnnpthe base, villanoua behaviour of these three hardened rogues was
such, and had been so much worse than all I can describe, that the drum had too much
ximilitude of tho fact ; and as I Would afterwards have punished them severely, no, if I
had hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and even should have been justified
' both by the laws of God and man. But to return to my story. In this kind of temper,
.. I lived some years _; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable
diversion, but what had something or other of thin in it ; aothnt my wife, who now my
mind wholly bent upon it, told me very serioualy one night, that aha believed there was
aome secret, powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had dotennined me to go

thither again ; and that she found nothing hindered my going, but my being engaged to ' -

:\ wife and children. She told me that it was true she could not think of parting with
me : but an alto was assured that if she was dead it would be the first. thing I would do;
no, as it aeemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would not be the only
. obstruction ; for, if I thought litand resolved to go [Here she found me very intent
' upon her words, and that! looked very eamestly at her, so that it a little disordered her,
and rho atopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and any out what nhe was goingto
say. But I perceived that her heart was too full, and some team stood in her eyes]
" speak out, my dear," said I ; "am you willing I should go i" "So," says she,
very afl'eclionately, " I am far from willing; but if you are resolved to go," says ahe,
"rather than I would be the only hindrance, I will go with you ; for though I think
it a moat prelmteroua thing for one of your years, and in your condition, yet, if it must
be," mid she, again weeping. "I would not leave you ; for, if it be of Heaven, you must
do it; there is no resisting it; and if Heaven make it your duty to go, He will alao
make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dirpoae of me, that I may not obstruct it."
Thin nfl'octiomtu behaviour of my wife's brought me n littlo out of the vnponra, and
I began to consider whnt I was doing; I corrected my wandering fitncy, and begun to

wlmt my wife had mid of its being on impulnu from Kenyon, nnd that it should be my

of their vice, end heaped up work for sorrow end repentoneo ; end the men of labour ' '7
spent their strength in daily struggling for bread to mint-in the vitol strength they \
lnhoured with; no living in a doily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, And ' i
working but to live, on if daily brood were the only end of wearixonu- life, and n wenri- 'I'
name life the only oeauioa of daily brood. \)

Thin put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the Maud; whom I mfl'ercd
no more corn togmw, Immune I did not not it; and bred no more gootn, her-sum I qul 'i y
no more nor for them ; where the money lay in thodmm-r till it grew mouldy, and lmd ,,
mine the favour to be looked upon in twenty years. '1 i

All these things, had I improved them us I ought to lure done, and no moron and
religion lmd dictated to me, would have taught me to search further than Imman
enjoyment: for a full felicity; and that there was romething which certainly was the
rennin and end of life, mperior to ull the-lo thingn, and which wax either to he [mm],
or at least hoped for, on thin Ride the grave.

Ilut my mge counaellor was gone ; I was: like a ship without a pilot, thnt could only
run afom the wind. My thoughts mu ull nwny again into the old nflitir ; my head was
quite turned with the whinnwya of foreign mlventurea; nml all the pleasnnt, innocent
omunementa of my form, my gnrden, my eottlo, and my fiimily, which before entirely
Immed me, were nothing to me, hnd no relish, and were like music to one that lmano
ear, or food to one that has no mm; in a word, I resolved to leore ofl' housekeeping, let
my form, nud return to London ; and in a few months otter I did no.

When I come to London, I was still an uneasy no I was hofom; I had no relixh for
the place, no mnploymont in it, nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person,
of whom it mny he mid he in perfectly useless in God'a mention, end it in not one

Nothing can be A greater domonotmtion of It future state, and of the existence of on
invisible world, thou the concurrence of second comics with the ideas of things which
we form in our minds, perfectly renewed, and not communicated to any in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how fur my distemper of wondering was returned upon
me, and I knew nothing oi what he hnd in hit thoughteto my, when thnt very morning,
before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every
port of my eimimatonem in my mind, come to thin resolution. thatI would go to Lisbon,
and consult with my old sce-cnptain ; and if it was rotionnl and pmetialhlo, I would go
and see the island nguin, end what was become of my people them. I had pleased

thin. in mines my nephew, as l have mid. with his project of carrying me thither in his
way tothe East Indies.

l paused awhile at hix womb; and looking steadily at him, " What devil," said J,
"sent you on thin unlucky errand Z" My nephew refined as it" he had been frightened,
at tint ; but perceiving that I wax not much diuplmsed with the proposal, he recovered
himself. "I hope it may not he an unlucky proposal, air," any; he; "I dare say you
would be pleased to are your new colony there, when: you once reigned with more
felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the world.'I

In a word, the xehemc hit so exactly with my tmnper, that i: to my, the prelmexxion
l was under, mnl of which I lmve unit! so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he
agreed with the merchants, I would go with him : but I told him I would not promise
to go any farther than my own ixland. """hy, sir," says he, " you don't want tube left
thcrc again, I hope i " " \Vl ," said I, " can you not take me up again on your return i "
He told me it would not be lwilyle to do so ; that the merchants would never allow
him to come that way with n laden ship of such value, it being a month's mail out of his
way, aml might be three or four. " Besides air, if I should nliwarry," said he, " and not
return at all, then you would hej 't reduced to the condition you worein before."

This was very rational ; but we both found out a remedy for it ; which was, to carry
a framed sloop on hoanl the ship, which being taken in piecca, and shipped on board the
ship, might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to curry with an, be set up
again in the island, and finished lit to go to sea in a few days.

I was not long resolving; for, indeed, the inllmrtunitiezs of my nephew joined so
ellbctually with my inclination, that nothing could oppose me. On the other hand, my
wife being dead, nobody concerned thcnlxelveuw much for me ax to persuade me to one
way or the other, except my ancient good friend the widow, who eamestly struggled
with me to mimider my young my way eimumstances, and the medium hamrdn ofa long
voyage; and above all, my young children. But it was all to no purpose; I had an
inwistible desire for the voyage; and I told her 1 thought there was something so
uncouuuou in the impressions I had upon my mind, that it would be a kind of resisting
Providence if I slmulduttempt to stay at home ; alter which she ceased her cxlmstalations,

. and joined with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my
family ull'airs for my absence, and pro ' 'ng for the education of my children,

In order to do this, I made my wi , aml settled the estate I had in such a. manner

for my childlen, and placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and satisfied they
i would havejustiee dune them. whatever might befall inc; and for their education. I left
it wholly to the widow, with n sullicicnt maintenance to hemelf for her care : all which

,. nhe richly desen-ed ; for no mother could have taken more cow in their education, or
-. understixxl it better; and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to mil about the ixginning ol' Januuly, 1694-5 ; and I, with
my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, on the 8th ; lun-ing, besides tlmtaloop, which
I mentioned above, a very mnsidemhle tango of all kinds of necessary things for my
colony ; which, if '. did not find in good condition, I racked to leave 30.

inhabitants, or at least to set on work there, upon my acoonnt, while I stayed, and either
to leave them there or carry them forward, as they should appear willing; puticululy
I curried two uu-pentera, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a coolnr
by tmde, and was alson general mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels,
and hand-mills to grind com, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker ; he also madeanything t':

was true, but that it was our du to do so, us we were fi-Ilnwmniatnn-s; and we would

and aluuulon them to star ,5; and, therefore, I would not let the lulst thing be taken

dillienlty to as, tor that t a ship was bound t: the East ladies; und though we wem
driven out ur mouse In the westward a very great way, and perhaps Were directed by

one I th pantieular aceuunt ; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to
the fix tux, with whom he was under elulflcl' to plastic his voyage by way of Brazil ;
and all I knew we eould do for them was, to put oulselvea in the way of meeting with
other ships home :ml bound from the West Indies, and get them a lxusige, if "willie,

The first part of the pinpungul was so generous and kind, they could not but be very

with home <<hip or sloop that they might hire to carry them hunk tn Canada, from whenee
they came.

I thought this was but I. reasonable request on their part, and therefore I inclined to
agree to it: for, indeed, I considered that to carry this whole company to the East
Indies, would not only he an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be
ruining our whole voyage, by devouring all our pmviaionx; so I thought it no breach of
elIurter-lmrty, but what an unforeseen accident nuule abenlutoly necessary to In, and in
which no one could my we were to bhnne ; for the laws of God and nature would have
forbid that we xhonld refuse to take up two boats full of people in llllcll sdistressed
noudition '. and the nature. of the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people,
obliged na to set them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance. So I consented
that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and quther would permit ; and if
not, thatl would enrry them to Martinieo, in the W'est India.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good ; and as the winds
had continued in the points between NJ'Z and SE. u long time, we nIiIeIed several
opportunities of sending them to ancc; for we met xeveml shilu bound to Europe,
whereof two were French, fmm St. Christopher's ; but they had been so long beating up
ainnnt the wind that they (land not take in Inm-ngew, for fear of wanting provisions for
the voyage, as well for thclnnolves as for them they should takein; so we were obliged to
go on. lt was about a week after this that warned" the Ilnnltsof Newfoundland; when:Y
to shorten my story, we put all our French people on board a bnrque, which they hired
at xea there, to put them on shore, and alterwanlx to carry them to France, if they could
get provisions to I'ictIIal themselves with. "hen I say all the French went on show, I
should remember, that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the Fast
Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be not on shore on the couust of
('ommaudel ; which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very
good reason, as will appear sltorwards ; also four of the women entered themselves on
our ship, and pun-ed very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away 5. and S. by
E. for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind nt all ; when we met
with another subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that
before.

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes north, on the 19th day of March,
1694.5, when we spied a sail, our course SE and by S. "It: soon perceived it was a
large. Iml, and that she bore up to us, but could not at first know what to make of her,
till, utter coming a little nearer, we found the had lost her nInin-topmast, foremost, and
bowxprit; and presently she fired a gun as s. sing of distress. The weather was pretty
good wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and we soon mum to speak with her.

""1: found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had been blown
out of thelroad at Barbodoes a few days before she was ready to sail, by a terrible
hurriutne, while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore ; so that, bmides
the terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent ease for good artists to bring theship
home. They had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible
storm, alter the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge
to the westward, and in which they had lost their masts. They told us they expected to
have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the south-east,
by a strong gale of wind at N.N.\V., the same that blew now : and having no sails to
work the ship with but a main <<mm and a kind of square sail upon a- jury-formant,which they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand
away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost starved for want of .
provisions, beaidm the fatigum they had undergone; their hmd and flesh were quite '
gone; they had not one ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days. The
only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, and they had about half a barrel
of flour left; they had sugar enough ; some sumles, or sweetmeatg they had at firxt,
lnlt they were all devoured ; am] they had seven clerks of rum.

Them was a youth, and his mother, and a maid-servant on board, who were
passengers, and thinking the ehip was imdy to mil, unlmppily eorne on board the
evening before the hurricane began ; and having no provisions of their own left, they
were in a more deplorable condition than the text: for the seamen, being reduced to
xuch an extreme necemity themselves had no compassion, We may be sure, for the poor
)xiawrigeis ; and they were. indeed, in such a condition that their mixer-y is very hard

. to dc<eribe.

I lmd perhaps not known thin part, if my curiosity had not led me (the weather
being fair, and the wind abated) to go on board the ship. The second mate, who upon
thin occision commanded the ship, had been on board our ship, and he told me they
had tlme pasacngers in the great arbin, that were in a deplorable condition : "Nay,"
. \'s he, " I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days:
a rd 1 was afraid to inquire after them," said he, " for I had nothing to relieve them
with."

"'e immediately applied ounwlres to giro them what relief we could were; and,
indeed. I had so far orerruled things with my nephew, that I would have victnalled
them, though we had gone awav to Virginia, or any other part of the emat of
America, to have supplied ourselv ; hut there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating too much, even
of that little we gave them. The male, or commander, bmught six men with him in
his boat ; but these poor wretchcs looked like skeletons, aml were so weak that they
could hardly it to their oars. The mute himself was very ill, and half-starved; for he
declared he rmrred nothing from the men, and went share and sham alike with
them in every bit they ate.

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him immediately; and he had
not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of order; so he stopped
awhile, and Our surgeon mixed him something with some broth, which he said would
be to him both food and physio _: and after he had taken it he grew better. In the
meantime, I forgot not the men; I Snlcrcd rictuala to be given them, and the poor
creatures rather devoured than ate it : they were so exceedingly hungry that they were
in a manner ravenous and had no command of themselves ; and two of them ate with.
so much greediness that they were in danger of their lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's dieters was very moving to me, and brought to mind
what I had a terrible prospect of at. my that coming on shore in my island, where I had
never the lumt mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any ; besides the hourly
apprehensions I had of being nmde the food of other creaturfi. But all the while the
mate Wu tlllls whiting to me the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not
put out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the
great cabin, viz, the mother, her Smyand the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing
of for two or thrw days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected,\x'-

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

their own extremitiis being so great: by which I understood, that they had really
given them no food at all, and that therefore they moat be perished, and be all lying
dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board with his men.
to refreah them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that were left on board :
but ordered my own boat to go on board the ahip, and, with my mate and twelve men,
to carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Onvsurgeon
charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard
in the cook-mun, to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the
pot before it was "'I'" boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a time :
and by this caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise have killed themaelvea
with that very food that new given them on purpose to save their lives.

At the some time, I ordered the nude to go into the great cabin, and see what con-
dition the poor pamngers were in ; and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give
them what refmhrnent was proper: and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with
some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate that wax on board, and which
he did not question would restore them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this: but, as I said above, having a great mind to see the
scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would present are with, in a more lively
manner than I could have it by report, I took the arptuin of the ship, at we now called
him, ,with me, and went myself, a little after, in their boat

I found the poor men on bound almost in a tumult, to get the victnala out of the
boiler before it was ready ; but the mate observed his orders, and kept a good guard at
the cook-room door; and the man he placed there, after using all Imiblo persuasion
to have patience, kept them off by force: however, he wanted some biscuit ealrex to
be dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, which they called lnewis,
and gave them every one some, to stay their stomachs, and told them 1'. war: for their
own surety that he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But it was all
in vain , and had I not come on board, and their own commander and ofiieers with
me, and with good words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe
they would have broken into the cook-room by force, and tom the meat out of the
furnace; for words are indeed of very small furoo to a hungry belly: however, we
pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first, and the next time
gave them more, and at last filled their belliu. and the men did well enough.

But the misery of the poor pamngera in the cabin was of another nature, and
far beyond the vest ; for as, first, the ship's company had so little for themselves, it was
but too true that they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally neglected
them : so that for mix or seven days it might be said they had really no food at all, and
for several days before very little. The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a
woman of sense and good breeding, had spared all she could so afl'cctionately for her
son, that at last she entirely sank under it 5 and when the mate of our ship went in,
she not upon the floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two chairs,
which were lashed fast, and her head hunk between her shoulders, like a corpse,
though not quite dead. My mate mid all he could to revive and e,:eouragc her, and
with a spoon put some broth into her mouth. She opened her lips and lifted up one
hand, but could not speak : yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him,
intimatiug that it was too late for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would have
said they should take care of him. However, the mate, who was exmdingly moved at

I'I'A FEARFUL SCENE.

the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got two
or three spoonfuls down ; though I question whether he could he sure of it or not : but
it was too late, and she died the same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most afl'ectionate mother's life, was
not so far gone; yet. he lay in a cabin bed, <<sane stretched out with hardly any life left
in him. He had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it :
however, being young, and having more strength thun his mother, the mate got
something down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive ; though by giving hiln,
some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and
brought it up again. _

But the next (are was the poor maid : she lay all along upon the deck, hard by her
mistress, and just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and struggled forlife.
Her limbs were distorted ; one of her hands was clasped round the frame of the chair
and she gripped it so hard that we could not easily make her let it go ; her other arm
lny over her head, and her feet lny both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin
table: in short, she ' ., just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she was alive too.

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with the thoughts
of death, but, as the men told us aflerwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress whom
she saw dying for two or three days before, and whom she loved most tenderly.

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for when our surgeon, whowasamun
of very great knowledge and experience, had, with great appliution, recovered her as to
life, he had her upon his hands still; for she was little less than distracted for a con-
sidemhlu time after. I deg

Whoever shall need these memorandums must be desired to consider, that visits at
see are not like ajourney into the country, where sometimes people stay a week or a.
fortnight at a place : ollr husinem was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie
by for them ; and though they were willing to steer the same course with us for some
d3)": yet we could carry no sail, to keep pace with a ship that had no masts: however,
as their captain begged of us to help him to set up a main-topmost, and a kind of top-
most to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were, he by him for three or {our days ; and
"'0". having given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit,
and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we could spare ; and taking three
cesks of sugar, some rum, and some piecmf-eight from them for safisfirction, we left
them, faking on board with us, at their own earnest request, the youth and the maid,
and all their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a pretty, well-bred, modest, and
hermihlc youth, greatly dejected with the lam of his mother, and, as it seems, he had lost his
father but a few months before, at Barbsdoes : he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to
take him out of the ship ; for he said the cruel fellows had murderedhismnther : and,
indeed, so they had, that is to say, passively ; for they might have spared a ml18u "mama
to the poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her life, though it had been but
just enough to keep her alive ; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no
right, and therefore is remorselms, and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would carry him may from
all his friends, and put. him, perhaps, in as bad circumstances almost as those '0 found
him in, that is to any, starving in the world. He said it mattered not whither he went,
if he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was among ; that the captain (by
which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, "Id ~KUIIINSUX CRUSUIE.

me towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a. flag of truce also ; and he not
only did not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that l
was come, till I spoke to him. "Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, " do you not know ,
i me?" At which he spoke not a word, but. giving his musket tothe man that was with
2"" him, threw his arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear,
urme forward and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face
'V- again that ho had once seen as if an angel from Heaven, sent to save his life : he said '1" i
_ nbundanoo of very handsome things, as a well-bred Slamiard always knows how; and i
',f ' then, beckoning to the person that attended him, bade him go and call out his comrades.
I He then asked me if I would wall: to my old habitation, where he would give me
i ii pom" of my own house again, and where I should see they had made but mean im- ll
provements ; so I walked along with him ; but, alas! [could no more find the place again
than if I had never been there; for they had planted so many trout, and placed them in
i such a position, so thick and elosetoone another, and in ten ytnm' time they were grown |

no big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, except by such windings and blind Ways ,
as they themaelves only, who made them, could Lind. '4.

I asked them what put them upon all these fortiliurtions : he told me I Would say ' '
there was need enough of it, when they had given me an aeoount how they had was
their time since their arriving in the island, eslazcially after they had the misfortune to
tind that I was gone. He told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my
good fortune, when he heard thatI was gone in a good ship, and to my satiamction ; and
that he had okentime-s <<strong persuasion that one time or other he should see me again ;
but nothing that ever befoll him in his life, he mid, was so surprising and allliezing to
him at first, as the disappointment he was under when he came back to the island
and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind, and of whom,
~ he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought themselves much butter
' among the snvgea, only that their number was so small: "and," says he, "had they
been strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory ;" and with that he crossed
himself on the breath " But, air," says he, " I hope you will not be displeased when I
shall tell you how, forced by neeunity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, to
disarm them, and make them our subjects, as they would not be content with being
moderately our masters, but would be our murderers" I answered, I was afraid of it
when I lelt them there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that
they were not come back, that I might have put them in lama-alien of everything first,
and left the others in a may of subjection, as they deserved; but if they had reduced

 

 

/ ' them to it, I. was very glad, and should be very far from finding any hinlt with it : for I
knew they were a [air-eel of refractory, ungovernnhle villains, and were (it for any manner
of mischief.

While I was saying this, the nmu enmo whom he lmd sent back, and with him

eleven more. In the dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what nation they

, were of; but he made all clear both to them and to me. First he turned to me, and
" pointing to them, said, "These, air, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to

' you ;" and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was;

i ' upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordinary
g fellows, and the like, but really as if they had been ambaandora or nobleman, and I a
) monarch or great conqueror: their behaviour was, to the last degree, obliging and

:onrteoua, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gmvity,whieh very well become them ;
and, in short, they hnd no much more manners than I, thatlaooreo knew how to receive
their ch" itiat, much lam how to return them in ltind.

The hixlory of their coming to, and conduct in, the inland, otter my going away, iuso
very renmrknhle, and has no many incidents which the former port of my relation will
help to understand, und which will, in moat of the lurtienluu, referto the account I
lnu'v already given, that I cannot but commit them, with great delight, to the reading
of thwe that come after me.

I xhnll no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person, which will put
me to the expi-nw of ten thousand "mid I'a," and "said he'a," and " he toldmo'a," and " I
told him's," and the like ; but I shall collect the foetshistoriuilly, asueer on I am gather
them out of In memory, from what they related to me, and from what I met with in
my conversing with them, and with the place.

In order to do this succinctly, and an intelligibly no I can, I must go back to the
ciltlllnuklurmt in which I let}. the inland, and in which the lmrwnx were of whom I am
to speak. And find, it in necemiry to repeat that I had aent away Friday'n father and
the Slmuinnl (the two whose lives I had rescued from the nitrogen) in n largo canoe to
lhe III n, :m I then tlmught it, to fetch over the Slnliinnl'n compunioun that he hath behind
him, In order to save them from the like calamity that he lmd been ill, and ill onler to
snot-our them for the pnnwllt; and that, if possible, we might together find some way
for our delivemncc nl'lxrn'nvdn~

When I sent them away, I had no viaible nppenmnce of, or the least room to hope
for, my own delivemuee, any more than I had twenty years before--much less hul I
uny forehnowlmlge of what annrwnnla happened, I mean, ol'nn English ship coming on
shore there to fetch mc nll'; and it could not he but. a very grout anrpriao to them, when
they came bnclt, not only to find that 1 won gone, but to find three atnngers left on the
apot, [muted ol'nll that l hud left behind me, which would otherwise have been their
0\\'ll. -

The first thing, however; which I inquired into, thatI might begin where I left 08',
wns of their own part: and I (haired the Spaniard would give me a particular account
of his voyage Inn-k to his countrymen with the boot, when I sent him to fetch them over.
He told me there was little variety in that part, {or nothing remnrltnble happened to
them on the way, hnving had verycahn weather, and a smooth sea. As for his country-
men, it could notbe doubted, he mid, but that they wore overjoyed to see him (itaeelna
he was the principal mun among them, the captain of file vessel they lml been ship-
wrecked in having been dunl some time) : they were, he mid, the more surprised to see
him, because they knew that he was fullen into the lntnde of tho savages, who, they were
"$55M, "'onhl devour him, as they did all the rent of their prisoners; that when he told
them the story of his delivenmce, and in what manner he was furnished forcerrying
them away, it ths him a dncam to them, and their astonishment, he said, was uomewhet
like that of Joseph's brethren, when ho told them who he was, and the story of his
oxaltntion in Pharaoh's court; but when he showed them the <<nun, the powder, the
ball, fllld provisions, that he brought them for their journey or voyage1 they were

were so much more wicked than they, that after they had been two or three days together-
they turned the tV-'o new--come" out of doom to shift for themselvea, and would have
nothing to do with them ; nor could they, {or a good while, he wounded to give them
any food : as for the Spaniards, they were not yet come.

When the Spaniards mine first on shore, the busines; begun to go forward: the
Spaniards would have penunded the three English brute to have taken in their country-
men again, that, on they mid, they might be all one family ; hut they would not hear of
it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves ; and finding nothing but indmtry and

application would make them live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore ' I"

of the island, but a little more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who nlvmyn
landed on the cart [am of the island

Here they huilt them two huta, one to lodge in, and the other to hry up their
magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and
some of the peas which I had left them, they dug, planted, and enclosed. after the
pattern I had set for them all, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of com
was on the ground ; and though it was but nlittle hit of land which they had dug up at
first, having had but alittle time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them with
bread and other eatablei; and one of the fellows being the rock's mate of the ship, wax '
very ready at making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the
milk, and such little fleuh as they got, furnished him to do.

They were going on in this little thriving position when the three unnatural rogues,
their own countrymen too, in mere humour, and to insult them, come and bullied them,
and told them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had given then:
the possesfiion of it, and nobody else had any right to it ; and that they should build no
houses upon their ground, unless they would pay rent for them.

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, asked them to come in and sit
down, and see what fine houses they were that they had built, and to tell them what
rent they demanded ; and one of them merrily said, if they were the ground-landlords,
he hoped, if they built tenements upon their land, and made improvements, they would,
according to the custom of landlords, grant a long lease : and desired they would get a 1
serivener to draw the writings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told them they
should see they were not in jest ; and going to a little place at n distance, where the
honest men had made a tire to dress their victualo, he takes a firebrand, and claps it to
the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have been all
burned down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him
away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not without some difieulty too.

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting him away, that he
returned upon him, with a pole he had in his hand, and had not the man avoided the .
hlow very niml-ly, and run into the hut, he had ended his days at. once. Hia onrnmde,roving the danger they wem both in, ran in after him, and innnmliately they came both
out with their Innskctx, and the man that was that. struck at with the pole knocked the
fellnw dawn that began the quarrel, with tho atock of his musket, and that before the

be your xen'n i too." "Ay," any: the hold deg. " and so you shall, too, before we have

Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this little discourse
had hmtml them ; and starting up, one says to the other (I think it was he they culled
, \Vill Atkins). "Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other brush with them ; we'll demolish
- their cattle. I'll wumnt you ; they shall plnnt no colony in our dominioust"

Upon this, they went ull trooping nn'ay, with every men n gun, a pistol, and a v. ,

sword, and muttered some insolent things among themselves, of what they would do to
the Spnninnls too, when opportunity offered ; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so
perfectly uuderstnnd them as to know all the pnrticnlanu, only that, in general, they
threatened them hnrd for tnking the two Englinhmen's pert.

\Vlnitller they want, or how they bestowed their time thnt evening. the Spaninrds
said they did not know ; but it seems they wandered about the country, part of the
night, nnd then, lying down in the place which I usal to all my bower, they were
weary and overslept themselves. The can was this: they had resolved to stay till
midnight, and so to take the two poor men when they were asleep, and as they

acknowlulgml afhrrwanlx intended to set fire to their huts while they were in then),
and either burn them there, or munler them as they came out. As malice seldom
sleeps very sound, it was very strange tltey should not have been kept awake.

.r, as the two nu-n had also a design upon thetn, anl have said, though a
nun-h fairer one than thatof burning and murdering, it happened, and very luckily for
tlwm all, that they were up and gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to
their hula.

When they mate there, and found the men gone, Atkins who, it seems, was the
lilrwanlext. man, railed out to his comrade, " Ila, Jack, here's the amt, but the birds am
ll: 'n." 'l' ey mused awhile, to think what should be the ocusion of their being gone
abmtd m won, and suggeatml presently that the Spaniards had given them notice of it;
and with th- t they shook hands and swore to one another that they would be revenged
of theSluntianls. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with
the poor men's habitation; they did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but they pulletl
down both their house>>, and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not the least
stick standing. or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood ; they tore all their
little colleetml household stnIl' in pieces, and threw everything about in such a manner,
that the poor nn-n afterwards l'olnul some of their things a mile ofl' their habitation.
When they had done thix they pulled up all the young try-es which the poor men had
planted ; pulled up an inchrinre they had made to secure their cattle and their corn ;
and, in a wunl. sacked and plundeml everything as eompleu'ly as a horde of Tin-tars
would have done.

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them oul, and had resolved to
light them wherever they had been, though they were but two to three; so that, had
they met there certainly would have been bloodshed among them, for they were all very
stout, mdnte follows, to give them their due.

llut l'mvinh-n ~~ took more care to keep them asunder than they themselves could do
to meet; for, as if they had dogged one another, when the three were gone thither, the
two were here ; and aherwanhg when the two went back to find them. the three were
come to the old habitation again : we shall see their dill'erent conduct presently. "'hen
the three came back like furious creatures, lluzdnrd witlt the rage whioh the work they
had been about had put llll'lll into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what
they had done, by ' of scoll'aud bravado; and one of them stepping up to one of the
Spaniards, as if th ' had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was
upon his head, and g g it a twirl about, fleering in his face, says to, hint, "And you,
Nignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the xnne sauce, if you do not mend your manners."
The Spaniard, who, though quit-t, ciu man, was as brave a man as could be, and,
withal, a stmug, well-made Inan, looked at him for a good while, and then, having no
wmlmn in his hand, stepped gravely up to hitu, and, with one blow of his flat, knocked
him down. as an ax is felled with a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, as insolent Its
the tint, tired his pistol at the Spaniard innnuliately : her 'vsed his body, indeed, for
the bullet-t went through his h r, but one of them touched the tip of hist ear, and he bled
pn-tty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he really
was. and that put him into some heat, for before he acted all in apnrfect calm ; but now,
resolving to go through with his work, he atooped, and tool: the fellow's musket whom
he .nl knocked down, and wnsjnst going to shoot the man who had fired at him, when
the fist of the Stmniards, belng in the cave, came out, and billing to hitn not to shoot,
they stopped in, secured the other two, and took their arrtnt {mm them.
THE ENGLISHMEN DlSARMED.

\Vhen they were thus diam-med, and found they had made all the Spaniards their
enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they began to cool, and, giving the Spaniards -
better worda would have had their arms again; but the Spaniards considering the feud
that was between them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best
method they could take to keep them from killing one another. told them they would do
them no harm ; and if they would live peaceably, they would be very willing to assist
and associate with them, as they did before ; but that they could not think of giving
them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with themto their
own countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them their servants.

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to act with reason ; but
being refused their arms, they went raving away, and raging like madmen, threatening
what they would do, though they had no fire-arms But the Spaniards, despising their
threatening, told them they should take care how they ofl'ered any injury to their plante-
tion or cattle ; for if they did, they would shoot them as they would ravenous- beaste,
wherever they found them; and if they fell into their hands aliveI theyshould certainly
be hanged. However, this was far from cooling them, but away they went, raging and
swmring like furias of hell. As soon as they were gone. the two men came back, in
[union and rage enough also, though of another kind; for having been at their planta-
(ion, and finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed
they had provoution enough. They could scarce have room to tell their tale. the
Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange enough to find that
three men should thua bully nineteen, and meivo no punishment at all.

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having that disarmed them,
made light of their tlrrenwnings ; but the two Englishmen resolved to have their remedy
against thorn, what pains soever it cost to find them out. But the Slmuiurdsinterpased
here too, and told them, that as they had diam-med them, they could not consent that
they (the two) should pursue thorn with fire-arms, and perlmpe kill them " But," said
the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, " we will endeavour to make them do you
justice, il'you will leave it to us: for there is no doubt but they will come to us again,
when their passion is over, being not able msubsist without ournssisuance. \Ve promise
you to make no peace with them without having a full satisfaction for you; and. upon
this condition, we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than in
your own defence." The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with
grunt reluctance; but the Spaniards protested that they did it only to keep them from
blomlshcd, and to make them all easy at last. "For," said they, " we are not so many
of us; here is room enough for us all, and it is a. great pity that we should not be all
, good friends." At'lengtlr they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, living
for some days with the Spaniards ; for their own habitation was destroyed.

In about five days' time, the three mgr-ants, tired with wandering, and almost
atnrved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtlea' 13g: all that while, came back to
the grove; and finding my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came up in a very submistir'e,
humble manner, and begged to he received again into the family. The Spaniards used
them civilly, but told them they had noted no nnnaturally to their countrymen, and so
very grossly to them (the Spaniards), that they could notcome toany conclusion without
consulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they would go to them and
discourse about it, and they should know in half an hour. It may begueased that they
were very hard put to it ; for, it seems, as they were to wait this half hour for an answer,they begged they would send them out some brad in the mean time, which they did,
tending. It the fine time, n huge piece of goat's flesh, and a boiled ml, which they
ate very heartily, for they were hungry enough. ,

After half on hour's consultation, they were called in, end I fang debate ensued, their
two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their labour, and I design tomurder
them ; all which they owned before, and therefore oeuld not deny now. Upon the
whole, thy S'uniunk noted the modenttonr between them ; and on they had obliged the
two Engl'uhmen not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed, no they now
obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellowe' two hute, one to b: of the some and the
other of larger dimensions than they were before ; to fence their ground again where
they had pullel up their feneev, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the
land again for planting corn where they had spoiled it, end, in a word, to restore every-
thin; to the slum etuto no they found it, as near an: they could; for entirely it could not

\Voll. they submitted to all this; and in they had plenty of provisions given them
all the while, they grew very orderly. and the whole aooiety began to live pleasantly and
agreeably together ngain ; only that these three follow could never be persnmled to work
--I mean for themselrai--exrept now und then 3 little, just no they planed ; however,
the Slmninrxls told them plainly. thut if they would but live anciubly and friendly toge-
ther, and study the good of the whole plantation, they would beeontentto work for them.
and let them wnlk nbout and be as idle no they pleuod ; and thus. having lived pretty
well together for in month or two, the Spaniards geve them nuns again, and give them
liberty to go abroad with them or before.

It was not above In week after they had then! urns, and went ohm-d, before the
ungrateful creatures begun to he as insolent and troublesome as ever; but, however, on
accident hnppened presently upon this, which endangered the mfety of them nll; and
they were obliged to lay by all private mnlmentu, and look tothe preservation of their
lives.

1 t hnppencd one night that the Spanish governor, no I cull him--that in to any, the
Spnuiurd whole life I had raved--who was now the rapt-in, or lender, or governor of
the roast, found himxelf very uneasy in the night, and mold by no means get any sleep :
he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only found hi- thoughts tumulo
tuoux; hi: Iniud run upon men fighting and killing one another; but he was broad awake,
and could not by any means get any sleep ; in short he lay a great while, but, growing
more and more tummy, he resolved to rise. As they lay, being so mnuy of them. on
goat-rhino lnid thick upon such couchut and pad: 1: they made for themselves, Ind not

were willing to rise, but to get upon their feet, and perhaps put on n coat, such Isitm
and their pumps, and they were Rudy for going nny why that their thoughts guided

and, besidu. the trees which I had planted, M in my former account is described, and
which were now grown toll, intercepted his tight, so that he could only look up, Ind see
that it was n clmr xkrrlight night, and, hearing no noise, he returned and luid him down
nguin ; but it was ull one : he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything
like rest ; but hie thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, nnd he knew not for win".

Having made some noise with rising and walking about. going out and coming in,him how it had been with him. "Say you xo'l" says the ozhe
Spaniard ; " such filings nre not to he alighwd, I assure you ; there is certainly
same mischief working nunr us ;" and presently he asked him. " Where are the
Englishmen l"--"Thcy are all in their huts," says he, "safe enough." It seems
the Spaniards had kept possession of the nmin apartment, and Imd inmle a place
for the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, wen: always quartered
by themselves, nnd could not. come at the rest. """ell," says the Spaniard,
"there is something in ic,I mn lmsundcd, from my own experience. I am

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

Come,"srys he, "let us go and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to justify
the trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of
my proposing it."

In a, word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill, where I used to go; but
they being strong, and a good company, not alone, as I was, used none of my mntions,
to go up by the ladder, and pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top,
but were going round through the grove, unconcerned and unwary, when they were
surprised with seeing a light a: of fire, a very little way of from them, and hearing the
voices of men--not of one or two, but of a great number.

In all the discoveri': I had made of tho savages landing on the island, it was my
constant mm to prevent them making the least discovery of there being any inlutbiunt
upon the place ; and when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so efi'ectn-
ally that they that got away were scam able to give any nooountof it; for we dimplwarcd
as won as possible; nor (lid ever any thatlnul seen me, escape to tell anyone else, except
it was the three mvagcs in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat ; of when), I
mentioned, I was afraid they should go home and bring more help. \Vhether it was
the consequence of the ammo of those men that so great a number came now
together, or whether they aune ignonurtly, and by accident, on their usual bloody errand,
the Spaniards could not, it seems, understand; but, whatever it Wins it had been their
businm either to have concealed tllelnxclves, or not to have seen them at all, much less
to have let the savages have men that there were any inhabitants in the place; or to have
fallen upon them so effectually as that not a man of them should have warped, which
could only luu'e been by getting in between them and their boats : but this pretence of
mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for ngrent while.

\"e need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, xulr'priscd with this
sight, van hack iuuncdintely and raised their fellows, giving them an account of the
imminent danger they were all in, and they again as readily took thenlnrm ; but it was
impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they were, but they must all run
out to see how things aloud.

\Vhile it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had opportunity enough,
for some hours, to view |he|u by the ght of three fires they had made at a distance from
one another ; what they were doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they
knew not. For, tint, the enemy were too many ; and, mondly they did not keep
together, but were divided ink) sen-ml parties and were on shore in several places.

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; and, as they found that
the fellows mu slr'l ling all over the shore, they made no doubt but, tint or last, some
of them would chop I upon their habitatiun, or upon aomeuther place where they would
see the token ofinhabitnnts ; and they were in great lieqilexityalro for fear oftheir flock
of goals, which would have been little lam than starving them, if they should huVe been
destmyed ; so the first thing they mullvezl upon was to dispatch three men away before
it was light, twu Slnmianls undone Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the grim:
valley where the cave in. . d, if need wore, to drive them into the very cave itself.

Lesa?A FlGH-T BETWEEN THE SAVAGES.

dark, to send the old savage, Friday's hither, out as a. spy, to learn, if poaibls, something
concealing them--as what they came for, what they intended to do, and the like. The
old man readily undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages
were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he
had been among them undiscovered ; that he found they were two parties, and of two
several nations, who had war with one another, and had bade. great battle in their own
country ; and that both sides having had seven] prisoners taken in the fight, they were.
by more chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring their prisoners and
mnking merry ; but their coming so by chance to the same place hall spoiled all their
mirth--that they were in a gmt rage at one another, and were so near, that he believed
they would light ngnin us soon as daylight began to sppar; but he did not perceive
that they had any notion ofnnybody being on the island but themselva He had hardly

nuulo an end of telling his story, when they could pemive, by the unusual noise they ,

made, that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to lie elm,
and not be seen ; he told them their safety consisted in it, and thnt they had nothingto
do but lie still, and the snvsges would kill one another to their hands, and then the not
would go away ; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially
upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity was so importunato upon their pmderntials, that
they must run out and see the battle ; however, they used some caution, too; they did
not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed
themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them manage the fight, and, as
they thought, not be seen by them; but it seems the savages did see them, ns we shall
find hereafter.

The battle was very hem; and. if I might believe the Englishmen, one of them said
he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and
of great policy in guiding the fight. The battle, they said, held two hours before they
could guess which party would be beaten; but then that party which was nearest our
people's habihtion began to appear weakest, and after some time more, some of them
began to fly ; and this put our men again intoa great consternation, lest any one of those
that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involun-
tarily discover the place; and that, by consequent>>, the pursuers would do the like
in search of them. Upon this, they resolved that they would stand armed within the
wall, and whoever came into the grove, they molved to sally out over the wall and kill
them, so that, if possible, not one should return to give an account of it; they ordered
also that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking them down with the stocks
of their muskets, but not by shooting them. for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.

As they expected it fell out ;' three of the rented army Red for life, and crossing the

creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least knowing whither they went, but ,

running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave
notice of this within, with this addition, to our men'}; great satisfaction, viz, that the
conquerors had not [mailed them. or seen which way they were gone ; upon this, the
Spaniard governor, a. man of humanity, would not snfl'er them to kill the three fugitives,
but sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in
behind them, and surprise and take them prisoners ; which was done. The residue of

i I said above, hnd ctfm'tuully reconciled them, they begun to consider their generul cir-
cumstances ; and the first thing that came under eomidention was whether, seeing the
ruvnges pnrticulurly haunted that side of the ialund, and that there were more remote
\ and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, Ind munifcstly to their
udrnntngc, they should not rather move their habitation, and plant in some more proper
ml place for their wfety, and especially for the murity of their tattle and com
'1

   

' Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would not remove their I
@ habitation ; because tlm, some time or other. they thought they might hear front their "3' v:
governor again, meaning me; and if I should send any one to seek them, I should be \
' sure to direct them to thnt side, where. if they should find the piece demolished, they

trwould conclude the savage: had. killed us all, and we were gone, and so our
supply would go too. But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the \'nlley where my cave was, where the land was as proper for both,
and where, indeed, there was land enough ; however, upon second thougth, they
altered on part of their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of
their cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there; end so if one part was
destroyed, tho other might be saved. And one part of prudence they used,
which it was very well they did, that they never trusted those three savaged
which they had taken prisoners, with knowing anything of the plantation they
hnd made in that valley, or of any cattle they had them, much hm of the cave
there, which they kept, in ease of neomity, as n safe retreat ; and thither they
carried also the two barrels of powder, which I had sent them at my coming
away. But, however, they resolved not to change their habitation; yet they
agreed, that u I had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification,
and then with a grove of trees, so seeing their nfcty consisted entirely in their
being concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover
and mneml tho plnoo yet more ell'eetuslly then before. For this purpose, as I
phmu-d trees, or rnther thrust in stalun, which in time all grew up to be tree, for
some good dixtnnee before the entrance into my apartments, they went on in the same
mnnncr, nnd filled up the rest of that whole space of ground from the trees I hnd
set quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I mid, I landed my floats, and
even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, notsomnch as leaving any place to land,
or nny sign lhnt there had been my landing thembonts: these stakes also being of n
wood very forwnrd to grow, as l have noted fonnerly, they took euro to have them
generally much larger nud tnllcr than these which I had planted; andns they grew
npuce, no they planted them so very thick and clone together, that when they had been
three or four years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way
into the plnntntion 3 end as for that part which I had planted, the tree! were grown as
thick <<an mnu'a thigh, nnd among them they plnced so many other short ones, and so
thick, thnt, in :1. word, it stood like it pelimdo a. quarter of n mile thick, audit was next
to inqwiblo to penetndo it, but with it little army to cut it all down--for it little dog
could lrnrdly get between the treex, they stood no close.

But this wns not all; for they did the snnxc by all the ground to the right hnnd and
to the left, and round even to the side of the hill, leeving no way, not so much as for
thenmelvut, to come out but by the lndder plnecd up to the side of the hill, and then
lifted up, nnd plnccd agnin from the first stage up to the top ; and when the ladder was
taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at tlnem.
This was excellently well contrived ; nor was it less than what they afterwards found
Immion for, which served to convince me, that as human prudence has the authority of
Provide-nee to justify it, so it hen doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to work ;
nnd ifwe listened carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded we might prevent many
of the dimtem which our lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to.

I return to the story. They lived two yeers alter this in perfect retirement, and had
no more visits from the savages. They had, indeed, an alarm given them one morning,
which put them into A great consternntion ; for, some of the Spaniardsbeing out early
one morning on the west side, or rether end, of the island (which was that end where I
never went, for fear of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing above twenty
canoes of lndinns juxt coming on shore. They made the best of their way home in
hurry enough ; and, giving the nlnnn to their comrades, they kept close all thnt day and
the next, going out only nt night to mnke their observation ; but they had the good luck
to ho mistaken, for wherever the savages went, they did not lnud that time on the island,
but pnnmed some other design.

And new they had another fired with the three Englishmen; one of whom, a most
turbulent fellow, being in u rage at one of the three slaves, whom I mentioned they had
taken, beer-use the fellow had not done something right which he bid him do, and seemed
it little untnwtnhle in his showing him, drew a. hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he
Wow it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.
One of tho Sluninrds, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a. bnrlxuoru cut with the
hntehet, which be aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought
he had cut the poor ermrture's arm 01?, ran whim, end entresting him not to murder the
poor nmn, placed himself between him and the savage, to prevent the mischief. The
follow, lining enraged the more at this. struck at the Spaniard with his hntchet, andTHE SPANIARDS AND ENGLISH. '

more he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard per-
ceiving, avoided the blow, and with n shovel which he had in his hand (for they were all
working in the field about their com hind) knocked tho brute down. Another of tho
Englishmen, running at the srmo time to help hieoommde, knocked the Spaniard down ;
and then two Spaninrds more mmo in to help their man, and a third Englishman fell in
"pan them. They had none of them any fire-arms or any other weapons but hateheta
and other tools, except this third Englishman ; he had one of my rusty cutlames, with
which he mode at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set the
whole fiunily in an uproar, and, more help coming in, they tool: the three Englishmen
prisoners The next question was, what should be done with them! They had been so
oflen mutinous, and were so very furious, so desperate, and so idl~ withsl, they knew
not what course to take with them, for they were mischiovom to the highest degree, and
cared not what hurt they did to any man ; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with
thorn.

Tho Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, that if they had been
of his own eountry,ho would have hanged them ; {or all laws and all governors were to
preserve society, and those who were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out
of it: but as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindnes of an
Englishman that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would use them
with all pontihlo lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of the other two
Englishmen, who were their countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they desired it might not
be left to them--" For," says he, "I am surewe ought to senteneo themtothe gallows ;"
nud with that he gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to
have all the five Englishmen join together, and murder all the Spaniards when they
were in tlu-ir sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he ealls to Will Atkins, "How, Seignior
Atkins, would you murder us alli \Vhot have you to say to that?" The hardened
villain was so far from denying it, that he said it was two, and swore they would do it
still before they had done with them. " \Vell, but Seiguior Atkins," says the Spaniard,
' " what have we done to you that you will kill u." And what would you got by killing
us? And whnt must we do to prevent your killing usi Must we kill you, or you kiil
us! \Vhy will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkinal" says the Spaniard,
very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such arage at the Sponiard's making
a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapon near
him, it was thought that he would have attemptcd to kill the Spaniard in the middle of
all the company. This hair-brain earringe obliged them to consider seriously what was
to be done; the two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who owed the poor savage, were of
tho opinion that they should hang one of the three, for an example to the rat, and that
particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet; and indeed, them was some reason to believe that ho hud done it, for the poor
savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had received, that it was
thought he could not live, But the governor Spaniard still said no; it was an English--
man that had saved all their lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman
to death, though he had murdered half of them ; nay, he said, if he had been killed
himself by an Englishmen, had had time left to speak, it should be that they should
pardon him.

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Sponiu'd, that there was no gain-'9

saying it ; an merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly
pmed, so they all come into it; but then it was to be considered what should be done
to keep them from doing the mischief they designed ; {or all agreed, governor and all,
that luealm were to be used for preserving the society from danger. After a long
debate, it . agreed. litst, that they should be dimrmcd, and not permitted to have
either gun, powdev, shot, sword, or any weapon ; and allould be turned out of the society,
and Mt to live when: they would, and how they could, by themselves ; but that none of
the rest, either Sluuiianlsor English. should convene with thcm,xpeak with them, or ham
anything to do with them : t mt they should be forbid to come within a certain distance
or the plan-e where the rest du'elt ; aml if they otl'emd to commit any disorder, 90 as to
spoil, hurn. hill. or destroy any of the rent, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle
belonging to the we ty, they should die without mercy, and they would shoot them
wherever they would liud them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, maxing upon the sentence, considered a
little upon it; and (tinting to the two honest Englishmen, mid, "Hold; you moat
rellwt that it will he lnng ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and they
must not starve : we must lhereflu'e allow them provisions." Sohe caused to be added,
that they should bar. | proportion of corn given them to last them eight months and
for seed to sow, by w I time they Ill be summed to raise some-of their own ; that
they should huh I.\ Inilrh-gmlta, four Ic-goots, and six kida given them, ax well for
present subsistence as for a store; and that they should have Wis given them for
their work in the fields, such as six hatcheta, an ad>>, in NW, and the like; but they
should have none of these tools or provisions unlm they would swear solemnly that
they would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow-
Euglisluneu

Thus they dixmissed them the society, and turned them out to shift for themselves.
They went a\ .Iy sullen mul vetmetery, ax neither content to go away, nor to stay ; but,
as them was no remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place where they
would settle themselv . , and some provisions were given them, but no weapons.

to mil round the island.

Here they built themselves two handsome huta, and contrived them iuu mauuer like
my first habitation, being elose under the side <<in lull, having some trees growing
already on three sides of it, so that by planting others it would be very easily covered
from the sight. nah-st narmu'ly smrched for. They desired some dried goat skins, for
beds and eon-ring, \vhieh were gut-u them; and upon giving their words that they
would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them hatchets,
and what other tools they could stare; some pan, barley. and rice, for sowing. and, in
a word, auvthiug they wanted, except arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got in their tirsl
harvest, though the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they had planted being
but little; (or, indeed, having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal oi
wort: upon their hands; and when they came to make boards and you, and such

lint l have olwrviug. and return to the xtory. The three fellows came down to the
Slutnianls one looming, and in very humble term: desired to he admitted to speak with
tln t. The Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was this :--
That they wens tired of living in the manner they did, and that they were not handy
enough to make the neceeuries the ' wanted, and that having no help, they found they
rhonld he starved ; but if the Sponiunla would give them leave to take one of the
allot-n which they eame over in, and give them arms and ammunition pmlmrtioned to
their defence, they would go over to the main and reel: th 'r fut-tuned, and so deliver
them from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very honestly n'pmtcntml
to them the certain dextrnetion they were hunting into; told them the ' had sull'ered
finch hardships upon that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy,
tell them they would he starved or murdered, and hade them consider of it.

The men replied, mulueiously, they should he starved if they stayed he re, for they
could not. work, and would not work. and they could but be starved ahroad; and it'
they were murdeml, there was an end of them ; and. in short, insisted importnnntely
upon their deumnd, declaring they would go, whether they gave them any arms or no.

The Spaniard; told them, with great kindness that if they were resolved to go, they
should not go like naked men, and be in no condition to deli-ad themselves ; and that,
though they could ill spore their file-emu having not enough for themselves. yet theywould let them have two muakete, a pistol, and a outlaaa, and each man a hatchet,
which they thought we: auficient for them. In a word, they accepted the ofl'er; and
having baked broad enough to serve them a. month, and given them as much gut-3' flail
as they could out while it was sweet. and a great basket of dried grapes, a pot of fresh
water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over the see,
where it was at least forty miles broad.

The boot, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have carried fifteen or twenty
men, and therefore was rather- too big for them to manage; hut oathey had a fnir breeze,
and flood-tide with them, they did well enough. They had made a most of a. long
pole, and a sail of four large goatshins dried, which they had sewed or laced together;
and away they went merrily enough. The Spaniards called after them, " Ben wyajr I "
and no mun ever thought of seeing them any more.

The Spaniurda were often relying to one another, and to the two honat Englishmen
who remained behind, how quietly and comfortably theylived, now these three turbulent
fellows were gone. As for their coming again, that was the remotest thing from their
thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold, after two-and-twenty daye' absence, one
of tho Englishmen, being abroad upon his planting work, see: three strange men coming
towards him at a distance, with guns upon their shouldem

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitehcd, comes frightened and amazed
to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were ull undone, for there were strangers
upon the island, but could not tell who they were. The Spaniard, pausing a while,
says to him, "How do you mean--you cannot tell who? They are the savages, to be
sure." "No, no," says the Englishman ; "they aremen in clothes, with arms." " Nay,
then," says the Spaniard, "why are you so concerned? If they ere not ravages, they
must be friundx, for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good
ruther than ham"

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and, standing without
the wood, which wns new planted, hallooed to them. They presently knew their
voices, and so all the wonder ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon
another 'qnestion :--\\'hst could be Lhe matter, and what made them come back
again I

It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring where they had been,
and what they had been doing, they gave them a full account of their voynge in a few
words :--that they reached the land in two days, or something lea ; but finding the
people alarmed at their coming, and prepared with bows and arrows to fight them, they
durst not go on nhore, but nailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till they came
'3 to a great opening. by which they perceived that the land they saw from our island was
not the main but an island. Upon entering that opening of the lee, they saw mother
island, on the right hand, north, and severnl more west ; and being resolved to lend
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on
shore ; that they found the people very courteous and friendly to them; and that they
gnu'o xovernl roots and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and the women, as
well as the men, were very forward to supply them with anything they could get for
them to eat, and brought it to them a great way upon their heada.

They continued here four dayg and inquired, as well as they could of them, by aignr,
what nations were this way and that way, and were told of govern! fierce and terrible
people that lived almost every way, who, as they made known by aigns to them, used to
cut men : but as for themselves, they said, they never ate men or women, except onlysuch zu they took in the want ; nnd then, they owned, they mule it grunt feast, nnd nte
their prisonem

The Englishmen implired when they hnd lmd II feat of that kind ; end they told
them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon and to two finger: ; nnd tlmt their
great king had two hundred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, and they
were feeding them to mnke them fut fur the next feast. Tile Englinhmeu seemed mighty
desirous of seeing those prisoners ; but the other: mistaking them, thought they were
duimns to have some of them to carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned
to theln, pointing to the setting ol' the sun,nnd then to the rising ; Which Wm] to signify
thlt the nextmnrning nt sun-rising they would bring some for them ; qul, neeonlingly,
the next moniing they brought down five women nud eleven men.nud gnre them to the
Englishmen, to carry with them on their Voynge, just as we would bring so runny cows
and oxen down to n sen-port town to \'lctllll I ship.

Au brutish and barbaronsnn these fellows were at home, their stomachs turned at this
night, mul they did not 1: W What to do. To refuse the primnere wouhl here been the
highest nll'mnt to the mvnge gentry thut could be oll'ercd them ; uml what to do with
them they knew not. lluwerer, utter some debate they resolved to accept of them ;
nud, in return, they genre the Kruger that brought them one of their hutchchs an old
key. it knife, nnd nix or :14. 'en of their bullets ; which. though they did not understand
their nzw, they seemed lrlrtieulnrly plotted with; and then tying the peer crenturex'
hands behind them, they drugged the prisonen; into the bout for our men.

The Englishmen were obliged to come nwny mi noon rut they hml them. or elm: they

thut gure them this noble present would certninly huvo expected that they uhnnld hare
gone to work with them, have killed two or tluee of them the next manning, nud,
perhnlu, here invited the donors: to dinner. But hnring taken their leave, with all the
respect and thanks that could well puss beth-n petunia, where, on either side, they
tlutlersml not one word they could my, they put nl'l' with their boat, nnd erune hock
towards the lirst island ; where, when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at
liberty, there being too many of them for their mien.
, in their ruynge they endeavoured to have some communication with their prisoners ;
" but it was impossible to mnke them understand anything. Nothing they could say to
them, or giro them, or do for them, but \ms looked upon M going to murder them. They
first of all unbound them ; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the
women, us if they hcul just felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately con-
cluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them anything to eat,
it was the mute thing; they then concluded itwu for fear they should sink in flesh, and
so not be rut enough to kill. 11' they looked at one of them more lurticulerly, the party
presently concluded it mu; to see whether he or she wns Git-tent, and fittest to kill first ;
my, after they hnd brought them quite orer, end begun to me them kindly, nnd treet
them well, still they expected erery dny to make a dinner or supper for their new
masters.

\Vhen the three \ruuderen; hnd given this unneeunntnble hintory or journnl of their
voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new family wxux ; and being told that
they had brought them on shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were come
up to beg some vietnnls {or them, they (the Spaniorda) end the other two Englishmen,
that is to say, the whole ooleuy, resolved to go All down to the place end use them ; and
did so, and Friday's Ether with them.

\Vhen they come into the hut. there they not, all bound ; for when they had brought

248

"4,2,. - _

"<<'-\'J.them on shore, they bound their hands, that they might not take the boat and make
their empe; there, I say, they sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three
men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-
five yeara of age; and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty ; two
more not above four or five and twenty; and the filth, a. tall, comely maiden, about
sixteen or xevrntoeu. The women were wellvfavoured, agreeable persona, both in shape
and features, only tawny ; and two of them, had they been perfectly white, would have
passed for very handmme women, even in London itself, having pleasant, agreeable
roumennnrea, and of a very modest behaviour ; especially when they came afterwards
to he rlothrd and themed, as they called it, though that dreaa was very indifi'oront, it
must be conformed.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth tn our Spaniards, who were, to
give them a juat character, men of the best behaviour, of the meet calm, sedate tempers,
and perfect good lnunonr, that ever I met with ; and, in particular, of the most modesty;
I say, the night was very uncouth, to see three naked men and fire naked women, all
together bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that human nature could be
supposed to be, \'iz.. to be expecting every moment to be dragged out, and have their
brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like a ealfthat is killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's father, to go in, and
ace, first, if he knew any of them, and then if he understood any of their speech. As
soon as the ohl man came in. he. looked seriously at them, but. knew none of them ;
neither could any of them understand a word he said, or a aign he could make, except
one of the women. However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy
them that the men into whose bands they were firllcn were Christians; that they
ahhom-d eating men or women ; and that they might be sure they would not be killed.
As soon as they were manned of this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward
gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for it seem! they were of several nations.

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if
they were willing to be aerr'anta, and to work for the men who h. 4 brought them
away, to save their lives ; at which they all fell a dancing ; and preeently one fell to
taking up this, and another that, anything that lay next, to carry on their shouldem, to
intimate they were willing to work.

The governor, who found that the having women among them would pmently be
attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion some strife. and perhaps blood,
asked the three men what they intended to do with these women, and how they
intended to use them, whether as aerrants or as wives'l One of tho Englishmen
answered, very boldly and readily, that they would use them on both; to which the
govenxor said, "I am not going to restrain you from it--yon are your own masters as
to that; but thin I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you,
and I desire it of you for that reason only, viz. :--That you will all engage, that if any
of you take any of these women an a wife, that he shall take but one; and that, having
taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we cannot marry any one of you, yet
it is but reasonable that, while you stay here, the woman any of you take: shall be'

ntuined by the man that talcu her, and ahould be his wife--I mean," says he,
~ wlule he continues here, and that none ebu- shall have anything to do with her."
All this appeared so just, that every one agreed .0 it without any difieulty.

Then the Euglialuucn asked the Spaniards if they designed to take any of them.
But every one of them answered, "No." Some of them said they had wives in Spain,
 

THE CHOICE OF WIVES

 

 

 

 

and the others did not like women that were not Christians; and all together declared
that they would not touch one of them, which was an instance of such virtue as I have
not met with in all my travels. 0n the other hand, to be short, the Eve Englishmen
took them every one a wife--that is to my, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new
form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which
they had enlarged exceedingly within. Tile three servants which were taken in the
last battle of the savaga lived with them; and these carried on the maiu part of the
colony, supplied all the mt with food, and assisted them in anything as they could, or
as they found necessity required.

But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, ill-matched fellows should
agree about these women, aml that two of them should not choose the same woman,
(upwinlly seeing two or three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable
than the others; but tl.cy took a good way enough to prevent quarrclling among
themselvca, for they set the five women by themselves in one of their huts, and they
went all into the other hut, and drew lets among them who should choose first.

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where the poor naked
creatures were, and fetched out her he chose; and it was worth observing, that he that
chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliut and oldest of the five, which made
mirth enough among the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it ; but the fellow
considered better than any of them, that it was application and business they were to
expect assistance in, as much as in anything else; and she proved the best wife of all
the parcel.

\thn the poor women saw thclnselvm set in a row thus, and fetched out one by
one, the terrors of their condition returned upon them again, and they firmly bclievcll
they were now going to bo devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor aune in
and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her,
and took their leave of her with such agonies and ad'ection as would have grieved the
hardest hurt in the world ; nor was it wasibh: for the Englishmen: to satisfy them that
they were not to be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's father,
who inunmliately let them know that the five men, who were to fetch them out one by

- one, had chosen them for their: wives.

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a. little over, the man
went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them ; and in a few hours they had
built them every one a new hat or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had
already were crowded with their tools, household stud: and provisions. The three
wicked once had pitched farthest off, and the two honest on" nearer, but both on the

:_ north shore of the island," that they continued separated as beforo; and thus my .
island was peopled in three places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun W he

built.

And here it is very well worth observing that, an it often happens in the world (what
the wise ends of God's providence are, in such a disposition of things, I alnnot say), the
two honest fellows had the two worst wivrs ; and the three roprobatos, that were sauce
worth hanging, that were lit for nothing, and neither seemed born to do themselves
good nor any one else, had three clover, diligent, careful, and ingenious wives; not that
the first two were bad wives, as to their temper or humour, for all the rive were most
willing, quiet, posivo, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wire: ; but my
meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and
neat.

plenty within and without; they hm! more tame mttlo than the others, more utensils

I),$1; WA

)3 But I now come to n scene different from nll that had happened before, eithergz
to them or to me ; and the origin of the story want this z--Early one morning. there
mule on shore five or six canoes of Indiana or snuges--mll them which you please--
nnd there is no room to doubt they come upon the ohl ermnd of feeding upon their
slaves; but that part was now so familinr to the Sponianls, and to our men too, that ,
they dill not concern themselves about it no I did : but having been made sensible, by
their experience, that their only business was to lie concenlal, annl that if they were not
seen by any of the savagu they would go off ngiin quietly, when their bunineSS was
done, having, as yet, not the least notion of there being nny inhnl-itnuts in the island ;

I my, having been made sensible of this, they hml nothing to do but give notice to
all the three plnntations to keep within doors, and not show themselves, only
placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats went to sea again. A
This wus, without doubt, very right ; but :\ disuter spoiled nll tin-sec measures,
and made it known among the savages that them were inhabitants them;

n...
which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony. Attor- the eanoea
with the mvngca were gone ofi', the Spaniards pooped abroad again; and some of them
had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to too What they had been
doing. Here, to their great unrpriae, they found three savages lefl behind, and lying
fast asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they had either been no gorged with
their inhuman feast, that, like beasts they were fallen Asleep when the otharn went, or
they hull wandered into the wooda, and did not come luck in time to be taken in.

The Spuuiurxhi were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at a loss what to
do. The Spanish governor, as il- hnppened, was with them, and bin advice was asked,
but he professed he knew not whut to do. An for alnvea, they had enough already; and
no to killing them, there were none of them inclined to do that: the Spaniard governor
told me. they could not think of shedding innocent blood; for as to them, the poor
overtures hud done them no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they thought
they lnnl no just quarrel against them to take away their lives And here I must, in
justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let the ueeonnts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico
nnd Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever,
in any foreign country, who were no universally modest, temperate, virtuous, ao very
goml'hnmuured. end no courteous, as these Spaniards: and as to cruelty, they had
nothing of it in their very natule: nu inhumanity, no harbor-ity, no outrugeoux [unions ;
and yet nll of them men of grant courage and spirit. Their temper and onlmncsx lnnl
upln-ured in their hearing the insuti'erahle mange of the three Englishmen; and their
justiee nml Immunity nppenred now in the cone of tho ntvugea, on above. After some
consultation, they Iuolvul upim thin: that they would lie still u while longer, till, if
pneihle, these three men mightbe gone. But then the governor Spaniard roeolleeted that
the tlnx-e sn-nges had no heat ; nnd it" they were left to roam about the inland, they
would certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it; and so they should be
undone thnt way. Upon this, they went had: again, and there hty the fellows fiat
asleep still, sothey resolved to uwnken them, and take them prisoner-a ; and they did so.
The poor fellows were strungely frightened when they were seized upon and bound ; and
afntid, like the women, that they should be murdered and eaten: for it sooner, those

. people think ull the world do as they do, eating men's flesh ; but they were soon mndo
ensy an to that, and away they carried them.

It was very happy for them that they did not carry than: home to their eastlhl
menu, to my palace undet- the hill ; but they carried them first to the horror, where m
the chief of their country work, xuch as keeping the goats, the plunting the corn, he. ;
and aftervmnla they carried them to tho habitation of the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for them to do; and
whether it Win; by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought the fellows could
not mend themselves, I know not, but one of them ran away, and, taking to the woods,
they could never hear of him any more

They had good mtson to believe he got home oguiu soon m.- in some other boate
or canoes of mvngea who tame on shore three or four weeks aflorwarda, and who,
carrying on their revolts>>; usual, went ofl' in two days' time. Thin thought terrified them
exceedingly ; for they concluded, end that not without good cause indeed, that if this
fellow enmo home safe among his oomrodea, he would certainly give them an account
that there were people in the inland, and aloe how few and weak they were ; for this
savage, an observed before, had never been told, and it. was very happy he had not, how ,
many there were, or where they lived ; nor had he ever seen or heard thofire of any of ,112/ ,

their guns, much lea had they shown him any of their other retired plum _; such in the
cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had mode, and the like.
The first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelligence of them was, that

7 about two months after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men in

a canoe, came rowing along the north side of the island, where they never used to come
before, and landed, about an hour afier sun-vise, at a oonvenient place, about a mile from
the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As the
Spaniard governor said, had they been all there, the damage would not have been so
much, for not a man of them would have escaped ; but tho use difl'crcd now,
very much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. The two men had the happiness
to discover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour before they landed;
and as they landed a mile from their huts. it was some time before they could come at
them. Now, having great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first thing they
did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two of the three men whom
they brought with the women (who, it seem; proved very faithful to them) to lead them,
with their two wives, and whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired
places in the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows
hand and foot, till they heard further.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and that th y had bent
their course directly that way, they opened the fences when the milch cow. were kept,
and drove them all out ; leaving their goats to struggle in the woods whither .hcy pleased,
that the savages might think they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with
them was too cunning for that. and gave them an account of it all, rm- they went
directly to the place.

\Vhen the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and goods, they sent the
other slave they had of the three who came with the women, and who was at theirplaee
by accident, away to the Spaniards with oil speed, to give them the alarm, and desire
speedy help, and, in the meantime, they took their arms, and what ammunition they

- had, and retreated towards the place in the wood where their wives were sent; keeping

at a distance, yet so that they might see, if posible, which way the Images took.

They had not gone .'sr, but that from a rising ground they could see the little army
of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, and, in a moment more, could see
all their huts and household stufl' flaming up together, to their great grief and mortified-
tion ; for they had a very great loss, to them irretrievnhle, at least for some time.
They kept their station for a while, till they found the savages, like wild beam, spread
themselves all over the place, rummaging every way, and every place they could think
of, in search of prey ; and in particular for the people, of whom now it plainly appeared
they had intelligence.

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure where they stood,
because it was likely some of the wild people mightoorne that way, and they might come
too many together, thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile
farther; believing, as it afterwards happened, that the farther they strolled, the fewer
would be together.

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, and
where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollowand vastly large; and in this true

they both took their standing, resolving to see there what might ofl'ar. They had not stood .

there long before two of the savages appeared running directly that way, as if they
already had notice where they stood, and were coming up to attach them; and a little

355
wsy further they espied three more coming otter them, and five more beyond them, all
coming the some way ; besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance, running
another way; for, in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen heating for their
game.

The poor men Wcm now in grout perplexity whether they should stlnd and keep
their posture, or fly ; but, nfter It very short debate with themselves, they considered,
tlmt if the savages mngnl the country thus before help came, they might perhaps find
out their retreat in the woods, and then all would boloet ; so they reeolvedto stand them
there, and if they were too mony to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the
tree, from whence they doubted not to defend themselves. fire excepted, as long as their
ammunition: lasted, though all the mmges that were handed, which was near fifty, were
to nttnclr them.

lluviug resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should fire at the first
two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party, by which the two and the five
thnt followed would be animated ; at length they resolved to let the first two pass by,
unless they should spy them in the tree, and come to nttsck them. The first two
mvogcs confirmed them also in this resolution, by turning a little from them towards
another port of the wood ; but the three, and the five after them, come forward directly
to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so
straight towards them, they resolved to take them in a line us they come; end as they
resolved to fire but one nt n time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all three; for
which purpose the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into his piece ;
and having a fuir loop-hole, us it were, from s broken hole in the tree, he took e sure
nilu, without being seen, waiting till they were within shout. thirty yards of the tree, so
that he could not ruins.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages come on, they plainly saw that one
of the three was the runaway savage thot had amped from them; end they both knew
him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, though they should
both fun: : so the other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not C op at the first
shot, he should be sure to have n second But the first was too good a. marksman to
' miss his nim ; for as the senses lrcpt near one another,s.littlo behind in e line, he fired,
and hit two of them directly : the foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head ; the
second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and fell, but was not

quite deed ; nod the third had a little sensteh in the shoulder, perhaps by the some bell .

that went through the body of the second; end being dreadfully frightened, though not v
so much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.
The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than sensible of the
danger. stood still at first; for the woods mode the sound s thousand times biger than
it really was, the echoes nttling from one side to another, and the fowls rising from all
parts, screaming, and every sort making a difi'ereut noise, according to their kind ; just
as it was when I fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot ofl' in the island.
However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the matter was, eems
, on unconcerned, till they came to the place where their companions lay in e condition
Iuisemble enough : and here the poor ignorant creature, not sensible that they were
within much of the some mischief, stood altogether over the wounded man, talking and,
as may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt: end who, it is very
rational to believe, told them, that a flash of fire first, end immediately the! thst

tlnunler fro n their gods, had killed those two and wounded him : this, I say, is Mon-l:

for nothing is more certain than that, (a they saw no man near them, so they had never
heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much a: head of a gun ; neither know they
anything of killing and wounding at a distance with fire and bullets: if they had, one
might mnably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned to view the fate of
their fellows, without some apprehension of their own.

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved them to be obliged to kill
30 many poor creatures, who, at the same time, hnd no notion of their danger; yet,
having them all thus in their power, and the first having to load his niece nguin, resolved
to let fly both together among them ; and singling out. by agreement, which to aim at,
they shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, {our of them ; the fifth, frightened
oven to death, though not hurt, full with the rest ; so that our men, seeing them all fall
together, thought they had killed them all.

The belief that the savage: were all killed, made our two men come boldly out from
the that before they had charged their guns, which was a wrong step ; and they were
under some aururiae when they ame to the place, and found no less than four of them
alive, and of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: this obliged them to fell
upon them with the stocks of their musket: ; and first they made sure of the runaway
songs, that had been the cause of all the mischief. and of another that was hurt in the
knee, and put them out of their pain ; then the man that was not hurt at all came and

_.understand. However, they nude aigna to him to sit down at the foot of otree hard by ;
and one of the Englinhmen, with a piece of rope twine, which he had by greet chenoe
in hi~s pocket, tied his two heads behind him, o'nd there they left him ; end with whet
speed they could mode after the other two, which were gone before, faring they, or any
of them, should find their way to the covered place in the woods, where their wives
and the few goo-hr they had left lay. They come onoe in sight of the two men, but it
was at a great distance; however, they had the satisfaction to ace them em over I
valley towards the sun, quite the contrary way from that which led to their retrut,
which they were afraid of; and being mtieflcd with that, they went back to the tree
where they left their prisoner, who, no they supposed, was delivered by his oomradea for
he was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just
at the foot oflhe tree.

They were new in as great concern as before, not knowing what course to take, or
how near the enemy might be, or in what number; no they resolved to go away to the
place where their wives were, to see it all was well there. end to make them easy, who
were in fright enough to be sure ; for though the ravages were their own countrymen,
yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more for the knowledge
they had of them.

When they more there, they found the savages had been in the wood, end very neor
that place, hut had not fimnd it; for it was indeed inaccenrible, from the trees stending
so thick, unluxx- the rumour: rocking it had been directed by those that knew it, which
three were not ; they found, therefore, everything very side, only the women in o terrible
fright. While they were here, they had the comfort to have seven of the Speninrda
come to their ieeistance ; the other ten, with their eemnta, and old Friday (I mean
Friday's father), were gone in a body to defend their bower. and the com and rattle
that were kept them. in am: the ravages should have roved over to that side of the
country ; but they did not spread so far. \Vith the seven Slmninnls wile one of the
three at . gee, who, as I said, were their prisoners fonnerly ; and with them also come
the. :<<u'age. whom the Englishman had left bound hand nnd foot at the tree ; for
it seems they came that way, saw the alrurghuvr of the eeven men, and unbound the
eighth, and brought him along with them ; where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as lhey had done the two others who were let}. when the third ran away.

The prisoners now began to he a burden to them ; and they were so afraid of their
warping, that they were once mnlving to kill them all, believing they were umler on
absolute amend! y t4- du m for their own preservation. However, the Spaniard governor
would not muse-rt toil, but ordered, for the present, that they should be sent out of
the way, to my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard
. them, and give them food for their xuhdatenoe, which was done; and they were bound
' ' there hand and foot for that night.

"'hen the Spaniards value, the two Englishmen were so encouraged, that they could
not ratisfy themeelvea to stay nny longer there ; but taking five of the Spaniards and
thernaelvezg with four muxkets one a pistol among them, and two stout quartcmtnves,
away they went in quest of the ravages. And first they came to the tree where
the men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see that some more of the
ravages had been there, for they had attempted to carry their dead men away, and had
dragged two of them o good way, but had given it over. me thence they ednn'eed
to the first thing ground, where they had stood and seen their amp destroyed, and
where they had the mortitimtion still to see some of the smoke ; but neither could they

here see any of tho savages. They then resolved, though with all posible caution, to
go forward towards their ruined plantation; but, a little befinm they came thither,
coming in night of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in
their canoes, in order to be gone. They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no way
to come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but, upon the whole, they were very
well intixfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englixlunen being new twice mined, and all their improvements destroyed
the rest all agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and mist thrm with needful
supplieit Their three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the Inst ineli-
nation to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they, living remote eastward,
lznew unthin-r of the matter till all was over),eame and nth-red their help and antistance,
and did, very friendly, work for sew-ml days to restore their habitationa, and make neeey
saries for them. And thus in a little time they were set upon their legs again.

About two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of fleeing three of the
savagea' cauoea come driving on shore, and, at some distance from them, two drowned
men, by which they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, which
had overnet rome of them ; for it had blown very hard the night after they went efi'.

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough of them meaped
to inform the rest,ns well of what they had done Met what had happened to them, and
to whet them on to another enterprise of the some nature, which they, it moms, resolved
to attempt, with sufiieient fume to carry all before them ; for except what the first man
had told them of inhabitants, they could say little of it of their own knowledge, for
they never raw one man ; and the fellow being killed that had afinned it, they had no
other witnexi to coufinn it to them.

It was five or six months alter this before they heard any more of the smug, in
which time our men were in hopes they had either forget their former had luck,
or given over hopes of better; when, on a sudden, they were invaded by a most
fnnnidahle tleet of no less than eiglibiind-te'enty canoes full of swages, armed with
bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like enginu of war; and they
brought such numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost
consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening. and at the easternmost side of the island, our
men had that night to consult and consider what to do; and, in the first place, knowing
that their being entirely concealed was their only safety before, and would be much
more so now, while the number of their enemies would be so great, they therefore
n-solVed, first of all, to take down the huts which were built for the two Englishmen,
and drive away their goats to the old care; because they supposed the savage; would
go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though they
did not new land within two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove away all the
floeln of goals they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the
Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was
possible ; and the next morning early they posted themselves, with all their force, at
the plantation of the two men, to wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap-
pened: these new invaders, leaving their eanoa at the east end of the island, more
ranging along the shore, directly towardathe place, to the number of two hundred and
fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our army was but smn'l, indeed ; but, that which
was worse, they had not arms for all their number neither. The whole account, it
seems, stood thus: first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday
   

 

(or Friday's Either), the three slaves tnkon with the women, who proved very titithi'ul,
~ und three other slaves, who lived with the Sinnianht. To nrln these, they had eleven

outmgooux by their wounds, and fought like madman.

When our men retreated, they halt the Sponinrd and Englishmen that were killed
behind them ; nud the mmgea, when they come up to them, killed them over ognin in

twi , in token of their victory; nflor which, they had the mortifieotion to see several
of their wounded I in full, dying with the mere loss of blood.

The Spuniurd governor lnu'ing drnwn his little body up together upon is rising
ground, Atkins, though he wus wounded, would Intro hurl them nlurch slnl elmrgo again

wounded men fight; let them alone till morning ; nll tho wounded men will be still"
zud sore with their wounde, and fuint with the loan of blood ; and m we shall hnvo tho
fewer to engrgt'." This udvioo was good: but Will Atkins repliul merrily, "That in
true, wignior, end so nhull I too ; and that is the reason I would go on while I um
worm." " Well, Seigninr Atkins," my: the Spnninrd, "you have behaved gnllnntly,
and done your port; we will fight for you if you onuuot come on ; but I think it best
to stay till morning :" no they united

led them round between the woods and tho sen-side westward, sud then turning ahert
south, they came so neor where the thickest of them lsy, that, More they were seen or
heard, eight of them fired in upon them. and did dreadful execution upon them ; in lndt'
s minute more, eight other>> fired utter them, pouring in their small shot in such a
qiumtity, thut abundance were killed and wounded; and all this while they were not
olale to see who hurt them, or which wny to fly.

. The Spaniards charged nguin with the utmost expedition, and then divided them-
selves into three bodice, and resolved to full in among them All together. They had in
each body eight persons, that is to any, twenty-two men, end the two women, who, by
the way, fought desperately. They divided the fire-emsoquolly in eneh party," wall as
the hnlbords and wives. They would have had the women kept beehhut they mid they
were resolved to die with their husbands Roving thus formed their little my, they
marched out from mnung the trees, and come up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting
Ind hullooing as loud us they could; the amigos stood all together, but were in the
utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together 2
they would have fought if they bud seen us; for as soon us we mmo near enough to be
seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Fridny wss wounded, though not dun-
gerounl)'; but our men gave them no time, but, running up to them, fired among them
three \rsys, and then fell in with the buttrende of their musket; their swords, nrmed
slaves, end halchetr, sud lsid shout them so well, that, in s word, they set up n dismnl
scmuuiug snd howling, flying to save their lives which wsy never they could.

Our men were tired with the execution, And killed or mortally wounded in the two
fights shout one hundred and eighty of them; the rest, being frightened out of their
wits scoured through the woods end over the hills, with all the speed feet sud nimblefest could help them to; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them,
they get all together to the sea-side where they luudcd, and where their canoes lay.
But their disaster was not at an and yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that
evening from the am, so that it was impossible for them to go ofi'; nay, the storm eon-
tinuing all night, when the tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven by the
surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it required infinite toil to get them off;
and some of them were even dashed to pieces against the batch, or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that night; but having
refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolved to march to that part of the
island where the savage: were tied, and see what posture they were in. This neces-
sarily led them over the place where the fight had been, and where they found several
of the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet post recovering life ; a sight disagreeable
enough to generous minds, for a truly great man, though obliged by the law of battle to
destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his misery. However, there was no need to
give any orders in this ease ; for their own savages, who were their servants, desmtohul
these poor creatures with their hutchets.

At length they came in View of the place where the more miserable remains of the
ravages' urmy lny, where there appeared about a hundred still ; their posture was gene-
rally sitting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth, and the had
put between the two hands, leaning down upon the knees.

When our men <<me within two muskctshots of them, the Spaniard governor
ordered two musket: to he fired, without ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that by their
countenance he might know what to expect, whether they were still in heart to fight,
or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might manage
accordingly. This stratagem tool: : for us soon as the savages heard the first gun, and
saw the flash of the second, they started up upon their feet in the greatest consternation
imaginable; and as our men advanced swiltly towards them, they all run screaming and
yelling away, with e. kind of howling noise, which our men did not understand, and had
never heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the eountry.

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and they had all
' gone away to am; but they did not then consider- that this might probably have been
the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least,
to come so many and so often as would quite desolate the islnnd, and starve them.
Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them, proved
the best munsellor in this case ; his advice was, to take the advantage that ofl'ered, and
step in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the oepwity of ever-
returning any more to plague the island.

They consulted long about this; and some were against it for fear of making the
wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate, and so they should have them to
hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have their plan-
tations continually rifled, all their tame goats dmtroyed, and, in short, he reduced to
a life of continual dishes.

_ \Vill Atkins told them they had better have to'do with a hundred men than with

a hundred nations; that as they must datroy their boats, so they must destroy the
men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed the necessity of it
so plainly that they all came into it ; so they went to work immediately with the
boats and getting some dry wood together from a. deed tree, they tried to set some of
them on fire, but they were so wet that they would not burn; however, ths fire so
hunted the upper part that it noon Iunde theln unfit for swimming in the sea as hosts

hawk into their country to tell the. story, the colony was undone ; so that, letting them know
thnt they ashuuld nut hnvcnny mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed
every one that the storm lunl not dostmyed before; at the right of which the savages
mixed it hideous e in the wooths which our people hennl plniu enough, after which
they mu nhont the. island like distracted men. tie that, in a word, our men did not really
know what at first to do with them. Nor did the Spnniurdzt, with all their pntdeucc,
t'tlflsitit'l" that while they made thowe pet-:de tliux denpernte, they ought to here kept 0.

Though our men were :dde to light them upon all matsions, yet they were in no
rendition to pumue them, or hunt them up and down; for us they were too nimble of
foot for our men when they l'onml them single, no our men thirst not go abroad single,

. for though their retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and their
lmrvext xpoiled, :Ind wlmt to do, or which way to turn themselvm, they knew not. The
only refuge they hnd now was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the awe,
and some little corn which grew there, and the phmtation of the three Englishmen.

killed by on arrow, whielt xtruek him on the aide of his head, just under the temples, w
thnt he never spoke mom; and it was very mmrknhle that this wzu the mute barbarous
fellow thut cut the poor inn-ego slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to
have murdered the Spnninrds.

I looked upon their cue to have been worse It this time than mine was at my
time, utter 1 first discovered the grniux of barley and rice, mid get into the manner of
plnuting and mixing my corn, and my tame mttle ; for new they had, no I may my, a
hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour everything they could come at.
yet could he hardly come nt themselves.

When they new wlmt their eircuiurtnnm were, the tint thing they concluded was,
that they would, it' possible, drive them up to the further part of the island, tenth-west,
thnt if any more ravages come on shore they might not find one another; then, thatthey would daily hunt end henna them, and kill a: many of them no they could come
nt, till they lmd reduced their number ; end if they could It lu't tune them, And bring
them to anything, they would give them corn, end tench them how to plant, and live
upon their daily labour.

In order to do this, they so followed thom,nnd eo terrified them with their guns, thnt
in n few day-lg if any of them fired n gun at no Indian. if he did not hit him, yet he
would full down for fear ; end so dreadfully frightened they were that they kept out of
night further nud further ; till, at lost, our men following them, and almost every day
killing or wounding some of them, they kept up in the wood: or hollow places so much
that it reduced them to the utmost misery for mat of food ; and many were nitorwerds
found dend in the woodx, without any hurt, absolutely starved to death.

When our men found this it mode their hearts mlont, Ind pity moved them, cape-
einlly the Spnninrd governor, who won the meet gentleman-like, generous-minded man

Thu poor wretches, thoroughly humbled. and reduced in number to about thirty-

them : upon which, twelve Sponinrdx and two Englishmen, well armed, with three
ind I idnvi-s :md old Friday. marched to the piece where they were. The three Indian
xdnvm curried tin-In u huge quuutity of breed, some rice boiled up to takes and dried

win-re they sent down, ale their pmvirions very thnnkfully, and were the meet Siithi'ul

They lmd mught them both to plunt corn, make breed, breed tune goats, and milk

were confined too neck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying
plain towurda the see before them. on the south-east corner of the islend. They had
luud enough, and it won very good and fruitful ; about I mile and a half broad, end
three or four milu in length.

Our men taught them to make wooden eludes, eueh no 1 mode for myrrh; and gave

among them twelve hatchet: and three or four knives ; and there they lived, the meet
" subjected, iuuoeeut creatures that ever were heard of.\VlLL ATKINS' TENT.

After this, the c )th" enjoyed a perfect tranquillity. with respect to the savages, till
I came to revisit them, which was about two years alter; not but that, now and then,
some canoes of savages cauue on shore for their triumphal, unnatural throats; but as
they were of several nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or
the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen ; and
if they had, it would have been very hard to have found them out.

Thus Ithiuk, I have given a full account of all that happened to them till my
return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians or savage! were wonderfully
eivilisml by them, and they frequently went among them ; but forbid, on pain of death,
any of the Indians coming to them, bmuse they would not have their settlement
betrayed again. One thing was very remarkable, \'i1.., that they taught the savages to
make wickemvork, or baskets: but they soon out/did their neuter-s; for they made abun-
dance of most ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly of all sorts of baskets, sieves,
bind-ewes, cupbozu'ds, &e.; as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of
other tluugs ; being very ingenious at such work, when they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we furnished them with
knives, aciznwnt, slauies shovels, pickoxes, and all things of that kind which they could
want. ""ith the help of those tools, they were so very handy that they came at last to
build up their huts or houses very handsomely, fiddling or working it up like basket.
work all the way round 5 whieh was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked
very odd, but was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as against all sorts of
vermin ; and our men were so taken with it, that they got the wild swag" to come
and do the like for them ; so that when I came to see the two Englisluuen's colonies,
they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in a hive. As for \Vill Atkins,
who was now become a very industrious useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself
such a tent of basket-work as, I believe, was never seen ; it was one hundred and
twenty paces round on the outside, nsI measured it by my steps; the walls were as close
worked ms a basket, in panels or square] of thirty-two in number, aml very strong,
standing about seven feet high ; in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces
round, but built stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood eight
very strong lusts; round the top of which he laid strong pieces, pinned together with

' wooden pills, fnun which he raised a pymmid for a roof of eight rafters, very handsome,
I assure you, and joined together very well, though he had no nails, and only a few
iron spikes, which he made himself too, out of the old iron that I had left there ; and,
indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had no
knowledge of : he made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the tire ; he
made himself charcoal for his work ; and he formed out of the iron crowso middling

' good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made many things, but especially hooks,
staples, and spikes, bolts, and hinges. But to return to the house : after he had pitched
the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up between the nfters with basketpwork,
so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over that a
large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry as if it had been
tiled or slated. Indeed, he ownerhthat the savages had made the basket-work for him.
The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, all round this inner apartment, and long
rafters lay from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about
twenty feet distant, so that there was a spice like a. in": within the outer wicker-wall,
and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.

The inner place he partitioned OH with the same wicker-work, but much fairer, and
divided into xix aparuuents so that he had nix rooms on a floor, and out of every one of
thew there mm a door ; find into the entry, or coming into the main tent, another door
into the main tent, and another door into the space or walk that was round it; no that
walk was also divided into six equal parts, which served not only fur a retreat, but to
store up any necemtrim which the family had occluiun for. Thm six spaces not taking
up the whale circumference, what other apartment: the outer circle had were thus
vnlm-d : Ax noun as you were in at the door of the outer circle, you hxul a short lavage
straight lfl'fllm you to the door of the inner house ; but on either aide was a wicker par-
tition, and a door in it, ll" which you went first into a large room, or storehouse, twenty
that wide and about thirty feet long. aml through that into another not quite so long.
so that in the outer eirvlu were. ten hundnome mount, nix of which were only to be come
at through the apartuu-nta of the inner tent, and served as closets or retiring-mam to
the n'xpectivu chambers of the inner circle; and four large wan-helmets or barns, or
what you please to null them, which went through one another, two on either hand of
the Inna-mgr, that led through the outer door to the inner tent.

Such a piece of lnixketpwurk, l lx'lieve, was never seen in the world, nor u house or
tA-nt Ml neatly contrived, much less so built. In this great bee-hive lived the three
tiuuilius, that is to my, \\'i|| Atkins and his companion; the third was killed, but his
wife remained with three children, for she was. it seems, hi with child when he died :
and the ether two were nut at all backward to give the \viduw her full share of every-
thing. i mean as to their earn. milk, grapes, d't'., and when they killed a kid, or funnd a.
turtle on the allure; m that they all lived well enough ; though, it was true, they were
not w industrious as the ether two, as has been nhaerved nlmtdy.

One thing, huu ver, mnunt be emitted, viz, that as for religion, I do nut know that
thew was any thing of that kind among them ; they often, indeed, put one another in
mind that there was a God, bv the \'erv mmmuu method of seamen, swearing by his
name: nor were their pom ignorant innago wives lunch better for having been married
- tn Christiana, as we must mll tlu-m ; for as the ' know very little of (led themselves, so
they were nth- ' capable of entering into any diam-urn: with their wivea nboutn God,
or In .ilk anyt a to them concerning I'l iun.

but to be well inatruetul in the Christian religion, andto belt-gully married; both which
were happily brought about afterwards by my menu; or at least in wusequence of my
coming muuug them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and pretty much of my run-
ngate English, I must my something of the Spaniards, who were the main body of the
liunily, and in whose story there are aome incidents alao remarkable enough. ,

1 had a gn-ut many diswum with them about their circumstances when they were
among the mvagtun. They told me mlily that they had no instances to give of theirhandful of people ; that if means had been put into their hands, they had yet so abandoned
themselves to despair, and sosunk under the weight of their misfortune, that they thought ,
of nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was con-
vinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise men to give themselves
up to their misery, but always to take hold of the help: which roman ofl'ered, as well for
present support Its for future deliverance : he told me that grief was the moat senseless,
innignilimut Fission in the world, for that it regnnled only things past, which were
generally imlwible to he recalled, or to be remedied, but had no views of things to

come, and had no share in mything that looked like deliverance, but rather added to the
269 .ulllictiuu thnn proposed It remedy ; and upon this he repented u Spanish proverb, which,
though I ommut repent in just the mine words thsthe spoke it in, yet I remember I
umde it into on English proverb of my own, thus :--

"ln trouble to be troubled,
Is to hue your trouble double ."

had found no bn-nd ; \rhemm here. they were only sustained with u few roots and herbs,
which they nuderstmul not, uud which lnrd no substance in them, and which the in-
tuntu gave them ulnn'ingly em gll ; u_nd they could trout them no better, unless they
wmxl-l turn ulnnilxtlu, and cut men's flesh, which was the great dainty of their country.

Tin-y gnvu me :Ill uewuut how runny wnys they strove to eivilioe the sinuses they
were with, uud to tux/ch them rutiorml erutonrs in the ordinary way of living, but in

those who could live without them.

They guve me dismal amounts of the extremities they were driven to ; how some-
timm they were many days without uuy food at all, the island they were upon being
inhnblhfil by n sort of suvuges that lived more indolent, and for that reason were less

voracious than thtue who had better nupplies of food. Also they Added, they could not
but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of
God dirt-eta the events of things in this world : which, they said, appeared in their cilu
. cunmanm ; for if, pressed by the hardships they were under, and the barrenntm of the
country when: they were, they had scorched after u better to live in, they hnzl then been
out of the way of the relief that happened to them by my means.

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived among expected
them to go out with them into their wan: ; and, it was true. that as they had fim~nrms
with them had they not had the disaster to lose their mnmunition, theyconld have been
m'rvicmhlu not only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible both to friends
and enemies ; but being without powder and shot, and yet in acnnditinu that they could
not in ":1an deny to go out with their landlords to their wars; so when they came into
the tirld of battle, they were in n worse condition than the savages themselvev, for they
had neither bows unv arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave them ; so they
could do nothing but stand still and be wounded with arrows, till they come up to the
teeth of their enemy; and then, indeed. the three halberdx they had were of use to them;
and they would olten drive a whole little army before them with three lmlberds, and
. ' pent-d sticks put into the muules of their muskets : but that, for all this, they were
i dimes xurnnunhal with multitudes and in great danger from their arrow); till nt
hut. they found the to make themselves large targets of wood, which they covered
with skim of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and these covered them fnnn
tlu trmws of the ravages: that, notwitth-uuliug these, they were sometinu-a in great
I gor : and tire of them were once knocked down urge-titer with the clubs of the savages,
which \vtu the time when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spnuinrd
whom I relieved : that at that they thought he had been killed; but when they after-
wards heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and
would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued him.

Thry told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of their company
resound them, and stood over them lighting till they were come to themselves, all but
him who they thoughthnd been dead ; nnd then they made their way with their hnlberds
and pieces, standing close together in n line, through a body ofnbove a thoumnd savages
beating down all that came in their way, get the victory over their enemies, but to their
great mrmw, [recluse it was with the lose of their friend, whom the other lmrty, finding
alive, carried oil', with some otheng as i gave an account before.

They descrilml, most ntl'eetionately, how they were mirprised with joy at the return
of their friend and connnnnion in misery, who they thought had been devoured by wild
beasts ot'lhe worst kind--wild men ; and yet, how more and more they were surprised
with the account he gave them of his errand. and that there wnsn. Christian in any place

' near, much more one that was able, and had humanity enough, to contribute to their
deliverance.

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief I sent them, and
at the nplwamuco of loaves of bread--things they had not seen since their coming to
that miserable place ; how often they crossed it; and blessed it a: bread sent from
heaven ; and what a rewiring cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the other
things I had sent for their supply ; and, after all, they would have told me something
of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to 08117 them any '0 the
person und place from whence all these new comforts come: but it was imposiblo to
express it by words; for their exeemive joy naturally driving them to unbecomingextmmgnnees, they had no way to describe them, but by telling me they bordered upon
lunacy, having no way to give vent to their passions suitable to the sense that was upon
them ; that in some it worked one way, and in some another; and that some of them,
through a surprise of joy would burst into tears, others be stark mad, and others
innnedintcly faint. This discourse extremely inflected me, and called to my mind Friday's
eostney when he met his futher, and the poor people's ecstucy when I took them up at
sea alter their ship was on fire ; the joy of the mate of the ship when he found himself
delivered in the plnoe where he expected to per'uh; and my own joy, when, after twenty-
eight years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country. All
these things made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men, and more effected
with it.

Having thus given a. view of the state of things as I found them, I must relate the
heads of what I did for these people, and the condition in which I left them. It was
their opinion, nnd mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the savages, or
if they were, they would be nhle to cut them off, if they were twice as many as before ;
so they hnd no concern nbout that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaninrd, whom I call governor, about their stay in the island ; for on I was not eoma
to curry nny of them ofl', so it would not be just to tarry off some and leave others, who.
perhaps, would he unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished. On the other
hand, I told them I came to establish them there. not to remove them ; and then
I let them know that I had brought with me relief of sundry kind for them ; that Ihml
been at n greet ehnrge to supply them with nll things necessary, as well for their conve-
nience as their defence ; and that I had such and such particular persons with me, sswell
to increase and recruit their number, as by the particular neeemry employments which
they were bred to, being nrtificcrs, to assist them in those things in which at present
they were in want.

They Were all wgether when I talked thus to them; and before I delivered to them
the stores I had brought, I Asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forget and
buried their first nnilnositiix that had been among them, nnd would shuke lmnds with
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, that so there might

- he no more misimderstnndings nnd julousiest

\\"ill Atkins, with nbundonce of frankness and good humour, said they had met with
atllietion enough to make them all sober, and enemia enough to make them all friends;
that, for his part, he would live and die with them, nnd wus so far from designing any-
thing ngminst the Spaninrds, thnt he owned they had done nothing to him but whnt his
own mud humour made necessary. and what he would have done, nnd perhaps worse, in

', their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish

things he had done to them, and wns very willing and desirous of living in terms of
entire friendship and union with them, and would do anything that lay in his power to
convince them of it ; and Its for going to England, he cared not if he did not go thither
these twenty years.

The Sp'miards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and excluded Will Atkins and
his two countrymen for their ill eonduct, as they had let me know, and they appealed to
me for the necessity they were under to do so ; but that Will Atkins had. behaved himself
so bravely in the great fight they had with the savages, and on several occasions since,
and had showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, tho genernl interest of them
all, thrit they had forgotten all tint was posed, and thought he merited as much to be _
trusted with arms and supplied with neoessories as nny of them; and they had testified_ ? unson's manna: 'AWIEE. '

their sstisfitction in him by committing the command to him next to the governor
himself; and as theyhsd entire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they
ncknowledged they had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest men

could merit to be valued and trusted ; end they most heartily embraced the occasion of _

giving me this assurance, that they would never hove nny interest separate from one
another.

Upon these frank and open declarations oi friendship, we appointed the next dsy to
dine all together ; and, indeed, we made: splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook end
his mate to come on shore and dreu our dinner, and the old cook's ninte we had on shore
assisted We brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork, out of
the ship's provisions, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it ; and, in particular, I
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English beer ; things tlnt
neither the Spaniards nor the English had tested for many years, and which it may be
supposed they were very glad of. The Spaniards ndded to our fenst five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent, covered up clue, on board the

ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we did with '

their salt meat from on board.
After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought my cargo of
goods; wherein, that there might be no dispute about dividing, I showed them that
there was a suficienuy for them ell, desiring that they might all tske on equal

quantity-t t the goodk that were for wearing; that is tony, equal when made up. As, first,
I dirtrihntrd linen nullicirnt to make every one of them four shirts and, at tho Spanianl'n
n-qumt, afterwards made them up six; these were exewliug comfortable to them,
h-n-ing been what they had long since forgot the use of. or what it was to vau- them.
1 allotted the thin Englixh stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make every one a light
coat, like a frock, which I judged fitmt for the heat of the wagon, cool and lame; and
onlrml that whenever they decayed, they should uunkr more, as they thought lit; the
like for pumps, allot-s, stockings hm, kc.

1 cannot expmu what pleasure, what satisfaction, not upon the countenance: of all
three poor men, when they new the care I had taken of them, and how well 1 had
furnished them. They told nu- I was a father to them ; and that having ruleh n com-s.
pendent at l was in are remote a port of the warm, it would make them forget that they
were loll. in a desolate place; and they all voluntarily engaged to "It" not. to leave the
place without my consent.

Then I prexented to them the people I had hmught with me, particularly the tailor,
themnith, and the two carpenters, all of them moat necessary people ; hut, above all, my
general artiticer, than whom they could not name anything that was more metal to
them ; and the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to worl: immediately, and,
with my leave. made them every one a xhirt, the first thing he did ; and, what WM at ill
nmre,he taught the women not only haw to new and stitch, and are the needle, but
made them th'lSt to make the shirt: for their hullnuda, and for all the rest.

As to the carla-ntent 1 Marco need mention how useful they were; for they tool: to
pivoes all my clumsy, unhaudy things and made clever convenient tables, atooht bedatmds,
cnplmrdx, loch-m, shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind. But to let them
rec how Nature made nrtilicera at first, I carried the carlwntA-n! to see \Vill Atkiua'
lashcl--homse, an I called it ; and they both owned they never yaw an instance
of auch natural ingenuity before, nor a dag so reguhtr and an handily built,
at least at its kind; and one of them, when he saw it, alter Innriug a good while,

a", turning about to me, "I am slum," says he, "that IIIIII) has no need of us; you need do
nothing but give him tools"

Then 1 brought them out all my store of tools, and gore every man a digging-spade,
a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harmwa or plough ; and to every separate place a
pirltaxr, a now, a broad axe, and a raw ; always appointing, that an often an any were
lnulu-u or worn out, they should beaupplied, without grudging, out of the general stores

more than he wanted, and he nmst he a tool that would waste or spoil them on any
account whatever; aml for the use of the amith I left two tons of unwrought iron
for a supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such, even to profusion,
that they could not but n-jeice at them; for now they could march, in I used to do, with
a musket upon each shoulder, if there wax occasion ; and were able to fight a tlunuzaud
xaragw, if they had but some little advantages of situation, which also they could not

274ADDITIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.

After n while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine n wny of thriving upon my
island, and considering that they hnd neither business nor acquaintance in the Knot.
India, or mson for taking so long n voyage, both of them came to me, sntl duired I
would give them lenvc to mnein on the island, and be entered among my firmily so they
called it. I ngmed to this readily ; nnd they hadn little plot of ground allotted tothem.
where they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded withnbeskebworlr, pollissdocd
like Atkins', adjoining to his plantation. Their tents were contrived so that they had
much of them n room npnrt to lodge in, end a. middle tent like a great storehouse, to lay
their gumln in, nnd to cot and drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed
their hnbit-ition to the same place ; and so the island was divided into three colonies,
nnd no inure--vim, the Spanisnls, with old Friday and the first servants, at my old
hnbitntion under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and when they had so
cnhrrgcd nnd extended their works, as well under sson the outside of the hill, that they
lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was there such n little city
in a wood, and so hid, in any port oftho world; for I verily believe that a thousand men
might have ranged the islnnd for :L month, end, if they had not known there was such a
thin and looked on purpose for it, they would not hnvo found it ; for the trees stood
so thick and so close, and grew so fnst woven one into another, that nothing
but cutting them down first could discover the place, except the only two narrow
entrances where they went in and out could he found, which was not very easy ; one of
them was close down at the water's edge, on the side of the creek, and it was afterwards
above two hundred yards to the place : and the other was up a ladder nt twice, as I have
uln'ndy described it; and they had nisu n large wood, thickly planted, on the top of the
hill, containing nbove an acre, which grew upnce, and concealed the plnce from all dis
rorery there, with only one narrow place between two trees, not easily to be discovered,
to enter on thnt side.

The only colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four families of English-
men, I mean thme I had left there, with their wives and children; three savages that
were slaves, the widow and the children of the Englishman that was killed, the young
man and the maid, and, by the way, we made is wife of her before we went away. Them
Wvl'c also the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me for them : also
the smith, who was a very necemry man to them, cspeeinllynsagnnsmith, to take cure
of their arms ; and my other man, whom I called Juek-of-uIl-trodes, who was in himself
as good almost as twenty men ; for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but n very
merry fellow, nnd before I went uwny we mnrried him to the honest muid that cune
with the youth in the ship I mentioned before.

And now I speMr of mnrrying, it brings me nntunllytomysomething of the French
ecclesizutic that l lmd brought with me out of the ship's crew whom I tool: up nt see.
It is true this man was a Roman, And perhaps it may give ofl'ence to some bores-Rev
if I leave nnything extraordinary upon record of n nun whom, before I begin, I must (to
set him out in just colours) represent in terms very much to his disadvantage, in the
nweunt of Protestants; as, first, that he was s Pnpist; secondly, a Popish priest; sud
thirdly, a French Popish priest. But justice demands of me to giro him in due chanc-
ter ; and I must say, he was I gave, sober, pious, nnd most religious person ; exact in
his life, extensive in his charity, and exemplary in nhuost everything he did. Whit,
then, can any one ssy ugsinst being very sensible of the value of such a msn, not'ith-

than you shall give me leave."

I told him his carriage wax so modest that I could not hut acknowledge it ; that it
was true we were such people as they called heretics hut that he was not the first Catholic
I had wave-sol with, without falling into inconveniences. or carrying the questions to
any height in debite; that he should not lind himself the Worst: used for being of n
difl'ereut opinion from us, and if we did not converse without any dislike on either side,
it should be his fault, not ounv.

He replied that he thought all our eonvermt-ion might be chilly separated from
disputes; that it was not his business to cup principles with every man he converse-l
with; and that he rather desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than a
n-ligiouist ; and that, if I would give him leave at any time to discourse upon rollgllllht
subjects, he would mldily oomply with it, and that he did not doubt but I would allow
him Alan to defend his own opinions as well as he could ; but that, without my leave.
he would not bleak in upon me with any auch thing. He told me, further, that he would
not. cease to do all that became him, in his ofliee nan priest, as well as a priv to ('In' '
lo pmenn'. the good of the ship, and the safety of all that was a her: and tho ,,
perhaps we would not join with him, and he could not pray with us, he hoped he
might pray for Ila. which he would do upon all oemaiona In this manner we con-
versed ; and as he was of the moat obliging, gentlelua e behaviour, on he was if I
may he allowed to 2er so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, of grant learning.

Ile gave me a most diverting account of his life. and of the mauyexlmonliuan'
events of it; of manv adventures which had hefalleu him in the few years that he had
lK'LIl abroad in the \wrld ; and lurtieularly it was re *r remarkable, that in the voyage
he was now engaged in, he had the misfortune to be li es shipped and unshiplmd,
and never to go to the place whither any of the ships he was in at that designed. That
his first intent was to have gone to Martinieo, and that he went on board a ship bound
thither at St. Malo ; but, being forced into Lisbim by bad weather, the ship receivul
some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river Tnglng and was obliged to
unload her cargo there; but finding a Portuguese ship the-rebound to the lla-leims'. and
ready to mil, and supposing he should easily meet with a \'tssel there bound to Mar-
tinieo, he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras': but the master of the Portu-
guese ship, being but an indifl'erent mariner, had been out of his reckoning. and they
drove to l-'yal ; where, however, he happened to find a very good market for his cargo,
u'hieh wax corn, aml therefore resolved not to go to the Madeinus but to load salt at
the 1910 01' may, and to go away to Newfoundland He had no remedy in this exigence
but to go with the ship, and hall a pretty good voyage as far as the banks (so they call
the place where they catch the fish), where, meeting with a French ship bound from France
to Quebee, iu the river of Canada, and from thence to Mnrtiuico, to carry provisions,
he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first design ; but when he
came to Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel proceeded no farther; so
the next voyage he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burned when we
took them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies, as I have already
said. Thus he had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in one
voyage, [aides what I shall have occasion to mention farther of him.

lint I shall not make digresion into other men's stories~ which have no relation to
my own ; I return to what concerns our ntl'airs in the island. He came to me one
pelled to be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at the furthest part
of the island ; I my, he came to me, nud told me, with a very grave countenancg that
he had for two or three daya desired nu oplnrtunity of some discourse witll me, which
he hoped would not be displeas'lllg to me, because he thought it vht in some measure
correspond With my general design, which wall, the prosperity of my new colony, and
perhaps might put it, at least men: than he yet thought itarnx, ill the way ofGod'a
blowing.

I looked a little surprised at tile hut part of his discourse-find turning ll little short.

ill the way of God's biasing, and yollr delligu is exceeding good, and will prosper: but,
.sir, though it were more so tllall it! even plrsible to you, yet there may be some among
you that are not equally 'igllt ill their actions: lllld you know, that ill the story of the
children of Imu--l, ol Aellan ill the camp removed God's blesing from them, and
turned his hand m agalnst them, that six-and-thirty of tllelll, though not concerned in
the crime, were the objects of Divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that punish-
ment." '

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his inference was so just,
alld the whole design seemed so sincere, allll was really so religion); ill its own nature,
that l was very sorry I had interrupted him, and begged him to go on; and, ill the
lllmlu time, becalum it seemed that what we had both to my might take up some time,
I told him I was going to the Englixshnlen'a plantations, and asked him to go with lur,
ulld we might diseouna: of it by the way. He told me he would the more willingly
wait on me thither, bcmllna'e there partly the thing was acted which he dexirul to speak
to me about ; so we walked on, and I pm] him to be free and plain with me in what
he had to rely.

" Why, then, sir," my: he, " be pluused to give me leave to lay down a few proposi-
tions, as tllo foundation of what I have to say, that we may not ditl'er ill the general
principles, though we may be of some dim-ring opinions ill the practice of particulars.
Find, Nil', though we dill'el' ill name of the doctrinal articles of religion (and it is very
unhappy it in w, eslmiully ill the case before an, as I shall rhow afterwards), yet there
are some general principles ill whicll we botll ngme--thnt there ill a God ; and that this
God harin-v given us some stated general rules for our service and obedience, we ought
not willing y and knowingly to olTelld llilll, either by neglecting to do what he has
eolaluanded, or by doing what he has cxprcady forbidden. And let our difl'erent
religions be what they will, this general principle is readily owned by as llll, that the
blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous ginning against his command;
and every good Christian will be ufl'cctionately concerned to prevent ally that are
under his care living ill a total neglect of God and his commands. It is not your men
being Protestants, whatever llly opinion may be of each, that discharges me from being
concerned for their souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they should
live in as little distance from enmity with their Maker as possible, especially if you Bi"
me leave to meddle so far in your circuit."

I could not yet imagine what be aimed at, and told him I granted all he had said,SOME DEFECTS IN GOVERNMENT.

and thanked him that he would so far concern himself for us, and begged he would
explain the particulars of what he had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own
parable, I might- pnt away the aceursed thing from ink

" Why, then, sir," says he, "I will take the liberty you give me; and there are
three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing upon your
endeavoum here, aml which 1 should rejoice, for your sake and their own, to see
removed. And, air, I promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all, as
soon as I name them ; calmially, Immune. I shall convince you, that every one of them
may, with great ease, and very much to your mtisfimtion, be remedied. First, sir," says
he. "you have here four Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the savages,
and have taken them as their wives and have had many children by them all, and yet
are not married to them after any stated legal manner, as the laws of God and man
require ; :uul therefme are yet, in the sense of both, no less than foniimtorsit'not living
in adultery. To this air, I know you will object that there was no clergymen or priest
of any ind, or any proftmiou, to perform the ceremony ; nor nny pen und ink, or paper,
to write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. And 1 know
also.sir. what the Spaniard govemor has told you, I mean, of the agreement that he obliged
them to make when they took these women, \'lL, that they should choose them out by con-
sent, and keep separately to them ; which, by the way,is nothing of anmrriage, no agree-
ment with the women as wives, but only an agreement among themselves to keep them
from quarrelling. But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he called it,
being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one
another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the
contract, to compel the man and woman, at all times to own and acknowledge each
other; obliging the man to abstain from all other women, to engage in no other contract
while these subsist; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them
and their children ; and to oblige the women to the same or like conditions, mitkllis
mnlaadir, on their side. Now, sir," says he, "these men may, when they please, or when
occasion pretentu, abandon those women, disown their children, leave them to perish,
aml take other women, and marry them while these are living ;" and here he added,
with some warmth. " How, air, is God honoured in this unlawful libertyl And how
shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, however good in themselves, and
however sincere in your design, while these men, who at present are your subjects,
under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by you to live in open
adultery l " '

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with the convincing
arguments he supported it with; for it was certainly true that, though they had no
clergyman upon the spot, yet a. formal contract on both sides, made before witnmes, and
continued by any token which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had
been but breaking a stick between them, engaging the men to own these women for
their wives upon all ocmsionr, and never to abandon them or their children, and the
women to the same with their husbands, had been an efl'ectual lawful marriage in the
sight of God ; and it was a great neglect that it was not done. But I thought to have
got ofl' my young priestby telling him that all that part was done when I was not there ;
and that they had lived so many years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was
past remedy ; nothing could be done in it now.

" Sir," says he, "asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right in this, that, it
being done in your absence you could not be charged with that port of the crime; but,l Inmh ynu, Ilnllrr nut ynnmll' that you are not, therefore, under an obligation to do
your utmoat now to put an end to it. How cmt you think but that, let the time put
lie on whom it will, all the guilt far the futon, will lie entirely upon you! because it is
certainly in your power lln\\' to put an end to it, and in nobody'a power hut your-L"

I was so dull atill that I did not understand him r'-'l t; but I imagined that, by

an end to it, he meant that I should part them, and not sufl'er them to lire
r any longer; and l mid to him I could not do that by any means, for that
won I pntthe whnlu inland inlu mnt'uaiun. He. seemed surprised that I almuld no fat-

speak of h; ital-ll?

I then pml him to tell me what wxnt the second complaint which he had to make,
ackimwlmlgiug that l mu very much his debtor for the tint, and thanked him heartily
for it. He told me he would uxe the same freedom and plainnus in the second, and
lull-ed I would take it at well ; and this wait, that notwithstanding these English subjects
of mine, as he called them, had lived with them women almost seven years, had taught
tIn-m ta spend: English and even t>> read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women
of wlemhle umlcrstamliug. and <<unable of instruction, yet they had not, to this hour,
taught them anything of the Christian religion--no, not so much as to know that there
wzu a God, or u wmahip, or in what manner God was to be served, or that their own
idolatry, and worshipping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said,
was an nummunmhle neglect, and what God would certainly call them to account for,
and lu-rhaps at last take the work out of their hands. He spoke this very nfl'ectionntely
. and warmly. "I am persuadul," says he, " had those men lived in the savage country
whence their wives cunn, the gauge: would have taken more pains to have brought
them to be idulntora, and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so for an I an
we. have taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true God. Now, air,"
mid he, " though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we wouldbe glad
" to we the devil's servants and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to know the geuenl
principles of the Christian religion; that they might, at least, hear of God and u
Redeemer, and of the mllrrection, and of a. future state--things which we all believe;
that they might, at leuxt, be so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true church

stny rrpon demrrrrugo ubove eight days morgjnd I have been here thirteen alremly ; so
thntI run perfectly unable to engage in this work, unlu I would suffer myself to he
left behind hm again ; in which use, if this single ship should Inisenrry in any port of
her voyage, I should be just in the Me condition thnt I was left in here nt first, and
from which I hove been so wonderfully delivered." He owned the ease runs very hnrd
upon mo us to nry voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether the blesiing
of swing thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had in the world for. I wns
not so sensible of thnt Is he was. I replied to him thus: " Why, sir, it is is valuable
thing, indeed, to be en instrument in God's head to convert thirty-seven heuthens to
the knowledge of Christ; but us you are an ecclesiustie, runl are given over to the
work, no it seems so nrrtnrrrlly to fell into the wuy of your profession ; how is it, their,
tlnrt you do not rather- ofl'er yourself to undertake it than pm me to do it 1"

Upon this he Steed about just before me, as he walked nleng, nnrl putting me to n
full stop, made me a very low bow. " I roost heartily thunk (ind nrul you, sir," said he,
" for giving me so evident o coll to so blessed at work ; nnd if you think yourself dis--
clurrged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most rendily do it, run! think it n
happy reward for all the hunrds and difficulties of srrch n broken, rlisnppoinIL-d' voynge
us I hnve rrret with, thnt I our dropped at Inst into so glorious it work."

I discovered n kind of rupture in his face while he spoke this to me: his eyes
slnr'kled like fire, his face glowed, end his colour more and went, us if he hurl been
falling into fits ; in a. word, he woe fired with thejoy of being embarked in suchn work.
I prursed n>> considerlble while before I could tell what to any to him ; for I wss
really surprised to find a men of'sueh sinwrity and ml, and curried out in his zenl
beyond the ordinary nrto of nren, not of his profusion only, but. even of soy profession
wlrntsoever. But after I hid considered it awhile, I asked him seriously if he wns in
utmost, and that he would venture, on the single consideration of no nttenrpt to convert
thm poor people, to be locked rrp in nu Implanted island for, perhnps, his life, rrnd nt Inst
might not know whether he should be able to do them good or not.

He turned short upon me, and asked me whnt I milled n venture. "Pnry, sir,"
slid he, "what do you think I consented to go in your ship to the East India for 1"
" Nny." mid I, " thnt I know not, unless it was to pranch to the Indium" " Derrbtless
it was," mid he; "and do you think, if I am convert these thirty-seven rrren to the
faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched off the
islnnd again i--nny, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many mule than my
life is or the life of twenty more of the mane profession! Yes sir," says he, " I would
give Christ and the blueed Virgin thanks all my days if I could be made the happy
instrument of saving the souls of those poor nrerr, though I were never- to get my
.' feet off this ishrnd, or see my native country any more. But since you will honour me
with putting me into this work, for which I will pray for you all the days of my life, I
have one humble petition to you besides." "What is that i" suit! I. " \Vlry," Myfilley
" it is that you will lrxrr'e your rnur Fridny with me, to be my interpreter to them, and

I Was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not think of parting
with him, and tbnt for many moons : he had been the companion of my travels ; he
was not only fuithful to me, but sincerely ufl'ectionnte to the lust degree; and I had
resolved to do something considerable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he
would. Then I knew that, Is I hld bred Fridny up to be u. Protestant, it would quite

They all gave me the nnawer I expeetul, viz, that there was nobody to marry
them ; that they agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives, aml to in-
tain them and mm them as their wivu: ; mul they thought, tux things stood with t -m,
they were as legally married as it'they had been married by a Inihsun, aml with all the
tbrlnnlities in the world.

I told them that no doubt they Wen- mnl'ried in the night of God, and were bound
in unwieuce to kwp them as their wives ; but that the laws ul' men being otherwiee,
they might desert the poor women and children hereafter : and that their wives, being
peer desolate women. friendlus and moneylest, would have no way to help Ihenuelves.
l then-hue told them that. unless I was usmrcd of their hound. intent, I could do
nothing for them, but \vould tnke care that whnt I did should be for the women and

. ehildreu without them ; and that, unhzx they would give me tome assumnets that they
would marry the women, I wuld not thin it was eunvenieut they xhuuld continue
together in! mm and wife; for that it wus both somdalous to men and etl'enrive to God,
who they could not think would blaze them it' they went on thus.

All thin went. on as I expected; and they told me, especially \Vill Atkins, who now
seemed to xpmk for the rest, that. theyloved their wives as well as if they had been born

_ in their own native country, and would not leave them on any account whatever; and
they did verily believe that their wives were as virtuous and m modest, and did, to the
utmost of their skill, ax murh for them mul for their children as any women could pm>>
aibly do: and they would not part with them on any account : and \Vill Atkim, for
his own lmrticular. added, that it' any man would take him away, and ofi'er to carry him

wnuld net go with him if he might not uirry his wife aml children with him; und
if there was a clergy-nun in the ship, he would be married to her now with all his

agreed to it with a good will, pereeiring the sincerity "this design.

eimnuxtaueea, and with the present design ; that he wzut very willing to perform that
part of hia l'inmtiun, and marry them, as I had desired ; hot that helium he could do it

open li- imtion; and that it was true that not ung but the consenting to marry, or
ell'wtually Pl'llttltltillg them from one another, could now put an end to it; lint there

N3.--Thin dialogue between Will Atkins end his wife I took down in writing, just
other he had told it me, which wee as follows.

Wife--Appointed by your God! Why, have you e God in your eountryl

ll'. A.--Yer, my deer, God is in every country.

"VA--No your God in my country ; my country have the greet old Benamuckee

Wile--No nurlrce de eu-th ; no you God mllree de mrth ; no unkee my country.

Will Atkins laughed A little at her expreuion of God not mnking her country.

Wife--No lnugh ; why laugh ruel This nothing to hush.

He vrls justly removed by his wife, for she was more serious than he at first.

ll'. A.--'l'hnt'u true, indeed; I will not lough any more, my door.

Wife--Why, you my you God melee nlll

ll'. A.--Yee, child, our God made the whole world, And you, and me, and all things;
for he is the only tnle God, and there is no God but him ; he lives for over in heaven.

would be left alone, and never be taught to know this God better : and last he should be
miserable, as ho had told her wicked men would he, alter death.

This was a strange account, and very sfl'octing to us both, but pu'ticulnrly to the young
clergyman; he was, indeed, wonderfully surprised with it, but under the greatest nfllic-
tion inurginahle that he could not talk to her, that he could not speak English, to nuke
her under-<<tend him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, he could not understand
her ; however, he turned himself to me, and told me that he believed that there must be
more to do with this woman than to marry her. I did not understwd him at first; but
at length he explained himself, viz, that she ought to be baptized. I agreed with him
in that part readily, and wished it In be done presently. " No, no; hold, sir," said he ;
" though I would hareherbc baptized, by all means, for I must observe that \Vill Atkins,
her husband, has indeed brought her, in s wonderful manner, to be willing to embrace a
religious life, and has given her just ideas of the being of a God, of his power, justice,
and mercy ; yet I desire to know of him if he has said anything to her of J urns Christ,
and of the aalvutiou of sinners; of the rmturo of faith in him, and redemption by him ;
of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection, the lustjudgment, and the future state."

I called "'ill Atkins again, and asked him ; but the poor fellow fell immediately
into team and told us he had said something to her of all those things, but that he was
himself so wicked a creature, and his own conscience so reproached him with his horrid,
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions that her knowledge of him should
lessen the attention she should give to these things, and nmke her rather wutcmu
religion than receive it; but he was tenured, he said, that her mind was so dispoM to
"wire due impressions of all those things, and that if I would but discourse with her,
she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labour would not be lost upon her.

.-\eeonliugly, I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter between my religious
priest nml the woman, I eutimted him to begin with her ; but sure such a sermon was
never punched by a l'onish priest in these latter ages of the world; and, as I told him,
i thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a. Christian, without
the error of a Roman Catholic ; and that. I took him to besuch nclergvmunusthe Roman
bishops were before the church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the con-

' aces of men. In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of
' Christ, and of redemption by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did
the first notions of a God, but with joy and faith ; with an afl'ection, and a surprising
degree of understanding, sauce to be imagined, much [em to he. exprcmod; and, at her
own request, she was haptised.

When he was prep-wing to baptise her I outreat-ed him that he would perform that
. nflice with some caution, that the man might not perceive ho was of the Roman Church,
if if lmible, because of other ill consequences which might attend a ditferenoe among us
. in that very religion which we were instructing the other in. He told me that as he
5 had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the oflice, I should see he would do it

in a manner that I should not. know by it that ho wean Roman Catholic myself, if I had I, . -

not known it. before; and so he did; for saying only some words over tohimself in Latin,
which I could not understand, he poured a. whole dishful of water upon the woman's
head, pronouncing in French, very loud, " Mary (which was the name her husband
desired me to give her, for I was her godlitthcr), I boptise thee in the name ofthe Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ;" so that none could know anything by it what
religion ho was of. He gave the benediction alterwards in Latin, but either Will Atkins
did not know but it was French. or eke did not take notice of it at that time.l ' A} k

for I never heard thnt the planters were ever uttueked or disturbed any more.

It now come into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the clergy that
the work of mnvorting the mrnges might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his
satisfaction, and I told him thnt now I thought that it was put in u fair way; for the

young woman I have mentioned above and "'1" .-\t s's \vit'e wen: become intimates;
uml this prudent. wligious young womuu lmd mrt'echwl the work "'ill Atkins hid begun ;

tion or eonvrmntlon in the world.

ll.r:nnr|n-xt into my mind in the morning before I went to them, tlmt' {stall the
nerdl'nl things I had to burn with them. Ihml not left them a llihle, in u l I showed

she inmginvd, for they were Irservnl for the comfort mid instruction of those thut e
mm-h better use of them than I had done.

I took om- ol' the llibloi in my pocket, mnl when I tune. to Will Atkius's lent. or
lune - and found the young woman and .-\tkin:<'s luptised wife had been disoouming of
religion togetln-r--tiur \\'ill Atkins told it me with :i "not deal ofjoy--f naked ifthoy
were together now, and he mid, 3 so I went into the house nml he with me, and we
found them h-gother very <<in r in diseomw. "Uh, sir," says "'ill Atkins, " when

I wengr-r; my wife has 'a t u new instructor : I knew I was unworthy, us I mu
imuqmble of tlmt wnrk ; that young woman hns been sent hither fmm heaven ; she is
enough to convert a. whole islnnd ol' savages." The young woman blushed, and rose up
to go away, but I desired her to sit still ; I told her she had it good work upon her
bonds, and I hoped God would hles her in it

\\'e talked u little, and I did not perceive that they lmd any book among them,
though [did not nsk ; but I put my hand into my pocket, sud pulled out my Bible.
" Here," said I to Atkins, " I have brought you an Assistant that perhaps you had not
hen-re." The man was so confininded, that he was not able to speak for some time; but
recovering himuclf, he takes it with both his hands, and turning to his wife, " Here,
my dear," says hr1 " did I not tell you our God, though he lives above, could hear what
we have saidi Here's the hook I prayed for when you and I kneeled down under the
hush; now God has heard us, and sent it." \Vhen he had said so, the man fell into
such transports of lumionnn>> joy, that between the joy of having it, and giving God
thanks for it, the team ran down his face like a child that was crying.

The woman was slnpriml, and was like to have run into a mistake that none of I13
wum aware of, for she firmly believed (lod had sent the book upon her hnahand'u
]I' tion. It is two that pmvidentially it wnu no, and might be taken so in a con-
smpmnt stonm' : but I ln-lic-vc it would have been no difficult matter at that time
In have lmsnudn-d the poor woman to have helieved that an oxpreoz memenger came
l'mm "raven on pin-pon- to luring that individual book; but it wns too seriona a matter
In youth-r any dclnxion to take place, no I turned to the young woman, and told her we
did not desire to impose upon the. new convert in her first and more ignorant under-
standing of things and begged her to explain to her that God may he very properly said
to answer our petitions, when, in the mum of his pmvidoncc, such things are in a par-
ticular manner brought to pom an we petitioned for : but we did not expect returns from
Heaven in a miraculous and particular manner, and it is a mercy that it is not so.

This the young woman did aflerwanls efi'ectnally, so that there was, I tenure you, no
priestcral't used llf'l'!' ; and I should have thought it one of the most unjustifiahle fraud):
in the world to have had it so. But the unrpriao of joy upon \Vill Atkins is really not
to he oxpressml ; and tln-ru we may be sure was no dellmiou. Sure no man was ever
mun- Ihankl'ul in tho world for anything of iLu kind than he was for the Bihla; nor, 1
helieve, never any man was glad of a ltihln- from a better principle; and though he had
lm-n a moat pmlligatn erratum, lu'atlstmllg, furious, and tlvslwrately wicked, yet this man
ii a standing rule to us :dl fur the well instructing children, viz, that lmrents allonld never
give over to tooth and instruct, nor ever despair of the succesu of their emit-aroma, let
the childvan ho t'\' so refractory, or, to appmmuce, iuwnuible toinxtruction; for, it evel
(toll, in his prov nice, touches the conscience of such, the force of their education
returns upon them, and the only instruction of parent>>: in not lost, though it may have
hot-u many yoant laid ash-op, hut some time or other they may find the bent-fit of it.
Thus it war with this poor nun: however ignorant he was of religion and Christian
knowlmlgo, he found ln- had some to do with now more ignunmt than himself, and that
the least part of the inulrnvtiau of his good father that now come to his mind was of use
to him.

Among the mt, it MCIlI'I'tNl to him, he mid, how his father need to insiut no much on
the inoxpvv-mihlu value of the ltihlr, aml the privilege and hlexliug of it to nations,
hunilics, and persons ; but he never entertained the limit notion of the worth of it till
now, when being to talk to hentheng savages and barbarians he wanted the help of the
written oracle for his omiutance.

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion, though she had one
and so had the youth, on hoard our ship, among their good>>, which were not yet brought
on sham And now, having said so many things of this young woman, I cannot omit
telling one story more of her and myuelt', which has something in it very instructive and
remarkable.

l have minted to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced--how her
mistnw was utarved to death, and died on ham] that unhappy ship we met at teen, andhow the ship's company were reduced to the last extremity. The gentlewoman, and her
son, and this maid, were first hardly used as to provisions, and at last totally neglected
and starved--that is to my, brought to the last extremity of hunger. One day, being
discoursing with her on the extremities they sufl'ered, I asked her if she could describe,
by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared. She told me she
believed she could, and she told her tale very distinctly thus :--

" First, sir," said she, " we had for some days fared exceeding hard, and sufi'ercd very
great hunger ; but at last we were wholly without food of uny kind, except sugar, ando
little winclund-nruter. The first day after I had received no food at all, I found myself,
towards evening, first empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to
yawning and sleep. Ilay down on the couch in the great cabin to sleep, and slept about
three hours and awelred 11 little refreshed, having taken a glam of wine when I lay down;
after being about three hours nwake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I found
myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down again, but could not sleep at all,
being very faint and ill ; and thus I continued all the second day with a strange variety
---fivst hungry, then sick again, with retchings to vomit. The second night, being
obliged to go to bed again without my food, more than a drought of fresh water, and
being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbsdoes, and that the mnrlret was mightily stocked
with provisions--that I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined very heartily.
I thought my stomach was as full ufter this as it would have been after a good dinner;
but when Iawuked, I was exceedingly sunk in myspirits, to find myself in the extremity
of famine. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its
having some spirit to supply nourishment , but there being no substance in the stomach
for the digesting oflice to work upon, I found the only efi'ect of the wine was to raise dis-
agreeable fumes from the staunch into the head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and
senseless, as one (lnink, for some time. The third day, in the morning, alter a night
of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I
nwaked ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not my understanding
returned and conquered it, whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little child
with me, its life would have been safe or not. This lasted about three hours, during
which time I was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master told
me, nutl as he can now inform you.

"In one of those fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down and struck my face against

the corner o'fu pallet-bed, in which my mistrem lay, and with the blow the blood gushed '

out of my nose ; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I set down and bled into
it u great deal ; and as the blood came from me, I come to myself, and the violence of
the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous port of the hunger. Then
I grew sick, and notched to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing 'in my stomsch to
bring up.

" After I had bled some time I swooned, and they all believed I was dead ;
but I came in myself soon alter, and then had a most dreadful pain in my stomach not
to be described--not like the colic, buts gnswiag, eager pain for food ; and towards night
it went ofl' with akind of unrest wishing or longing for food, something like, a: I euppow
the longing ofs woman with child. I took another draught of water with sugar in it;
but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again ; then I tool: a. dnught
of water without sugar, and that stayed with me ; and I laid me down upon the bed,
praying most heartily that it would pleas God to take me sway; and composing my
A mind in hopes of it I slumbered awhile, and then waking, thought myself dying, being light
. ' 305corned-1y wished that somebody Would throw me into the sen.

"All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thoughhexpiring. but here it with
much more patience tluni I,----gave the lastbit of bread she had now her child, my young
master, who would not have taken it~ hutsho obliged him to eat it ; and I believe it nved
his life.

"Tommie the morning I slept ngsin ; and when I awoke I fell into a violent passion
of crying. and after that had a second (it of violent hunger. I got up ravenous and in
u moat dreadful condition ; had my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I am
certain I should have mien a piece of her flesh withssmueh relish and us unconcerned as
over I did not the flesh of any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I was
going to bite my own arm. At lust I sow the husin in which was the blood I had bled
at my now the day before : I run to it, and swallowed it with such haste, and such n
greedy appetite, as if I wondered thnt nobody had taken it before, and afmid it should
be taken from mo now. After it was down, though the thoughts of it filled me with
horror. yet it checked the fit of hunger, and I took another draught of water, and was
mmpmed and refreshed for some hours after. Thiswns the fourth day ; and thus I kept
up till towards night, when, within the campus; of three houra, I had all the several
oirclunulnllces over again one after nnother, viL, nick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the
stomach, then ravenouu again, then sick, then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again.
mid so every quarter of an hour, and myatrcngth wanted cxcculingly; at night I lay me
down, having no comfort but in the hope that I should die before morning.

" All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger wesnow turned into adioeasc ; and I
luul a terrible calie and griping, by wind, instead of food, having found its way into the
bowels ; aml in this condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised by the cries and
lmucntntious of my young muster, who culled out to me that his mother was (loud.
I lifted myself up n little. for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead.
though she was able to giro very little signs of life.

"I hud then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of aome sustenance. an I cannot
describe ; with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, as nothing but the tortures
of death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen above cry
out, ' A mil ! n mil !' and halloo and jump abouts: if they were distracted.

"I was not able to get otl' from the bed, and my mistm much less ; and my young
quuler was so sick that I thought he hud been expiring; were could not open the cabin
door, or get any account what it was thatoeeasioned such confusion ; nor had_ we had any
conversation with the ship's company for two days, they having told us that they had
not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship ; and this they told us afterwards--they
thought we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we were in when you were
sent to save our lives ; and how you found us, sir, you know as well as I, and better
um."

This was her own relation, and in such a distinct account of starving to death as, l
confess, I never met with, and was exceeding enteruining to me. I am the rather apt
to believe it to be a true account, because the youth gave me an account of a good part
of it; though I must own, not no distinct and so feeling as the maid ; and the rather,
because it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own life: but the poor maid.
though her constitution being stronger than that of her misting, who was in years, and
u weakly woman too, she might struggle harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be
supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistren, who might be allowed

.hk 306

V, v' w .to keep the last hit something longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid: No

' ' quation, aa' the ease is here related, if our ship, or some other, had not so providentially

met them, a few days more would have ended all their liven, unlem they had prevented
it by eating one another; and that even, as their eaae stood, would have served them
but a little while, they being five hundred leagues from any land, or any possibility of
relief, other than in the miraculolns manner it happened: but this in by the way. I
return to my dixjmitiou of things among the people.

And, finct, it is to bc olmerved here, that for many reasons I did not think (it to let
them know anything of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of setting up among
them ; for I found, at least at my first coming. auch seeds of division among them, that
I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon every
light diaguat, have separated, and gone away from one another; or perhaps have turned
pirate, and no made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and
religious people, as l intended it ; nor did I leave the two piece: of brass cannon that I
had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew tool: extraordinary, for
the same muon : I thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against
any that uhouhl invade them, but not to set them up for an ofl'enaivo war, or to go abroad
to attack others ; which, in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon them :
l reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service another way, as I shall
observe in its place.

ll. in; now done with the island, I left them all in good circunutaneea, and in a
lluurislnng condition, and went on board my ship again on the 6th of May, having been
:rbmt twenty-live days among them; and as they were all resolved to stay upon the
i<luml till I mine to remove them, I promised tosend them further relief from the Bruzils
if I could lmaibly find nu opporumity ; and particularly I promised to send them some
cattle, such as sheep, hugs, and cows. A: to the two cows and calves which I brought
fmm England, we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them at two, for
want of bay to feed them.

The next day, giving them a salute of live guns at parting, we net mil, and arrived
'_ at the bay of All Saints in the Bmzils in about twenty-two dnyv, meeting nothing
remarkable in our lineage but this: that about three days after we had sailed, being
beatlmed, and the current setting strong to the RN15, running, as it were, into a bay,
or gulf on the land side, we were driven wmething out of our counse, and once or twice
our men cried out, " Land to the eastward !" but whether it wax the continent or inland:
we could not tell by any menus But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we am the sea, as it were, mvexrd towards the land with something
very black ; not being able to discover what it was, till alter some time, our chief mate,
going up the mainshromhi a little way, and looking at them with a perspective, cried out
it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an army, and thwartul him a
little hastily. "Nay, sir," says he, "don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too ;
for I believe there are a lllullmlld canoes, and younmy see them paddle along, for they
are coming towards us apace."

, I am a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew, the captain; for he had
heard such terrible atoriea of them in tho ialaml, and having never been in those seen
before, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three times, we should
all be devoured. I must confem, considering we were becalmed, "and the current aet strong
towards the share, I liked it the worse ; however, I bade them not be afraid, but bring
the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near an to know that we muat engage them.

and the enrpenter presently set up I kind of fence, like wuto boards, to cover them
from the nrrowe of the outrages, if they should shoot egnin.

About half an hour nlkrwnrdx they I" come up in o body Intern ofne, and so near
that we could euily dieeern what they were, though we could not tell theirdeeign ; und
I ennily found they wereeome of my old friends, the sum-snort of mvngen that I had been
used to eugnge with ; and in 1 short time more they rowed a little fartheront to see>>. till
they come directly broodxide with us, end then rowed down stmight upon us, till they
come no near that they could hear us speak ; upon this I ordered all my men to keep
elme, lat they uhould shoot uny more Irrows, and nude Ill our guns randy ; but being
no neu- en to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and all out aloud
to them in hin hugunge, to know wlmt they meant ; which iooon'lingly he did. \Vhether
they understood hilu or not, thut I know not ; hut in won as he had celled to them, six
of them, who were in the foremost or nighext boat to us, turned their convex from mi,
and steeping don-u, showed us their linked hacks ; whether this wus n deli-nee or chal-
lenge we knew not, or whether it was done in mere contempt, or as; n signal to the rest :
lint immmlinwly Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and, unlmppily for him, poor
fellow, they let lly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inexpmsesilile grief,
killed poor Fridny. no other nmu being in their eight. The poor fellow was idiot with
no lest than three arrow, and about three more fell very near him; xuch unlucky
umr'kxmeu they wow!

I \Vtus so enmged ut the lo-ei of my old trusty servant and connnnion, that I imme'
dintely ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot, and four with greet, and gave
them such : ' lmxulside mi they had never heard in their lives before, to be sure. They
were not above lmlfn cable'x length 011' when we lined; and our gunners took their nim
so well, that three or four of their canoes were overeat, m we hud reason to believe, by
one hlloi/ only.

The ill mnuuem or turning up their here back:- to mi guve us no grant ofl'euee;
neither did I know for vermin whether that which would pane for the grated contempt
:unung us might be understood so by them or not; therefore, ill return, I had only
r: Il\'ed to have lined four or five gum; nt them with powder only, which I knew would
' fi liteu them sulficiently : but when they shot at in: directly with all the fury they were
mpnlple of, mul caqioeinlly us they had killed my poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved
and valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifinhle
lx-fom God and man, but would have been very glud if I could have ovcniet every enuoo
there, and drowned every one of them. -

neither eat nor sptnk, mld we all fancied he would starve himself to death : but I took
a way to cure hinl ; for I made them lake him and turn him into the lung-boat, and
make him believe they would toss him into the sea again. and so leave him where they
found him, if he Would not speak : nor would that (l0, but they really did throw him
into the sea. and came away from him ; and tllell he followed tllem, for he swam like a
cork, and called to them ill his tongue, though they knew not one word of what he said ;
however, at last. they took him ill again, and then he began to be more tractable: nor
did I ever design they should drown him.

We were now under sail again, but I was the moat diseonsolate creature alive for
want of my nlau Friday, and would have been very glad to have gone back to the inland,
to hurt: taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion. but it could not he : so we
went on. "'0 had one prisoner, to: l have said, and it was a long time before we could
make him understand anything; but, in time, our men taught him some Engliall, and
he begin to he a, little tractable. Afterwards, we inquired what country he came from.
hut muhl make nothing of what he said ; for his speech was so odd, all gntturals, and he
spoke ill the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that. we could never for-ma wold after
him; and we were. all of opinion that they might spark that language as well if they
were gagged aa otherwise ; nor could we peweive that they had any oculsinn either for
lt'rth, tongue, lips, or palate, but filruled their wonlajuat as a hunting-horn forms a tune
with all open throat He told us, however, some time alter, when we had taught him
to speak a little English, that they were going with their kings to fight a great battle.
When he slid kings, we. asked hilll how lmlny kings. Hemid th ,y were live nation (we
mnld not make hilll undemtand the plural r), and that they all joined to go against two
nation. We asked him what made them come up to us. He said, "To maker to great
wonder look." Hemit is to be observed, that all those natives, as also those of Africa,
when they learn English, always add two e's at the end of the words where we use one ;
and they place the accent upon them, as make" takFe, and the like ; nay, I could hardly
make Friday leave it oll', though at last he did.

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last leave of him.
l'nov honest Friday! We buried him with all the decency and solemnity possible, by

| putting him into a command throwing hinl into the <<ea ; and I caused them to fire
eleven guns for hinl ; and so ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and
mast affectionate servant that ever man had.

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil ; and ill about twelve tloys' time we
made land. ill the latitude of live degrees south of the line, lieing the uorth-eastemmost
land of all that part of Ameriea. We kept on S. by E., in sight of the shore four days,
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an anchor ofl' the bay of
All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, from whence mule both my good and evil

Never ship come to this port that had lesa business than I had, and yet it was with
great dilliculty thlt we were admitted tohold the least correspondence on shore: not llly
partner himself, who was alive, and made a great figure among them ; not my two mer-
chant-tnisteea ; not the flulle of nly wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain me
that favour; but my partner, remembering that I had given live hundred moidoras to
the Prior of the Monastery of the Auguatiues, and two hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor,
and get leave for me personally, with the captain and one more. halides eight seamen, to

they must cut all their throats ; and it wu- ten to one but some of them might escape,
it being in the night, though the moon was up ; and if one escaped, he would run and
raise all the town, so they should have a whole army upon them : again, on the other
hand, if they went away and lefl those untouched, for the people were all asleep, they
could not fall which way to look for the town : however, the last was the best advice,
so they resolved to leave them, and look for the town as well as they could. They went
on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree ; thiS. they pmently concluded, would
be a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before
them, or the town behind them, and if they untied her, they should see which way she
went: if she went back, they had nothing to say to her; but if she went forward, they
would follow her: so they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow
went on before them, directly to the town ; which, as they reported, consisted of above
two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found soveml families living
together.

Here they found all in silence, a: profoundly secure as xleep could make them : and,
first, they called another council, to consider what they had to do; and. in a word,
they resolved to divide themselves into three bodies, and so set three houses on fire in
three parts of the town ; and as the men came out, to aeiu: them and bind them (ifany
resisted, they need not he naked what to do then), and so to search the rest of the
houses for plunder. But they resolved to march silently first through the town, and see
what dimonsionx it was of, and if they might venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture. upon them; but
while they were animating one another to the work, three of them, who were a little
before the rest, called out aloud to them. and told them that they had found Tom
Jeffry : they all ran up to the place, where they had found the poor fellow hanging up
naked by one arm, and his throat eut. There was an Indian house just by the tree,
where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had been
Concerned in the fray wilh m before, and two or three of them wounded with our
shot; and our men found they were awake, and talking one to another in that house,
but knew not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as before, that they swore
to one another they would be revenge-d, and that not an Indian that came into their
hands should have any quarter; and to work they went immediately, and yet not so
madly as might be expected from the rage and fury they were in. Their first euro
um to get something that would soon take fire; but, after a little seareh, they found
that would be to no purpose ; far most of the houses were low, and thatched with flags
and rushes, ol'wllieh the country is full; so they presently mode acme wildfire, as we

3 - call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands, and in a quarter of an

hour they set the town on fire in four or five plum and particularly that house
where the Indians were not gone to bed.

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened cmtturex began to rush out
to save their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt; and erpmially at the

door, where they drove them back, the bontswain himself killing one or two with his

polcaxe. The house being large, and many in it, he did not care to go in. but called
for a hand grcnndn, and threw it among them, which at first frightened them,
but, when it burst, mnde aueh havoc among them that they cried out in a hideous
manner. In short, most of the Indians who were in the open part of the house were
killed or hurt with the grenado. except two or three more who prmed to the door,

-.BURNING THE NATIVES' HOUSES.

which the bontawain and two more kept, with their lmyonets on the maules of their
pieces, and dispatched all that came in their way ; but there was another apartment in
the house, where the prince or king. or whatever he was, and several others, were ; and
there were kept in till the house, which was by this time all in a light flame, fell
in upon them, and they were smothered together.

All this while the ' fired not at gun. bemuse they would not woken the people fnater
than they could master them ; but the tire begun to waken them fast enough, and our
fellows were glad to keep a little together in bodies ; for the fine grew so urging, nll the
house; being innde of light combustible stufl', that they could hardly bar the street
between them; and their business was to follow the tire, for the enter execution.
As fast as the tire either forced lhe people out of those houses which were burning, or
frightened them out of otheix, our people wen: ready at their doors to knock them
on the head, still culling and hallooiug one to another to remember Tom Jelli'y.

"'hilo this was doing, I must control I was very uneasy, mid calmially when I now
the flames of the town, which, it being night, seemed to he just by me. My nephew,
the mptain, who was roused by his men, seeing such a tire, was very unemy, not
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I wa in, especially hearing the guns too.
for by this time they began to use their iireanns; ll thousand thoughts opprtxsed
hix mind concerning me mnl the supermrgo, what would become of us; and at last,
though he could ill spore any more men, yet not knowing what exigent-e we might be
in, he tnki nether boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes axhore to me.

He \ . rprised to see me nud the auwrcnrgu in the boat with no more than two
men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet he was in the sum: impatience
with to: to know what was doing ; for the noise mulinued, and the flame increased; in
:hort, it wax next to an impas'sibility for any men in the world to rextrain their
curiosity to know what had happened, or their concern for the Nli'ely of the men : in a.
word, the raptain told me he would go and help his men, let what would come.
I argued with him. ~< 1 did befo - with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of
the v0. 5', the in . .~t ol' the ownem and merchants, the" and told hi I and the two
men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was likely to be the
event, and come back and tell him. It was in ruin to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the not before; he would go, he mid; and he only n" bed he had left but.
tcu men in the ship, for he could not think of having his on hot for want.of
help; he had nlllu'r lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all; and nwny
he went.

I was no more able to stay behind now than l was to pet-anode them not to go;
so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, nnd fetch twelve
men more, leaving the long~hout at an anchor; and that, when they came back, xix
men should keep the two boats, and six more come utter us ; so that he left only
sixteen men in the xhip; for the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men,
whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this miaehief on.

Being now on the march, you may be sum we felt little of the ground we trod on ;
and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the place of
the flame. If the noise of the guns was surprising to us before, the cries of the
poor people were now quite of mother nature, and filled us with honor. I must
confess I was never at the melting in city, or at the taking a town by storm. I
had hmrd of Oliver Cromwell taking Droghetln, in Ireland, and killing num, woman,
and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sucking the city of Mogdebonrg, and

ndn one of them made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and came up
to Int.

As noon the the lmtuvnin saw us, he set up a. halloo like a shout of triumph, for
having, as he thought, more help come; and, without waiting to hear me, "Captain."
mys he, "nohlo mptain! I am glad you are come ; we have not half done yet.
Villanons hell-hound (logs! I'll kill an many at them as poor Tom Inez hairs upon his
head 1 \u have sworn to spare none of them ; we'll root out. the very nation of them
from the earth." And thus he ran on, out of Month, too, with action, and would not
give us leave to speak a word.

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little, " Barhnmus dog I" said
l, "what are you doing? I won't have one creature touched more, upon pain of
dmth : I charge you, upon ruur life, to utop your handn, and stand still here, or you are

t'l y have done! If you want a "mu for what we have done, conic hither." And
with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging, with his throat cut.

enough; but I thought they lnnl mrried their Inge too I': nd remembered Jacob's
wool: to hk mus Simeon and Len "Pulsed be their anger, for it wax fierce; and

the men 1 ca iml with me saw the night. as I had done, I had as much to do to
n-xtmin them at l xhould hm had with the others; in ", my nephew hiuwell' fell in
wilh Ihrm, and told me, in their hearing, that he me: only concerned for fear of the
men being orerlmwerul: aml as: to the peolde, he thought not one of them ought to
live: for lln-y had all glutted tlienm-lrex with the murder of the poor man, and that
Ihey ought to he road like murderers. Upon thyme words au'uy ran eight of my men,
with the heats unl his crew, to Complete their bloody wurk ; and I, seeing it quite
out of my pow to restrain them, came an- it'lhivt: and sud : for I could not bear the

' It, mueh haw the horrible noise and cries of the poor Wrotches that fell into their
hands.

1 got nolmly to come back with me but the snpercarg and two men, and with
these Walked haek to the boat. It was a wry great piece ut't'olly in me, I confess, to
venture back as it were alone; for M it hogan: now to be almost day, and the alarm had
run over the emmtry, there xtuod about forty men armed with lances and how, at the little
plme where the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentionml before ; but by accident I
n <<ed the place. and eamc din-ctly to the sea-aside ; and by the time I got to the sea-
ude, it wasl d day : immediately I took the piunace and went on lxuml, and sent
her haek t at the men in what might happen.

I observed, about the time that I came to the hontvside, that the tire was pretty well
out, and the noiw abated; hat in about halfan hour after I got on board, I heard a
volley "four men's fire-anus and slw a gmt smoke: this; ax I nndenttood nflarwan'ls,
was our men falling upon the men who, as I said, stood at the few houses on the way,
of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, uml set all the house: on fire. but did not

. meddle with the women or children.
' lly the time the man got to the shore again with the pinunee, our men began to
appear ,- they tame dropping in, not in two bodies as they Went, but straggling hem
and them in meh a manner, that a small force of resolute men might have cut them all
otl'. But the dread of them was upon the whole country ; and the men were surprised,
mnl so frightened. that I believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight ofbut
335five of our men ; nor in all this ten--ible action was there a man that made any consider
able defence; they were so surprised between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack
of our men in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves; for if they
fled one way, they were met by one party; ifback again, by another: to that they were
everywhere knocked down ; nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one
that sprained his foot, and another that had one of his hands burned.

I was _very angry with my nephew, the captain, and indeed with all the men, in
my mind, but with him in particular, as well for his acting so out of his duty as oom-
munder of the ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon him, as in hix prompting.
rather than cooling, the rage of h'm blind men, in sobloodynnd cruel an enterprise. My
nephew answeml me very mnx'ctl'ully, but told me that when he new the body of the
poor summn whom they had murdered in so cruel and barlluronx a manner, he was not
nnuter of himself, neither could he govern his prunion : he owned he should not
have done no, as ho was commander of the ship ; but as he was a man, and nature moved
him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me at
all, and they knew it well enough ; so they took no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any mom ofit Onrmell dill'ered in the
aomunt of the number they had killed ; but according to the beat of their accounts, put
all together, they killed or destroyed about one hundred nml fifty people--men, women,
nml children, and left not a house standing in the town. As for the poor fellow Tom
J etl'ry, as he was quite dead (for his threat was ac cut that his head washall' on), it would
do him no ice to bring him away; so they only took him down from the tree where
he was han In; by one hand.

However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it, and I always
after that time told them God would blunt the voyage; for I looked upon fill the blood
they shed that night to be murder in them. For though it in true that they had killed
'l'om Jell'ry, yet J el'l'ry was the nggnmor, had broken the trace, and had violated a young
woman of theinr, who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the public
eapitulntion.

The boatawain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards on board. He mid
it was true that we seemed tobmk the trace, but really had not; and that the war was
begun the night before by the natives thernselverg who had shot at mi and killed one of
our men without any just provomtion ; no that as we were in a capacity to fight
them now, we might also be in a calamity todo ourselves juxtice upon them in an
extnwrglinary manner ; that though the poor man had taken a little liberty with the
\vench, he ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a villainous IIIarnrer ; nml
that they did nothing but what was juxt, and what the lawn ol' God allowed to be done
to murderers.

one would think this should have been enough to have warned us against going on
shore amongst heathena and barbarians; but it is impomible to make mankind wine
but at their own expense; and their experience seems to be alweyx of most use to them
when it is dearat bought.

\Ve were new bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the coast of Com-
nmnrlel, only to teach at Surat ; hat the chief of tho superelrgo'a dedgn lay at the Bay
of Bengal ; where, if he missed big business outward-bound, he ms to go up to Chino,
and return to the coast as he come home.

The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, where five of our men,
venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the gum were surrounded by the Arabians,and either all killed or uu-riod way into slavery; the not of the boat's cm were not
Aide to male them, and had but just time to get ofi' their boat. I began to npbrlid
them with the just ntribuh'on of Room in this use; but the hoauwain very
wnnnly told me, lie' thought I went further in my cenanrea than I could show any
"mm for in Scriptnge ; and referred-In Luke xiii. 4, where our Snriourintimatea
that thw'l'nogn on whom the Tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the
Gelileam: but tint which put me to ailenee in the case won, that not one of these
five men who were now lost were of those who went on shore to the manure of
hhldagnaean--m I always ulled it, though our men could not bear to hear the wonl
manner: with any pntieanee.

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject hul worse oonxequeuces than
I expected; and the boatawain, who had been the head of the attempt, came up
boldly to me one time, and told me he found that I brought that afl'air con-
tiuunlly upon the stage; that I made unjunt reflectioux upon it, and lmd used the
men very ill on that account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a pamngrr.
and had no enmmand in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to
lmr it; that they did not lmow but I might have some ill design in my hand, and
pcrhupa to call them to an account for it when they came to England; nnd that.
therefore. unless I would restolve to have done with it, and also not to concern myself
any further with him, or any of his oil'nira, he would leave the ship ; for he did not
think it snl'c to soil with me among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him that I confessed
I lmd all along opposed the massacre of Mndagnsazr, and that I had, on nll oomioxu,
spoken my miml freely about it, though not more upon him than any of the rest ; that
on to having no command in the ship, thut was true; nor did I exemine nny nuthority,
only took the liberty of speaking. my mind in things; which publicly concerned us all ;
nud w'hnt concern I had in the voyage was none of his husiucu ; thnt 1 WM n considerable
owner in the dip. In that claim, I conceived I had n. right to spell: even further
tlmn I lmd done, and would not be acmuntnble to him or any one else, and began
to ban little wnvm with him. He made but little reply to me at that time, and I
; thought the nfl'uir had been over. We were at this time in the mad at Bengal; and
being willing to see the place, I went on shore with the snpcrenrgo, in the ship's boat,
to divert myself; and townrda evening wax preparing to go on board, when one of the
men come to me, and told me ho would not hove me trouble myself in come down to
the boat, for they had order: not to carry me on board any more. Any one may guus
what a surmise I was in at to iuxolont a message; and I asked the man, who bade him
deliver that manage to me. He told me the eoxswnin. I said no more to the fellow,
but bode him let them linow ho had delivered his message, and that I had given him
no answer to it. .

I immediately went and found out the summon-go, and told him the story. adding,
what I presently foreaw, that there would be amntiny in the ship; and entrusted
him to go immediately on board the ship in on Indian boat, and acquaint the captain
of it. But I might have spend this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on

\ ' : shore, tho mntmrwasefl'ecud on board. The bootewain, tho gunner, the carpenter,

and all the inferior oflieers, as soon as I was gone ofi in the boat, came up, and desired

to speak with the captain; and there the hoata'ain, making a long haraugne, nnd

repeating nll he had nid'to me, told the captain in a few wordagthat an I was now gone

peaceably on shore, they were loth to use any violence with me, which, if I had not

.-_-----~--__----_*_

pmlml for swing any port of the world which I ha] never seen before could possibly
come nnIisn to me.

It wax, however, some time before we could get I ship to our mindl, end when we
hnd got n van-L it was not easy to get English sailors ; that is to any, so many M were
neceevnry to govern the voyage nnd munge the milom which we should pick up
there. Alter some time we got u mute, n heauwnin, end a gunner, English ; a Dutch
carpenter, and three foremnxt men. With these we found we could do well enough,
having Indinn xenmen, such as they were, to make up. V

Then: on: so mnny travellers who have written n history of their voyager end
tnu-ehz this wny, thut it would he very little diversion to anybody to given long account
ol'the plneex we went to, and the people who inhabit there; that: things I leave to
others, and refer the render to those jnumnix nnd tnIvelx of Englishmen, of which
mnny l liml um puhlixhul, nud more promised every day; it ix enough for me to tell

u that we mnde thin voyage tn Aehin, in the islnnd of Snmntrn, and from thence to

I. when: we exchnnged some of our waves for opium and some nrrnck ; the first a
commodity \vllieh lionm n great price among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was
much \vnnted there. In n word, we went up to Suxknn, mnde a very great voyage,
wen ight months out, nud rotnmod to Bengal ; and I was very well satisfied with my
ml\'rntnm. l (blM'l'Vt! tllut our people in Englnnd olhen admire how ntlieent, which the
('nmpnny sen-l into lndin, nnd the merehnnts which generally stay them, get such very
grout extntm us they do, nnd mmetimm come home worth sixty or xerenty thousand
ponmls at n time; but it in no wonder, or at lumt we xhull see no much further in!>> it
when 3 considrr the iunnmenible ports and places where they have n free commerce,
thnt it will be none; and much lam it will he so when we eonxider that at these plum
and ports where the English xhipx come, them in luleh great and conntant demands for
the growth of nll other countries that there is In certain vent for the returns M Well m
n umrket nhmud for the goodx carried out.

In short, we nnule A very good voyage, and I got so much money by my first
ndveutnre,nud such an insight into the method of getting more, thnt had I been twenty
yum: younger, I ashould have mu tempted to have xtnyed here, nud nought no further
for making nny fortune; hut whnt WM ell thin to n mnn upwnrtls el' threesome, thnt

" ' \vns rich enough, and enme- uhmnd more in obedience to n restless desire of seeing the

wurhl than n eovetmu dauire of gaining by it! And, indeed, I think it is with great
iINlice I now call it Imtleau (lesim, for it Was no. \Vhen I was at home, I wnx mtlem
to go nbrmd; nnd when l wus nhmed, I was mtless to he nt home. I my, wlmt was
this gnin to me? I was rich enough nlmdy, nor hnd I nny unemty desires nbont
getting more money ; nnd therefem the profit of the voynge to me was of no great force
for the prompting me forwnnl to further undertakings: hence, I thought that by this
\'oynge I lnid mnde no program at all, because 1 me come hack, on I might call it, to
the place from whence I come, M to n home : whereas. my eye, like thnt which Solomon
:peekn of, was never satisfied with seeing. I was come into a part of the world which
I \vnx never in before, and that part, in particular, which I had heard much of, end was
resolved to see us much of it as I could : and then I thought I might my I had mu all
the world thnt we>> worth seeing. .

But my fellow-tmveller and I had different notions: I do not name this to insist on
my own, for I neknowledge his were the montjust. end the more suited to the end of n
merchant's life: who, when he in abroad upon ndventurwee, is wise to stick to that, M
the best thing for him, which he is likely to get the most money by. My new friend; lu-pt himself to the nntnre of the thing, and would have been content to have gone like \
n uu'ricr's home, nlwnys to the mute inn, backwnrd and forward, provided he could, as
he tolled it, find his account in it. On the other hand, mine was the motion of n mud,
mud-ling hey, that never cores to see a thing twice over. But this was not all : I had
n kind oriunenienre upon me to be uenrer heme, and yet the most mnettled resolution
inunginnble which way tn go. In the interval of these couxulurtionu, my friend, who

'vt upon the search for husinem, pmpox'ed another voynge to me among the

IIIS, and to bring home a landing of clever from the Mnuillns, or thermboulu ;

though \\'I- wont not so far, but to some other, when: they hnve not the whole power, on

We were not long in pl'l'lerl'iug for this voyage; the chief diflieulty won in bringing
me to none into it; however, nt heat, nothing else adoring, and limli thnt really

' :nul had more mtisl'netinn to my miml, than sitting still, which, to
me eslm'lnll' the unllnppiest pert oflife, I mlvml on this voyage too, which
we made \ . I('P('.'k\'r|lll.\', touching nt llorneo, nnd severnl islnndn whom nnmm I do

.\ly fi'ii d, when we mnde up th' ' neeonnt, smiled ut me : " \Vvll, new," mid he, with
n mrt ofng ' ' udolent temper, "is not this better than walking
about here, ht: ' " g to do, and spending our time in storing nt the

not lmnds enough to go to N" with, he lny by at Beugnl ; and having, it neelnx, got
money enough, or lwing willing, for other misc-us, to go for Europe, he gave public I .
notice he would sell his ship. This mum to my enrs belhre my new partner heard of
it, nml I had .1 grout mind to buy it; so I went to him mnl I told him of it. He
wnsidered awhile, for he was no rush nmn neither; lmt musing mine tlme, he replied,
" She is it little too big; but, however, we will hnve her." Accordingly, we bought the
tdlllt, :nnl ngreeing with the neuter, we paid for her, and took Imitation. \Vhen we

we inquired much about them, and at length were told that they were all gone together

Surat, - nl go by the sen, to the Gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me n good while, as tlmt I should mire the oppor-

' of fellows lln'y were; for, in xhort, their history was, that this mnn they
called captain was the gunner only, nut the commander; that they had been a
{hiding voyage. in which they had been attacked on shore by some of the Malays
who had killed the cuptuin and three of his men ; and Chet, alter the captain was
killed, tin-so men, eleven in number, lmd resolved to run away with the ship,

which they did. and brought. her to Bengul, leaving the nutlc and five men more
on share.

\Vn-ll, let them gut the ship how they would, we came honestly by her, M we
'_ thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as we ought;
for we never inquired anything at the seamen, who would certainly have fidteml
in their account, contradicted one another, and perhaps contradicted themselvas ;
somehow or other we should have had reuon to lure xuxpocted thom ; but the nmn
showed tn: .1 bill of sole for the <<hip. to one Emunuel Cloak-mhovcn, or some such nume,

our harguin.

"l mu tell you hut part of the story, sir," my: be ; "but I have n. Dutch awn-n
hero with me, and I believe I could perxundo him to tell you the rest, though there in

you know well enough--that you were with this ship at Sumatra ; that there your

captain wna murdered by the Malaya; with three of his men ; and thnt you, or some of -

those that were on board with you, hm away with the ship. and are einoe turned pirates.
Thin is the sum of the ntory, and you will all be seized aspirates, I can mum yon, and

is, to be out of the danger. If you have any regzml for your life, and the lives ofnll
your men, put to may. without. firil at high water; and no you have a whole tide before
you, you will be gone too fur out before they c.\n come down ; for they will come nwny
at high water, and as they have twenty miles to come, you will get near two hours of
them by the difference of the tide. not reckoning the length of the way ; bladders, as they
are only 1mm, and not ship>>, they will not venture to follow you far out to see,
especially ifit blown." "Well," said I, " you hnve been very kind in thin: what ell-ll
I do for you to make you amends 1" "Sir," says he, "you may not be willing to make
me my amends, bemuso you may not be convincul of the truth of it. I will mko an
offer to you: I have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship --, which I
mute out of England in ; and the Dntchmnn that is with me has seven months' pay due
to him. If you will make good our pay to us, we will go along with you ; if you find
nothing more in it, we will dame no more; but if we do convince you thut we have
saved your lives and the ship, nnd the lives of all the men in her, we will lenve the rest
to you."

I consented to this readily. nnd went immediately on board, and the two men with
me. As soon :m I come to the xhip's side, my partner, who wars on board, come out on
the quarter-deck, nnd called to me, with a great deal of joy, "0h, ho ! 0h, ho l we hove

stopped the leek--we have utopped the leak !" "Say you no i " said I ; "thenl: God! .

but weigh nnehor, then, immulintcly." "\Veigh !" says he ; "wiltt do you mean by
that? \tht is the matter?" " Ask no question," said I ; "but all hands to work,
and weigh without losing a minute." He was surmised ; but, however, he culled the
captain, end he immediately ordered the nuchor to be got up ; and though the tide nu
not quite down, yet it little lend-brew Blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called
him into the cabin, and told him the Italy ; nnd we called in the men, and they told us
the reetofit; but u it tool: npn gmtded of time, before we had done, I. scum

" full of men." " Very well," raid 1, " then itiuppuent there is something in it" In
the next place, I ordered all our men to he called up, and told them that there was In
denign to seize the ship, mul to take us for pirates, and talked them if they would stand
Ivy In, and I ' ne another; the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would

way or other to dispose of the ship, and come back in some of the vcsels of the country,
such as we could get. This wns npproved of as the best method for our security; and
accordingly we steered ewny N.N.E., keeping nbove fifty leegnu 011' from the uxunl
cannon to the eutwnrd. This, however, put us to some inconvenience; for, first, the
winds, when we come that distance from the shore, xeemed to be more steadily egeinxt
us, blowing almost tmde, us we cell it, from the E. nud PIKE, so that we were A long
while upon our voyage, end we were but ill provided with victunls for so long 1 run ;
and, what wua still worse, there was some danger that those English and Dutch shim

llixlluncst or fraudulent, much lean-4 thievish ; I luul chiefly been my own enemy, or, er
I mny rightly my, I had been nebody's enemy but my own; but now I memlxrrnuased
in the worst condition imaginable; for though I was perfectly innocent, I we: in no
condition to nudre that innocence nppmr; end if I had been taken, it had been
under n summed guilt of the Wont kind--at least, a crime esteemed so among the
people I lmd to do with. Thin nnule me very anxious to mnko nn escape, though
which wny to do it I knew not, or what port or plnce we should go to. My partner
seeing me thus dejected, though he won the meet concerned nt first, began to
enununge mo, and describing to me the several port: of that coast, told me he
would put in on the cmut of Cochin China, or the Boy of Tonquin, intending oner-
wnrds to go to .'Iurzm, A town once in posse-"inn of the Portuguese, and where still a

Hither, then, we mlrml to go; nud accordingly, though after u tedious nnd

court wry curly in the morning; and upon reflection on the pest circumstances we
were in, and the danger if we luul not camped, we resolved to put into n small river,
which, however, luul depth enough of water for us, end to see if we could, either over-
lund or by the idlip's piunncc, come to know whut ships were in any port thereubouk
This lmppy step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for though we did not immediately see
any European ships in the Bay of Tonqnin, yet the next morning there come into the
buy two Dutch ships; and a third, without any colours spread out, but which we
believed to be e Dutchman, passed by at about two lcegucs' distance, steering for the
coast of Chinn, end in the afternoon went by two English ehipe steering the same
course; And thus we thought we saw ourselves bceet with enemies both one way and
the other. The place we were in wee wild and barberolm--the people thieves, even by
occupation or pmfession ; end though. it is true1 we lied not much to seek of them, and,

We were in u sniull river of this country, within a few league: of it! utmost limits
northward ; end by our bunt we eoeatcd north-cut, to the point of land which opens
the great Boy of Tonquin; and it we: in this beating up along the shore that we
dixcovernl we were surrounded with enemies. The people we were among were the
roost hurl-<<mus of all the inhabitants of the coat having I16 correspondence with any
other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, nnd nueh groan commodities; and it may
be lmrticulurly seen that they Ire the meet barbarous of any of the inbubitents. Among
other cuntnnw. they have thin one--that if any vessel has the misfortune to be ship-
wrecked upon their mt, they pmntly make the men all prisonem or slaves; and itwns
not long beforo we found a piece of their kindnea this wny, on the occasion following.

I have nbuerved above, that our ship aprung a leak at see, and that we could not
find it out; and it happened that, an I have said, it won atoppod unexpectedly, in
the happy I rte of our being tobe seized by the Dutch and English ships near the Bay
of Siam ; yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly tight and sound in we desired, we
resolved while we were nt this place to lay her on shore, and take out whut henvy
thiugx we hnd on board, and clean her bottom, if poekihle, to find out where the
leaks were. Amn'dingly, having lightened the lhip, and brought all our guns and
other movubh-s to one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come ut her
bottom; but, on second thoughts, we dil not mm to luy her on dry ground, neither
could we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabimulx. who had never been acquninled with such a sight, came wondering
down the shore to look nt urz; und seeing the ship lie down on one ride in such n
mnnn r, nml lu g in toward); the shore, lllll not seeing our men, who were nt work
on her bottom \vrth stages, and with their book on the omnidv, they presently concluded
thut the ship "not out nwuy, nud lay first on the ground. On thix supposition, they all
mine ubeut us in two or three hourn' time, with ten or twelve lnrge bonus having some
of them eight, some ten men iu n hurt, intending, no doubt, to have come on board nnd
plundered the xhip, uud if they found un there, to burn curried us away for shiver:
to their king, or whatever they call him, for we knew nothing of their gov lnlor.

""lwn they come up to the ship, and began to row round her, they discovered us all
hnnl at work on the outside of the adiip'x bottom and ride, washing, and gmving, and
Hopping, nu every seafaring umu knows how. They stood for A while gazing at uu, and
we, "do wr-n'a little surprised, could not imagine what theirdeeign was; but being
wil lg to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into the xhip, and others
to hand down onus and ammunition to thoeo that were ut work, to defend themselves
with, if there should be occasion; audit was no more than need--for in line than
n qunrter of all hour's counultutinn, they agreed, it seems, tlmt the ship was mlly a
wreck, and thut we were ull at work endeavouring to save her, or to save our live! by

' - the help of our bout: ; and when we hnndul our arms into the bent, they concluded, by

that motion, that we were cnderwouriug to save some of our goods: upon thix, they
took it for granted we all belonged to them, and away they come directly upon our men,
us if it lnul been in a line of battle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we luy but in nu ill
posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what they should do. I immediately
celled to the men that worked upon the stages to slip them down, and get up the side
into the ship, nnd bude these in the bout to row round and come on board ; and the few
who were on board worked with all the strength and hands we bed to bring the ship to
rights ; but, however, neither the men upon the #56! nor those in the boat: could do us, z x

'- From thence we sailed etill north, keeping the coast of China at on equnl die- ,

usually come ; being molved. if possible, not to fall into any of their hands. especially
./ in this country; where, M our circumstances were, we could not tail of being entirely
ruined

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved he put into the first
trading port we should come at; and standing in for the share, about came of two
leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot on bonrd, who, knowing us to be a
Eurolnrnn ship. came to oll'er his net-vice, whichI indeed, we were glad of, and took hiln
on board ; upon which, without arking u: whither we would go, he dismissed the boat

I thought it was now no much in our choice to make the old man carry us whither
we would, thnt I begnn to talk to him nbout carrying us to the Gulf of Nunquin, which
in the most northern part of the coast of China. The old man said he knew the Gulf
of Nnnqnin very well ; but smiling, asked on what we would do there. I told him we (I

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was very opinionated

 

i" or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, and that we had a i
5 mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch of '3;
China. " Why, then," aye the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where, by the river . <<.
which runs into the sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the greateanal.

Tlrirr canal is a navigable stir-arm, which gees through the heart of that vast empire of
China, crosses all the rivers, 1m some considerable hills by the help of shrines and gates,
and goes rrp to the city of I'm-kin, being in length near two hundred and seventy leagues."

" Well," said I, "Seignior Portuguwe, but that is not orrr business now ; the great
question is. it'you can arrry us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we our travel
to Pekiu afterwards l " He said he could do so very well, and that there was a great
Dutch ship gone up that wayjust before. This gave mo a little shock, for it Dutch
ship was now our terror, and we had much rather have met the devil, at hast iflre lard
not come in too frightful a figure ; and we depended rrporr it that a Dutch ship would
be our destruction, for we were in no condition to fight them ; all the ships they trade
with into those parts being of great burden, and of much greater force than we were.

The old man found nu: a little confused, and under some concern when he named a
Dutch ship, and said to rue, "Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of the Dutch ;
I suppose they are not now at war with your nation 'I " "No," said I, "that's true ;
but I know not what liberties rncu rrray take when they are out of the reach of the laws
of their own country." "\Vh ',"says he, "you are no pirates; what need you feorl
They will not meddle with peaceable merchants, sure."

If I had any hluod in my body that did not fly up into nry face at that word, it was
hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to cirerrlate it, for it put rue
into the gmtest disorder and confusion imaginable; nor was it lmible for rue to
conceal it so, but the old man euily perceived it.

" Sir," mys he, "I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts ut rrry talk ; pmy
be pleased to go which way you think (it, and depend upon it, I'll do you all the service
I can." "Why," seiguior," said I, " it is true I am a Iitle unsettled in my resolution,
at this time, whither to go in particular; and I aru something more so for what you
said abuutpinrtes I hope there are no pirates in these seas. \Ve are but in an ill
condition lo meet with them, for you see we have but a small force, and are but very
weakly nrrrnued." " 0h, sir," says he, " don't be concerned ; I do not know that there
have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen yennr, except one, which was seen, as I
hear, in the Bay of Siam, about a ruorrth since ; but you may be assured she is gone to
the southward; nor wax she a ship ofarry great force, or fit for the work. Slro was not
built for a privxtcer', but was run away with by a reprobate crew that was on borrd,
alter the captain and some of his men had been murdered by the hIalnyarrx, at or near
the island of Sumatra." maid I, seeming to know nothing of the ruetter, "did,
thry murder the captain 1" said he, "I don't understand they murdered hiur ;
hut, as they afterwards run away with the ship, it is generully believed that they betrayal
him into the hands of the Mrrluyarrs, who did murder him, and perhapn they procured
them lo do it," " Why, then," said I, " they deserve dmth as much as if they had done
it themselvmr." " Nay," says the old mun, " they do deserve it ; and they will certainly
have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they have all agreed
together. that if they meet that rogue, they'll give him no quarter." "But," mid I
to him, " you my the pirate is gone out of these seas ; how an they meet with him,
then 1" "Why, that's true," rays he, " they do say so ; but he was, as I tell you, in the
Buy of Siam, in the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some Dutchmen who
belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore when they ran away with her ; and
some English and Dutch traders being in the river, they were within 9. little of taking
him ; uay,"said be, "if the foremost boats had been well seconded by the lest, they had
certaiuly taken him; but he, finding ouly two boats within reach of him, tacked about,
- and firul at thoae two, uml dimbled them before the others ea up, and then standing
oil to N'xl, the others were not able to follow, and so he got away; but they have all
:0 exnet a description of the ship, that they will he sure to know her ; and wherever
they find her, they have vowed to give no quarter either to the captain or mmerr, but
to hang them all up at the yard-arm." " What ! " mid l, " will they execute them, right
or wrong I lumglhem find, and jrrdge therrr allerwants l" " 0h, sir," rays the old pilot,
" there is no need to make a formal brminess of it with such roguw an those; let them
tie them back to hook, and set them a diving--'tis no more than they rightly tlmn'e."

I knew I laid my old man that on bonrd, and thot he could do no harm, no that I
turnul short upon him. "Well, now, seignior," mid I, "this is the very reason why 1
would have you carry us up to Nunquin, nml not put back to Mama, or to any other

ilrwlont fellows, that neither know what belorrgx to justice, nor how to belnrre them-
selves as the laws of God and nature diner. ; but being proud of their ofliem, and not
understanding their power. they would not the rrumlerers to punish robbers ; would take
upon them to insult rncrr falsely accused, and determine tlre'ru guilty without due
impriry; and perhaps 1 may live to bring some of thorn to account for it, when they
may be taught how justice is to be executed, and that no man ought to be trmted
as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the man."

M-rved we I told him the masons I hud to believe the story of killing the master by

fiction of their own to suggeat that the men had turned piralea, and they ought to have
been sure it was so before they ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist
them ; adding that they would have the blood of those men whom we killed there in
just defence to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were very much in the
right to go away to the north ; and that, if he might advise us, it should be to sell the
ship in China, which we might very well do, and buy or build another in the country.

were not the man that firxt went at? with the ship, but innocently bought her for their
trade ; and I am persuaded they will so far believe Incas at last to act more cautiously
for the time to come."

While these things were priming between us, by way of discourne, we went forward
directly for Nanqnin, and in about thirmeu daya' sail came to an anchor at the south-
west paint of the great Gulfnf Nanquin ; where, by the way, I came by accident to
understand that two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that I should
certainly fall into their hands. I consulted my partner again in this exigency, and he
was as much at a less as I was, and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost
anywhere; however, I was not in each perplexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if
there was no creek or harbour which I might put into and pursue my business with the
Chinese privately, nnd be in no danger of tho enemy. He told me if I would sail to
the southward about forty-two [mg-<<n. there was a little part called Quiuchang, where
the fathers of tho mimion usually landed from Macao, on their progres to teach the
Christian religion to the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in ; and if I
thought to put in there, I might consider what farther course to take when I was on
shore. ll'e confereuxl, he said, it was not a place for merchants, except that at some
certain times they had a kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over
thither to buy Chinese merchandist.

\Ve all agreed to go back to this place ; the name of the port, as he called it, I may
perhaps Rpell wrong. for I do not particularly remember it, having lost this, together
with the names of many other places set down in a little pocketbook, which was spoiled
by the water by an accident, which I shall relate in its onlcr ; but this I remember, that
the Chinese or Japanese merchants we (arrespolldcd with called it by n difl'erent name
from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as above, Qainchang.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed the next
day, having only gone twice on shore when: we were, to get fresh water ; on both which
occasions the people of the country were very civil to us, and brought abundance of
things to sell to us; I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tee, rice, and some fowl: ; but
nothing without money.

"'1: did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary) for five days; but it
was very much to our satisfaction ; and I was joyful. and I may my thankful, when I
set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of
ourselves and efl'eets any other way, though not every way to our satisfaction, we would
never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel more ; and indeed, I must acknowledge.
that of all the circumstancu of life that over I had any experience of, nothing makes
mankind so completely miserable as that of being in constant fear. \Vell does the
Scripture my, " The fear of man bringcth a snare :" it is a life of death, and the mind
in so entirely oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief; and all the rigour of Nature
which usually supports men under other afllictions, and is present with them in the
greatest exigencies, fails them here,

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by heightening every danger;
representing the English and Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or
of distinguishing between honest men and rogus; or between a story aleulnted for our
own turn. made out of nothing. on purpose to deceive, and a two genuine account of
our whole Vomo, progress, anal daign ; for we might many ways have convinced any
msonnble creature that we were not pirates ; the goods we had on board, the course
we steered, our frankly showing ourselves. and entering into such and such ports; nud* 2.33; ' -

Iy room for a defence. W'e reflected that there milly was so much apparent
cridenee before them, that they would scarce inquire alter any more; as, first, that the
ship was certainly the same, and that some of the seamen among them knew her, aml
had been on board her; and, xeemnlly, that when we had intelligence at the rirer of
Cambodia that they were coming down to examine Ins we fiurght their boats and lied;
so that we made no doubt hut they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates as we
were xi slied of the contrary; and, as I often mid,l know not but I should hare

la-li ing. or lu'l'llzllm considering, what they might have to offer in their defence.

llat let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions; and both my lmtner
and I min-e slept a night without dmu ng of hullem and yard-annx, that is to my,
gihlu-ts; of lighting, and being taken ; of killing, and being killed; and one night I
was in such a fur' ' dream, fiiucying the Dutchmen had boarded Ins aml l wax

caluiu I lay in With such a force as wounded my hand grievously, broke my knucklms

Another apprehemion l had was the cruel usage we might meet with l'mm them if
'we tell into their hands ; then the atnrynf Amhoyua came into my head, and how the
Dutch might ln-rhapa torture ux, as they did our countrymen there, aml make some of

These things torun-nuxl me, and my Iru'tuer too, u' ht and day ; nor did we consider
that the captains of ahipshad no authority to act thus; and if we had surrendered

haven which all men drive at, rig, to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in
new aorrowx by my own unhappy choice ; and that I, who had eaeaped no many dangers
in my youth, should now come to be hanged in my old age. and in on remote a place,
for a. crime which I was not in the least inclined to, much lees guilty of:

After these thoughta, something of religion would come in; and I would be con-
xiduring that this seemed to me to be a. disposition of immediate Providence, and
I ought to look upon it and submit to it as such ; that although I was innocent as to
men, 1 war far from being innocent M! to my Maker; and I ought to look in and
examine what other crimen in my life were most obvious to me, and for which Pm-
videuce might juntly iullict thia punishment an a retribution; and that I ought to
snlnnit to this just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had pleased God to have brought
such a dimter upon me. '

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place, and then I would be
talking myself up to vigorous: resolutions ; that I would not be taken to be berharoludy
used by a parcel of incmilm wretchex in cold blood; that it were much better to have
fallen into the hands of the ravages, though I was aure they would feast upon me when
they had taken me, than those who would pcrhapa glut their rage upon me by inhuman
uni-mm alnl bnrboritiea ; that in tho ease of the aavages, I always resolved to the
lighting to the hut gasp, and why should I not do so now, seeing it was much more
dreadful, to me at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to
think of being arteu by men 1 for the "V8850, give them their due, would not eat a man
till he was killed and dead, but thae men had many arts beyond the cruelty of
drnth. Whenever theme thought! prevailed, I was sure to put myself intoa kind of
fever with the agitation of a aupposed fight; my blood would boil, and my eyea sparkle,
an if I wmz engaged, and I always resolved to take no quarter at their hauda; but even,
at hurt, if I could mint no longer, I would blow up the ahipnnd all that was in her, and
leave them but little booty to booat of.

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexitiu of these things were toour thoughts
while we were at sea, the greater was our satisfaction when we saw ouraelvea on shore ;
and my partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his back, which
he um to carry up a hill, and found that he was not able to Itand longer under it ; but
that the Portuguese pilot came and took it oil' his book, and the hill disappeared, the
ground before him appearing all smooth and plain: and truly it was no ; they were all
like men who had a lead taken off their backa. For my part, I had a weight taken oil'
my heart that it wax not able any longer to bear; and an I said above, we resolved to
go no more to sea in that ship. \thn we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now
our friend, got us a lodging and a warehoiuc for our goods, which, by the way, was much
the same ; it WM a little heuxle, or hut, with a larger houaeadjoining to it, all built with
eaueag and paliaadoed round with large amen, to keep out pilfering thieves of which, it
moms, there were not a fewin that country : however, the magistrates allowed an alittle
guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of halberd, or hdflpike, who atood aentiuel at
our door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, about the
value of threepencc, per day, so that our gooda were kept very safe.

The fair, or mart, usually kept at thia place, had been over some time : however, we
found that there were three or four junkx iu the river, and two J apanueu, I mean ahlpe
from Japan, with goods which they had bought in China,.and were not gone away,
having some Japaneae merchants on show

. The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us wan, to get us acquainted with 'i-ill'
three mimicnary Romish priests who were in the town, and who had been there some ' r.
time converting the people to Christianity ; but we thought they made but poor work 'V
of it and made them but sorry Christiana when they had done: however, that was a

r none of our business One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon ;
another was a Portuguese ; and the third o Genoese; but Father Simon was courteous, 'fi'l

'5 easy in his manner, and very agreeable company ; the other two were more reserved. l

' seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they came about, viz, /. .
to tall: with and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, whenever they had

i , opportunity. We often ate and drank with those men ; and though, I must confess, '-

' l the oonversion, as they eall it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so 1hr from the true

I conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ. that it seems to

l amount to little more than letting them know the name of Christ, and say some prayers

to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they understand not, and to cross

I themselves and the like ; yet it must he oonfesed that the mligioniata, whom we call

l missionaries, have a firm belief that then people will he saved, and that they are the

I instruments of it; and on this account, they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage,

l and the hannls of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself; and the most violent

tortures, for tho euko of this work.

" But to return to my story :--This French priest, Father Simon, was nppointed, it

me to go that journey; telling me how he would show me all the glorious things of that :'7
mighty empire, and, among the rest, the greatest city in the world ; " a city," said he,
., d " that your London and our Paris put together cannot be equal to." This was the city
of Pekin, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of people ; but, as I looked
on those things with difl'erent eyes from those of other men, so I shall give my opinion
i '- of them in a few words, when I come in the oourae of my travels to speak more per-
'.. ticularly of them.

,rfh. But first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one day, and being
1"? very merry together, I showed some little inclination to go with him ; and he premed

' Father Simon," says my partner, "should you desire our company so muchl you know
SS . we are heretics, and you do notloveuanor cannot keep us oompany with any pleasure."
" "Oh," says he, "you may perhaps be good Cutholice in time; my businers here is to

, discourse very well, and it began to put use in mind of my priest that I hid [on in the '~,
' ' Bmils; but this Father Simon did not come up to his character by n great deal; for '."_
though Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal levity in him, yet he had not ./.-

Ax thin in the only excnraion of the kind which I have made in all the accounts I
qu'r given of my travels, so I ahall make no more, such ; it is none of my bllsillcsit, nor
any purt of my dcoign ; but to give an account of my own adventures through a life of
inimitable wanderingg and a lung vnriety of Cllllllgfls which, perhaps, few that come

I'lilfl'h, dim-rt runntriess und numerous people, I have yet to pure; through, mare than
relates to my own xtnry, and which my concern among tlu-m make Inventory.

I wnx now, an near an I can compute, in the heart of China, about thilty degrees
north of the linr, for we were mtunied from Nalnpiin. I had, indeed, a mind to ace
the t y of I'ekiu, which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon impoltunml mu
daily 0 do it. At length hix time of going away being not, and the other mimimiary
who was to go with him being arrived from Macao, it was neoiuwy that we should
nwh'e either to g0. or not ; so I referred it wholly to my partuer, and left it wholly
to his ehnice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative, and we prepared for our
jnnnn-y. \\"c set out with very good ndvantage, an to finding the way; for we got
lame to travel in the retinllc of one of their Inaudarinu, a kind of Viceroy or principal
mngistnu in the province where they "side, and who take great smite upon them.
travelling with grmt attendance, and great homage from the purple, who are sometimes
greatly innmverishrd by them, being obliged to furnish provisions for them and all
their attendants in their journeys. That which I particularly nlmrved in our
tnn'vlling with his baggage, was thin, that though we received luflieiunt provisions
both for ourselves and our horse: from the country, in belonging to the mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for everything we had, alter the market price of the enuntry.
and the mamluvin's steward collected it duly from us; no that our travelling in the
mtinne of the mandarin, though it wnua very gmtt kindness in us, wan not such a
mighty fnvnnr in him, but was n great mlvautage to hi . considering then: were above
thirty fltlll'l'llfilllll' travelled in (he nune manner besides mg under the pmtmtiun of

took our money for them.

Nlllllll't'tl with our own, but not so to these poor wretchen, who know no other.
The pride of the people is infinitely grind, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty,
in some parts, which adds to thnt which I call their misery; and I must needs think
the native savages of Amerit-n live much more happy than the poorer sort of these,
because as they have nothing. so they desire nothing; whereas, that: am proud and
inwlent, and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudgeg; their ostentation
is inexpreuible; and, if they an, they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves,
which is to the lust degree ridiculouu, on well "the contempt of all the world but
themselves.

unmet of some of the piece. I touched at in this journey.

"At length we arrived It Pekin. I had nobody with me but the youth whom my
nephew the captain lied given me to attend me an e ucrmnt, and who proved very truaty
and diligent; and my pertner had nobody with him but one servant, who wus n kins-
man. As for' the Portugueee pilot, he being desirous to see the court, we bore his
clutrgce for hie company, end to use him as am interpreter, for he understood the

luugulge of the Country, dud spoke good French and e. little English; and indeed
this old man we: I meet uneful implement to w; everywhere; for we had not been
above a week at Pekin, when he came laughing. " All, Seignior lnglere," says he, "I

had abundance to make or merry with. In short, he told us there wax u grout caravan
of Meteorite end Polinh merchants in the city, preparing to set out on theirjourncy
by land to Mnecovy, within four or five weekn ; and he mu: sum we would take the
opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind to go back ulune.

I confess I was greatly Iurprined with thin good news, und hell ammo power to upmk
to him for eome time; but It let I turned to him. "How do you know thiul" said
I : "am you euro it ie'truel" " Yes," eeye he; " I met this morning in the street on

wus to be done; nnd I naked my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and
whether it would suit with hie nflhiul He told me he would dojuxt as I would ; for
he lllti rattled all his nfi'eirl so well It Bengal, end left his efi'ectu in such good hands.
that an we had mode 1 good voyage here, if he could invest it in Chino silks, wrought

Having resolved upon this, we agreed thet it'our Portugume pilot would go with wr,

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I ' soldier that llu ixjnst ready to run any. My old pilot was ol' my mind ; end being

nesr me, called out: " Seiguiur Inglese," says he, " thoee fellow: must be eneonnged, or
they will ruin Iu sll ; for if the Torture eome on, they will never stood it." " 1 Nil of
your mind," my: I ; " but what mint be donel" " Done!" my: he "let filty of our
men advance, and lieuk them on each wing, end eneonrnge them, sud they will light
like lnnve follows in bravo eomlinny; but without this, they will every men turn his
buck." Immedintely, I rode up to our leader, end told him, who was exactly of our
mind ; end eeconlingly filly of us enrolled to the right wing, and lilty to the lefi, and
the rest made a. line of rescue ; end so we numbed, lenving the hut two hundred men
in make u body by themeelvul, end to guerd the camels ; only (hot, if need were, they
should mud a. hundred men to mist the hut lilty.

lu n word, the 'l'nrtnr-s cnme on, end an innumenhle company they were; how
many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we drought, was the least; n. party of them
mine on first, and viewed onr posture traversing the mound in the front of our
line; nnd, us we found them within gunshot, our lender ordered the two wings to
ndvnnec swiltly, nnd give them A solve en eech wing with their shot, which was done ;
and they went ofl; I suppose hook, to give on ueoount of the reception they were
like to meet with ; end, indeed, that mlnte cloycd their Man-melts, for they immedintely
halted, stood nwhile to consider it, end wheeling off to the left, they gave over their
design, end said no more to us for thnt time ; which was very ugreeehlo to our eir_-
rnmxtnncex, which were but very indifl'erent for n bottle with Inch 3 number.

Two days after, we came to the city of Noun, or Nenm : we thenlrod the summer
for his care of no, and collected to the vnluo of n hundred crowns, or thembents,
which we guve to the soldiers! sent to guard us ; end here we rested one day. This
is n gurrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reunion
of it wus, that formerly the Mnmovite frontier! IAy neerer to them than they now do,
the .'lnscoviteo lnwing elnndOned that pert of the country, which lies from this city
west for about two hundred miles as desolate 'eud unfit for use ; and mom especially
being so very remote, and so diflicult to send troope thither for in defence ; for we were
yet above two thousand miles from Muecovy, properly so called.

Alter thhg n'e [unused soveml greet rivers, and two dreadful deserts ; one of which
we were sixteen ihnys [urging ever, end which, as I said, we: to be celled no nmn's

to the Cmr ol' Mnseevy, was filled Argnnn, being on the west side of the river Angelle.

I could not but discover en infinite Intiefnction that I won so soon arrived in, as
I called it, n Christina country, or, at lent, in a country governed by Christians ; for
though the )lilmwites do, in my opinion, but just deserve the "nine of Chrintinne, yet
such they pretend to be, end are very devout in their way. It would eertninly
occur to any men who travels the world as I have done, and who had any power of
n-flwrien, whet n blessing it in>> be brought into the world where the name of (led
and n Redeemer is known, Idem-d, nnd worshipped ; end not where the people, given
up by "town to strong delusions, worehip the devil, and prostrate themselves in
stocks and stones ; worship monitors, element, horrid-aheped animals, and etetneo or
images of monsters. Note town or city we passed through but bed their moths,
their idols, and their temples, sod ignonet people worshipping even the works of their

religion was owned, and the name of the true God was called upon and alored; and
it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the breve Scots merchant I mentioned
above with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking him by the hand, I said to '
' him, " Blamed be God, we are once again among Christians" He smiled and answered. ,
" Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Museovim are but an odd sort of
\ Christians; and but for the name of it, you may see very little of the substance for
'\ some months farther of our jounmy." "Well," says I, "but still it is better than
ingan'uen and wonihipping of devils." " Why, I will tell you," says he. " except the
ltuuian soldiers in the garrison, and a few of the inhabitants of the eitiu upon the
road, all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by
" the worst and most ignorant of pagans" And so, indeed, we found it

nent of land into America, the Lord knows where; though I could give some reasons
why I believe that to be a mistake.

As we entered into the Muscovite dominion: a good while before we came to any
mnsidenible towns, we had nothing to observe there but this : first, that all the rivers
nut to the east; as I understood by the charts, which some in our caravan had with
them, it was plain all those riveis nui into the great river Yaniour, or Geniour ; which
l'i" , l|_\' the natuinl course of it, must run into the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The
story they tell "it, that the mouth of this river is choked up with bulnishes of a mon-
strous growth--viz, three feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high--I must be allowed
to my, I believe nothing of it ; but, as its navigation is of no use, beeause there is no
tnule that way, the Tartan, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle, so
nobody that ever I hound of has been curious enough either to go down to the month
of it in boats, or come up from the mouth ofit in ships as (Sir as I can find ; but this is
certain, that this river running must, in the latitude of about 50 degrees, carries it vast ~
eoncouiw of rivers along with it, and finds nn ocean to empty itself in that latitude ;
so we are sure of see there.

Seine leagues to the north of this river, there are several considerable rivers, whose
streams run asdue northas the Yaluour runs mat, and these are all found to join
their wuteis with the great river antonis, muned so from the northernmost nations of x} 3
the Mogul Tartan; who, as the Chinese any, were the first Tartan; in the world ; and . l
who, as our geographers nllege, are the Gog and Mngog mentioned in sacred history. .1
These rivers running all northward, as well as all the other rivers I am yet to speak -'.
of, make it evident that the Northern Ocean bounds the lands also on that side ; so ,' {go

lamul nud jaded with the l-ulumi of the way and long nurreh over the last desert;

told him What I hnd men. and with whnt indignntion I had since thought that
luuunu nature could he no degenerate; I told him it' I could get but four or live

you have not put it out of my thoughts, nod I believe I nhall do it before I quit this

"God forlnid they iihunld deliver you up to auch a crew of mentors! They shell not do .

However, upon second thoughu, we were willing to delny it till the next night,
heeuum the mmrou being to not forwnrd in the morning, we unplumed the governor
'- would not pretend to give them uny mtislitclion upon us when we wne out of hiu power.
The scum nu-rehmn, in steady in his reqdution for the enterprise nu hold in executing,

tor in it little pol, uhout nn hour after night we set out upon our exlmlitiou.

We none to the pluce nhout eleven o'clock st night, sud found thnt the people llod
not the leout jenleunyef danger attending their idol. The night woe cloudy ; yet the
moon gnu-e nu light enough to see thlt the idol aloud just in the some Future and pluce
tlmt it did before. The people seemed to he ull at their not; only that in the great
hut or (out, on we culled it, where we sow the three prieutu, whom we mistook for
huh-hem, we one o light, and going up close to the door, we heard people tulltiog us if
there were live or mix of them ; we wncludml. therefore, that if we not wildfire to the
idol, these men would come out immuli-tely. Ind run up to the place to rescue it from
the destruction that we intended for it ; and whlt we intended to do with them weTHE TARTAR IDOL DESTRUYED.

but when we came to handle it, we found it too bulky for our elu'riege; no we were at
u lou- agnin. The eoeond Boolean-n woe for eetting fire to the tent or but, and knocking
the creature-e that were there on the head when they come out; but I could notjoin
with that; I wee ngeinxt killing them, if it were poeeible to ovoid it. "\Vell, then,"
my! the Scott merchant, " I will tell you whet we will do : we will try to make them
primnenr, tie their handn, and make them etend and see their idol destroy "

A:- it hnppirned, we had twine or paelbthread enough about us, which we used to tie
our firelockn together with ; eo we molved to attaek theee people first, end with
M little noiue an we could. The Brat thing we did we knocked It the door, when one of
the priests coming to it, we immediately aeized upon him, stopped hie mouth, and tied
hie hnndx behind him, Ind led him to the idol, where we med him that he might not
make I noise, tied hie feet also together, end left him on the ground.

Two of u then waited at the door, expecting thet another would eome out to see
what the matter was; but we waited no long till the third rum-came book to us; end
then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently, Ind immediately out came two more,
and we eerved them juet in the same manner, but were obliged to go 5" with them, and
hry them down by the idol some dietauee from one nnother; .when, going heck, we
found two more were come out to the'doer, and A third stood behind them within the
door. We wired the two, end immediltely tied them, when the third, stepping back
and crying out, my Seote memhnrrt went in ew- them, Ind taking out o composition we
hod nnulo thut would only smoke and Itiuk, he not fire to it, and threw it in among
them. By that time the other Sootemnn and my men, taking charge of the two men
already bound, ind timl together also by the nrzrr, led them away to the idol, and left
them there, to lee if their i.lol would relieve them, making haste buck to us.

When the frrrze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much smoke that they
were nlrnnet eufl'ocated, we thc'r threw in e umell leather- hag of another kind, which
flurned like I. candle, nud following it in, we found there were but four people and, an
we enppoeed, had been about tome of their diaboliml nerifieee. They appeared. in
short, frightened to death, at lent to u to sit trembling end etupid, end not able to
iupeuk either for the emoke. '

In a word, we took them, hound them an we had done the other, and all without
any noise. I should have mid we brought them out of the house or hut firlt; for
indeed we were not able to beer the amoke my more than they were. When we had
done this, we carried them all together krthe idol; when we came there, we fell to work
with him ; and first we deuhed him all over, and hie robe- eleo, with tar, and such other
ntufl' u we had, which war tallow mixed with brimetone ; then we stopped hie eyes and
earn and mouth full ofgunpowder ; then we wrapped up a. great piece of wildfire in his
bonnet; and then flicking all the combustible. we had brought with no upon him, we
looked about unto too if we could find anything else to help to turn him; when my
Scot-amen muemhered that by the tent or hut, where the men were, there lay a heap of
dry forage whether ntrrw or rnehee I do not remember ; any he and the other Seote
men r-arr llllfl fetched their am: full of that. When we lied done thin wetook All our

that all the country revurenoed the great Chum Chi-Thnungn, who dwelt in the Inn, and
no mortul would hnve (lured to ofl'er violence to his inuge but name Christin mimeont ;
and they therefore wired to denounce we: egeinlt him end all the Ruaiens, who,
they mid, were miscreants and Christians.

The governor, still patient, end unwilling to nuke n breech. or to have any count) of
war nlloged to be given by him, the Car hoving strictly clmrged him to treat the
conquered country with gentlenes end civility, geve them xtill ell the goon words he
could. At lust he told them there was e enreven gone tow-uh; Russia. thnt morning,
and perhnps it was some of them who hed done them this injury; and that if they
would he satixlied with that, he would send the? them to inquire into it. This seemed
to appeaw them a little; and woonlingly the governor sent after no, end gave on a.
particular neeount how the thing'wes; indnnting withnl, thot if my in our olnvnn had
done it, they should nuke their eoeepe; but that whether we hed done it or no, we
should make all the hash forwerd that was pomihlo; end that, in the roenntime, he
would keep them in play nu long as he could.

sidomhlv stop, nud then we lay at a village culled Plothua ; nor did we make only long
slap how, but hastened nu towards Jumwenu, another of the ('nr of Mumvy'e coloniru,
and when: we expected we should be mfe. But upon the :econd day'n march from
l'luthux, hy the clouds of dust behind on et n grmt dintnnce, some of our people began
to be sensible we were pursued. \Ve had entered l greet desert, and had "ml by u
great lake culled Schukx Oner, when we perceived a. very gmt body of horse nppcnr on
the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling want. "We observed they went nwuy
west, as we. did, but had xuplmd we would have taken that side of the hike. wherein;
we very hnppily took the south aide; and in two dnys more they disappeared ngein : for
they, beliering we wow still before them, pushed on till they come to the river Uddn, u
very gmt river when it paw further north, but when we come to it we found it narrow
and fimlablr.

The thiul dny they lnul either found their mistake or hell intelligence of no, and
came pouring in upon us towards the dunk of the evening. \Ve had, to our grout satin-
faction, just pitched upon it plnco for our camp, which was very convenient for the night;
for as we won: upon it desert, though but at the beginning of it, thut was above live
huudnd miles over, we had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the
city Jilfil't't'llfl. which we hnd yet two days' march to ; the dart, however, had some
few woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which run all into the. great river Uddn ;
it was in a nurmw intuit, between little but very thick wood>>, that we pitched our little
camp for that night, expecting to be attacked before morning.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pnmued for : but as it was usual for the
Mogul Tartnrs to go about in troops in that desert, so the enmvnna always fortify
themselves every night against them, as against nnnies of robbers ; and it wax, therefore
no new thing to be pursued.

But we luul this night, of all the night: of our travels, I most ndvnntegeoue comp ;
for we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet running just before our front, so that
we could not be surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front or leer. We tookPURSUED BY THE TARTARS.

care Also to nuke our front on strong as we could, by piecing our pooh, with our eemele
Ind hornet, I" in in line, on the inside of the river, nud felling some twee in our rear.

In this posture we enenmped for the night; but the enemy wns upon ms before we
had finished. They did not come on In; like thieves, no we expected, but sent three
messenger: to uni, to demand the men to be delivered to them that had ubused their
prints. and burned their god Chem Chi-Thaungu with fire, that they might burn them
with fire ; and upon thin, they mid, they would go awuy, and do \us no further lull'ln ;
otherwise they would destroy In! ell. Our men looked very blank It this manage, and
began to stare at one mother to see who looked with the meet guilt in their faces ; but
nobody was the word--nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent word he was well
ensured that it was not done by any of our camp; that we were peueelill merchant".
travelling on our business ; that we had done no harm to them or to nny one else; and
that, therefore, they must look further for their enemies who luul injured them, for we
were not the people; so he desired them not to disturb ux, for if they did we should
defend ourselves>>

They were for ll-om being aetialicd with this for nn mum-or ; and it great crowd of
them were running down in the morning, by break of dny, to our camp; but neeing us
in such nu quwconntnble situation, they dunst come no art/her thnn the brook in our
front, where they stood, and xhowed ux such a number thut indeed terrified ux very
much ; for those thnt spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood nnd
looked ut us awhile, and then netting up at great howl, they let fly a crowd ol'nrmws
:nunng us; but we were well enough fortified for thut, for we sheltered under our hag.
gm nud I do not remember that one of us wus hurt.

Some time nll'Asr this we now them move n little to our right, and oxlmtml them on
the rrur : when u cunning fellow, a Comok of Jamming, in the pay of the Museovitee,
mlling to tho luuler of the carnrnn, said to him, " I'll go send all thme people nwny to
Sibeilkn." This wnx'n city four or five dnye' journey at leust to the right, nnd rather
behind us. So he tekee his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides nu'ny
from our rmr directly, as it were back to Nertzilnikny; after this he takes it great
circuit ubout, and comes directly on the army of the Tudors, as if he had been went
exprmt to tell them u long xtory that the people who had burned the Cham Chi-

being exceedingly fatigued with the lust day's hnrd march, and with want of rat in the

From thix city we had a. frightful desert, which hold us twenty-three days' march.

I have nothing material to any of my lutieular nflkiu till I <<one to Toholski. i'
the capital city of Siberia, where I continued some time on the following ltcwnnt. '

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, nnd winter began to j? '.
come on arm; whereupon my partner and I atlled a council ubont our pnrticulnr .',
ntl'aing in which we found it proper, us we were bound for England, and not for
Moscow, to consider Irow to dirpow of ounelreu. They told us of sledge: and
wintleer to carry na over the throw in the winter- time ; and, indeed, they have such
things that it would he incredible to relnte the lurticulnnr of, by which menu the
Iinuxinurt trnvel mom in winter than they can in summer, nu in them nledgu they '
me nble to run night and day; the snow, being "Mac", is one universal covering to
Nature, by which the llilbs rulers riveng and lakes nre ull smooth Ind lnm'l or! a
Mono, and they run upon the nurfuce, without any regurd to whut ix undernenth.

But I had no <<warden to urge n winter journey of thin kind: I Wlut bound to
England, not to Moscow, end my route Iny two wnyx: either I must go on us the
mum-n went, till I mine to Jumdnw, nnd then go oll' west for Nnrvn, and the Gulf of ' ..
Fiulnnd, nnd noon to Dautzic, when: I might lumibly yell my ('hinn cargo to good E
ndvnntage; or I must leave the mmvnn nt at little town on the Dwiun, from whence "1
I had but six days by WItiA'l' to Archangel, and from thence might be nun: 0!
shipping either to England, Holland, or IInmburglr.

Now, to go nuy of these journey>> in the winter would buve been prqmtemnx;
for no to Dnntzic, the Baltic would huVe been frown up, und I could not get
lounge; and to go by land in them countrica was for less sure than among the
Mogul Tortnrs: likewise, to go to Amhengel in October, nll the ships would be gone
from thence, and even the Inerchnnts who dwell there in aummer retire south to
Moscow in the winter, when the z-lrips nre gone; so that I could have nothing but
extremity of cold to encounter, with u runrcity of provisions, nnd must lie in nu
empty town all the winter; so that, upon the n ule,I thought it much my better
way to let the tumvon go. and mnke pmvieion to winter where l wan, at Tobelski,
in Siberia, in the Intitude ol' nbozzt aixty dtgrec-s, where I was anm of three things '
to wear out n told winter with--viz, plenty of proriaiom, aurh ms the country
nfl'erded, a warm house, with fuel enough, nnd excellent colnlhnry.

1 WM now in quite a dim-rent climnte from my beloved ialnnd. where I never
felt cold, except when I had my uguo; on the contmry, I had much to do to ban-
any clothe: on my back, and never made any tire but without doeng which was
neceosary {or dressing my food, the. Now I had three good vats, with Inrge who:
or goqu over them, In luurg down to the feet, runl button close to the wrists;
and all these lined with fur-s, to moire them snflieiently wnrm.

A: to I worm house, I must confess I greatly dialiked our way in England of
making fires in every room in the house in open chimneyss which, when the fire
was out, always kept the air in the room cold on the climate; but taking nn
apartment in a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built like a
furnace. in the centre of six never-n1 rooms, like a stove; the funnel to carry the
monk:- went up one wny, thr- door to come at the tire went in another. and all theWINTER IN TOBOLSKI.

rooms were lrept equally worm, but no fire seen, just a: they heat the bagniue in
England. By thia means we had nlwnya the some climate in all the rooms, and an
equal hart was preeerved ; and how cold waver it was without, it was always warm
within; uud yet we saw no fire nor were over incommoded with amolre.

The meat wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to meet with
good company here, in a country no barbarous as that of the meet northerly parte
of Europe. neur the Frown Ocean, within hut a very few degrees of Nova Zembla.
But thix being the country where the slate criminals of Museovy, as I observed
lit-film," are all banished, thix city wna full of nobleman, gentlemen, aeldiera, and
courtiem of Muxcovy. Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the old General
Roboutialri, and several other persons of note, and some ladies By means of my
Scots merchant, whom, novertheletg I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with u-vcml of thmo gmtlemcn ; uml from there, in the long winter nights in which
I ntnycd here, I received several very ugrot-nhle \'ixits

It was talking one night with Prince , one of the honixhed minister: at
atuh' helonging to the (fun- of Mllacovy, tlmt the discount? or my particulnr mac
hogan. Hr. had been telling me nhundnnee of fine thing: of the gmutnem. the
urn-,guiliccncr', the dominiuna. and the absolute power of the Emperor of the Rimimm:
l interrupted him, and told him I was rt grmter and more powerful prince thnn
ever the Curr of Musteovy was, though my dominionx were not no large, or my people
no my. The aninn grandee lookedn little xurprieed, nnd, fixing hia eyea steadily
upon me. began to wonder what I mount. I told him his wonder would come
when I had explained mynclf. Fiat. I told him I had nlmhrte dinpoaal of the
lives and tin-tunes of all my subjectx; that uotwitlmtamling my ataolnto power, I
hml not one pemon dimifl'ecled to my government, or to my person, in all my
dominiona. He shook hix haul nt that, uud aid, there, indeed. I outdid the Car
of Muscovy. I told him tlurt nll the lumls in my kingdom were my own, and all
my nuhjects were not only my lemmas but tenants at will ; that they would all
fight for me to the hut dmp; nnd that never tyrant, for such I acknowledged
myself to be, WM ever so universally beloved, and yet no horribly feared, by his
subjects.

Alter nmuuing him with these riddles in government for a while, I opened the
cane, and told him the story at lnrgo of my living in the island; and how I
mnnngcd both myself and the people that were under me. just as I have since
minutcd it down. They were exceedingly taken with the story, and especially the
prince, who told me, with a. sigh, that the true gmtneex of life was to be masters
of ourselves ; that he would not have exchanged such a state of life as mine to be
Carr of Museovy; and that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to
be hanixlml to there than ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in
the court of his master the Car; that the height of human wiadom was to bring
our tempers down to our cireumatnneerg and to make a calm within, under the
weight of the greatest storms without. When he more first hither, he laid he used
to tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from his bank, as other: had done
before him; but a little time and consideration had made him look into himself, as
well its munil him, to things without: that he found the mind of man, if it was
but once brought to reflect upon the state of universal life, and how little this
world m concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity ,
for itself, fully mtist'ying to itself. and suitable to its own heat enda and duh",

rue only M it man, it lnunnn cunture, not at all distinguished from another; and so 1
can suffer no want, unless I nhould be visited with sickness and <<Ii-tempers. However,
to put the question out of dispute, you see our wny of life: we are, in this place, five
persons of rank ; we live perfectly retired, as suited to I atom of boninlunent; we hove
something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps on from the more
necmity of hunting for our food ; but the poor wldienr, whnnre here without that help,
live in no lunch plenty as we, who go in the woods and enlch sable: end foxes; the
lulu-urn!" n month will innintoin them nyear; and as the way of living is not expensive,
so it 'u not hnnl to get sufl'rcient for oumlves. So that objection is out of doors."

I hnvo not room to give a. full necount of the most agreeable convcmution I had
with this truly grmt man ; in all which he showed tlmt his mind won so inquired with
n superior knowledge of things, so supported by religion, as well on by u vast share of
wisdom, thnt his contempt of the world was really nu rnueh rut he had exprewxl, und
thnt he was nlwnyn the mum to the hurt, us will appear in the story I am going to
tell.

I had heen here eight months, and a dork, dreadful winter I thought it 3 the cold
so intense that I could not no much us look ubrood without being wrapped in furs.
and a mask of for before my lime, or rather a hood, with only n hole for hrenlh, and
two for sight: the little daylight we had wmr, tux we reckoned, for three months not
ubove five honm u dny, nnd xix nt moot; only that the snow lying on the ground con-
tinually, and the wmther being clenr, it wmr never quite dork. Our horses were kept,
or rather :dnrved, under ground ; end no for our servunts, whom we hired here to look
nftor onmdvee and honing we had, every now and then, their flugersnnd teen to thaw
and take rare of, lest they should mortify, and full ell"

It in (me, within doors we were wunn, the house: ociug clue, the wallx thick, the

stores of provisions for the winter are laid up in the aumnn-r, and well cured: our
drink was water, mixed with n-pm-Viue iuslendol' Ivmudy ; end for a treat, mend iusleud
of wine, which, however, they have very good. The hunters, who venture ubmnd all
wenthem, frequently brought on in line veniwn, nnd mint-times hour's Ilerdr, but we did
not much am: for the hut. "'0 had it good stock of ms, with which we treated our
friends. nud we lived very cheerfully nud well, nll things considered.

It was now March, the dnys grown <<insiderubly longer, and the wmther nt lenxt
tolerable ; so the other travellers began to prepare sledges to urrry them over the snow,
end to get things ready to be going; but my nunnlm being fixed, :u I have mid,
for Archangel, and not for Museovy or the Hallie. I nuulu no motion ', knowing very well
thnt the ships from the south do not rust out (or thut port of the world till Muy orJnne ;
end that if I was there by the beginning of August, it would be no smn us any ships
wouldbe reedy mgouwuy; end urerefom I made no hosts: to be gone, as othersdid : in n
wonl, I saw a grait runny people, My, All the tmvellent, go uwuy before me. It seems
every year they go from thence to Mmeovy for trule, to any fun, und buy neetmien,
which they bring back with them to furnish their shops : also others went on the some
errand to Archangel; but then they oll being to come back again nhove eight hundred
miles, went out before me.

In the month of May I began to melts all ready to pack up; and, u I was doing
this, it occurred to rue that, seeing all these people were banished by the Car of Mus-THE RUSSIAN EXILE.

covy to Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to go whither they
would, why they did not then go away to any part of the world, wherever they thought
fit: and I began to examine what should hinder them from making such an attempt.
But my wonder was over when I entered upon that subject with the person I have
mentioned, who answered nIe thus: " Consider, first, sir," said he, "the place when
we are ; and, secondly, the condition we are in ; especially the generality of the people
who are banished hither. "7e are surrounded with stronger things than bars or bolts ;
on the north side, on IInnavignble ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never swam ;
every other way we have nbove a thousand miles to pass through the Czar's own
dominiona, and by way>>: utterly impawshle, except by the roads made by the Govern-
ment, and through the towns gnrrisoned by his troops ; so that we could neither puss
\lnllhcoveml by the mud, nor atulnist any other way ; so that it is in vain to attempt it."
I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in a prison every jot as
secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at Momw: however, it came into
my thoughts that I might certainly be made an inrtrumcnt to procure the coupe of
this excellent person; and that, whatever hemrd I Ian, I would certainly try if I could
carry him 091'. Upon this, I took an occasion, one evening,totell him my thoughts. I
mprwntod to him thatit was very may for me to carry him away, there being no guard
over him in the country ; and as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and
that I went in the rotinuc of a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the
stationary towns in the desert, but could eneamp every night where I would, we might ' '
easily pass unintcrmptod to Archangel, where I would immediately secure him on
board an English ship. and carry him safe along with me; and as to his subsistence and
other luIrticulars, it should be my care till he could better supply himself
He heard Inc very attentively, and loolred eamastly on me all the while I spoke:
my, I could see in his very {see that what I said put his spirits into an exceeding
ferment, his colour frequently changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, till
it might be even perceived in his countenance ; nor could he immediately answer Inc
when I had done, and, as it were, hesitated what he would say hit: but, alter he had
pnnsed a little, he embraced me, and said, " How unhappy are we, unguarded creatures
~ as we are, that even our greatest sets of friendship are made snares unto used we are
made Winners of one another! My dear friend," said he, "your ofl'er is so sincere, has
such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage, that I
musthsveverylittlelmowlcdge of the world if I did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge
the obligation I have upon Inc to you for it. But did onI believe I was sincere in what-I
have often mid to you of my contempt of the world? Did you believe I spoke my very
'. soul to you, and that I had really obtained that degree of felicity here that had placed
' mo above all that the world could give met Did you believe I was sincere when I told you
I would not go back, if I was recalled even tobeall that I once wasin the court, with the
favour of the Carr my masteri Did you believe me, my friend, to be an honest manl

or did you believe Inc to be a boasting hypocritol" Here he stopped, as if he would ' ;

hear what I would say; but, indeed, I soon after perceived that he stopped because his
spirits were in motion, his great heart was full of struggles, and he could not go on. I
was, I confess, astonished at'tho thing as well as at the man, and I used some argu-
ments with him to urge him to set himself free ; that he ought to look upon this
as a door opened by Heaven {or his deliverance. and a summons by Providence, who

has the care and disposition of all events, to do himself good, and to render himself
useful In the world.\"Q'r I'W'mw-j

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood silent, looking at him,
and, indeed. admiring whnt I saw. The Itrnggle in his soul was so great thnt, though
the weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most violent sweet, nod I found he
wanted to giro vent to his mind ; so I slid l word or two, that I would leave
him lo <<unsider of it, mul wuit on him nguin, sud then I withdrew to my own aportw
ment.

About two houm after, I hard somebody at or near the door of my mm, um] I WM
going to open the door, hut he hud opened it, und come in. " My dear friend," says he.
I'you lnul ulmoot ovemet me, but I nun recovered. Do not take it ill thut I do not
elm-1o with your offer. I nature you it is not for wont of sense of the kindnun of it in
you ; and I cunn- to make the moat airmen: ncknowledgluent of it to you; but I hope I
lmvo got the victory over mywlf." " My lord," aid 1, "I hope you are fully satisfied
thlt you do not resist the call of Heaven." "Sir," mid he, "if it hnd been from
"raven, the some power would hu\'e influenced me to luu'e ncceptcd it ; but I hope, and
um fully mtislied, that it is from Heaven that l decline it, llllI I lnn'o infinite
sutisfnotion in the putting. that you shull leave me nu honest mun otill, though not n
free man."

I hnd nothing In do but to M'quicwe, und Inuko profusions to him of my having no
end in it but an sincere desim to serve him. He embraced me very lmiolmtely, and
usuured me he wun sensible of that, und ahould always "knowledge it ; nud with that
ho ufl'erod me u very fine present of snbhay--wo nuich, indeed, for me to accept
from n mnu in his cimnunituncos, llllI I would have avoided them, but he would not he
refused.

The nrxl. morning I xent my serrnut to his lordship with n snlnll praent of iul,
und two pit-ea of Chiim thin-null. and four little wedge: of anuu gold, which did not ull
weigh ubove nix ounces or then-<<hanks but were fur short of tho value of his nobles, which,
when I came in Enghuul. 1 found worth near two hundred pounds. He accepted the
ten, nnd one piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had :1 fine stump
upon it, of the Japan coinage, which 1 found he tool: for the nrity of it, but
would not luhc nny mom: nnd he sent word by my servant that he duimd to spell:
with me.

' When I came to him, he told me I knew whnt had passed between us, and hoped
I would not move him my more in thst uIl'uir; but thnt, mince I mode such I: generous
oll'er to him, he nakcdmo if I had kindnes enough to ofl'cr the nine to another person
that he would mine to me, in whom he had n great share of concern. I told him tlnt I
eould not any I inclined to do so much for any but himself, for whom I lmd o [articular
value. and should hire been glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance; how-

' over, if he would please to nume the person to me, I would give him my unswcr. He
told me it was his only son ; who, though I had not seen him, yet was in the some condi-
tion with himself, nod above two hundred miles from him, on the other side of the Ohy;
but that, if I consented, ho would send for him.

I undo no heaitntion, but told him I would do it. I nwdo some ceremonyin letting him
uudomtnnd that it was wholly on his account ; md tint, seeing I could not prevail on
him, I would show my respect to him by my concern for his son; but those thing- In
too tedious to repent here. He sent the next day for his son ; And in about twenty dnys
ho came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with very rich
furs, which, in the whole. mounted to a. very great nlue. His monk brought the
horses into the town, but left the young lord at n dixhnce till night, when he cum
' incognito into our upnrtrueut, end his father presented him to me; end, in abort, we

' ' concerted the mnuner of our trnvolliug, nud everything proper for the journey.

I had bought u eenxideruble qunntity of tables, blIek fox ekinl. fine erminel, And
xuch other furs u are very rich in tint city, in exehnuge for some of the good: I had
brought from China; in partieulur, for the cloves end nutmegx, of which I eold the
grentunt pert here. and the rest nt'eerwnnln nt Archangel, for is much better priee than I
could have got ut London ; nud my purtner, who VIM nenniblo of the profit, nnd whom
buxinm' more lmrtioulurly than mine, wxu merchandise, VIM mightily pleased with our
xtny, on ncconnt of the trni'fie we nrude here.

It was the beginning of June when I left thin remote place; n city, I believe, little
heard of in the world; nnd, indeed, it is so fur out of the reed of _commeme, thut I
know not how it should be much talked of. "70 were now reduced to u very small
mmvnn, having only thirty-two home! uud eernebt in ii", and ull of them leaned for mine,
though my new guest wan proprietor of eleven of them; it we: meet nntnrnl, nine, that I
xhould tnko mom servants with me then I hml before; and the young lord incurred for
my Mtewnnl ; wlnrt grout men I [mil for myself, I know not, neither did it concern
me to inquire. We hud lu-rc the womt end the lnrgost desert to prom over that we met
with in em- whele mmey ; I arll it the went hemnee the wny vine r'ery deep in some
plum-is nnd very uneven in other-r; the best we hud tn my for it won, thnt we thought
we hnd no troops of Turtum or mhbenr to four, und thnt they never come on this side
the river Ohy, or at leuxt very seldom ; but we found it otherwire.

My young hn'rl hnd u faithful Siberian servant, who wnn perfectly uequninwd with
the country, nnd led us by private reeds, so thnt we avoided coming into the principnl
towns nud cities upon the grant rend, ouch M Tureen, Seloy Knnlxkei, null several
others; became the Mimeoviw gnrrixons which one kept than: are Very curious and
>trict in their obserrutiuu upon tmvellerxnnd searching lost any of the banished lumen
of note should ruuke their mpe thnt wny into Mrueovy ; but, by thin returns, as we
were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was :1 <<Inert, nnd we were obliged to
r-ncnmp uud lie in our tente, when we might have had very good ueoommodutiou in the
l'itiut on the wny ; this the young lord wus so seresible of that he would not allow us to
lie ubreud when we mine to xeveurl cities on the way, but lay nbroud himself, with his
servant, in the woods, and met us ulwuys at the appoinwl pbweu.

\Ve lindjiut entered Europe, lowing [weal the river Knm whieh in these parts in

' the bonrulnry between Enrol>>: uml Asia, and the tint city on tho Eurepeen side we:

eullul Soley Kuumkoi, which is my much us to say, the great city on the river Kenn ; v i '

and here we thought to see wine evident nltentinu in the people ; but we were mie~
token ; for u we luul n rust desert to peer, which is near oeven hundred mile: long in some
places, but not nlxu'c two hundred milee over where we [meted it, no till we came post
that horrible plnee. we found very little difference between that country und the Mogul
Turtury ; the people nre mostly pugnnn and little better then the swag-s: of Aruoriut;
their houses and town full of irlelx, end their way of living wholly burbnreuu, except in
the citieg and the villages near them, where they nre Christians. ms they cdl them-
selves, of the Greek Cbureh, but have their religion mingled with so runny reliee of
urperetitiou that it is sauce to be known in some places from more loreery and witch-
cleft.

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must (Alter all our dungenx were, to our
imagination, escelxsd) lurve been plundered and robbed, nnd perhaps murdered, by n
(mop oI thieves; of what country they were. I m yet nt a lees to know ; but theyROBBERS lN THE \VOOD.

were III on hon-chuck, enrriul hours and nrmwu, and were at first nbont forty-live in
number; they onme so near to m us to be within two muxket-ahote, and, linking no
question, snrronndml us with their horses, nnd looked very earnestly upon us twice ; at
length, they placed themselvesjlmt in our way ; upon which we drew up in a little line,
before our eumehs being not nbeve xixtmn men in all ; and, being drawn up time, we
halted, and rent out the Siberian servant, who nttended his lord, to we who they were ;
his ninuler was the more willing to let him go beoulse he urns not n little npprohcnnive
that they were u Siherinn troop sent ont after him. The man came up nearer them
with n. flag of tnice, nnd called to them ; but though he spoke seven] of their lnngunges,
or dialects of lnugungm mther, he could not understand n word they said; however,
nfler some xignu to him not to come near them nt his peril, the fellow enmo back no
win-r thnn he went; only thnt by their divas, he mid, he believed them to be some
antnm of Knlmuck, or of the Circumiun hordes, and that then) must he more of them
upon the great deucrt, though he never heard that any of them were seen so fur north
before.

About nn hour niter, they ngiin mode a motion to nttnel: us, and rode round our
little wood to we where they might br'mk in ; but finding us nlwnys ready to {nee than),
they went all" ngnin ; and we rewlved not to stir for that night.

This wnn :unnll comfort to us; however, we hnd no remedy; there was. on our loit
linnd, at about u quarter of n mile dislnnee, n little grove, and very nmr the mod ; I
immediately marlin-d we xxhnuld advance to those trees, nnd fortify ourselves on well on
we could there; for, find, I mnxidered thnt the tree; would in it great measure cover us
from their Arrows; nnd, in the next place, they could not come to charge us in n body ;
it want, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, end who had this oxecllency
unending him, that he wns always rendiest nml most npt to direct and encourage III in
am of the most dungen \Ve advanced immedintely, with what speed we could, and
gained that little wood; the Tartan; or thieves, for we knew not what to call them,
keeping their stand, nml not ntlmupting to hinder us \Vhen we come thither, we
found, to our great ntinfncliun, that it was It nwnmpy piece of ground, and on the one
side In very great spring of water, which, running out in n. little brook, wns n little
1, further joinul by another of the like size ; and wns in short, the source of a considerable
river, culled afterwards the Wirtulm; the trees which grew about this spring were not
nbove two hundred, but very large, and Mood pretty think, so that u: soon as we got in,
we saw ourselves perfectly sni'e from the enemy "Him they nttnekod In on foot.

While we stayed here whiting the motion of the enemy some hours, without
perceiving tluit they nmde nny movement, onr Portuguese, with some help, out several
arms of trees half off, and laid them hanging across from one tree to another, and in I
nmnner fenced us in. About two hours before n'ght, they come doWn directly upon us;
and though we had not perceived it. we found they hnd been joined by some more, In
thnt they were near follueore home; whereol; however, we fancied me were women.
They came on till they were within half-shot of our little wood, when we fired one
Imudtet without bail, nnd called to them in the Raminu tongue, to know whet they
wanted, and bode them keep all; but they came on with n double fury up to the wood
side, not imngining we were no barricaded that they could not wily break in. Our old
pilot urns our captain, as well as our engineer, end desired or not to fire upon them till
they come within pistol-Ihot, that we might be sure to kill, mil thnt when we did lire
we should be cure to take good nim; we bode him give the word ofeommnnd, which he
delnyed no long, thnt they were name of them within two pikel' length of us when weIIIt fly. "'0 aiIIIIvIl so true that we killed fourteen of them. and wmInchl several others.
