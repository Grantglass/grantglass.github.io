LIFE
AND
ADVENTURES, $c.
I was born of a good family in the
city of York, where my father, who
was a native of Bremen, had settled,
after his having got a handsome estate
by merchandize. As my heart began
to be very early filled with rambling
thoughts, I at length resolved to gratify
my roving disposition.
On the first of September, 1651, I
went on board a ship, which w£s
bound for London. We were wrecked
by the way, but were picked up off Yar-
mouth, where we were received with
great humanity, and had moneyi given
us sufficient to carry us either to Lon-
don or back to Hull.
On my arrival in London, I con-
tracted an acquaintance with the master
of a ship who had been on the coast of
Guinea; and having had good success
there, was resolved to go again. This
voyage made me both a sailor and a
merchant; for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my
adventure, which yielded me in Lon-
don at my return almost 300/.
I now set up for a Guinea trader;
and my friend to my great misfortune
dying soon after his arrival, I resolved
to go the same voyage again, and ha-
ving left 200/. in the hands of my friend's
widow, I embanked in the same vessel
with one who was his mate in the for-
mer voyage, and had now the command
5
of the ship. This was one of the most
unhappy voyages that ever man had
made; for, as we were steering between
the Canary islands and the African
shore, we were surprised by a Moorish
piratical rover, and were all carried
prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging
to the Moors.
Hence I soon made my escape in a
pleasure boat, taking only a black boy
nalmed Xury with me. Passing the
Straits of Gibraltar, I thought to make
the River Gambia; in ten days after,
off the Cape de Verd Islands, just as
we were almost dying for want of pro-
vision, we met a Portuguese ship, which
kindly relieved our distress. The Cap-
tain wished to purchase my boy Xury,
to which the latter consented, and to
which I could not object, as his kind-
ness to both of us was very great.
VVe made a successful voyage to the
Brazils, and at All-Saints Bay I turned
planter. Two years I remained here,
and during that time my good Captain
had made a voyage, and brought me
from London 100/. out of the 200/. I
had owing there.
Had I continued in the station I was
then in, I might have been happy, bftt
growing rich apace, my head beg;an to
be full of projects and undertakings be-
yond my reach. I had lived here about
four years, when I fitted out a ship of
about 120 tons burden, which carried
six guns and 14 men.
Irt this vessel I set sail, with the
hopes of purchasing slaves, to assist us
in our plantation^ and stood to the
 'Mii.*>ii.l'iilihslmt hy a M/itti/i O, Sfmt .\J Thmiin.' .IfMutlr
northward, in order to stretch over to
the African coast. We had very good
weather for about twelve days; but soon
after we had crossed the line, a violent
hurricane drove us quite out of our
knowledge, and, many days together
not any in the ship expected to save
their lives. In this distress it was re-
solved to stand away for Barbadoes, in
order to refit.
With this design we changed our
course; but soon after a second storm
arose, which carried us with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us out
of the way of all human commerce.
One of our men early one mornffig,
cried out, Land! and we had no sooner
run out of the cabin, in hopes of seeing
where we were, but the ship struck
upon a sand, and in a moment the sea
8
broke over her .in such a manner, that
we expected we should all have perish-
ed. We all took to the boat, which
was soon swamped, and all perished
save myself. Wave after wave driving
me along, at last dashed me against a
piece of rock, and left me senseless ;
but recovering; before the return of
another, I got to the main land, claiif-
bered up the clifts of the shore, and set
me down on the grass.
Night coming on, I walked about a
furlong from the shore, to see if I could
find any fresh water to drink, which I
did to my great joy 3 and having drunk
and put a little tobacco in my mouth to
prevent hunger, I climbed up into a
tree; I then cut a short stick f6r my
defence, endeavoured to place myself
so as that if I should sleep, I might not
fall; and being much fatigued, slept
very comfortably till morning.
A little after noon, I found the sea
very calm, and the tide ebbed so far out
that I could come within a quarter of a
mile of the ship. The weather being
extremely hot, I swam to the ship, and
to my great joy saw that all the ship's
provisions were dry; and being well
disposed to eat, I went into the bread
room, and slipping on a waistcoat, fill-
ed my pockets with biscuit, and ate as
I went about other things; l also found
some rum in the great cabin, of which
I took a large dram, to enable me to
accomplish my design.
As I found several spare yards, and
some large spars of wood, I next broke
open and emptied three of the seamen's
chests: then lowered them down upon
10
the raft, and filled them with bread,
some dried goats' flesh, and three Dutch
cheeses. I found several cases of bot-
tles, in which were some cordial waters,
and about five or six gallons of arrack;
these I stowed by themselves, there be-
ing no room for them in the chests. I
also let down the carpenter's chest,
which was worth more to me than a
ship load of gold, I next found two ex^
cellent fowling pieces, and two pistols,
with some powder horns, two barrels
of powder, and two old rusty swords,
all of which I placed on the raft, and
with this invaluable cargo resolved to
put to sea, and got it safe to land.
The next day, considering that I
might yet get many useful things out
of the ship, particularly the rigging
and sails, &c. I made a second voyage,
11
and to my great comfort brought all
safe away.
I now went to work to make a little
hut with the sail and some poles, which
I cut for that purpose; and into it I
brought every thing I knew would spoil
either with the sun or rain: I piled all
the empty chests and casks in a circle
round the hut to fortify it from any
sudden attempt from man or beast; I
blocked up the door with boards, and
spreading one of the beds on the ground*
laying my two pistols just at my head
and my gun by me, I went to bed, and
slept very quietly all night.
I had been thirteen days on shorej
and had been eleven times on board the
ship. Rummaging the cabin, I disco-
vered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors,
12
and a pair of large scissars, with ten or
a dozen good knives and forks; and in
another about 36Z. value in gold and
silver coin, a useless drug to me now,
and not worth a ten-penny nail.
It blew very hard one night, and in
the morning when I looked out, no
more ship was to be seen. I now went
in search of a place where I might fix
my dwelling; endeavouring to choose
one where I might have the advantage
of a healthy situation fresh water, and
security from being; surprised by man
or any ravenous beast. I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, which
was there as steep as the side of a house,
sothat nothing could come down to me
from the top: on the side of this rock
was a hollow place, like the entrance
of a caye, before which I iesoIved to
 »W /,> /! Mtirfiit.'i. &m/ S'TTtanin*.4/H&I'
13
fix my tent. This plain w&s not above
100 yards broad and twice as long, de-
scending to the sea.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a
half circle before the hollow place,
which extended 20 yards,, and in this
half circle, pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground
like piles; they stood about five feet
and a half out of the ground, sharpened
on the top. This cost me much time
and labour, especially in cutting the
piles in the wood, bringing them to the
place, and driving them into the earth.
The entrance I made by a short ladder
to go overHhetop, which, when I was
in, I lifted over after me. Into this
fence I by degrees carried all my riches,
all my provisions, ammunition, and
stores, and made me a large tent to se-
14
cure myself and them from the weather.
When I had done this, I began to work
my way into the rock, which was pretty
soft, laying all the earth and stones I
dug out within my fence, in the man-
ner of a terrace, and thus I had a cave
just behind my tent.
The first time 1 went out, I had the
pleasure to find that there were goats
and pigeons in the island; which 1
caught and brought up.
To prevent losing my reckoning of
time, 1 set up a large square post on
the shore where I first landed, and cut
upon it with a knife, "I came on shore
here the 30th of Sept. 1659." Upon
the sides I cut every day a notch, and
every seventh notch was as long again
as the rest, and every first of the month
as long again as that long one; and
15
thus I kept my weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning.
I had got from the ship some pens,
ink, and paper, some mathematical in-
struments, and three good bibles, with
several other books, which I carefullv
secured. I also brought to shore with
me two cats, and a dog swam on shore,
who was a trusty servant to me many
years; nay, he was so good a compan-
ion, that I was at a loss for nothing he
could fetch me.
I frequently killed the goats for my
subsistence, whose fat supplied my
lamp, which was a dish made of clay,
baked in the sun, and for a wick, I
made use of oakum. In the midst of
all my labours, I found a little bag with
a few husks of corn in it, which I shook
out by the side of my fortification, and
16
they furnished me with grain to sow*
worth more to me than fifty times their
weight in gold, so I carefully preserved
them.
When I had been about a year in the
island I was taken extremely ill. Soon
after my recovery I took a survey of the
island; at about two miles distance from
my habitation I found some fine savan-
nahs, and a little further a variety of
fruit, and as for limes and lemons 1 had
as many as I could well stand under.
I was so enamoured with this place,
that I built myself a bower, fenced with
a double hedge, and this country-house,
as 1 called it, cost me two months la-
bour; but I had hardly begun to enjoy
my habitation, when the rains came on,
and I was obliged to retreat to my old
one; taking with me my grapes, which
17
were now become fine raisins of the
sun. In one journey I caught a young
parrot. Having knocked it down with
a stick, I brought it home with me, and
taught it to speak. Having travelled
about twelve miles eastward along the
shore, I set up a great post for a mark,
and returned homeward, designing that
my next tour should be the contrary way,
till I came to this post. My dog having
seized a kid, I saved it alive, and there-
by got a stock of tame goats. My
worst enemies were the birds, who only
waited for my absence to drop down
upon my corn that was in the ear, so I
shot three of them, and hung them up as
a warning to the rest.—I reaped a pret-
ty good harvest, and contrived to make
bread, and having made some earthen
vessels, and baked them upon my fire
18
till they were fire-proof, I could soon
have set up a pastry-cook's, as I had no
fear of wanting flour.
As my clothes now began to decay, I
made myself two waistcoats out of some
watch coats, and a cap out of a goat's
skin, with the hair side outwards, to
throw off the rain.
Three or four years after, I made a
little boat, an umbrella serving both for
a mast and an awning.—One afternoon,
after a little trip, I got over the fence,
and laid me down to sleep in the shade;
but, judge my surprise, when I was
awakened by a voice calling me by my
name several times, " Robin, Robin
Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! where
are you ? where have you been ?" I a-
woke terribly frightened; but no sooner
were my eyes open than I saw my Poll
19
sitting on the hedge, and the next day
I carried him along with me to the cas-
tle.—One dangerous ramble reconciled
me to my desolate island, and resigned
me to the dispensations of Providence.
It would have made a Stoic smile to see
me and my family sit down to dinner;
there was my majesty, all alone like a
king, attended with my servants. Poll,
my favourite, was the only person per-
mitted to talk to tne. My dog, who
was grown very old, sat always at my
right hand, and my two cats, one on
one side of the table, and the other on
the other.
I had at length a great mind to go to
the point of the island, to see how the
shore laid, and resolved to travel thither
by land. And now, reader, I will give
thee a short sketch of the figure I made.
so
I had on a great high shapeless cap, made
of goat's skin, a jacket with the skirts
coming down to the middle of my thighs,
and a pair of open-kneed breeches of
the same, with the goat's hair hanging
down to the middle of my leg. Stock-
ings and shoes I had none, but I had
made a pair of somethings, I scarcely
know what to call them, to flap over
my legs like spatter-dashes; but of a
most barbarous shape, and so, indeed,
was all the rest of my clothes; I had a
broad belt of goat's skin dried, and in
a loop hung on one side a saw, and on
the other a hatchet. I had another
belt not so broad, fastened over my
shoulder; under my arm hung two
pouches for my shots and powder; on
my back I carried a basket, on my
shoulder a gun, and over my head a
21
great Ugly goafs-skin umbrella. My
beard was cut short, except what grew
on my upper lip, which I had trimmed
into a large pair of Mahometan whis-
kers; but as for my figure, I had so
few to observe it, that it was of no man*
ner of consequence.
In this figure 1 went my new jour-
ney, and was out five or six days. One
day at noon, I was exceedingly sur*
prised with the print of a man's foot on
the shore, which was so plainly to be
seen in the sand, that, in approaching
nearer the strand, I was perfectly con-
founded and amazed.
I had now been twenty-two years in
the island, and was so naturalized to the
place, that had I been secure as to the
savages, I fancied, I could have been
contented to have staid in it, till (like
22
the goat) I had died of mere old age;
but, in my twenty-third year, going out
at break of day, I was surprized with
the light of a fire upon the shore, to-
wards the end of the island.
Some time after, in the midst of a
stormy night, I was startled at the fi-
ring of guns; these, I thought, were the
signals of a ship in distress, and such it
proved, as I discovered the next day. I
cannot explain by any possible energy
of words, the emotion I felt at the sight
of this rich wreck. Oh ! that there had
been but one saved! (I cried,) that I
might have had one companion! one
fellow-creature to have spoken to, and
have comforted me in my affliction.
After this acquisition, I lived in my
old manner, though terrified with fears
of the savages. One morning very
23
early I saw five canoes of them ashore.
I clambered up my hill, and by the help
of a perspective discovered no less than
thirty dancing round a fire. I soon af-
ter saw two miserable wretches dragged
out of the boats, one of whom was im-
mediately knocked down; but the other,
starting from them, ran with incredible
swiftness along the sands towards me.
Out of the three that pursued him, I
knocked down one with the but end of
my musket, shot the other, and one
ran away. The black I had saved was
a well-made handsome fellow, of about
twenty-six years of age, of an olive col-
oured complexion, with long black hair.
I soon began to speak to him, and to
teach him to speak to me; arid first, I
made him know that his name should
be Friday, which was the day whereon
24
I saved his life. He was not long in
learning English, and became a most
faithful servant. He said his country-
men were cannibals, and they once ate
up twenty men, two women, and a child;
but not knowing how to tell twenty, he
numbered them by laying so many
stones in a row, and pointing to me to
tell them over.
Having learned from my man Friday
that 17 men had come on shore in dis-
tress, and were on an adjoining island,
I had a strong desire to see if they
might form a part of the crew of the
ship that was last wrecked; for this
purpose, as well as to try if I could not
effect my escape, we constructed with
great labour a canoe, and set up a mast
and sail.
It was in the 27th year of my capti-
 /,,.„,/„/i hiMmttrrl by fl.JMiirlin.ti. flnvily'TVitHiuu: Ajhk'II'
25
vity that Friday gave me notice that 21
savages with three prisoners, had land-
ed, and they had killed and eaten one
of them, and*were going to murder the
others. I directly armed Friday and
myself, with all my muskets, pistols,
and swords. Coming upon them as
they sat huddled roundptheir victims,
and taking due aim, we killed them in
succession, and then arming the poor
wretches whom he had saved, we dis-
patched 17 of the savages and four
escaped out to sea. One of the prison-
ers proved to be Friday's father, and
another was a Spaniard, all of whom,
as they owed their lives to me, were
ready to lay them down in my service.
Not long after from the top of my
hill I saw an English ship lying at an-
chor, from which a boat full of men
26
proceeded to the shore and landed.
Having selected six/three of whom they
bound, with an evident intention of
destroying them, I lost no ftme in arm-
ing my little company, and coming up
as they were straggling about, we shot
several of thern, and the rest submitted.
We then learned it was a mutiny of
the sailors, headed by some despera-
does, which determined me directly to
assist the captain in recovering the ship.
This was effected only by main force,
taking them by surprise in the night,
when the rebel master was killed, and
the lawful captain came on shore to
embrace me, and say the ship and
cargo all were mine.
When I saw my deliverance thus
put into my hands, I was ready to sink
with surprise; I was not able to an.
27
swer one word; but a flood of tears
brought me to myself, and a little while
after I recovered my speech. I then
in my turn embraced him as my deli-
verer, and we rejoiced together. I
prepared to go on board the next day,
and took my man Friday, the Captain
returning to the ship, to get every thing
ready for my reception. Thus I left
the island, after being on it twenty-
eight years
On my arrival in England, I was as
perfect a stranger as if I had never
been known there; my faithful steward,
the widow, was become poor; my fa-
ther and mother were dead; but I had
two sisters,/and two of the children of
one of my brothers were living. The
merchant, concerned in the ship I had
saved, having heard the Captain's story,
28
invited mc to an entertainment, and
made me a present of near 200/. I then
went to Lisbon, to see after my effects
in the Brazils, and found the generous
Captain, (who had been so much my
friend,) still alive, and he put me in a
way of recovering the produce of my
plantation. And a few months after,
there arrived ships in the Tagus, with
effects for my use, to the amount of
9,000/. besides 1,000/. a year which I
expected to receive annually from my
plantation.
Having converted my money into
bills of exchange, I returned to Eng-
land, and some time after I married.
Not knowing how to live without em-
ployment, I retired into the country,
to a little farm; but in the middle of
this felicity, my wife died, leaving me
29
three children. By the loss of my sage
counsellor, I became like a ship with-
out a pilot, that could only sail before
the wind. One of my brother's chil-
dren I had brought up to the sea, and
had given him a ship. He was going
a voyage to China, and came one morn-
ing to ask me if I would go with him,
to see my beloved island. Having
made my will, and settled my estate on
my children, we set sail.
When we came within sight of it, I call-
ed to my man Friday, and asked him if
he knew where he was ? when clapping
his hands, he cried, O yes! O there!
and danced and capered like a mad
fellow. There was no keeping Friday
on board, for he saw his father, and
he flew like an arrow out of a bow.
The Spaniard I mentioned came
30
towards the boat, carrying a flag of
truce, I went with bim to my old ha-
bitation, which was made far stronger
than when I left it. When I enquired
the reason of this, he told me the three
barbarians, not contented with being
moderately their masters, wanted to be
their murderers, and they had been ob-
liged to disarm them.
About this time a great number of
savages of different nations landed, and
fought a battle, in which thirty-two
more were killed upon the spot.
They had not long after another
visit from the savages; and were inva-
ded by a most formidable fleet, armed
with bows and arrows, great clubs, and
wooden swords. To oppose this force,
there were seventeen Spaniards, five
Englishmen, old Friday, and aix slaves.
 31
who killed the larger part, and the rest
being made prisoners, soon became ci-
vilized, for the Spaniards and English
went among them.
This was the situation of the island
at my arrival, with the addition of
twenty little children, for the women
had all been fruitful. My coming was
a particular relief, because I furnished
them with knives, shovels, pick-axes,
and every thing they could want.
When the Spaniards and English
were all assembled, I told them that I
came to establish them there, and not
to remove them.
Soon after this, having, by my so-
vereign authority, divided the lands
amongst them to prevent quarreling,
I l§ft the Island; but I had not been
awa:y from it three days, when we dis-
32
covered a great number of canoes,
which came very near us, on which we
made signs for them to put back, which
they did ; but first they discharged
about 500 arrows at us, and wounded
one of our men. Not willing to fire
upon them, I ordered Friday to speak
to them, when instantly they discharged
another flight of arrows, that killed
poor Friday, no other man being in
their sight. Enraged at the loss of my
old servant, I gave them a broadside,
which overset many of their canoes,
and the rest fled so fast, that in a little
time there was not one of them to be
seen.
We now steered to the East Indies,
staying a few days at the Cape of Good
Hope, where we took in fresh water,
audi sailed to Madagascar.
33
At Bengal I took a lodging in the
house of an English woman, where I
got acquainted with a merchant; we
bought a ship, and went a voyage fo
China, which proved very successful,
and made another to the spice islands,
with the like good fortune. We then
bought a larger vessel; but this pur-
chase had like to have cost us our lives ;
for the people of whom we had bought
her, having killed their Captain ashore,
had run away with the ship, and turned
pirates; this we heard in the river Cam-
bodia, which obliged us to fly, and we
were pursued by five of the East India
Company's boats^ which we kept off
with our guns, and made the best of
our way to Nanquin, under the utmost
terror of being seized, and hanged as
pirates. Our ship having ?[ rung a
34
leak, we there laid her down to stop it.
While she was in this condition, the
natives not seeing our men, came round
us in twelve large boats, supposing it
to be a wreck; we were in an ill pos-
ture for fighting, all hands being at
work, paying the ship's bottom : we
immediately set about righting the ship;
but before we could do it, they had
boarded our long boat to make prison -
ers of some of our men. The first they
seized was an Englishman, who, instead
of firing the musket he had in his hand,
laid it down in the boat, and seizing
the fellow by the ears, he by main
force dashed his brains out against the
gunnel; while a Dutchman, with the
but end of the musket, knocked down
five of them. In the mean time, a fel-
low who attended the carpenter with a
35
kettle of boiling pitch, saluted the Pa-
gans with a ladle of the hot stuff, which
the carpenter seeing, cried, Well done,
Jack, and dipping the mop into the
boiling pitch, sprinkled it profusely
over them, which made them howl
most dreadfully; and another kettle of
the same materials gave us a complete
victory without firing a gun.
W$ left this bay the next morning,
and sailed to Nanquin, where, to our
great joy, we sold our vessel to a mer-
chant of Japan, and afterwards travel-
led with a large caravan, through
China, Siberia, and Muscovy, and ar-
rived at London, on the 10th of Janu-
ary, 1705; having been absent from
England, this last time, ten years and
nine months. And now resolving to
harass myself no more, I am preparing
S6
for a longer journey than all these; for
I have lived seventy-two years, che-
quered with infinite variety^ and have
been taught sufficiently the value of
retirement, and the blessing of ending
my days in peace, and in the true
worship of my Almighty Deliverer.
