' No fiction in any language was ever better supported than the 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.' — Dr. Blair. 

' Robinson Crusoe is the first book I ever read with plea- 
sure ; and I believe every boy in Europe might say the same.' — 

Marmontel. 

<Was there ever anything written by mere man, that was 
wished longer by its readers, excepting Don QuixaTE, Robinson 
Crusoe, and the Pilgrim's Progress.' — Dr. Johnson. 

' De Foe's style is every where beautiful, but plain and 
homely. Robinson Crusoe is delightful to all ranks and classes, 
and worthy to find a shelf in the libraries of the wealthiest and 
the most learned.' — Charles Lamb, 

' If it be inquired by what charm it is that these Surprising 
Adventures should have instantly pleased, and always pleased, 
it will be found that few books have ever so naturally mingled 
amusement with instruction.' — Chalmers. 

' Society is for ever indebted to the memory of De Foe, for his 
production of a work, in which the ways of Providence are 
simply and pleasingly vindicated, and a lasting and useful moral 
is conveyed through the channel of an interesting and delightful 
story.* — Sir Walter Scott.

' Robinson Crusoe must be allowed, by 'the most rigid mo- 
ralist, to be one of those novels which one may read, not only 
with pleasure, but also with profit. It breathes throughout a 
spirit of piety and benevolence ; it sets in a very striking light 
the importance of the mechanic arts, which they, who know not 
what it is to be without them, are so apt to undervalue ; and it 
fixes in the mind a lively idea of the horrors of solitude, and, 
consequently, of the sweets of social life, and of the blessings we 
derive from conversation and mutual aid.'— Dr. Beattib. 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 



OF 



DE FOE. 



To literary reputation may be applied the same re- 
mark that the Grecian Sage made on human happi- 
ness, when the prosperous career of an individual was 
commented on, — * Wait till the end :' and certainly it 
is only when a writer is removed from the possibility 
of increasing his works, that the real merits of those he 
leaves behind him are impartially ascertained. Time 
is the test of excellence : all that is remembered inde- 
pendent of the passions and interests of the period 
in which it was brought forth, must be remembered 
solely for its intrinsic worth, and for its accordance 
with those principles of truth, which, being inherent 
in' the nature of man, awaken his sympathies with the 
same irresistible power, age after age, in all condi- 
tions of society. Hence he who could be assured 
that his' name should be wafted by the breath of po- 
pularity, even with only one of his works, stea- 
dily down the stream of time, might be well con- 
tented |;hough all his other productions should be

gradually swallowed up in its oblivious gulf. The 
author of *' Robinson Crusoe " may be. deemed one 
of the most remarkable instances of this concentration ' 
of interest and renown in a single performance, that 
ever appeared' in the annals of literature. More than 
two hundred publications flowed from his ever-ready 
pen ; all of them powerful and appropriate at the 
time of their appearance ; yet their interest has gra- 
dually died away with the subjects which gave them 
birth, and the greater proportion of them, till lately, 
have been only to be found resting undisturbed in the 
libraries of the* curious, or chance-preserved, on the 
humbler book-stall. ** Robinson Crusoe," however, 
still forms the delight of all readers ; the young and 
old, the rich and poor : the celebrity of his adven-' 
tures has been extended not only through Germany, 
France, Spain, Italy, and, indeed, the whole of po- 
lished Europe, but even to the sandy plains of Arabia, 
where, under the delicious title of *' Dur El Bakur," 
'' the pearl of the sea," in the translation of the in- 
genious Burkhardt, it rivalled tjbe long-cherished tra- 
ditions of Sinbad the Sailor, which form so inter- 
esting a portion of the stories that constitute the 
'' Arabian Nights' Entertainments." 

It is then, principally in considering him as the 
author of " Robinson Crusoe," that we wish to in- 
quire into the history of Daniel de Foe, and to pre- 
sent such a faithful portraiture of him as may in- 
crease the interest of that work with its numerous 
readers, by showing them the materials of mind out of 
wjiich it was formed^ and the circumstances^by which 



OF DE FOE* iti 

those materials were shapen and brought into active 

Daniel de Foe was born in the parish of St. Giles,^ 
Cripplegate, in the city of London, in 1661. His 
parents were nonconformists, and the religious per- 
secution under which they at that time consequently 
laboured, was perhaps more than compensated to 
them by the blessed effect it brought with it of 
early imbuing the mind of their son with firmness, 
independence, and a profound reverence for that re- 
ligion, in the cause of which he saw those whom< he 
most respected and loved willing to '* count all loss 
gain." Whilst yet a boy he employed himself in 
copying the Bible in short hand, in obedience to 
the wishes of his parents, who dreaded lest they 
might be suddenly deprived of its consolations, by 
some arbitrary decree of power, at a time when they 
might be most wanted : he proceeded with great zeal 
in his task as far as the Pentateuch, when his patience 
and his fears alike subsided, and he was willing to 
believe that further . precaution was at that period 
unnecessary. 

It appears that De Foe was originally intended for 
the ministry, to which he might h^ve received an 
early bias from the respect his parents bore towards 
their favorite pastor, the Reverend Samuel Annesley, 
LL.D., a distinguished presbyterian divine, who, having 
be»n ejected from the living of Cripplegate, afterwards 
preached, as a nonconformist, at a meeting-house in 
Little St, Helen's, Bishopsgate Street. Of Dr. An- 
nesley's worth, both as a minister and a Christian, 



IV BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

De Foe long entertained an affectionate remem-* 
brance ; and he has drawn his character at length in 
the form of an elegy, which may be found in the 
collection of his writings. In the following lines he 
identifies himself with the Doctor's congregation. 

" His native candor, his familiar style, 
Which did so oft his hearers' hours beguile, 
Charm'd us with godliness ; and while he spake, 
We lored the doctrine for the preacher's sake ; 
While he inform'd us what those doctrines meant 
By dint of practice more than argument." 

At fourteen years of age Daniel De Foe was placed 
under the charge of the Reverend Charles Morton, the 
head of a respectable seminary at Newington Green ; 
a gentleman distinguished as a polite and profoupd 
scholar, and in whom his pupils found the advan- 
tages of good society combined with those of sound 
learning. De Foe always retained a grateful remem- 
brance of this worthy man, whose name lie has men- 
tioned on various occasions with the respect it de- 
serves, and whose voluntary exile from his native land 
to America, in consequence of the persecutions to which 
he was exposed on account of his religious principles, 
must have been a subject of equal indignation and re- 
gret to the ingenuous mind of his pupil. It is probable 
that the frequent occurrence of similar acts of oppres- 
sion might be one of the causes that operated to divert 
De Foe from his original intention of entering the 
ministry ; and another might be foiind in that strong 
predilection for politics, which early led him to ex<> 
press his opinions on the popular side with an ardour 



OF J)B FOE. T 

and boldness that would soon kave been sUen6ed from 
the pulpity but which rapidly raised hiin to distinctioa 
through the medium of the press. The period in which 
De Foe lived, immediately between the Restoration 
and the accession of the House of Hanover^ was one 
peculiarly calculated to excite the full energy of a 
mind like his, gifted equally with the powers of ob- 
servation, and with activity to embody their results. 
The court of Charles the Second presented the strange 
and disgusting anomaly of unblushing profligacy of 
manners, combined with the most heartless political 
ingratitude and tyranny. It was impossible for a 
staunch friend of liberty, civil and religious, to look 
coolly on that arbitrary exercise of power which threat-^ 
ened destmction to both. Hence, in the conflict of 
parties from the reign of Charles the Second to the 
accession of George the First, few persons took a 
more active share than De Foe ; and in the number 
of his publications he probably outstripped all other 
writers of his time. During ten of his busiest years, 
and those the most factious in English history, he was 
the sole writer of a periodical paper, which appeared 
three times a week, under the title of '' The Review,'^ 
and contained many elaborate essays upon the most 
important subjects in politics and commerce. 

De Foe was about one-and-twenty when he com* 
jnenced authoTi and he continued the employment, 
with little interruption, for the space of half a oen* 
tiiry. We have already ^remarked that his literary 
labours amounted to two hundred acknowledged pub- 
jlioatioBS, bendes anonymous ones; and, as has been 



▼1 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

observed by ih^ biograpber to whom the public is 
recently indebted for the most perfect catalogue of 
them, as well as for the most elaborate account of their 
author that has yet appeared, ** even the bare titles 
of them are in themselves a literary curiosity, and will 
serve in a degree to illustrate the peculiar bent of the 
writer's genius." 

His first publication is commonly supposed to have 
been called forth by the war between the Turks and 
the Imperialists, in an anonymous treatise against the 
Turks, which appeared in 1683 ; but before this he had 
enlisted his pen in the political dissensions of the times, 
and levelled a lampoon at one of the most factious of 
its writers, the noted Roger L'Estrange. It was occa- 
sioned by L'Estrange's ** Guide to the Inferior Clergy,*' 
and bore the following title : *• Speculum Crape-Gown- 
orum ; or, A Looking-glass for. the Young Acade- 
mies, New Foyl'd, With Reflections on some of the 
late hig-h-flown Sermons : to which is added, an Essay 
towards a Sermon of the newest fashion. By a Guide 
to the Inferiour Clergie. Ridentem discere Verum 
Quis vetat ? London : Printed for E. Rydal. 1682. 
4to. pp. 34." At twenty-four years of age, De Foe 
joined the standard of the brave ^ and unfortunate 
Duke of Monmouth, on his landing at Lyme, in the 
summer of 1685. In this perilous and ill-fated expe- 
dition he acquitted himself courageously, but escap- 
ing alike the horrible cruelties and legal persecutions 
which followed close on the defeat of his leader, 
he lived to narrate the ill-advised transaction and all 
its melancholy consequences,* forty years afterwaids. 



OF DE FOE. Vll 

with a yigonr and feeling that showed how forcibly 
the remembrance of it revived that enthusiasm of 
youth which had led him into the participation of its 
dangers. The public execution of Monmouth, and 
the total wreck of hope in his party, seems to have 
acted for a time on the lively spirits of De Foe as a 
sedative, under the influence of which he betook 
himself to the peaceful occupation of a hosier, or ra- 
ther of a factor in the hosiery line ; for he has repelled, 
somewhat indignantly, the idea of having been ap- 
prenticed to the business, and his biographers have 
done the same for him, as if there could be the 
slightest disgrace, especially in difficult and troubled 
times, in any laudable occupation whatsoever, parti- 
cularly when entered on with the education of a gen- 
tleman, and the independence of an honest man. 

De Foe carried on the office of factor, or middle- 
man, between the manufacturer and the retail dealer, 
about ten years, during which time he took up his 
freedom, to which he was entitled by birth, and was 
admitted to the civic honor of liveryman of London' 
in January, 1687-8. , At this time the nation was in 
a state of feverish excitement respecting the repeal of 
the test act, which James openly avowed should be 
the sole condition of serving him in any capacity, 
either civil or military. Protestant officers were re- 
moved. Popish ones put in their place ; shoals of Ca- 
tholic priests imported ; mass-houses erected ; semina- 
ries instituted ; religious bigotry pervading every mea- 
sure of the government; superstition and hypocrisy 
jpeigning over one half of the people, fear and indigna^ 



VHi . BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

tion oyer the other ; whilst rancour wa» common to 
both. In this state of things De Foe raised his pen 
to put the dissenters on their guard against the king's 
pretended zeal for liberty of conscience, exhorting 
them not to accept even liberty itself at the expence 
of their religious rights. That accomplished nobleman 
and statesman, George Saville, the Marquis of Hali- 
fax, whose political views coincided with those of De 
Poe, published a pamphlet at the same period so similar 
in subject and in the manner of treating it, as to pro- 
cure De Foe the honor of being imagined its author. 

During the middle of William's reign, De Foe was 
comparatively little engaged in politics, and it appears 
that he began to be sensible at this time, that, in help- 
ing to settle the affairs of the nation, his attention had 
been most injuriously diverted from his own. He had 
been engaged some years in the Spanish and Portu- 
guese trade, and he enlarged the sphere of his obser« 
vation on men and manners by visiting those coun« 
tries, as well as France, Holland, and Germany. It 
is ^nrobable, however, that his travels were in some 
measure connected with the increasing embarrassment 
of his affairs, which, in 1692, obliged htm to get out of 
the way of his creditors. However the prudence or 
foresight of De Foe might be impugned by his mtsfbr-^ 
tunes, for in those days the severity of the laws made 
it a real misfortune to be a bankrupt, it is evident 
that his integrity remained unimpeachable, from the 
circumstance of the commission of bankruptcy, which 
an- angry creditor took out against him, being super* 
aided on the petition of those to whom he was most 



OF DE fOB. ix 

indebted^ who accepted a composition on his single 
bond ; and well he repaid the consideration thus shown 
to him, as he not only exerted the utmost efforts of 
industry so far as punctually to fulfil the engagements 
he thus entered on, but some years afterwards, when 
his affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect un-» 
der the reviTifying influence of royal favor, he paid 
the whole of their original demands to several of his 
creditors, who» by the turn of fortune's wheel, were then 
plunged into the same difficulties as he had extricated 
himself from, by the most laudable application and 
frugality. The practice of these virtues was the more 
commendable in him, as they by no means formed any 
component parts of his character : he had, therefore^ 
reason to be proud rather than ashamed of the charge 
brought against him by Lord Haversham, of being 
mercenary ; to which he replies by a simple statement 
of fjBtct, more honorable to himself than any studied 
panegyric by another could have been, saying that 
^* with a numerous family, and no help but his own 
industry, he had forced his way, with undiscouraged 
diligence, through a sea of misfortunes, and reduced 
his debts, exclusive of composition, from seventeen 
thousand to less than five thousand pounds." In n 
subsequent work he expressed himself on this subject 
with an equal sense of religion and honor, ** Never 
think yourselves dischai^ed in conscience," said he^ 
** though you may be discharged in law. The obli- 
gatioB of an honest mind can never die. No title of 
honor, no recorded merit, no mark of distinction, can 
txoeed that lasting appellation^ an ' honest man.' He 



ii BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

that lies buried under such an epitaph, has more said of 
him than volumes of history can contain. The payiheiit 
of debts, after fair discharges, is the clearest title to 
such a character that I know ; and how any man can 
begitt again, and hope for a blessing from heaven, or 
favor from man, without such a resolution, I know not." 
Years afterwards, when he was suffering under the 
obloquy and punishment of his famous ironical sa-^ 
ture, entitled, ** The Shortest Way with the Dissen* 
ters," the following testimony to his honesty was 
granted him by John Tutchin, one of his sharpest 
and earliest antagonists, who entered the lists of con- 
troversy with himi, in a pamphlet in titled, '' Dis8en-< 
ter and Observator,'' and who afterwards, by an illi- 
beral attack on King William, in a poem icalled 
** The Foreigners," drfew forth De Foe's fndignant 
reply, in his famous satire of '' The True-born English- 
man." *' I must do one piece of justice to the man," 
observes the writer, *^ though I love him no better 
than you do : it is this, that meeting a gentleman in a 
coffee-house, 'when I and every body else were railing 
at him, the gentleman took us up with this shprt 
speech^ * Gentlemen,' said he, * I know this De 
Foe as well as any of you, for I was one of his cre- 
ditors, and compounded with him, and discharged 
him fully. Several years afterwards he sent for me, 
and though he was clearly discharged, he paid me all 
the remainder of his debt voluntarily, and of his own 
accord ; and he told me, that as far as God should 
enable him, he intended to do so with every body. 
When he had done, he desired me to set my hand to a 



OF DB FOE. Xi 

paper to acknowledge it, which I readily did, and 
found a great many names to the paper before me; 
and I think myself bound to own it, though I am no 
friend to the book he wrote, no more than you.* *' We 
have dwelt the more fully on . this subject, because, 
thanks to the liberal spirit and enlai^ed views of mo- 
dern times, the sole disgrace in the present day in 
failing, seems to be that of failing for a small sum ; 
and it would be thought as ungentlemanly to remind 
Any one of a debt thus nominally liquidated, however 
ruinous in its consequences to the creditor, as it would be 
impolitic for the debtor himself to bring his bankruptcy 
to recollection, by any old-fashioned prudence or de- 
cency in altering his mode of living according to his 
circumstances, or, as the homely wisdom of our ances- 
tors concisely expressed it, *' cutting his coat accord- 
ing jto his cloth." 

The estimation in which De Foe's integrity was 
held by his friends, manifested itself in an offer which 
they made of settling him as a factor at Cadiz, on 
highly advantageous terms ; but all his misfortunes 
had not taught him to attend to his own interests, 
as he would have done by accepting the proposition ; 
instead of which he chose to remain in comparative 
seclusion at home^ employing himself with writing 
*' An Essay on- Projects';" among which was a plan 
for the ways and means of raising money for the war 
just then begun with France, which he proposed tb 
do by a general assessment of personal property ; and 
80 well satisfied was h^ of the efficacy of his scheme, 
ihat he offered to farm the revenue arising from il 



Xll BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

hiniselfy at a rent of three miUioiui ammallj, gnring 
good security for the payment. ** And when that ii 
done/' says he, *' the natioB would get three more 
by paying it, which is Tery strange, but might eanly 
be made out.'' Such are the sunny yisions that throw 
their radiance over the path of the projector and poli- 
tician, to the bewilderment of weaker optics, who see 
with astonishment a rational being gazing on the stars 
above his head, instead of aroiding the ditch at his 
feet ! In spite of himself, howerer, the circumstances 
of De Foe began to assume a better aspect. He was 
appointed by government, without any solicitation of 
his own, accountant to the commissioners of the ^ass 
duty, in which office he continued until the tax itself 
was repealed in 1699. Much about the same time he 
was made secretary to the tile and brick wcnrks at 
Tilbury, in Essex, which employment he held for 
several years, and those years might be termed the 
most prosperous of his worldly career. 

The accession of King William to the throne was 
every way an important epoch in the life of De Foe. 
^e had, both in his public capacity as a writer, and 
in his individual one as a dissenter, taken an intense 
interest in the progress of the revolution. The general 
bent of his productions could not fail to render him ac- 
i^eptable to William's government ; and his poem of 
<' The True-born Englishman," procured him the 
honor of an introduction to the monarch himself, by 
Urbom he was ever afterwards treated with a degree 
#f consideration which added personal partiality to 
esteem ; and he annually commemorated the 



OF DK FOE. Xiii 

4th of November, the day on which the king first 
landed on British ground, in 1668, as one of the 
most anspicioiis in the annais of onr history. ** A 
day," says he, '* famous on various accounts, and 
every one of them dear to Britons who love their 
country, value the protestant interest, or have an 
aversion to tyranny and oppression. On this day he 
was bom ; on this day he married the daughter of 
England ; and on this day he rescued the nation 
from a bondage wors^ than that of Egypt, a bond- 
age of soul, as well as bodily servitude ; a slavery 
to the ambition and raging lust of a generation set 
on fire by pride, avarice, cruelty, and blood." 

As the poem of ** The True-born Englishman " had 
perhaps a more decided influence on both the fortunes 
and reputation of De Foe than any other of his pro- 
ductions, it may not be amiss to make a few remarks 
in this place on its origin and intention. '' During 
this time," says he, ^' there came out a vile, abhorred 
pamphlet, in very ill verse, written by one Mr. Tut- 
chin, and called * The Foreigners ;' in which the 
author, who he was I then knew not, fell personally 
on the king himself, and then on the Dutch nation. 
And after having reproached his majesty with crimes 
that his worst enemies could not think of without 
horror, he sums up all in the odious name of Foreigner, 
This filled me with a kind of rage against the book, 
and gave birth to a trifle, which I never could hope 
should have met with so general an acceptance as it 
did ; I mean " The True-born Englishman." 

In this poem De* Foe satirizes the English, * 



Xir X BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

selves the most mixed race in the world, for their 
prejudices against foreigners, and lashes their ingra- 
titude for overlooking all the benefits which King 
William had confened on their country, merely 
because that country did not happen to be the one 
which gave him birth. The opening lines of the 
poem are well known. 

** Wherever God erects a house of prayer. 
The Devil always builds a chapel there j 
And 'twill be found upon examination, 
The latter has the largest congregation." 

After tracing the most ancient ' families to their 
origin, among those who marched under the banners 
of the Norman invader, he proceeds to compliment 
them and his countrymen at large in the following 
lines :— 

** These are the heroes who despise the Dutch, 
And rail at new-come foreigners so much ; 
Forgetting that themselves are all derived 
From the most scoundrel race that ever lived, 
A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones. 
Who ransack'd kingdoms, and dispeopled towns. 
The Pict, and painted Briton, treach'rous Scot, 
By hunger, theft, .and rapine hither brought, 
Norwegian pirates, buccaneering Danes, 
Whose red-hair'd offspring every where remains ; 
Who, join'd with Norman -French, compound the breed. 
From whence your true-bom Englishmen proceed." 

From searching into the origin of the race, he next, 
in colours e(][ually flattering, delineates its character- 
istics :— 



OF D£ FOB. XT 

" Fierce as the Briton, as the Roman bravei 
And less inclined to conquer than to save ; 
Eager to fight, and lavish of their blood. 
And equally of Fear and Forecast void. 
The Pict has made 'em sour, the Dane morose. 
False from the Scot, and from the Norman worse. 
What honesty they have, the Saxons gave them. 
And that, now they grow old, begins to leave them." 

In terms equally forcible and biting, he runs over 
the peerage as augmented by the natural children of 
King Charles the Second, and other left-handed 
sources, and concludes his poem, after warm pane- 
gyrics on King William, his generals, and personal 
friends, with an axiom, the truth of which must be 
equally acknowledged by all ranks and in all ages :— • 

** Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate. 
And see their offspring thus degenerate ; 
How we contend for birth and names unknown. 
And build on their past actions, not our own ; 
They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface. 
And then disown the vile degenerate race ; 
For fame of families is all a cheat, 

'TiS PERSONAL VIRTUE ONLY MAKES US GREAT." 

I 

The interest of the satire was no way lessened in 
the estimation of King William, who knew as little 
of the Muses as of the Graces, by the rough and 
homely numbers in which it was conveyed ; and the 
run it had among the nation at large, praised by 
some, abused by others, but read by all, was asto* 
nishing. De Foe himself, in less than four years»

his concurrence : of these pirated editions no les9 than 
80,000 were disposed of at a cheap rate in the streets, 
of London. By this unprincipled conduct De Foe 
sustained a very considerable deduction in his profitB, 
which otherwise, according to his own calculation, 
would have amounted to one thousand pounds, an 
amazing sum certainly in those days for so small a 
publication. 

The favor in which De Foe was now held at court, 
added to the esteem with which his mercantile in- 
tegrity caused him to be regarded, procured him the 
notice of many persons of rank and talent ; and it was 
probably to give himself some little additional conse- 
quence among his new associates, or to restore it to 
its Norman origin, that he took the De in addition 
to bis name, * having before been known only as 
Daniel Foe ; nor would his antagonists ever compli- 
ment him by addressing him with the foreign prefix. 

De Foe resided several years at Tooting in 
Surrey, where he rendered the Dissenters in that 
neighbourhood the service of forming them into a 
regular congregation, under the reverend and learned 
Dr. Joshua Oldfield, author of a treatise on ** The 
Improvement of Human Reason.'^- 

The whole of the reign of King William afforded 
perpetual invitation to the pen of a writer like De 
Foe. The massacre of Glencoe, the question of oc- 
casional conformity, of a standing army, the state of 
morals, reformation of the stage, observance of the 
sabbath, treaty of partition, act of settlement, and, 
above all, the, famous appeal of parliament known

by the name of the '* Legion Letter;" a statement, 
of grievances laid before them in the name of two 
hundred thousand Englishmen, on the impeachment 
of the leading Whig nobility ; — were all treated on by 
him with his accustomed vigour and independence. 

The death of William in 1702 opened a fres^ 
field to him in vindicating both in prose and verse 
the memory of that monarch, to whom he was cer- 
tainly most devotedly attached, from the aspersions 
ai his enemies, and setting forth with all the lively 
eloc[uence of grief quickened by indignation, the in- 
-jiumerable benefits conferred by him on a country 
ungrateful enough to forget them before his remain^ 
were cold. *' Can an Englishman," says he, '* go to 
bed, or rise up, without blessing the very name of 
King William ? His perils have been our safety, his 
labours our ease, his cares our comfort, his continued 
harassing and fatigue our continued calm and tran- 
quillity. When you sit down to eat, why' have you 
not soldiers quartered in your houses, to command 
your servants and insult your tables? 'Tis because 
King William subjected the military to the civil au- 
thotjity, and made the sword of justice triumph over 
the sword of war. When you lie down at night, 
why do you not bolt and bar your chamber, to 
defend the chastity of your wives and daughters from 
the ungoverned lust of raging mercenaries? 'Tis 
because King William restored the sovereignty and 
dominion of the laws, and made the red-coat world 
servants to those that paid them. When you re- 
ceive your rents, why are not arbitrary defalcations 
VOL. I. b 



XVm BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

made on your tenants, arbitrary imposts laid on your 
commerce, and oppressive taxes levied on your es- 
tates, to support the tyranny that demands them, and 
your bondage made strong at your own expense ? 
^Tis because King William re-established the essen- 
tial security of your properties, and put you into that 
happy condition, which few nations enjoy, of calling 
your souls your own. How came you by a parlia- 
ment, to balance between the governed and the go- 
verning, but on King William's exalting liberty upon 
the ruin of oppression ? How came you ever to have 

f)ower to abuse your deliverer, but by the very de- 
iverance he wrought for you? He gave you that 
liberty you afterwards took to insult him, and sup- 
ported you in those very privileges you ungratefully 
bullied him with. You could not, with all your 
brutish skill, provoke him to be a tyrant. He 
abhorred oppression, and scorned to practice it; and 
he that had fire enough to assault all your oppressors, 
and a hand strong enough to wrestle with an esta- 
blished and confirmed tyrant, had yet meekness 
enough to let you oppress him, because he would 
not oppress you, and saw you ungrateful enough to 
oppose^ not your benefactor only, but your own feli- 
city for his sake," 

The reign of Anne was fraught with trouble to the 
dissenters ; the queen advocated the cause of the high 
church with firmness and moderation, but, 

" It is the curse of kings to be attended 

By slaves, that take their humors for a warrant 

To break within the bloody house of life -, 



* V 



OF DE FOE. XtX 

Aad, on the winking of authority, 

To understand a law ; to know the meaning 

Of dangerous majesty, when, perchance, it frowns 

More upon humor than advised respect." 

The intemperance of the party thus patronized by the 
queen soon threatened to elevate the mitre even above 
the crown, and to mark all the humbler dissenters from 
its dogmas as victims of persecution. '* I knew/.' 
says De Foe, in his ' Christianity of the High-church 
considered/ ''a person of the same principles with the 
High-church, who, discoursing with me on the altering 
the lieutenancy throughout the kingdom, was pleased 
to say, * Now, Sir, we have an opportunity, and don't 
distrust our improving it: a little time and pains 
shall compel all to be of one religion.' ' How can 
that be,' added I ; 'don't you find the Dissenters are 
the most numerous and the richest persons in the 
kingdom V * 'Tis no matter for that,' cried he, laugh- 
ing ; * it will not be long before all Dissenters will be 
out of office, and the magistracy in our hands ; when 

that d -d liberty of conscience,' added he, biting 

his lips, ' shall be snatched away, and they compelled 
to conform.' ' I fancy,' said 1, * these things will not 
happen in my time, nor in this reign, whatever they 
may in the next.' ' Assure yourself that they will,' 
added he ; * and as for those who are obstinate, I 
hope Queen Mary's bonfires will , blaze again in 
Smithfield, that they may be all extirpated, and not 
a soul left.'" Sentiments like these, unblushingly 
expressed, were certain to lead to actions equally in- 
temperate, insomuch that in a very short time the Dis- 



XX BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

senters saw themselves exposed to insult in tkll public 
places, their meeting-houses and religious assemblies 
assaulted by the mob, and their miuisters and preach- 
ers scarcely free from yiolence in the streets. Such a 
state of things was calculated to excite the indignation 
of far less fiery spirits than De Foe ; it cannot therefore 
be matter of surprise that he should attack it with the 
sharpest weapons he had at command : among these 
isatire was ever ready ; and he had now recourse to it 
under its most delicate and dangerous form of irony. 

He accordingly published his celebrated pampUet, 
entitled '' The Shortest Way with the Dissentefs^ 
or Proposals for the Establishment of the Church ;'' 
in which, under the character of a high-churdmian, 
he so dexterously expounded the sentiments with 
which Sacheverell, Leslie, and other licensed Tory 
fanatics, had insulted true religion and common sense 
from court pulpits, that, to use his own expression, 
•'* the piece in its outward figure looked so natu*- 
ral, and was so like a brat of their own begetting^ 
that, like two apples, they could not know then 
asunder.'' After pretended bitter reflections, on ^ 
Dissenters and their principles, and a retrospective 
view of their conduct in the preceding reigns, affect- 
ing implicit belief in all the factions and plots im* 
puted to them, he proceeds to auLke as violent and 
as ironical a panegyric on the virtues of the esta* 
blished church, particularly complimenting it on its 
lenity and moderation. ** The first execution of the 
laws against Dissenters in England," says be, ** was 
in the days of King James the First. And what 



OF DB FOB* XXI 

it aai6uBt to ? Truly the worst they suffered was at 
their own request, to let them, go to New England, 
luid erect a colony, give them great priv^eges, defend 
them against invaders, and receive no taxes or re* 
▼estte from them. This was the cruelty of the church 
of England. Fatal lenity! Had King James sent 
all the puritans in England away to the West Indies, 
we had heen a national unmixed church. To requite 
the Ittiity of the father, they took up arms against 
the son ; conquer, pursue, take, imprison, and at last 
put to death the anointed of God, and destroy the 
being of government ! In the days of King Charles 
the Second, how did the church reward their bloody 
doiBgs ? With lenity and mercy. King Charles came 
in all ndercy and love, cherished them, preferred 
th^a, withheld the rigour of the law, and oftentimes 
against the advice of his parliament, gave them li-^ 
berty of conscience. And how did they requite him 
with the villainous contrivance to depose and murder 
him and his successor at the Rye-plot ? King James 
the Second, as if mercy was the inherent quality of the 
family, began his reign with unusual favour towards 
them* Nor could their joining the Duke of Mon- 
mouth against him move him to do himself justice on 
them : but that mistaken prince thought to win them 
by gentleness and love. How they requited him all 
the world knows.'' 

In examining the reasons urged in their favour, De 
Foe says, ** They are very numerous, they say, and 
we cannot suppress them. To this may be answered, 
%» They are not so numerous as the Protestants in 



XXII BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

France, and yet the French King efFectnally cleared 
the nation of them at once, and we don't find that Ipe 
misses them at home. But I am not of opinion they 
are so numerous as is pretended. Those mistaken 
people of the church, who are misled and deluded by 
the wheedling artifices to join with them, make their 
party the greater. But these will open their eyes 
when the government shall set heartily aboivt the 
work, and come off from them as some animals, which 
they say always desert a house when it is likely to 
fall. 2. The more numerous the more daugerous, 
and, therefore, the more ne^ to suppress them. 3. If 
we are to allow them, only because we cannot sup« 
press them, then it ought to be tried whether we can 
or no. But I am of opinion, 'tis easy to be done, 
and could prescribe ways, and means, if it were pro- 
per ; but I doubt not the government will find effec- 
tual methods for rooting the contagion from the face 
of the land." He adds, " We can never enjoy a set- 
tled uninterrupted union and tranquillity in this na- 
tion, till the spirit of whiggism, faction, and schism, 
is melted down like the old money." To quicken the 
work, De Foe tells his^ readers, ** ihe time is come 
which all good men have wished for. Here is the op- 
portunity, and the only one perhaps that ever the 
church had to secure herself, and destroy her enemies. 
If ever you will establish the best Christian church in 
the world ; if ever you will suppress the spirit of en- 
thusiasm '; if ever you will free the nation from the 
viperous brood that have so long sucked the blood of 
their mother; if you will leave your posterity free 



OF DE FOE. XXUl 

from faction and rebellion, this is the time. This is 
the time to pull up this heretical weed of sedition, 
liiat has so long disturbed the peace of our church, 
and poisoned the good corn. ' But,' says anothev 
hot and cold objector, ' this is renewing the fire and 
faggot; this will be cruelty in its nature, and barba- 
rous to all the world.' I answer, 'tis cruelty to kill a 
snake or a toad in cold blood, but the poison of their 
nature makes it a charity to our neighbours to destroy 
those creatures, not for any personal injury received, 
but for prevention ; not for the evil they have done, 
but the evil they may do. Serpents, toads, vipers, &c. 
are noxious to the body, and poison the sensitive life ; 
these poison the soul, con-upt our posterity, ensnare, 
our children, destroy the vitals of our happiness, and 
contaminate the whole mass. Shall any law be given 
to such wild creatures? Some beasts. are for sport, 
and the huntsmen give them the advantage of ground ; 
but some are knocked on the head by all possible 
ways of violence and surprise. I do not prescribe fire 
and faggot ; but, as Scipio said of Carthage, Delenda 
est Carthago. They are to be rooted out of this na- 
tion, if ever we will live in peace, serve God, or enjoy 
our own. As for the manner, I leave it to those who 
have a right to execute God's justice on the nation's 
and the church's enemies." 

De Foe adds, " 'Tis vain. to trifle in this matter. 
The light foolish handling of them by fines is their 
^lory and advantage. If the gallows instead of the 
compter, and the gallies instead of the fines, were the 
reward of going to a conventicle, there would not be 



XXIV BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

SO many sufferers. The spirit of martyrdom is over. . 
Tbey that will go. to church to be chosen sheriffii 
and mayors, would go to forty churches rather thaa. 
be hanged. If one severe law was made and pune* 
tiially executed, that whoever was found at a conven- 
ticle should be banished the nation, and the preacher 
be hanged, we should soon see an end of the tale; 
they would all come to church ; and one age would 
make us all one again. To talk of five shillings a 
month for not coming to the sacrament, and one shil- 
ling a week for not coming to church, is such a way o^ 
converting people as was never known. This is selU 
ing them a liberty to transgress for so much moAey. 
If it be not a crime, why don't we give full lice&se ? 
And if it be, no price ought to compound for the oom-i^ 
mitting it, for that is selling a liberty to people to sin 
against God and the government. We hang men for 
trifles, and banish them for things not worth naming i 
but an offence against God and the church, against 
the welfare of the world, and the dignity of religion, 
shall be bought off for five shillings. This is such s 
shame to a Christian government, that 'tis with regret 
I transmit it to posterity." 

The most remarkable circumstance attending this 
satire was, that it offended. all parties alike. The 
high-church people did not find out that it was the 
production of an enemy, and the dissenters did not 
perceive that it was written by a friend. The church 
party could not have committed a severer libel oq 
themselves than they did, in thus adopting as a serious 
measure the advice to send all the dissenting minis* 



OF PE FOE. XXT 

tj9]Rs %Q tb^ gallows, baiiiah their people; and confiscate 
ibmr possessions; but the dissenters libelled them-* 
selves nearly as much by persisting to accuse the 
aatlMMTy even after De Foe was known to be the wri- 
ter, of wishing to suggest arbitrary measures towards 
them, to a goTernment already too much inclined to 
treat them with severity ; forgetting that in that case, 
as be observes, he must equally have invited persecu- 
tion on the heads of an aged father and unoffending 
wife» and six innocent children. It is certain, how^ 
ever, that the churchmen were universally deceived 
by the werrk : one, a fellow of a college in Cambridge, 
having received it with a parcel of books from his 
bookseller, was so delighted with its style and argu- 
ments, that he wrote to thank the bookseller for hav- 
ing sent it, in the following terms i ** Sir, I received 
yours, and with it that pamphlet which makes, so 
muck noise, called * The Shortest Way with the Dis- 
senters,' for which I thank you. I join with that 
author in all he says, and have such a value for the 
book, that, next to the Holy Bible, and the sacred 
emaments, I take it'for the most valuable piece I have. 
I pray God put it into her Majesty's heart to put what 
is tiiere proposed into execution. Yours, &c" 

It may be imagined how deeply persons thus capa- 
ble of canonizing a performance of this kind must 
have been mortified, when they found it emanating, 
in the most caustic spirit of satire, by his own acknow- 
ledgment, from a dissenter, at once the champion and 
oracle of bis party. They blushed at the discovery 
tt had betrayed them into, of their intolerant spirit. 



TLXVl BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

Their own reputation called on them to condemn the 
book, and yet their resentment against its author in- 
creased their hatred of his tenets. The whole hation 
was in a blaze : even they who were most moderate in 
their own principles condemned De Foe for throwing 
such a firebrand among the inflammable materials of 
party spirit ; abd the governing powers, being as ini- 
mical to the man as to his book, it was resolved to 
make this occurrence the ** shortest way'' of getting 
rid of him altogether by crushing him beneath a state 
prosecution. 

De Foe saw the cloud beginning to darken over his 
head, and prudently hid himself from the tempest. A 
proclamation was then issued by government, offering a 
reward of fifty pounds for the discovery of his retreat : 
in this proclamation he is charged with ''writing a scan- 
dalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled, ' The shortest 
Way with the Dissenters,'" and described as "a mid- 
die-sized spare man, about forty years old, of a brown 
complexion, and dark-brown coloured hair, but wears 
a wig ; a hooked nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a 
mole near the mouth." The book was next sentenced 
to be burned by the hands of the common hangman ; 
a measure more likely to promote the sale than the 
suppression of the work ; but when this procedure was 
followed by the arrest of the writer and bookseller^ 
De Foe generously stepped forth from his conceal- 
ment, resolved to brave the full fury of the storm » 
rather than expose others to suffering for his error. 
The short period of De Foe's retirement had been 
spent in writing an apologetical explanation of the 



OF DE FOE. XXTli 

work, but neither the respect he professed in it for the 
Queen, his submission to the ruling powers, nor the 
generosity he had displayed in coming forward to the 
release of the innocent, could disarm faction of it6 
malice, or his enemies of their resentment. He was 
promised the protection of the Queen if he would 
plead guilty to being the author of the obnoxious 
pamphlet, and throw himself upon her mercy for par- 
don. To this proposition he willingly acceded ; but 
having done so, he was basely forsaken by the court, 
and weakly or wickedly found guilty by the jury of 
composing and publishing a seditious libel, and' con- 
demned to pay a' fine of 200 marks to the Queen, 
stand three times in the pillory, be imprisoned during 
the Queen's pleasure, and find sureties for his good 
behaviour for seven years. 

The infamous severity of this sentence, it has been 
justly observed, reflected much more dishonor on the 
court by which it was pronounced, than on De Foe, 
on whom it was inflicted. 

If it be easy, however, for those high in office to 
pass sentences of disgrace, it is not always easy to 
make them disgraceful. It was fortunately in the 
midst of summer when De Foe was thus condemned to 
make himself more conspicuous above others, than 
either his friends or enemies had ever anticipated his 
being destined to do. The populace adorned the pil- 
lory with garlands, like votive offerings on the altar of 
liberty ; drank his health whilst they protected him 
from insult during his exhibition ; testified their joy 
liy shouts and acclamations when he was taken down. 



XXVIU BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

and guarded him to a place of refuge, where refrteh* 
ments were prepared for him : that same day a '' Hymn 
to the Pillory'^ appeared from the pen of De Foe, 
and the interest which was called forth on its first 
publication by sympathy for the author, was con- 
tinued through several editions by the generosity and 
manliness of the sentiments it expressed. 

The cruel and unjustifiable severity of goyernment 
towards De Foe was, nevertheless, a fatal blow to his - 
fortunes. Before his persecution he was in circum- 
stances sufficiently prosperous to authorize him to keep 
a coach and a proportionate establishment; but his 
long imprisonment preventing him from looking after 
his pantile works, which were the chief source of his 
revenue, they were obliged to be given up ; by which 
a hundred labourers and their families were thrown 
adrift, and De Foe, after losing three thousand five 
hundred pounds, saw himself surrounded by a wife 
whom he tenderly loved, and six children, with no 
other means of supporting them than such as he might 
be able to procure by his pen. 

De Foe was now immured between prison walls.; 
his enemies attacking, his friends forsaking him, his 
fortunes ruined, and temptations assailing him ; for had. 
he chosen to abjure hb party and his principles^ in 
one week the whole aspect of his fortunes might have 
been changed. The very satire which now drew on 
him the resentment of the governing powers, would 
have been willingly paid for, had he consented to de- 
vote it to their service. But this dark period of ad- 
versity was that in which De Foe's virtues shone 



OF DB FOE. Xxix 

forth with the brightest lustre. He might, indeed, say, 
" Till I die, I will not remove my integrity from me. 
My righteou^iess I hold fast, and will not let it go : 
my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live." 
He occupied his prison hours with various publica- 
tions connected with the dissenting interests, and ga- 
thered his works together ii^to one uniform edition, as 
well to secure those of which he was really the author 
from piracy, as to disclaim others which were imputed 
to him from malicious motives. Nor did his observa- 
tion of men and manners forsake him in this compara- 
tively limited field for its exercise. He seemed, like a 
watchful sentinel, to survey from his fixed and narrow 
station the movemenb of the enemy's line ; and if he 
could not say in the contemplative spirit of the author 
of the Task, 

♦* Tis pleasant through the loop-holes of retreat 
To peep at such a world ; to see the stir 
Of the glreat Babel, and not feel the crowd ; 
To hear the roar she sends through all her gates 
At a safe distance, where the dying sound 
Falls a soft murmur on the uninjur'd ear " — 

he yet might, in his own more homely numbers, 
apply the consolations to himself, which he has de- 
scribed in his H3rmn to Peace, and which evidently 
did not forsake him at this trying moment. 

** Brought up in teaching sorrow's school. 
In peace and patience I possess my soul ; 
Am master of my mind. 
And there the heaven of satisfaction find. 



XXX BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

Let them ten thousand barbarous methods ti7, 
When they'll no longer let me live, I'll die ; 
Of all their fury, I shall have 
An uncontested conquest in the grave." 

It was now also that he projected his periodical 
work called " The Review," the first number of which 
was published on Saturday, February 19, 1704. It 
combined news foreign and domestic, political contro- 
versy, and disquisitions on trade and commerce, with 
the lighter topics of literary criticism, gallantry and 
anecdote. From its very nature, however, the chief 
proportion of the work was connected with the topics of 
the day, and consequently did not survive their ephe- 
meral sources ; insomuch that the nine quarto volumes 
to which it extended are now no where to be found 
except in detached parts ; and are held in remem- 
brance only as a prodigious effort of industry and 
multifarious information in one man ; particularly when 
the various other productions emanating from the pen 
of the same individual, and his divers active employ- 
ments both political and commercial, during the same 
period, are taken into consideration. Of the reward 
of all this industry let the author himself speak at the 
close of the first volume. '* I have studied to direct 
and inform the world," says he, ** and what have I 
had for my labour ? Profit the press would not allow, 
and therein I am not deceived, for I expected none. 
But good manners and good language I thought I 
might expect, because I gave no other ; and it is but 
just to treat mtinkind as they would be treated. But 
neither has this been paid to me, in debt to custom

t 

and civility. How often have my ears, my hands, 
and my head been to be pulled off? Impotent bullies ; 
that, attacked by truth and their vices stormed, fill the 
air with rhodomontades and indecencies, but never 
showed their face to the resentment truth had a just 
cause to entertain for them ! I have passed through 
clouds of clamour, cavil, raillery, and objection ; and 
have this satisfaction, that truth being the design, 
Jinis coronat, I am never forward to value my own 
performances ; but I cannot but own myself infinitely 
pleased, and more than satisfied, that wise men read 
this paper with pleasure, own the just observations in 
it, and have voted it useful." 

Under these circumstances no wonder that he medi- 
tated bringing the work to a' close at the end of the 
first volume ; as, however, he was induced to continue 
it by subscription for several years aften;«^ds, it is to 
be hoped that he finally gained something more by it 
than the necessary charges of the press, which he had 
the generosity to say he was sorry his circumstances 
did- not enable him to oblige his readers with, in addi- 
tion to his own labours. 

In the beginning of August 1704, De Foe was 
restored to those precious gifts of heaven, liberty and 
fresh air, through the interposition of Harley, Speaker 
to the House of Commons ; who, aware of the benefit 
the new administration might derive from the variety 
and readiness of his talents, wisely resolved to try 
how far the sunbeams of prosperity might relax the 
sternness of that independent spirit which the bitter 
blasts of adversity had had no power to bend. The 



XXXU BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

Queen accordingly, under the representationfl of hm 
minister, was enabled to gratify her natural goodneSB 
of heart by releasing the unfortunate Tictim of pcuty 
cabal, sending him at the same time a sum of money 
to pay his fine, and the expenses of his discharge, and 
transmitting a considerable supply to his wife and 
family through the hands of the lord treasurer Qo" 
dolphin. 

Immediately on his release from prison, De Foe 
went to Bury St. Edmonds, in Suffolk, to recruit his 
health and recover his serenity. Here he occupied 
himself in writing various works of more or less im^ 
portance, connected with the events of the day. In 
the beginning of the ensuing year he was sent abroad, 
probably unfder an assumed name, on some secret 
mission by Harley, who had rightly calculated on 
his being more easily worked upon by •gratitude than 
opposition. He acquitted himself so well in this k^ 
of agency as to procure him no small degree of &vor 
with government; but the violence with which reli- 
gious and political fury raged during the latter part of 
the reign of Anne, involved him, as usual, in all the 
heat of controversy in which it seems to have been his 
singular bad fortune to incur the hatred of opposing 
parties, without gaining the confidence of his own. 
The cause of this dislike and distrust may possibly 
be found in De Foe's manner of treating his subjects, 
as much as in the subjects themselves. Satire is at all 
times a dangerous weapon to handle ; irony the moat 
difficult part of it to manage, and it was that of which 
De Foe was unfortunately most fond : the effect of it» 



OF DE FOE. XXXIII 

aa we have already seen in his ** Shortest Way with 
the Dissenters/' too often was to bewilder his friends 
without convincing his enemies. Whatever ill-will^ 
however, his principles or his tone of expressing them 
might beget, yet the mode in which it was frequently 
shown was base and cruel ; in attacking him by means 
of the press, he was only attacked with his own 
weapons ; and even the torrents of abuse thus poured 
forth on him from that great public fount of good 
and evil, might only be regarded as the missiles of 
the day : but in resorting to personal insults and 
threats of violence as they did, his enemies disgraced 
themselves ; and in endeavoring to ruin him a second 
time by law proceedings, sham actions and arrests, 
trade debts compounded for seventeen years before, 
and assignments of debts and collateral bonds eagerly 
sought and purchased to be brought out against him, 
with other unjustifiable artifices, they too evidently 
showed, that by whatever denomination they might 
express their Christian doctrine, its spirit and prac-* 
tice was far from them. 

. Under such usage De Foe might well complain, 
as he affectingly does, that he stood alone in the 
world, abandoned by those whom he had served, sold 
and betrayed by friends, abused and cheated by bar- 
barous and uiyiatural relations, sued for oUier men's 
debts, and stripped naked by public injustice of what 
should have enabled him to pay his own. Such were 
the results of his contest for liberty and religion, the 
most sacred things under heaven ; without which, man, 
ceasing to be rational, becomes only a responsible

brute. With «o little to delight him at home, De Foe 
willingly accepted, an offer made him by the miniatem 
to go into Scotland on a mission respecting the union, 
a subject on which he had bestowed considerable 
thought, and which he had personally discussed many 
years before with king William. His known princi- 
pies, his insinuating address, and the variety of his 
information in all matters connected with political 
economy, added to the regard he had always ex- 
pressed towards the Scotch, gained him an excdlent 
reception among *'that sagacious people," until he 
came to be consulted on the taxes and excise, wben 
the diflSculty of dealing them out in such proportions as 
suited at once the principles and purses of the parties 
who w^re to pay them, speedily turned their *' noble 
nature into bitterness," and nearly pocured him the 
honor of martyrdom, as the. framer of these un- 
palatable measures, and the advocate of that union, 
the advantages of which all their second-sightedfiess 
did not enable them at that time to foresee. 

The Scotch, however, were beholden to De Foe in- 
this and several subsequent visits for many valuable 
suggestions respecting their trade, manufactories, and 
shipping; he also complimented them with a long 
poem in folio, entitled, ** Caledonia, a poem in honor 
of Scotland and the Scots' nation, in three parts ;" 
and, in return, the Duke of Queensberry, the queen's 
high-commissioner, complimented him with the title 
of Esquire, and the exclusive privilege of selling his 
eulogistic strains for the space of seven years : it does 
not appear, however^ that this privilege was ever of

much- Utility to him, the aale barely extending beyond^ 
the original subscription list. Nevertheless, his His- 
tory of the Union of Great Britain, published in 1709, 
tn folio, pp. 686, is a yaluable performance, at onco 
ft fiButhfiil record df important historical events, and a 
conect picture of the actors in them. When De Foo 
•eturned to London, January 1708, after an absence 
in Scotland of sixteen months, he was rewarded for 
his services with some appointment to which was an- 
nexed a fixed salary ; probably a sinecure, as he doe» 
not appear to have been confined by it to any particu- 
lar duties, or to have been required to comply with the 
sacramental test, to which he uniformly objected. 

When through the jealousies of the Marlborough 
and Masham interests the queen wa» compelled to 
dismiss her favorite Harley from her councils, De Foe 
sftw himself placed in a very painful and delicate Av^ 
lemma. To Harley he owed his liberty, bis pension, 
and \ii& consideration in society ; to Godolphin, 
who on the retirement of Harley was restored to the 
queen's Havor, he feared that on that very account he 
could only be an object of distrust ; fortunately how- 
ever for him, both parties acquitted themselves with 
equal generosity towards him ; Harley releasing him 
from all supposed obligation which honor might 
suggest to him, to follow the fortunes of his first pa- 
tron rath^ than accept any employment from his suc- 
cessor ; and Godolphin retaining him in his situation > 
without any way fettering his honest independence.

action in hid appeal to ^^ Honor and Justice/' pub<^

lished seven years afterwards, in which he takes a 
review of his political life under the different reigns 
he had seen, and vindicates himself from the charge 
of inconsistency. ** When on that fatal breach the 
Secretary of State was dismissed from the service, I 
looked on myself as lost ; it being a general rule in 
such cases, when a great officer falls, that all who 
came in by his interest fall with him. And resolving 
never to abandon the fortunes of the man to whom I 
owed so much of my own, I quitted the usual appli- 
cations which I had made to my lord treasurer. But 
my generous benefactor, when he understood it, frankly 
told me that I should by no means do so ; ' for,' said 
he, in the most engaging terms, * my lord treasurer 
will employ you in nothing but what is for the public 
service, and agreeable to your own sentiments of 
things. And, besides, it is the queen you are serv- 
ing, who has been very good to you. Pray apply 
yourself as you used to do; I shall not take it ill 
from you in the least.' 

'' On this, I went to wait on my lord treasurer, 
who received me with great freedom, and told me, 
smiling, he had not seen me a long while. I told his 
lordship very frankly the occasion; that the un* 
happy breach that had fallen out, had made me doubtr 
ful whether I should be acceptable to his lordship ; 
that I knew it was usual, when great persons fall, 
that all who were in their interest fell with them ; 
that his lordship knew the obligations I was under, 
and that I could not but fear my interest in his lord- 
ship was lessened on that account. ^ Not at all^ Mr« 



OF DB FOE. XXXyH 

'De Foe/ replied his lordship, * I always think a mai{ 
honest, till I find to the contrary/ On this I at- 
tended his lordship as usual; and being resolved to 
ifemove all possible ground of suspicion that I kept 
any secret correspondence, I never visited or wrote 
to, or any way corresponded with my principal bene- 
factor, for above three years ; which he so well knew 
the reason of, and so well approved that punctual 
behaviour in me, that he never took it ill from me 
at all. 

** In consequence of this reception, my Lord GodoU 
phin had the goodness, not only to introduce me for 
the second time to her majesty, and to the honor of 
kissing her hand, but obtained for me the continuance 
of an appointment which her majesty had been pleased 
to make me, in consideration of a former special ser- 
vice I had done, and in which I had run as much risk 
of my life as a grenadier on the counterscarp ; and 
which appointment, however, was first obtained for 
me at the intercession of my said first benefactor, and 
is all owing to that intercession and her majesty's 
bounty. On this second introduction, her majesty 
was pleased to tell me, with a goodness peculiar to 
herself, that she had much satisfaction in my former 
services, that she had appointed me for another office^ 
which was something nice, and that my lord trea- 
surer should tell me the rest; and so I withdrew, 
llie next day his lordship ordered me to attend, told 
me that he must send me to Scotland, and gave me 
but three days to prepare myself. Accordingly, I 
went to Scotland, where neither my business, nor the 



ZXXTIll BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

teanner of my discharging it, b material to this tracft^ 
nor will it be eyer any part of my character, that I 
reveal what should be concealed. And yet, my 
errand was such as was far from being vnfit for a 
sovereign to dhrect, or an honest man to perform ^ 
and for the service I did on that occasion, as it is 
not unknown to the greatest man now in die natioA, 
under the king and the prince, so, I dare say, hb 
grace was never displeased with the part I had in if, 
and I hope will not forget it." 

On the fifth of November, 1709, the celebrated Dr. 
fiacheverel preached his famous sermon at St. PattPs, 
before the city magistrates, on the perils among false 
brethren ; in which he so out-Heroded Herod in llie 
promulgation of a passive obedience and non-resistanoe 
and the divine right of kings, that the throne and the 
high-church ought alike to have blushed at their adTO- 
cate, i/dio seemed destined eventually to teach them tbait 
an injudicious friend is the most injurious of enemies. 
At the moment, however, his discourse had the effect 
of setting the kingdom once mote in a blaze : tumult 
filled the streets, and violence threatened even private 
dwellings. Forty thousand copies of the Doctor's ser- 
mon were dispersed in a few weeks, whilst the author 
was burnt in effigy by the whigs, and the tories re- 
turned the compliment by ducking and whipping the 
dissenting ministers under the same form. De Foe now 
appealed to the public, and asked if he had exagge- 
rated, in his Shortest Way with the Dissenters, the 
views and feelings of the high-church pcurty, who now, 
through their trumpet, or tool, the Doctor, advocated in 



OB BB FOE. XZziX 

earnest^ as openly as they durst, the Tery measures they 
iiad so wannly resented his imputing to them in jest. * 
It was soon, however, the Doctor's turn to stand 
at the bar where De Foe had stood before him, being 
impeached by the House of Commons, and put on his 
trial to answer for the seditious and inflammatory na- 
ture of his discourse. But Sacheverel had the good foi^ 
tune to find a jury more lenient, though equally pusilla«> 
tiimous ; and merely b^ng prohibited from preaching 
for the term of three years, he was set at liberty to go 
on a sort of fanatical crusade throughout the kingdom, 
spreading dissension and ill-will wherever he went. 
De Foe was not silent at this important juncture ; he 
devoted the chief part of his Review to the exposure 
of SacheverePs doctrines, and to calling on the 
whigs and dissenters to stand up manfully for them* 
selves at such an alarming crisis. Nevertheless, in all 
his discussions he showed a degree of moderation and 
candour the more to be admired, because he himself 
was treated with so much virulence by the <^ Papists, 
Jacobites, and High-fiyers," as he terms them, as 
even to have his life threatened by some of the most 
infuriated among them. The effect of Dr. Sacheve*- 
rel's ultra-toryism was a complete change in the mi- 
nistry, by which Harley was once more restored to 
the most important offices in the state ; and knowing 
as he did the value of De Foe's services, he soon 
availed himself of them again in sending him on vari- 
ous secret commissions to Scotland and other places, 
which took him much out of the way of the tumults 
and dissensions of the metropolis : the intervening time 



Xl BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

hie spent in comparative retiremeht a^ Stoke Newing* 
ton, where he had a house for some years. Here he 
seemed to be gradually weaning himself from politics^ 
and directing his mental powers to better things than 
those ephemeral objects which ambition or avarice are 
continually suggesting to the evil nature of man ; but 
whilst the events connected with them pass away like 
vapours, and are no more remembered, the effects on 
the actors in them may remain, and become almost 
imperishable. 

The times were as yet, however, far too unsettled to 
allow of a mind like De Foe's having any long rest; the 
peace of Utrecht among other great political events, or 
rather the conditions of it, drew forth his censures ; and 
with his accustomed ill-fortune he found that, as he 
had before displeased the body of the people by advo- 
cating a peace at all, so he now offended the ministers 
by finding fault with the terms on which it was con- 
cluded : treated as an apostate by his own party, and 
regarded with an eye of suspicion by those whose in-* 
terests he was accused of secretly advocating, he withn 
drew for a time from the field of action, and retired to 
H alifax in Yorkshire, where, according to tradition^ 
he lodged at the sign of the Rose and Crown, in the 
back lane, and divided his social hours chiefly ber 
tween Dr. Nettleton, author of several professional 
publications, and an essay entitled '* Some Thoughts 
concerning Virtue and Happiness," and Mr. Na- 
thaniel Priestley, a dissenting minister, ancestor of 
the celebrated Dr. Priestley. Neither philosophy, 
however, nor divinity were sufficient to interest De 



OF DE FOB. xli 

FoCy unless he could link them with his darling poli- 
tics ; and in this his comparative retirement he was 
tempted again to have recourse to his favorite weapon, 
ironical satire, of which it certainly, as wielded by 
him, could not be said, 

" That two-handed weapon at the door 

Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more/' 

It was, indeed, two-edged, as well as two-handed, 
and speedily brought De Foe into the same situation 
it had done before ; namely, at the bar of. the Queen's 
Bench, there to explain the difference between jest 
and earnest, for the benefit of all such solemn state 
blockheads and shallow coffee-house politicians as 
could not see any difference between one and the 
other. The explanation cannot be better given than 
in the words of the presunble to the pardon which her 
miyesty Queen Anne, with that good sense which 
always distinguished her proceedings when they were 
suff^ed to emanate from her own judgment and bene- 
volence, was graciously pleased to grant him. — 
''Whereas, in the term of the Holy Trinity last past 
our Attorney-general did exhibit an information in 
our Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster, against 
Daniel De Foe, late of London, gent., for writing, 
printing, and publishing, and causing to be written, 
printed and published, three libels; the one entitled 
* Reasons against the Succession of the House of 
Hanover; with an enquiry how far the Abdication 
of King James, supposing it to be legal, ought to af- 
fect the person of the Pretender.' One other, entitled^

* And what if the Pretender should come ? dr^ 
Some considerations of the advantages and real cod« 
^equences of the Pretender's possessing the Crown d 
€creat Britain.' And one other, entitled* * An An- 
swer to a question that nobody thinks of, viz. Whal 
if the Queen should die ?' 

** And whereas the same Daniel De ^oe hath by hia 
humble petition represented to us that he, with a sin- 
cfere design to propagate the interest of the Hanovei 
succession, and to animate the people against the de- 
signs of the Pretender, whom he always looked on as an 
enemy to our sacred person and government, did publisi 
the same pamphlets; in all which books, although, thi 
titles seemed to look as if written in favor of the Pre* 
tender, and several expressions, as in all ironical 
writings it must be, may be wrested against the troc 
design of the whole, and turned to a meaning quitfi 
different from the intention of the author ; yet the pe« 
titioner humbly assures us, in the solemnest manner, 
that his true and only design, in all the said books, 
was, by an ironical discourse of recommending the 
Pretender, in the strongest and most forcible manner 
to expose his designs, and the ruinous consequences 4^ 
his succeeding therein, which, as the petitioner humbly 
represents, will appear to our satisfaction by the 
books themselves, where the following expressions ar^ 
very plain, viz. — ' That the Pretender is recommended 
as a person proper to amass the English liberties into 
one sovereignty ; supplying them with the privilege oi 
wearing wooden shoes ; easing them of the trouble oi 
choosing parliaments ; and the nobility and gentry oi

the hazard and expense of winter journeys, by go- 
verning them in that more righteous method, of his 
absolute will, and enforcing the laws by a glorious 
standing army ; paying all the nation's debts at once, 
by stopping the funds, and shutting up the exchequer ; 
easing and quieting their differences in religion, by 
bringing them to the union of Popery, or leaving 
them at liberty to have no religion at all.' That these 
were some of the very expressions in which the said 
bodcs^ which the petitioner sincerely designed to ex- 
pose, and oppose, as far as in him lies, the interest of 
the Pretender, and with no other intention ; i\everthe- 
less the petitioner, to his great surprise, has been misre- 
presented, and his said books misconstrued, as if writ- 
ten in favor of the Pretender ; and the petitioner is now 
under prosecution for the same ; which prosecution, 
if forliier carried on, will be the utter ruin of the peti* 
tioner and his family. Wherefore the petitioner, hum- 
bly assuring us of the innocence of his designs, as 
aforesaid, flies to our clemency, and most humbly 
prays our most gracious and free pardon. 

*• We, taking the premises and the circumstances of 
the petitioner into our royal consideration, are graci- 
ously pleased to extend our royal mercy to the peti- 
tioner. Our will and pleasure therefore is, that you 
prepare a IhII for our royal signature, to pass our great 
seal, leotttaining our gracious and free pardon to him, 
the same Daniel De Foe, of the offences aforemen- 
tioned, and of all indictments, convictions, pains, pe<- 
nalties, and forfeitnres, incurred thereby ; and you are 
to insert therein all such apt and beneficial clauses m

you shall judge requisite, to make this our intended 
pardon more full, valid, and effectual ; and for so do« 
ing this shiill be your warrant. Given at our Castle

Thus harmlessly evaporated the effects of produc- 
tions which Sir Thomas Powis, who had been made a 
judge a short time before, had gravely asserted, con- 
tained matter for which the author « might be hanged^ 
drawn, and quartered." It cannot be denied, how- 
ever, that the frequent recurrence to this mode of 
writing was not very creditable either to the judgment 
or good feeling of De Foe, who must have seen that it 
answered no other end than that of mystifying all par- 
ties alike, and laying him equally open to the most 
opposite charges. The whigs hated him for his ima- 
gined attachment to the tories ; the tories hated him 
for his real attachment to the whigs : the Jacobites 
hated him for advocating the Hanoverian succession ; 
and the Hanoverians hated him for adhering to his 
early friend, Harley, Earl of Oxford, who was known 
to be in the Jacobite interest. Thus, as he acknow- 
ledges himself, he lived *' under universal contempt," 
though we must, in fairness, continue in his own 
words, ** which contempt I have learned to contemn, 
and have one uninterrupted joy in my soul, not at my 
being contemned, but that no crime can be laid to my 
charge, to make this contempt my due." Certain it is, 
however, that his political vacillation, or tergiversation, 



OF DE FOE. xIy 

to his enemies more decidedly tenned it, caused 
him to be considered towards the latter part of his 
career as a mere hireling, ** an ambi-dexterous, merce- 
nary scribbler," as Boyer the historian expresses . it, 
who prostituted his skill in ** puzzling an argument by 
▼erbose sophistry;" and it is evident that the facility 
with which he could copy to the very life the tone of 
thought and peculiarity of expressing it in any party, 
whose arguments he wished for the moment to assume, 
made others equally doubtful of his sincerity when be 
uttered his own. The nicety of his imitation so closely 
approached to intentional deception, that at length it 
gained him the usual reward of habitual fabehood, not 
to be. believed when he should speak the truth. That 
he keenly felt, however, the doubtful situation in 
which his own vivacity of feeling, and to speak ac- 
cording to its effects, unfortunate fluency, as it might 
be styled, of expressing it, had placed him, b evident 
from his vindication of himself in his '< Appeal to Ho- 
nor and Justice," wherein he says, ** I know too much 
of the world to expect good in it^ and have learnt to 
value it too little to be concerned at the evil. I have 
gone through a life of wonders, and am the subject of a 
vast variety of providences. I have been fed more by 
miracle than Elijah, when the ravens were his pur-, 
veyors. I have some time ago summed up the scenes 
of my life in this distich : — 

" No man has tasted differing fortunes more, 
And thirteen times I have been rich and poor." 

** In the school of affliction I have learnt more philo- 



xlvi BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

sophy than at the academy, and more diyinity than 
from the pulpit ; in prison 1 have learnt to know that 
liberty does not consist in open doors, and the fi«e 
eg;res8 and regress of locomotion. I have seen the 
rough side of the world as well as the smooth; and 
have, in less than half a year, tasted the difference 
between the closet of a king and the dungeon of New- 
gate. I have suffered deeply for cleaving to princi- 
ples, of which integrity I have lived to say, none but 
those I suffered for ever reproached me with it. Ttm 
immediate causes of my suffering have been the being 
betrayed by those I have trusted, and scorning to b^-r 
tray those who trusted me. I'o the honor of English 
gratitude, I have this remarkable truth to leave be- 
hind me : that I was never so basely betrayed as by 
those whose families I had preserved from starving ; 
nor so basely treated as by those I starved my own 
£Eunily to preserve. The same chequer-work of for- 
tune attends me still : the people I have served, and 
love to serve, cut my throat every day, because I will 
not cut the throat of those that have served and as- 
sisted me. Ingratitude has always been my aversion, 
and, perhaps, for that reason it is my exercise. • • • • 
Early disasters, and frequent turn of my affairs> have 
left me incumbered with an insupportable weight of 
debt; and the remarkable compassion of some creditors* 
after continued offers of stripping myself nakedj by 
entire surrenders upon oath, have never given me more 
trouble than they were able, or less than they knew 
how ; by which means most of the debts I have dis- 
charged, have cost me forty shillings in tlie pound,

wni the creditor half as much to recover. I have a 
large family, a wife and six children, who never want 
what they should enjoy, or spend what they ought to 
apare. Under all these circumstances, and many 
others too long to write, my only happiness is this : 
I have always been kept cheerful, %asy, and quiet, 
enjoying a perfect calm of the mind, clearness of 
thought, and satisfaction not to be broken in upon by 
whatever may happen to me. If any man ask me 
how I arrived to it, I answer him, in short, by a con- 
stant serious application to the great, solemn, and 
weighty work of resignation to the will of heaven, by 
which let no man think I presume.'' 

This manly and spirited performance must have had 
a nM>re powerful effect on the minds of his contempo- 
raries, in the vindication of its author's character, had 
he not given so many proofs of being able to write 
with equal elegance and force on subjects which had 
no real foundation of conviction in his mind. In the 
present instance, however, his physical powers bore 
testimony to his mental sincerity, by sympathising in 
the agitation it produced : an apoplectic stroke was the 
eonsequence, and for six months he languished in an 
almost hopeless state ; from which, however, he was 
gradually restored, and might every way be said to 
mkteiF a new state of life ; for his political existence 
seems to have terminated on the commencement of 
the reign of George the First, and his literary charac- 
ter gradually assumed a new feature, as his body 
lecovered its strength, and his mind its serenity. The 
first fruits of De Foe's, recovered health and altered

views were, ** The Family Instructor," in three ptaAs ; 
addressed, first, to fathers and children ; second, mas- 
ters and servants; third, husbands and wives. The' 
laudable object of this work was to impress on the 
heads of families the solemn duty incumbent on them/ 
of instructing their children and dependents in the 
principles of religion and virtue ; and on the lattet, 
the duty of listening to those instructions with an 
obedient spirit and a teachable disposition. These 
instructions being thrown into the form of familiar 
dialogue, at that time the most popular mode of con- 
veying admonition, and enlivened by apt storied, re- 
lated in that persuasive tone of reality in which the'' 
author on all occasions showed himself so eminently 
happy, it speedily became a favorite both with young 
and old, and has passed through an almost countless 
number of editions : it was indeed equally adapted to 
delight and instruct all sects and conditions, bein^ 
written in that true spirit of Christianity, which says 
not, " I am of Paul," or " of Cephas." It might lite- 
rally be said to be equally adapted to the cottage and 
the crown ; and George the First, though he professed 
no esteem for the author, yet honored the work* by- 
including it in the list of books he wished to be- used 
in the education of his own family, and the original 
copy thus selected may be seen among the Ktermy 
curiosities of the British Museum. 

Four years after the ** Family Instructor," appeared 
from the same prolific pen the romance, which has 
immortalised its author, of Kobinson Crusoe, or as it 
most attractively stood forth in the original title-page,

studied eulogium on a work which continues to blazon 
its own fame in successive editions to generation after 
generation of readers, would, in this place at least, 
be worse than useless; it would be impertinent and 
injurious to analyze the foundation of that fame ; and 
lab<Hiously to point out all those beauties on which 
it rests, would only be to rob the reader of the plea- 
sure of discovering them himself, and to convert the 
delightful sympathies of his imagination into a cold 
asMnt of judgment. 

Blaire and Beattie, Charles Lamb and Sir Walter

lighted with this captivating performance ; but of all 
the thousand eulogiums uttered on it, Johnson's, Mar- 
montel's, and Kousseau*s, are the shortest and the best, 
and render all others indeed superfluous. 

When De Foe first offered Robinson Crusoe to the 
Vooksellers, he could with difficulty find a purchaser for

them as a body/ which Milton had done before him 
with respect to his Paradise Lost; and as many of 
pur best authors have done after him with respect to 
works which have afterwards made the fortunes of the 
very men by whom they were rejected in the first 
instance. So it was with Robimftun Crusoe. Taylor, 
the fortunate purchaser, who probably calculated with 
some distrust as to a few pounds more or less when 
treating for the copyright, made a thousand pounds 
by his bargain : the work acted on the public like a 
charm ; it made its way through all ranks, it won all 
hearts ; and in four months it passed through as many 
editions. Nevertheless De Foe's pleasure at the suc- 
cess of his work was far from coming to him unmixed 
with mortification ; and every argument that malice 
could suggest was resorted to, to deteriorate from the 
merits of the work, and obstruct the lawful profits of 
the sale. When it was laid before the public as a 
narrative of real occurrences, the local and chronologi* 
cal circumstances were inquired into and compared, 
geographical errors eagerly sought out ; the probability 
and even possibility of many of the events argued on, 
and the whole scouted as a fiction and a romance ; it 
being alleged that there never was any such man, 
or place, or circumstance in any man's life ; that it 
was formed and embellished by invention, to impose 
on the world ; but no sooner was it acknowledged to 
be a fiction, written to please and instruct, than this 
again was denied, and the author accused of retailing 
facts of which, he had unf9.irly possessed himself; in 
short, of stealing them from the papers of one Alex* 



OF ©E FOB, ' ' li 

apder Selkirk, who had placed them in hk hands for 
the purpose of preparing them for the press; thus 
gaining a reputation to which he had no claim, and 
robbing . another at once of the pleasure of standing 
forth the hero of his own story, and also of the profits 
that might have accrued to him therefrom. Then again, 
.wh^n tbeqe charges fell harmless to the ground, dis* 
proved by time and their own absurdity, others were 
iavonted to prove that he had had nothing at all to 
do with the work, fairly or unfairly, excepting to 
father it, and that the real autiior was Arbuthnot, or 
Lord Oxford, or somebody nobody knew who. So 
ingenious are envy and malice to suggest arguments 
which not even credulity itself would accept as te<- 
nable from less perverted sources. 

There can be little doubt that De Foe was indebted 
for the first idea of his work to the Narrative of Alex- 
ander Selkirk, who, in consequence of a quarrel with 
hifl commander, had been set on shore at his own request 
on the uninhabited island of Juan Fernandez, where 
he lived four years and four months in complete soli- 
tude. His account of his mode of passing his time, 
and the methods he had recourse to for procuring his 
subsistenee, speedily found their way to the press 
through various channels, and among the rest through 
that delightful writer Steele, whose pen gave attrac- 
tions to every subject it touched on. He published 
ai| interesting account of Selkirk in the 26th number 
of; his periodical paper csdled the Englishman. It 
was impossible for so singular and interesting a state- 
ment not to make a forcible impression on an observer 



lii BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

like De Foe, of ** each change of many coloured life ;" 
and turning it over in the alembic of his fruitful mind, 
he brought out sterling metal, for the rough ore of which 
he might indeed be indebted to Selkirk, but which be 
shaped into current coin by the force of his own 
genius. With the image of Selkirk before him, and 
with that peculiar tact in imitating character which so 
remarkably distinguished him, he wrote as Selkirk 
would in all probability have written, as far as we 
may judge by his viva voce narration delivered to Sir 
Richard Steele, had he bcf^n a writing man, which 
however it does not appear that he was ; at any rate 
not during his solitary sojourn at Juan Fernandez ; 
for even if we agree with Dogberry, *' that reading 
and writing come by nature,'^ yet as he had neither 
pen, ink, nor paper, all tne time he remained there, 
De Foe may safely be acquitted from the charge of 
stealing what was not to be stolen ; any more than 
Tllburina could see the Spanish fleet when it was not 
in sight. It is to be lamented, however, that this 
opinion has gained such ground as to cause a preju- 
dice against De Foe even in those who have most 
admired his work ; and it is melancholy to think bow 
many have heard of this groundless impeachment on 
his honor, honesty, and humanity, who yet never 
heard of the proofs of all those ennobling qualities 
which he had given in his conduct towards his cre- 
ditors, and in many of the relations of his private life ; 
so true it is that men's evil deeds, real or imputed, we 

'* graye on brass, 

Their virtues write on water." 



OF DE FOE. liii 

In every point of view this far-famed romance may be 
considered as the chef d^ceuvre of its author ; embody- 
ing all the most valuable characteristics of his mind, 
setting his principles in the most honorable light, and 
consequently inspiring that respect and sympathy 
towards himself which can never be excited by the 
ebullitions of pdrty spirit, or the tediousness of po- 
lemical controversy. To his early reverence for reli- 
^on; sanctified to him by tnany sorrows for its sake, 
we are indebted for the fine delineations of the work- 
ings of grace in the heart, and the devout reflections 
which he puts into the mouth of his hero ; from his ex- 
perience of the world we derive his correct exhibition 
of the various aspects of fortune; and to that aptness 
in identifying himself with the character he assumed, 
which be had so often indulged in to his cost, we owe 
the exquisite naturalness of sentiment and feeling 
wliich links us so closely with the solitary monarch of 
4itt he swvei/Sf and makes us every instant acknow- 
fedge the truth of Terence's observation, 

'* Homo sum : humani nihil a me alienum puto." 

The success of Robinson Crusoe encouraged De Foe 
to continue that kind of dramatic fiction, as it may be 
fenned, in which the characters develope themselves 
through the vehicle of familiar dialogue ; whilst the 
descriptive and reflective parts of it come in as the 
back-ground and accessories of the scene, giving that 
exquisite air of naturalness which comes so home to 
the heart of the reader, and in which De Foe stood 
unrivalled. Next to ** Robinson Crusoe/' the ** Me- 



fiV BIOGRAPHICAL STRETCH 

moiTS. of a Oayalier'' may be reckoned the mdA 
pleasing of any of De Foe's fictitious narratiTes. It 
is indeed, as has been observed by Mr. Chalm#nr> 
*< a romance the likeliest to tnith that ever was 
written;" insomach that it deceived Lord Chatham 
into the belief of considering it an authentic history i 
and as such he used to recommend it as the bent 
account extant of the civil wars. Though all De Foe's 
performances are entitled to the praise of natural' de*- 
lineation, yet on that account some of them, from the 
very nature of their subjects, are more repulsive. 
Such are his '' Fortuiies and Misfortunes of Moll 
Flanders," and his *' Fortunate Mistress, or life of 
.Roxana." 

The *' life and Piracies of Captain Singleton,^ and 
" Robert's Voyages," can only be considered a& info*- 
rior imitations of Robinson Crusoe ; whilst his Dick- 
ory Crooke, Duncan Campbell, and various per«- 
formances of a similar order, may all be considered as 
tales gone by, and not likely to awaken any interest 
in the revival. Not so with his ** History of the 
Plague," one of the finest combinations of real parts, 
with imaginary feelings and incidents, that ever Was 
•penned ; on a subject too not to be glanced on witli*- 
out interest, and not to be contemplated without horror. 
To enter into extracts from this work would be to be- 
gin at the close of our brief memoirs — a theme which 
might extend it to a volume. Sir Walter Scott baa 
.pronounced that '' had he not been the author of 
' Robinson Crusoe,' De Foe would have deserved im- 
mortality for the genius which he \i9s displayed iotbis

work." It is well known to have furnished the ma- 
chinery for a poem of great merit published at Edin* 
burgh in 1816,and entitled, " The City of the Plague," 
by John Wilson, now Professor of moral philosophy 
in the University of Glasgow, and author of many 
other esteemed works. The praise of a writer of 
such kindred genius, in affixing the stamp of nature 
and truth to every thing that flows from his pen, 
is^uloghim sufficient on the merits of the. work, witl^- 
out having recourse to the testimonies which others 
have borne to it, more especially by borrowing from 
its pages wherewith to give interest to their own. 
Next to De Foe's ** Family Instructor," may be 
placed, in respect both to merit and popularity, his 
^' Religious Worship," published four years after, 
in which the important truth, that the holiness and 
stabHity of conjugal love must have religion to rest 
on for its basis, is enforced in domestic narrative, and 
enlivened by a variety of interesting dialogues con- 
oected with the subject. 

Though De Foe was now advancing in years, and 
declining in health, his habits of observation rendered 
it almost necessary to him to continue taking a part in 
all the occurrences of the day : hence we find him in 
the very evening of his life still discussing, still pro- 
j^ting, and, we niay always add, still instructing.

Great Britaio ; sag^gestions for extending its tra^^ 
commerce; and manufactures;— these \>f ere the oceia<«. 
pations of the fire-side, which he daily grew less un^ 
able and more unwilling to leave : and if his latei; 
productions show by comparison somewhat, of thet 
feebleness of his declining state, it is only by com-, 
parison ; and hb apology for it must have mora: 
than redeemed the difference in the mind of sock 
readers as had been delighted with the vigor of hit 
earlier productions. 

: De Foe's old-age, had few of these consolations, 
and was moreover tried with afflictions to which 
the vicissitudes and vexations of his youth were bat 
as things of a moment, the light sprinkling of . an 
April shower compared to the arrowy sleet of De- 
cember's storms. He had to acknowledge from his 
own sad experience, 

" How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is 
"To have a thankless child." 

His daughters appear to have been dutiful and af- 
fectionate to him, and we have his own testimony that 
Sophia, his youngest, who married Mr. Baker, a 
gentleman of considerable scientific attainments, vnm 
particularly endeared to him by her amiable quali^ 
ties. But his son was, as far as we may judge from 
his father's melancholy mention of him, the afflict*, 
ing reverse of every thing which filial duty or even 
common honesty called upon him to He. It seeiaa 
that De Foe, continually subject to the persecution 
of some relentless creditor, had, in order to make a 
provision for his wife and his two unmarried dangh*- 



OF DB FOB. Ivii 

tei3» ^conveyed his property to his soiiy with an under* 
standing, fully acknowledged by the latter, that it 
was to be for their benefit ; but with a degree of tur- 
pitude more calculated to send his father sorrowing 
to .the grave, than any mere bereaYement of property 
under other circumstances could have been, he appror 
printed it to his own use, and refused even a pittance of 
it to the relief of those who had given him birth. 
How keenly this abominable conduct was felt by 
De Foe, may be seen in the following moving epistla 
from him to his son-in-law Mr. Baker, written shortly 
after he had been arrested at the suit of some unmer- 
ciful creditor, and exposed again to the horrors of a 
jail, a mortification, which, though it lasted only a 
short time, was yet long enough to cover with dis- 
grace the son who might have prevented it, and yet 
withheld the means. 

" Dear Mr. Baker, 

** I have yo' very kind and affecc'onate letter 
of die 1st, but not come to my hand till y* 10th; 
where it had been delay'd I kno' not. As your 
kind manner and kinder thought, from w^ it flows« 
(for I take all you say to be as I always believed yon 
to be, sincere and Nathaniel like, without guile) was a 
particular satisfacc'on to me ; so the stop of a letter, 
however it happened, deprived me of that cordial too 
Hiany days, considering how much I stood in need of 
it, to support a mind sinking under the weight of an 
affliec'oh too heavy for my strength, and looking on 
raytelf as abandoned of every comfort, every friend.

and every relative, except such only as are able to 
give me no assistance. 

** I was sorry you should say at y* beginning of 
your letter, you were debarred seeing me. Depend 
upon my sincerity for this, I am far from debarring you* 
On y* contraxy, it would be a greater comfort to me 
than any I now enjoy, that I could have yo^ agree- 
able visits w^ safety, and could see both you and 
iny dearest Sophia, could it be without giving her the 
^ief of seeing her father in tenebris, and under y^ 
load of unsupportable sorrow. I am sorry I must open 
my griefs so far as to tell her, it is not y* blow I rec* 
from a wicked, perjured, and contemptible enemy that 
has broken in upon my spirit, w^, as she well knows, 
has carried me on thro' greater disasters than these. 
But it has been the injustice, unkindness, and, I must 
say, inhuman feeling of my own son, w^^ has both 
ruined my family, and, in a word, has broken my 
heart; and as T am at this time under a weight of 
very heavy illness, w*^** I think will be fever, I. take 
this occasion to vent my grief in y^ breasts, who I 
know will make a prudent use of it, and tell you that 
nothing but this has conquered or could conquer me. 
£t tu. Brute ! I depended upon him, I trusted him, 
I gave up my two dear unprovided children into hi^ 
hands ; but he has no compassion, and suffers them 
and their poor dying mother to beg their bread at his 
bands ; and to crave, as if it were an alms, what he is 
bound under hand and seal, besides the most saored 
promises, tp supply them with, himself at y® same 
tim^ .living in $t profusion of plenty. It is too mucb 



OF DB 70E. liX 

for me. Excuse my infirmity, I can say no more; 
my heart is too full. I only ask one thing of you 
as a dying request. Stand hy them when I am gone, 
and let them not he wrong'd while he is ahle to do 
them right. Stand hy them as a brother, and if yoa 
haYe any thing within you owing to my memory, who 
hare bestowed on you the best gift I had to give, let 
J^ n6t be injured and trampled on by false pretences 
and iranatural -reflections. I hope they will want no 
help' but that of comfort and council, but that they 
will indeed want, being too easie to be manag'd by 
Words and promises. 

"It adds to my grief that it is so difficult to me to 
see you. I am at a distance from Lond**, in Kent t 
not hare I a lodging in London ; nor have I been at 
that place in the Old Bailey since I wrote you I was 
removed from it. At present I am weak, having had 
some fits of a fever that have left me low. But those 
things much more. 

' '^ I have not seen son or daughter, wife or child many 
weeks, and kno' not which way to see them. Th^y 
dare not come by water, and by land here is no coach, 
and I kno' not what to do. 

" It is not possible for me to come to Enfield, unless 
you could find a retired lodging for me, where I 
might not be known, and might have the comfort of 
seeing you both now and then ; upon such a circum- 
stance I could gladly give the days to solitude, to 
have the comfort of half an hour now and then with 
yoif both, for two or three weeks. But just to cdme 
imd lCK>k at you and retire immediately, 'tis a burden

too heavy. The parting will be a price beyond the 
enjoyment. 

, ''I would say, (I hope) with comfort, that His yet 
well. I am so near my journey's end, and am hasten- 
ing to the place where y* weary are at rest, and 
where the wicked cease to trouble ; be it that the 
passage is rough and the day stormy, by what way 
soever He please to bring me to the end of it, I desire 
to finish life with this temper of soul in all cases: 
Tc Deum laudamus. I congratulate you on the oc- 
casion of yo' happy advance in yo'' employment. May 
all you do be prosperous, and all you meet with plea- 
sant, and may you both escape the tortures and trou- 
bles of uneasie life. May you sail y* dangerous 
voyage of life with a forcing wind, and make the 
port of heaven without a storm. 

** It adds to my grief that I must never see the 
pledge of your mutual love, my little grandson. Give 
him my blessing, and may he be to you both your joy in 
youth, and your comfort in i^e, and never add a sigh 
to your sorrow. But, alas! that is not to be ex- 
pected. Kiss my dear Sophy once more for me ; and 
if I must see her no more, tell her this is from a father 
that loved her above all his comforts to his last 
breath.

About two miles from Greenwich, Kent,

Idem, 

" D. F.*' 

When the- drama of life begins to exhibit scenes 
like these, it is time to drop the curtain. De Foe 'was 
gently removed, in seeming lethargic calmness, from 
this transient state into eternal life, on the 24th of 
April, 1731. He died in the parish where he was 
bom, like the poor hunted hare, who terminates all its 
anxious breathless windings at the spot where it was 
first compelled to start, from by its tormentors. 

It now only remains to take a general view of the 
character, moral and literary, of this extraordinary 
man, whose fate it seemed to be, like that of Cassan- 
dra, to foresee and to foretel, without the power of 
inspiring belief in the truth of the prediction, or the 
sincerity of the predictor. That his political writings 
attracted considerable attention in the beginning of 
his career, is evident from the unjustifiable means 
that were resorted to in order to suppress them, 
and to crush their author ; but as we have already 
remarked, the success with which he could assume 
either side of an argument, seems gradually to have lost 
him the confidence of all parties ; for each in turn felt 
more certain of his power to injure, than of his since- 
rity in serving. It must be observed, however, that 
there is no proof of Daniel De Foe ever having actu- 
ally swerved from the principles he professed; and 
thtt strong testimony in favor of his integrity, from 



Ixii BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

Durston, his personal enemy and a rival journalist,; 
ought to weigh against a host of anonymous calum- 
nies. 

De Foe did not meet with much more liberality as a 
projector than a politician ; it is indeed the general fate 
of speculatists to be looked on with envy, ridicule, and 
dislike, rather than with the respect due to ingenuity 
and disinterestedness. If the plan suggested fail, those 
who never would have had skill or science sufficient to 
suggest it, yet feel a sudden accession of both in the tri- 
umphant declaration, that they had always foreseen it 
would never succeed. Should success, on the con- 
trary, crown the undertaking, envy is as busy in 
pointing out reasons why it might have succeeded to a 
still greater extent, or why it ought not to have sue-, 
ceeded at all. 

Many of the suggestions of De Foe, which during 
his life only held him up to ridicule as a visionary, 
have been acted on in the present day to the advan- 
tage of society at large ; and the singularity by which 
he is least known, and in which he has been least 
imitated, is that of paying his debts in full, when he 
was acquitted by his creditors for a part. This reflec- 
tion brings us to the contemplation of the moral part 
of his character : of his honesty commercially consi- 
dered, it would be cruel and unjust to doubt, after the 
testimonies which even his enemies have borne to it : 
hb religious habits were fixed too early in life to for- 
sake him afterwards, and consequently his troubles 
and afllictions could only have the efl^ect of making 
him throw himself with more devout submission on 



OF DE FOB. Ixiii 

the support of that wise Disposer of all things, who 
saw fit to visit him with them : of his domestic cha« 
racteristics not much is known. The habits of the 
Dissenters in his time were sufficiently rigid to make 
them hold theatrical exhibitidns and public entertain* 
ments in dislike, but he does not appear to have been 
of gloomy or censorial habits : that he was a tei^der 
parent as well as dutiful son, is evident from many 
passages in his letters and writings, where he mientions 
his father and his children ; and that he was an affec- 
tionate husband may be inferred not only from the 
same evidence, but also from the high appreciation in 
which he at all times held the female sex ; and as he 
who -acknowledges a claim on love and admiration in 
generals, is not likely to deny it in particulars, we 
may fairly conclude that Daniel De Foe would not 
belie his own taste and judgment, and that, having 
chosen one according to the same standard, he would 
not fail to treat her with the tenderness and respect he 
acknowledges to be her due. 

*' A woman of sense and manners," says he, "is 
the finest and most delicate part of God's creation ; 
the glory of her Maker, and the great instance of his 
singular regard to man, to whom he gave the best gift 
either God could bestow or man receive ; and it is the 
sordidest piece of folly aad ingratitude in the world to 
withhold from the sex the due lustre which the advan- 
tages of education give to the natural beauty of their 
minds. A woman well bred and well taught, fur- 
nished with the additional accomplishments of know- 
ledge and behaviour, is a creature without compari- 



IziT BIOGRAPHICAL 8KBTCH OF DB FOE. 

ton. Her society is the emblem of sablime enjoy- 
ments ; she is all softness and sweetness, love, wit» 
and delight ; she is every way suitable to the sub- 
limest wish ; and the man that has such a one to his 
portion, has nothing to do but to rejoice in her, and to 
be tliankful." 

That De Foe possessed natural benevolence of 
heart, and amiability of temper, may be proved 
from his writings, as well as from the acknowledge- 
ments of some at least of those whom he had served : 
in his fictions an author generally delineates the cha- 
racteristic features of his own mind ; and to judge his 
by this rule, it affords a picture of many virtues. Xo 
writer, since the days of Shakspeare, with the excep- 
tion of Richardson, has shown so much knowledge of 
the human heart, or delineated it with such exqubite 
exactness of detail and truth of colouring ; and if 
some of his works are less known than others, it 
is not because they are less true to nature, but that 
they -represent those objects in nature, which are 
less pleasing to contemplate : he was always,, how- 
ever, equally intent on instructing, and in his 
hands the very incidents of vice are so managed as to 
produce lessons of virtue. Of him it may be said as 
Johnson said of Goldsmith, that he left no species of 
writing unattempted ; and we may add that all the 
separate excellencies of his character, attainments of 
his mind, and his felicity in expressing them, may be 
contemplated with benefit and delight little less than 
is afforded by his *^ Kobinson Crusoe." 



THE 



LIFE AND ADVENTURES 



OF 



EOBINSON CRUSOE. 



I WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, 
of a good family, though not of that country, my 
Ceillier being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first 
at Hull : he gained a good estate by merchandise, 
and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York ; 
from whence he had married my mother, whose re- 
Itttioiui were named Robinson, a very good family in 
that country, and from whom I was called Robinson 
Kreutznaer ; but, by the usual corruption of words in 
England, we are now called, nay we call ourselves, 
Una write our name, Crusoe ; so my companions 
always called me. 

' I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieute- 
nant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flan- 
ders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel 
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk 
against the Spaniards. What became of my second 
brother I never knew, any more than my rather or 
mother did know what was become of me, 

▼OL. I, A 



2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to 
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with 
rambling thoughts : my father, who was very ancient, 
had given me a competent share of learning, as far 
as house-education and a country free-school gene- 
rally go, and designed me for the law ; but I would 
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my 
inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, 
nay the commands of my father, and against all the 
entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other 
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in 
that propension of natur^, tending directly to the life 
of misery which was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious 
and excellent counsel against what he ioresa.w was my 
design. He called me one morning into his chamber, 
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated 
very warmly with me on this subject : he asked me 
what reasons more than a mere wandering inclination 
I had for leaving my father's house and my native 
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a 
rospect of raising my fortune by application and in- 
ustry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me 
it was for men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or 
of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went 
abroad on adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make 
themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of 
the common road; that these things were all either 
too far above me, or too far below me ; that mine 
was the middle state, or what might be called thie 
upper station of low life, which he had found, by 
long experience, was the best state in the world, the 
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the 
miseries and hardships, the labor and sufferings of the 
mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with 
the pridC; luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper 
part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of the 
happiness of this state by one thing, vfz. that this was 



S 



OF ROBINSON CRVSOE; 3 

the state of life which all other people envied ; that 
kings have frequently lamented the miserable conse- 
quences of being bom to great things, and wish they 
had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, 
between the mean and the great ; that the Mase man 
gave his testimony to this, as the j ust standard of true 
felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor 
riches. 

He bid me observe, and I should always find, that 
the calamities of life were shared among the upper 
and lower part of mankind ; but that the middle sta« 
tion had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to 
so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of 
mankind ; nay, they were not subjected to so many 
distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, 
as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and 
extravagances, on one hand, or by hard labor, want 
of necessaries, and mean and insufficient diet, on the 
other hand, bring distempers on themselves by the 
natural consequences of their way of living ; that the 
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of 
virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and 
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that 
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all 
agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were 
the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that 
this way men went silently and smoothly through the 
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed 
with the labors of the hands or of the head, not sold 
to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with* 
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, 
and the body of rest ; not enraged with the passion of 
envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for great 
things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently 
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of' 
living, without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, 
and learning by every day's experience to know if 
mere sensibly^ 



4 LIFE AND ADVEKTITRES 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most 
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, not 
to precipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and 
the station of life in which I was horn, seemed to 
have provided against ; that I was under no necessity 
of seeking my hread ; that he would do welF for me^ 
and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of 
life which he had been just recommending to me; and 
that if I was not very easy and happy in the worlds it 
must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; 
and that he should have nothing to answer for, having 
thus discharged his duty in warning me against mea* 
sures which he knew would be to my hurt : in a word, 
that as he would do very kind things for me if 1 would 
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would 
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give 
me any encouragement to go away : and to close all, 
he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to 
whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to 
keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but 
could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to 
run into the army, where he was killed ; and though 
he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would 
venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish 
step, God would not bless me, and I would have 
leisure hereafter to reflect on having neglected his 
counsel, when there might be none to assist in my 
recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which 
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did 
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the 
tears run down his face very plentifully, and espe^ 
cially when he spoke of my brother who vras killed : 
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to ve-^ 
pent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that 
he broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart 
was so full he could say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, ai^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 

iAfleed who could be otherwise ? and I resolved not 
^to tkink of going abroad any more, but to settle at 
home according to my father's desire. But, alas ! 
a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent 
any of my father's further importunities, in a few 
weeks after I resolved to run away from him. How- 
erer, I did not act so hastily as my £rst heat of reso- 
lution prompted, but I took my mother, at a time 
when r thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary^ 
and told her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent 
on seeing the world, that I should never settle to any 
thing with resolution enough to go through with it, 
and my father had better give me his consent than 
•force me to go without it ; that I was now eighteen 
years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a 
trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I 
4lid, I should never serve out my time, and I should 
certainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea ; and if she would speak to my 
father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came 
home again, and did pot like it, I would go no more, 
and I would promise, by a double diligence, to reco« 
▼er that time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion : she told 
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to 
my father on any such subject ; that he knew too well 
Vfhat was my interest to give his consent to any such 
thing so much for my hurt ; and that she wondered 
how I could think of any such thing after such a dis- 
course as 1 had had with my father, and such kind 
and tender expressions as she knew my father had 
used to me ; and that, in short, if I would ruin my^ 
self, there was no help for me ; but I might depend I 
should never have their consent to it: that for her 
part^ she would not have so much hand in my destruc* 
tion ; and I should never have it to say, that my mo- 
ther was willing when my father was not. 
, Though my mother refused to move it to my father^ 



<3 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported all the 
discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a 
great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, *' That boy 
might be happy if he would stay at home ; but if he 
goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch 
that was ever born ; I can give no consent to it/' 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke 
loose, though, in the mean time, I continued obsti- 
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, 
and frequently expostulating with my father and mo- 
ther about their being so positively determined against 
that to which they knew my inclinations prompted me. 
But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, 
and without any purpose of making an elopement at 
that time ; but, I say, being there, and one of my 
companions theii going by sea to London, in his fa- 
ther's ship, and prompting me to go with them, with 
the common allurement of sea-faring men, viz. that it 
should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted 
neither father nor mother any more, not so much as 
sent them word of it ; but leaving them to hear of it 
as they might, without asking God's blessing, or my 
father's, without any consideration of circumstances 
or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on 
the first of September, 1651, I went on board a ship 
bound for London. Never any young adventurer's 
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued 
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner out of the 
Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves 
to rise in a most frightful manner ; and, as I had never 
been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in 
body, and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to 
reflect on what I had done, and how justly I was 
overtaken by the judgment of heaven for wickedly 
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty. 
All the good counsel of my parents, my father's tears 
and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into m j 
mind ; and my conscience, which was not yet come to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 7 

the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, 
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the 
breach of my duty to God and my father. 

Ail this while the storm increased, and the sea, 
on which I had never been before, went very high, 
though nothing like what I have seen many times 
since ; no, nor like what I saw a few days after : but 
it was enou&:h to affect me, who was then but a vouns 
sailor, and Ld never known any thing of the It J. 
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, 
and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, 
in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never 
rise more ; and in this agony of mind I made many 
vows and resolutions, that if it would please God here 
to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once my 
foot on dry land again, I would go directly home to 
my fiather, and never set it into a ship again while t 
lived; that I would take his advice, and never run 
myself into such miseries as these any more. Now 
I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about 
the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably 
he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed 
to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore; and I re- 
solved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go 
home to my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued during 
the storm, and indeed some time after ; but the next 
day, as the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, I 
began to be a little inured to it : however, I was very 
grave for all that day, being still a little sea-sick ; but 
towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was 
quite over, and a charming fine evening followed ; the 
sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next 
morning ; and having little or no wind, and a smooth 
sea, the sun shining on it, the sight was, as I thought, 
the most delightful that I ever saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more 
^ea-sicky but very cheerful, looking with wonder on 



8 LIFE AND ADVENTURBS 

the ftea that was so rough and terrible the day befon^ 
and ccfvld be so calm and so pleasant in a little time 
after, l And now, lest my good resolutions should 
continue, my companion, who had indeed enticed me 
away, came to me and said, '' Well, Bob," clapping 
me on the shoulder, '* how do you do after it ? I 
warrant you were frightened, wa'n't you, last nighty 
when it blew but a cap-full of wind V — " A cap-full 
do you call it ?" said I ; ''it was a terrible storm," 
— ** A storm, you fool you," replied he, " do you 
call that a storm ? why it was nothing at all ; giye us 
but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing 
of such a squall of wind as that ; but you're but a 
fresh- water sailor. Bob. Come, let us. make a bowl 
of punch, and we'll forget all that ; do you see what 
charming weather it is now ?" To make short this 
sad part of my story, we went the old way of all 
saildrs ; the punch was made, and I was made drunk 
with it ; and m that one night's wickedpess I drowned 
all my repentance, all my reflexions on my past con- 
duct, and all my resolutions for my future. In a 
word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of 
surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that 
storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my 
fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the 
sea being forgotten, and the current of my former de- 
sires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises 
that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some 
intervals of reflexion ; and serious thoughts did, as it 
were, endeavout to return again sometimes; but I 
shook them off, and roused myself from them aa 
it were from a distemper, and applying myself to 
drinking and company, soon mastered the return of 
those flts^ for so I called them ; and I had in five or^ 
six days got as complete a victory over conscience, as 
any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with 
it, could desire : but I was to have another trial for 
it still ; and Providence, as in such cases generally it 



X>F ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 

does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse : 
for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the 
next was to be such a one as the worst and most har- 
dened wretch among us would confess both i}ie dan- 
ger and the mercy of. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into 
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary, 
and the weather calm, we had made but little way 
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to 
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con- 
trary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days, dur- 
ing which time a great many ships from Newcastle 
came into the same roads, as the common harbour 
where the ships might wait for a wind for the river. 

We had not, however, rode here so long, but should 
have tided it up the river, had the wind not blown 
too fresh ; and, after we had lain four or five days, it 
blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned 
as good. as a harbor, the anchorage good, and our 
ground tackle ^ery strong, our men were unconcerned, 
and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent 
the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the 
sea ; but the eighth day in the morning the wind in- 
creased, and we had all hands at work to strike our 
top-masts, and make every thing snug and close, that 
the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the 
sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode fore- 
,ca8tle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once 
or twice our anchor had come home ; on which our 
master ordered out the sheet-anchor ; so that we rode 
with two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to 
the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and 
now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces 
-even of the seamen themselves. The master, though 
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as 
Jie went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear 
bim softly say to himself several times, ** Lord be 



lO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

• 

merciful to us ! we shall be all lost ; we shall be all 
undone !'' and the like. During these first hurries 
I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in 
the steerage, and cannot describe my temper : I could 
ill reassume the first penitence which I had so appa- 
rently trampled on, and hardened myself against: I 
thought that the bitterness of death had been past, 
and that this would be nothing like the first : but 
when the master himself came by me, as I said just 
now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully 
frightened : I got up out of my cabin, and looked out ; 
but such a dismal sight I never saw ; the sea went 
mountains high, and broke on us every three or 
four minutes : when I could look about, I could see 
nothing but distress around us ; ' two ships near us, we 
found, had cut their masts by the boara, being deep 
laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship about a mile 
a-head of us was foundered. Two more ships being 
driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads 
to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast 
standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so 
much laboring in the sea ; biit two or three of them 
drove, and came close by us, running away with only 
their spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged 
the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore- 
mast, which he was very unwilling to do : but the 
boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the 
ship would founder, he consented ; and when they 
had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so 
loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged 
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in 
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had 
been in such a fright before at but a little. But if 
I can express at this distance the thoughts that I 
had about me at that time, I was in tenfold mor^ 
horror of mind on account of my former convictions. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOBl 



iTi 



find the having returned from them to the resolu- 
tions I had yrickedly taken at first, than I was at 
death itself; and these, added to the terror of th^ 
storm, put me in such a condition, that I can by no 
words describe it. But the worst was not come yet ; 
the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen 
themselves acknowledged they had never known a 
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deeply 
laden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every 
now and then cried out she would founder. It was 
my advantage in one respect, that I did not know 
what they meant by founder^ till I inquired. How- 
ever, the storm was so violent, that I saw what is not 
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others 
more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, expecting 
every moment that the ship would go to the bottom. 
In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of 
our distresses, «one of the men that had been down on 
purpose to see, cried out, we had sprung a leak ; an- 
other said, there was four foot water in the hold. Then 
all hands were called to the pump. At that very 
word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and 1 
fell backwards on the side of my bed where I sat, 
into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and 
told me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, 
was as well able to pump as another; at which I 
stirred up, and went to the pump and worked very 
heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing 
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, 
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would 
not come near us, ordered us to fire a gun as a signal 
of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant, 
was 80 surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, 
or some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I 
was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As 
this was a time when everybody had his own (ife to 
think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of 
; but another man stepped up to the pump, and 



12 I^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking 
I had been dead ; and it was a. great while before 1 
came to myself. 

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the 
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder; and 
though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was 
not possible she could swim till we might run into a 
port, so the master continued firing guns for help ; and 
a light ship, who had rode it out just a-head of us, 
ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the ut- 
jpost hazard the boat came near us, but it was impos- 
sible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near 
the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very hear- 
tily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men 
cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and 
then veered it out a great length, which they, after 
great labor and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled 
them close, under our stern, and got all into their boat. 
It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in 
the boat, to think of reaching their own ship ; so all 
^agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards 
shore as much as we could ; and our master promised 
them, that if the boat was staved on shore he would 
make it good to their master ; so partly rowing and 
partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, 
sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton 
Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour 
out of our ship before we saw her sink, and then I 
understood for the first time what was meant by a ship 
foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had 
hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she 
was sinking; for from that moment they rather put 
me into the boat, than that I may be said to go m ; 
my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with 
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts 
of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet la> 



Of ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

boring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore^ we 
could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, wo 
were able to see the shore) a great many people run- 
ning along the strand ix> assist us when we should 
come near ; but we made but slow way towards the 
shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being past 
the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the 
westward y towards Cromer, and so jthe land broke off 
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, 
and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe 
on s^ore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth^ 
where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great 
humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who 
assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants 
and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient 
to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we 
thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to 
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and 
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's par»* 
Ue, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for hear- 
ing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yar- 
mouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any 
assurance that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti- 
nacy that nothing could resist ; and though I had se- 
Teral times loud calls from my reason, and my more 
Gonnposed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power 
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I 
urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries 
il8 on to be the^ instruments of our own destruction, 
even though it be before us, and that we rush on it 
with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such 
decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it 
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed 
me forward against the calm reasonings and persua- 
90ns of my most retired thoughts, and against two 



14 l;f£ and adventures 

such visible instructions as I had met with in my first 
attempt. . 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, 
and who was the master's son, was now less forward 
than I. The fii-st time he spoke to me after we were 
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, 
for we were separated in the town to several quarters; 
I. say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone 
was altered, and looking very melancholy, and shaking 
his head, asked me how I did, and telling his father 
who I was, and how I had come this voyage only 
for a trial, in order to go fyrther abroad ; his father 
turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone, 
•• Young man," says he, ** you ought never to go to 
sea any more ; you ought to take this for a plain and 
visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man." 
•* Why, Sir," said I, " will you go to sea no more? " 
*J That is another case," said he ; '* it is my calling, 
and therefore my duty ; but as you made this voyage 
for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you 
of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps 
this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in 
the ship of Tarshish. Pray," continues he, '< what- 
are you ; and on what account did you go to sea?" 
I told him some of my story ; at the end of which he 
burst- out with a strange kind of passion ; *' What had- 
I done," says he, ** that such an unhappy wretch 
should come into my ship ? I would not set my foot 
in the same ship with thee again for a thousand 
pounds." This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of hi» 
spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, 
lid was farther than he could have authority to go. 

awever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me,- 
orting me to go back to my father, and not tempt 
P)[pyidence to my ruin; told me I might see a visi- 
ble hand of Heaven against me. *' And, young man," 
sa^, hei << depend on it^< if you do not go back,< 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15 

wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disi 
asters and disappointments, till your father s words 
are fulfilled on you." 

We parted soon after ; for I made him little 
answer, and I saw him no more : which way he went, 
I know not. As for me, having some money in my 
pocket, I travelled to London by land ; and there, as 
well as on the road, had many struggles with myself,^ 
what course of life I should take, and whether I 
should go home, or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best notions, 
that offered to my thoughts ; and it immediately oc- 
curred to me how I should be laughed at among the 
neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not my 
father and mother only, but even every body else ; 
from whence I have since often observed, how incon- 
gruous and irrational the common temper of man- 
kind is, especially of youth, to that reason which, 
ought to guide them in such cases, viz. that they are 
not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; 
nor ashamed of the action for which they ought justly 
to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the return- 
ing, which only can make them be esteemed wise 
men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some 
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what 
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance con- 
tinued to going home ; and as I staid awhile, the 
remembrance of the distress I had been in, wore off; 
and as that abated, the little notion I had in my de- 
sires to a return wore off with it, till at last I quite 
laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a 
voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away 
from my father's house, that hurried me into the. 
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, 
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly on me, 
as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the. 



16 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

inlreaties and even the commands of my fathef ; 1 
say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented 
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; 
and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of 
Africa ; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to 
Guinea.' 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adven- 
tures I dia not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, 
though I might indeed have worked a little harder 
I than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the 
\ duty and office of a foremast-man ; and in time might 
\ have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not 
\ for a master. But as it was always my fate to choose 
for the worse, so I did here ; for having money in my 
pocket, and good clothes on my back, 1 would always 

fi on board in the habit of a gentleman ; and so 
neither had any business in the ship, nor learned to 
do any. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good 
company in London, which does not always happen 
to such loose and un guided young fellows as I then 
was ; the devil generally not omitting to lay some 
snare for them very early : but it was not so vnth me. 
I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship 
who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, 
having had very good success there, was resolved to 
go again ; and who taking a fancy to my conversa- 
aon, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, 
hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told 
ibe if I would go the voyage with him I should be 
at no expense ; I should be his messmate and his com- 

ftnion ; and if I could carry any thing with me, 
should have all the advantage of^^ it that the trade 
would admit ; and perhaps I might meet with some 
encouragement. 

I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict 
friendship with this captain, who was an honest and 
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 17 

garried a small adventure with me, which, by the 
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I 
increased very considerably ; for I carried about 
40/.. in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me 
to buy. This 40/. I had mustered together by the 
assistance of some of my relations with whom I cor- 
responded, and who, I believe, got my faUier, or at 
least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my 
first adventure. 

This was the only voyage in which I may say I was 
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to 
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain ; 
vnder whom also I got a competent knowlege of the 
mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how 
to keep an account of the ship's, course, take an ob- 
servation, and, in short, to understand some things 
that were needful to be understood by a sailor : for, as 
he took delight to instruct me, JL took delight to 
learn ; and, in a word, tliis voyage made me both a 
sailor . and a merchant : for .1 brought home five 
pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, 
which yielded me in London, at, my return, almost 
300/., and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts 
which have so completed my ruin. 

Vet even in this voyage 1 had my misifortunes too ; 
particularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown 
mto a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the 
climate; our principal trading being on the coast, 
from tfie latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line 
itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my 
friend, to my great misfortune, dyiug 80<mi after his 
arrival, I resolved to go the same voy^^e again, and 
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his 
mate in his former voyage, and had now got the com- 
mand of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage 
that ever man made ; for though I did not carry quite 
iOQ/. of my new-gained wealUi^ so that I. had 200/« 

VOL. I. B 



18 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

iBit, and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who 
was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes 
in this voyage ; and the first was this, viz. our ship 
making her course towards the Canary Islands,* <Mr 
rather between those islands and the African share, 
was surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish 
rover, of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail 
she could make. We crowded also as much canvass as 
our yards would spread, or our masts carry to have 
got clear ; but finaing the pirate gained on us, and 
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we 
prepared to fight ; our ship having twelve guns, and 
the rover eighteen. About three in the afternoon he 
came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just 
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as 
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on 
that side, and poured in a broadside on him, which 
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and 
pouring in also his small-shot from near. 20Q men 
which he had on board. However, we had not a man 
touched, all 6ur men keeping close. He prepared to 
attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but 
laying us on board the next time on our other quarter, 
he entered sixty men on our decks, who immedi<«- 
ately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging. 
We plied them with small-shot, halfrpikes, powder^ 
chests, and sucii like, and cleared our deck of them 
twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part of 
our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our 
men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged to 
yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port 
belonging to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first 
I apprehended ; nor was I carried up the country to 
the emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but 
was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper 
prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, 
»nd fit for his business. At this surprising change of 



OF EOBINSON CRTJSOB« lO 

my' circttmdtances, firom & merchant to a miserable 
lAmwe, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked 
iMck on my father's prophetic discourse to me, that £ 
diOHld be miserable, and have none to relieve me, 
which I thought was now so effectually brought to 

essy that I could not be worse ; that now the .hand of 
eaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without 
redemption : but, alas ! this was but a taste of the mi- 
sery I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel 
of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home 
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take me 
with him when he went to sea again, believing that it 
would sometime or other be his fate to be taken by a 
Spanish or Portuguese man of war ; and that then I 
•hoold be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was 
soon taken away ; for when he went to sea, he left me 
on shore to look after his little garden, and do the 
common drudgery of slaves about his house ; and when 
he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to 
lie in the cabin to look after the ship. 

' Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what 
method I might take to effect it, but found no way 
that had the least probability in it : nothing presented 
la make the supposition of it rational ; for I had no- 
body to communicate it to that would embark with 
me, no fellow slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or 
Scotchman there but myself; so that for two years, 
though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet 
I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting 
it in .practice. 

After about two years an odd circumstance present- 
ed itself, which put the old thought of making some 
attempt for my liberty again in my head. My pa- 
tron lying at home longer than usual without fitting 
out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, 
he used constantly, once or twice a- week, sometimes 
ofteneTy if the weather was fair, to take the ship'«

pinnace, and go out into the road to fish ; and as he 
always took me and a young Moresco .with him to row 
the boat, we made him very merry, and I prored very 
dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that sometimes 
he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, 
and the youth of Moresco, as they called him, to catch 
a dish offish for him. 

It happened one time, that going to fish in a stark 
calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were 
not half a league from the shore we lost sight of it; 
and rowing we knew not whidier or which way, we 
labored all day^ and all the next night, and when the 
morning came we found we had pulled off to sea in* 
stead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at 
least two leagues from the shore : however, we got well 
in again, though with a great deal of labor and some 
danger ; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in 
the morning ; but particularly we were all very hungry* 

But our patron, warned by tliis disaster, resolved to 
take more care of himself for the futur.e ; and having 
lying by him the long-boat of our English ship he had 
taken, he ^resolved he would not go out any more 
without a compass and some provision ; so he ordered 
the carpenter of his ship, who also was «n English 
slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin ^ in the mid-* 
die of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place 
to stand behind it to steer and haul home the main-* 
sheet ; and room before for a hand or two to stand 
and work the sails: she sailed with what we call a 
shoulder of mutton sail ; and the boom gibbed over the 
top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low,:«nd 
hsMl in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and 
a table to eat on, with some small lockers to pot in 
some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink ; 
and particularly his bread, rice, and coffee. 

We went frequently out in this boat, and as I was 
most dexterous to catch fish for him, he nerer went 
without me. It happened that he had appointed to go 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOB. 21 

•Qt IB this boaty either for pleasure or for fish, with 
two or three Moon of some distinction in that place, 
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and 
bad th^efore sent on board the boat over-night a lar* 
ger store of provisions than ordinary ; and had ordered 
flie to get ready three fnzees vnth powder and shot, 
which were on board his ship ; for that they designed 
wome sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited 
the next morning with the boat washed clean, her en-^ 
sign and pendants out, and every thing to accommo^ 
dale his guests ; when by and by my patron came on 
board alone, and told me hb guests had put off going, 
on some business that fell out, and ordered me with 
the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat 
and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to 
•up at his house ; and commanded that as soon as I 
got some fish I should bring it home to his house ; alt 
which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance dart^ 
ed into my thoughts, for now I found I was like to 
hare a little ship at my command ; and my mastet 
being, gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fish- 
ing business, but for a voyage ; though I knew not; 
neither did I so much as consider, whither I should 
steer ; for any where, to get out of that place, wasmy 

speak to this Moor, to get something for our subsist-^ 
ence on board ; for I told him we must not presume 
to eat of our patron's bread ; he said, that was true : 
so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their 
kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the beat. 
I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which 
it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some 
English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat 
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been 
there before for our master : I conveyed also a great 



2*i^ I4IFB AND ADVENTURES 

lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed abbvo 
half a hundred weight, with a parcel ol twine or 
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which 
were of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax 
to make candles. Another trick I tried on him, 
into which he innocently came also ; his name was 
Jsmael, whom they call Muley, or Moley; so I 
called him: " Moley," said 1, /'our patron's guns 
are on board the boat ; can you not get a little pow- 
der and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamied 
(a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know h^ 
keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."-^*^ Yes/' says 
he, ^' I'll bring some ;" and accordingly he brought a 
great leathern pouch which held about a pound and 
a half of powder, or rather more ; and another with 
shot, that had iBve or six pouods, with some buUeta, 
and put all into the boat : at the same time I had 
found some powder of my master's in the great cabiii« 
with which I filled one of the large bottles in the cade, 
whidi was almost empty, pouring what was in it into 
another ; and thus furnished with every thing needfuU 
we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is 
at the entrance of the port, knew who we were^ and 
took no notice of us : and we were not above a mile 
put of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set 
MS down to fish. The wind blew from the N.'N.£ii 
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown 
southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of 
Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz ; bat 
my resolutions were, blow which way it would, ' I 
would be gone from that horrid place where I was« 
find leave the rest to fate. 

. After we had fished some time and catched nothing, 
for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull 
them up, that he might not see them, I said to the 
Moor, *< This will not do; our tnaster will not be 
thus served ; we must stand farther off." He, thiiik<* 
jng no harm, agreed, and being in the head of Iha 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

boat set the sails ; and as I had the helm I run the 
boat out near a league farther, and then brought her 
to as if I would fish ; when giving the boy the helm, 
J stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making 
as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him 
by surprise with my arm under his waist, and tossed 
him clear overboard into the sea. He rose immedi-^ 
lM«ly, ioT he swam like a cork, and called to me^ 
b^ged to be taken in, told me he would go all over 
the world with me. He swam so strong after the 
boat, that he would have reached me very quickly^ 
Jthere being but little wind ; on which I stepped into 
ihQ cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I 

f reseated it at him, and told him, I had done him no 
urt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none : 
^* But^" said I, '< you swim well enough to reach the 
'shore, and the sea is calm ; make the best of your 
way to shore, and I will do you no harm ; but if you 
€ome near the boat I'll shoot you through the head, 
for I am resolved to have my liberty :" so he turned 
himself about, and swam for the shore, and I make 
no doubt he reached it with ease, for he was an excel-* 
}eot swimmer. 

J could have been content to have taken this Moor 
^th me, and have drowned the boy, but there was 
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone^ I 
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said 
to him^ *' Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll 
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke 
your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Maho* 
met and his father's beard, '' I must throw you into 
the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spots 
00 innocently, that I could not mistrust him; and 
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world 
.with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swim- 
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather 
stretching to windward, that they might think me 



24 LIFE AND ADVENTURB6 

gone towards the Straits' mouth ; (as indeed any one 
tiiat had been in their wits must have been supposed 
to do;) for who would hare supposed we were sailed 
on to the S9uthward to the truly Barbarian coast, 
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to sur* 
round us with the canoes, and destroy us ; where we 
could never once go on shore but we should be de- 
voured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages 
of human kind ? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I 
changed my course, and steered directly south and 
by east, bending my course a little toward the east, 
that I might keep in with the shore ; and having a 
fair, fresh gale ot wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I 
made such sail that I believe by the next day at 
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the 
Jand, I could not be less than 150 miles south of 
Sallee ; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's do^ 
minions, or indeed of any other king thereabout, far 
we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, 
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into 
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, 
or come to an anchor ; the wind continuing fair till 
I had sailed in that manner five days ; and then tlM 
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that 
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also 
would now give over ; so I ventured to make to the 
coast, and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little 
river, I knew not what, or where ; neither what lati- 
tude, what country, what nation, or what river: I 
neither saw, or desired to see any people ; the prin^ 
cipal thing I wanted was fresh water, n e came into 
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shoro 
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country ; but, 
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadfiil 
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wiU 
creatureiS of we knew not what kinds, that the poor 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

bojr was ready to die with fear, and begged of roe 
ttoi to go on shore till day. ** Well, Xury/' said I, 
** then I won't ; but it may be we may see men by 
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions."— > 
*' Then we give them the shoot gun/' says Xury^ 
laughing, ** make them, run way." Such English 
Xwy spoke by conversing among us slaves. How* 
ever I was glad. to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave 
him a dram (out of our patron's t^ase of bottles) to 
dieer him up. After all, Xury's advice was good, 
and I took it ; we droppcnl our little anchor, and lay 
still all night ; I say. still, for we slept none ; for in 
two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we 
knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come 
down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wal* 
lowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of 
cooling themselves ; and they made snch hideous 
bowlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the 

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was 
I too ; but we were both more firightened when we 
heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming 
towards our boat ; we could not see him, but we might 
hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and 
forions beast ; Xury said it was a lion, and it might 
be 10 for aught I know ; but poor Xury cried to me 
to weigh the anchor and row away: '* No," says I^ 
'* Xury ; we can slip our cable with the buoy to it, 
and go off to sea ; they cannot follow us far," I had 
no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (what* 
ever it was) within two oars' length, which something 
surprised me ; however, I immediately stepped to the 
cabin*door, and taking up my gun, fired at him ; on 
which he immediately turned about, and swam to- 
wards the shore again. 

Ant it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, 
aad hideous cries and bowlings, that were raised, as 
well on the edge of the shore as higher within the 



26 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

country, on the noise or report of the gun, a thing I 
have some reason to believe those creatures had never 
heard before : this convinced me that there yras no 
going on shore for us in the night on that coast, and 
bow to venture on shore in the day was another ques- 
tion too ; for to have fallen into the hands of any of 
the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the 
paws of lions and tigers ; at least we were equally 
apprehensive of the danger of it. 
, Be that as it would , we were obliged to go on shore 
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint 
left in the boa^; when or where to get it, was the 
point : Xury said, if I would let him go on shore 
with one of the jars, he would find if there was any 
water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he 
would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the 
boat? The boy answered with -so much affection, 
that made me love him ever after. Says he, '^ If wild 
mans come, they eat me, you go way." — ** Well, 
Xury," said I, ''we will both go, and if the wild 
mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat neither 
of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread«to 
eat, and a dram out of our patron *s case of bottles 
which I mentioned before ; and we hauled the boat 
in as near the shore as we thought was proper, and so 
waded to shcnre ; carrying nothing but our arms, and 
two jars for water. 

. I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing 
the coming of canoes with savages down the livec: 
but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the 
country, rambled to it ; and by and by I saw him 
eome running towards me. I thought he was pursued 
by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, 
and I run forward towards him to help him ; hut when 
I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over hit 
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like 
a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs ; how- 
ever,, we were very glad of it> and it was very, good 



OF ROBINSON CR17SOE; 27 

m^ait ; but the great joy that poor Xury came with^ . 
was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no 
wild mans. 

. Sut we foand afterwards that we need not take such 
pains fmr water, for a little higher up the creek where' 
we were, we found the water fresh when the tide was 
out, which flows but a little way up ; so we filled our 
jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and pre^ 
pared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of 
any human creature in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I 
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and 
the Cape de Yerd islands also, lay not far off from 
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an 
observation to know what latitude we were in, and 
not exactly knowing, or at least remembering what 
latitude they were in, and knew not where to look 
for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them ; 
Otherwise J might now easily have found some of 
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood 
along this coast till I came to that part where the 
English traded, I should find some of their vessels on 
their usual design of trade, that would relieve and ' 
take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I 
now was, must be that country, which, lying between 
the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, 
lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild beasts ; 
the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther 
south for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors not think-* 
ing it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness } 
and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious 
numbers of tigers, lions, and leopards, and other furi« 
ons creatures which harbor there ; so that the Moors 
«ise it for their hunting only, where they go like an 
army, two or three thousand men at a time ; and in- 
deed for near an hundred miles together on this 
ooast^ we' saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited coun-r

try by day, and heard nothing but bowlings and roar-^ 
ing 01 wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw the 
Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the Mountain 
Teneriffe in the Canaries ; and had a great mind to 
venture out, in hopes of reaching thither ; but having 
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, 
the sea also going too high for my little vessel ; so 
I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along 
the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, 
after we had left this place ; and once in particular, 
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor un- 
der a little point of land which was pretty high ; and 
the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 
Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems 
mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we 
had best go farther off the shore ; " for," says he, 
** look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of 
that hillock fast asleep.'^ I looked where he pointed, 
and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terri- 
ble great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under 
the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a 
little over him. " Xury," says I, " you shall go on 
shore and kill him." Xury looked frightened, and 
said, ^* ]V(e kill ! he eat me at one mouth ;" one mouth* 
ful he meant : however, I said no more to the boy, but 
bad him lie still, and I took our biggest gun, which 
was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a ^ood 
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it 
down ; then I loaded another gun with two bullets ; 
and the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with 
five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with 
the first piece to have shot him in the head, but he lay 
so with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the 
slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. 
He started up, growling at first, but finding his leg 
broke, fell down again, and then got up on three legB>

and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard« I 
wa^ a little surprised that I had not hit him on the 
head ; however, 1 took up the second piece imme- 
diately, and, though he began to move off,.fired ag&in^ 
and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see 
him drop, and make hut little noise, hut lie struggling 
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me 
let him go on shore ; *' Well^ go," said I ; so the boy 
jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one 
hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming 
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his 
ear, and shot him in the head again, which dispatched 
him quite. 

. This was game indeed to us, hut this was no food ; 
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder 
and shot on a creature that was good for nothing to 
us. However, Xury said be would have some of him ; 
so he comes on board, and asked me to give him the 
hatchet. '* For what, Xury V said I. *' Me cut off 
his head," said he. However, Xury could not cut off 
his head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with 
him, and it was a monstrous great one« . 

I hethought myself howrever, that perhaps the skin 
of him might one way or other be of some value to 
us; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. 
So Xury and 1 went to work vrith him ; but Xury 
was much the better workman at it, for I knew very 
ill how to do it. Indeed it took us both up the whofe 
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and spread- 
ing it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried 
it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me 
to lie on, 

. After this stop, we made on to the southward con- 
tinually for ten or twelve days, living very sparing 
on our provisions, which began to abate very much, 
and going no oftener into the shore than we were 
obliged to for fresh water: my design in this was, 
to make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to fiay. 



30 UFB AND ADVENTURES 

anywhere about the Gape de Verd, where I was iii 
hopes to meet With some European ship ; and if I 
did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but 
to seek for the islands, or perish there among the 
Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, 
>Hiich sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to 
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this Cape, or 
those islands ; and in a word, I put the whole of my 
fortune on this single point, either that I must meet 
with some ship, or must perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days 
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land 
was inhabited ; and in two or three places, as we 
sailed by, we saw people stand on the shore to look 
at us ; we could also perceive they were quite blacky 
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone 
on shore to them ; but Xury was my better counsel- 
lor, and said to me, *< No go, no go." However, I 
hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them, 
and I found they run along the shore by me a good 
way : I observed they had no weapons in their hands, 
except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury 
said was a lance, and that they would throw them a 
great way with a good aim ; so I kept at a distance, 
but talked with them by signs as well as I could ; and 
particularly made signs for something to eat ; they 
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would 
fetch me some meat. On this I lowered the top of 
my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the 
country, and in less than half an hour came back, and 
brought with them two pieces of dry flesh and some 
corn, such as is the produce of their country ; but we 
neither knew what the one or the other was : how- 
ever, we were willing to accept it, but how to come 
at it was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing 
on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us : 
but they took a safe way for us all, for tliey brought 
it to the shore, and laid it down, iind. went and stood 



bV ROBINSON CRUSOE. St 

a grtot way off till we fetched it on board, and then 
eame elose to us again. 

; We made signs of thanks to them, for we had 
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity 
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully ; 
for while we were lying by the shore came two 
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took 
it) with great fury from the mountains towards the 
sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, 
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could 
not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was 
usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter ; be-* 
cause, in the first place, those ravenous creatures 
seldom appear but in the night ; and in the second 
place, we found the people terribly frightened, espe-> 
cially the women. The man that had the lance or 
dart did not fly from them, but the rest did; how- 
ever, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, 
they did not seem to offer to fall on any of the 
Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and 
swam about, as if they had come for their diversion : 
at last, one of them began to come nearer our boat 
than I at first expected ; but I lay ready for him, for 
I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition^ 
and bade Xury losid both the others. As soon as he 
,eame fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him 
directly in the head : immediately he sunk down into 
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and 
down, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed 
he was : he immediately made to the shore ; but be- 
tween the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the 
strangling of the water, he died just before he reached 
the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these 
poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun ; some 
of them were even ready to die for fear, and fell down 
es dead with the very terror ; but when they saw the 
ereature dead^ and sunk in the water, and that I raad«

signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart 
and came to the shore, and began to search for the 
creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; 
and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, 
and gaye the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on 
^ore, and found that it was a most curious leopard, 
spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the 
Negroes held up their hands with admiration, to think 
what it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire 
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up 
directly to the mountains from whence they came ; 
nor could I, at that distance, know what it was* I 
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh 
of this creature, so I was willing to have them take 
it as a fayor from me ; which, when 1 made signs 
to them that they might take him, they were yerv 
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with 
him ; and though they had no knife, yet, with a 
sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as 
readily, ana much more readily, than we could have 
done with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh, 
which I declined, making as if I would give it 
them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave 
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their 
povisions, which, though I did not understand, yet I 
accepted. I then made signs to them for some water, 
and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bot- 
tom upward, to show that it was empty, and that I 
wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to 
some of their friends, and there came two women, 
and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burned, 
as I suppose, in the sun ; this they set down, to me, as 
before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and 
filled them all three« The women were as stark naked 
as the men.

was, and water ; and leaving my friendly N^oes, 1

fonfard for about eleven days more, without 
offenng to go near the shore, till I saw the land run 
/Qttt 8 great length into the sea, at about the distance 
of four or five leagues before me ; and the sea being 
Tery calm, I kept a large offing, to make this point. 
At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues 
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to 
seaward : then I concluded, as it was most certain in- 
'deed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those the 
ii^ands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd Islands. 
However, they were at a great distance, and I could not 
well tell what I had best do ; for if £ should be taken 
with a gale of wind, I might neither reach one nor the 
i>ther. 

In this dilemma, as I. was very pensive, I stepped 
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the 
belm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cri^l Qut^ '' Mas- 
ter, master, a ship with a sail !" and the foolish boy 
was frightened out of his wits, thinking it must needs 
be «ome of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I 
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach; 
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not 
•nly the ship, but what she was, viz. that it was a 
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, wa^ bound to the 
coast of Guinea, for Negroes. But when 1 observed 
the course she steered, I was soon convinced they 
were bound some other way, and did not design to 
come any nearer to the shore : on which I stretched 
out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with 
them, if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I' should 
not be able to come in their way, but that they would 
be gone by before I could make any signal to them : 
but after 1 had crowded to the utmost, and began to 
4eipaii^, they, it seems, saw me, by the help of their 
perspective glasses, and thought it was some European 
boat, which, they supposed, must belong to some ship 
thai was lost ; so they shortened sail, to let me come

up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my pa- 
tron's ensign on board, I made a waft of it to them, 
for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which 
they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke, 
though they did not hear the gun. On these signals, 
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me ; and 
in about three hours' time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in 
Spanish, and in French, but I understood none of 
them ; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on board, 
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I 
was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out 
of slavery from the Moors, at Sal lee : they then bade 
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and 
all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one 
will believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed 
it, from such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condi- 
tion as I was in ; and I immediately offered all I had 
to the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliver- 
ance ; but he generously told me, he would take no- 
thing from me, but that all I had should be delivered 
safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. " For," says 
he, *' I have saved your life on no other terms than I 
would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one 
time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the same 
condition. Besides,'^ continued he, ** when I carry 
you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own 
country, if I should take from you what you have, 
you will be starved there, and then I only take away 
that life I have given. No, no. Seignior Inglese," 
(Mr. Englishman) says he ; ''I will carry you hither 
in charity, and these things will help to buy your sub^- 
sistence there, and your passage home again." 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was 
just in the performance, to a tittle ; for he ordered the 
seamen, that none should offer to touch anything I 
had : then he took every thing into his own posses- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

aiony and gave me back an exact inventory of them, 
that I might have them, even so much as my thre^ 
earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that 
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the 
ship's use ; and asked me what I would have for it ? I 
told him, he had been so generous to me in every 
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of the 
boat, but left it entirely to him : on which, he told 
me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty 
pietees of eight for it at Brazil ; and when it came 
there, if any one offered to give more, he would make 
it up* He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more 
for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take ; not that 
I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I 
was very loth to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had 
assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. How- 
ever, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to 
be just, and offered me this medium, that he would 
give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, 
if he turned Christian : on this, and Xury saying he 
was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazib, and 
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' 
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I 
was once more delivered from the most miserable of all 
conditions of life ; and what to do next with myself, I 
was now to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can 
never enough remember : he would take nothing of me 
for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for Uie leo- 
pard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had 
in my boat, and caused every thing I had in the ship 
to be punctually delivered to me ; and what I was 
willing to sell, he bought of me ; such as the case of 
bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of 
bees-wax, — ^for I hsid made candles of the rest : in a 
wordi I made about two hunchred and twenty pieces of

who has your money in London , to send 3roar effects 
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in 
such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring 
you the produce of them, God willing, at my return ; 
but, since human affairs are all subject to changes and 
disasters, I would have you give orders for but one 
hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your 
stock, and let the hazard be run for the first, so that if 
it come safe, you may order the rest the same way ; 
and, if it miscarry, you may haye. the other half to 
have recourse to for your supply." 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so 
friendly, that 1 could not but be convinced it was the 
best course I could take ; so I acc<Nrdingly prepared 
letters to the. gentlewoman vfith whom I left my 
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, 
as he desired me. 

I wrote the English captain*s widow a full account 
of all my adventures ; my slavery, escape, and how 
I had met with the Portuguese captain, at sea, the 
humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was 
now in, with all other necessary directions for my 
supply ; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, 
he found means, by some of the English'merchants 
there, to send over, not the order only, but a full 
account of my story to: a merchant at London, who 
represented it effectually to her : she not only dell- 
Tered the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the 
Portuguese captain a very handsome present for his 
humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred 
pounds in English goods, such as. the captain had 
wrote for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, alid 
he brought them all safe to me at the Brazik : among 
which, without my direction, (for I was.too ydung in 
my business, to. think of them,) he had taken cars ta 



. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

all V sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, nor 
oeasary for my plantation, and which were of great use 
to me. 

■ When. this, cargo arrived, I thought my fortune 
made, for. I was surprised with the joy of it; and 
my^good steward, the captain, had laid out the five 
pottQds, which . my friend had sent him as a present 
for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant^ 
finder, bond for. six years' service, and would not 
accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, 
IPfhich . I would have him accept, being' of my own 
produce. 

• Neither was. this, all : but my. goods being all 
English manufactures, such as clotli^, stuffs, baize, 
and things particularly valuable and desirable in the 
country, I found means to sell them to a very great 
advantage; so that I might say I. had more than 
four times the value of my firist cargo, and. was now 
infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the ad- 
vancemenj; of my plantation : for the first thing I did^ 
I bought me a Negro slave, and an European servant 
abo ; I mean another besides that which the captain 
brought me from Lisbon. 

' But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the 
▼ery. means of our adversity, so was it with me. 1 
^ent on the next year with great success in my plan- 
tation;! raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own 
g^and, more than I had disposed of for necessaries 
among my neighbours ; and these fifty rolb, being each 
of above a hundred weight, were well cured, and laid 
by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon : and 
fiuw, increasing in business and in wealth, my head 
began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond 
tky reach ; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the 
ba9t heads in business. Had I continued in the sta- 
tion I was UQW in, I had room for all the happy things 
fo have yet befallen me, for which my father so ear^* 



40 LIFE AND ADVENTURBS 

iMBstly reconnmended a quiet, retired life, and idiioh 
lie had so sennhiy described the middle station of life 
to be full of: but other things attended me, and I 
was still to be the wilful agent of all my own mise- 
ries; and, particularly, to increase my fault, and 
double the reflexions on myself, which in my future 
sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these mis- 
carriages were procured by my apparent obstinate 
adhering to my foolish inclination, of wandering 
about, and pursuing that inclination, in contradic- 
tion to the clearest views of doing myself good in 
a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those 
measures oi life, which nature and Providence con- 
curred to present me with, and to make my duty. 

As I had once done thus in breaking away from 
my parents, so I could not be content now, but I 
must go and leave the happy view I had of being a 
rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to 
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster 
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus. I 
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of hu- 
man misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could 
be consistent with life, and a state of health in the 
world. 

To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars 
of this part of my story : — You may suppose, that 
having now lived almost four years in the Brazils, 
and beginniug to thrive and prosper very well on 
my plantation, I had not only learned the language^ 
but had contracted an acquaintance and friendship 
among my fellow-planters, as well as among the mer- 
chants at St. Salvador, which was our port ; and that» 
in my discourses among them, I had frequentiy given 
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of 
Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes there, 
and how easy it was to purchase on the coast for 
trifles — such as t>eads, toys, knives, soissars, hatchets. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

hkd of glass, and the like — not only gold dust^ Guineas 
grains^ elephants' teeth, &c. but Negroes, for the 
senrioe of the Brazils, in great numbers. 

-They listened always very attentively to my dis* 
eoQEses on these heads, but especially to that part 
wiiich related to the buying Negroes ; which was a 
trade^ at that time, not only not far entered into, but, 
as far as it was, had been carried on by the assientos, or 
permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and 
engrossed from the public ; so that few Negroes were 
bought, and those excessive dear. 
. It happened, bemg in company with some mer- 
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking 
of those things very earnestly, three of them came to 
me the next morning, and told me they had been 
musing very much on what I had discoursed with 
thein of the last night, and they came to make a 
secret proposal to me : and, after enjoining me to se- 
creey, they told me that they had a mind to fit out a 
ship to go to Guinea ; that they had all plantations as 
well as I, and were straitened for nothin'g so much as 
•enraiits ; that as it was a trade that could not be 
carried on, because they could not publicly sell 
the Negroes when they came home, so they desired 
to make but one voyage, to bring the Negroes on 
shore privately, and divide them among their own 
plantations : and, in a word, the question was, wh6* 
ther I would go their supercargo in the ship, to 
manage the trading part on the coast of Guinea^ 
and they offered me that I should have an equal 
share of the Negroes, without providing any part of 
the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had 
it been made to any one that had not a settlement and 
plantation of his own to look after, which was in a fair 
way of coming to be very considerable, and with a 
good stock on it. But for me, that was thus en- 
tered and established, and had nothing to do but go 09

as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to 
have sent for the other hundred pounds from £ngland; 
and who, in that time, and with that little addition, 
could scarce have failed of being worth three or four 
thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too ; for 
me to think of such a voyage, was, the most preposte^ 
rous thing that ever man, in such circumstances, could 
be guilty of. 

/ But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could 
/no. more resist the offer, than I could restrain my first 
i rambling designs, when my father's good counsel was 
uost on me. In a word, I told them I would go 
with all my heart, if they would undertake to look 
after my plantation in my absence, and would dis- 
pose of it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried. 
This they all engaged to do, and entered into wri- 
tings or covenants to do so : and I made a formd 
will, disposing of my plantation and effects, in case 
of my death ; making the captain of the i^ip that 
had saved my life, as before, my universal heir; but 
obliging hini to dispose of my effects as I had di- 
rected in my will; one half of the produce being. to 
himself, and the other to be shippea to England. 

In short, I took all possible precaution to pres^ve 
my effects, and to keep up my plantation : had I used 
half as much prudence to have looked into my own 
interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought 
to have done and not to have done, I had certainly 
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking* 
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum- 
stance^ and gone a voyage to sea, attended widi all its 
common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to 
expect particular misfortunes to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dic-^ 
tates of my fancy, rather than my reason : and ac- 
cordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo 
furnished, and all tnings done as by agreement, by my 
{Mtrtners. in. the voyage, I. went on board in an evil

hour again, the Ist of September, 1659, being the 
same day eight years that I went from my father and 
moUier at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their au- 
thority, and the fool to my own interest. 

Our ship was about' one hundred and twenty tons 
burden, carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides 
the master, his boy, and myself;, we had on board no 
large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit 
for our trade, with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of 
glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking- 
glasses, kniyes, scissars, hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing 
away to the northward on our own coast, with design 
to stretch over, for the African coast. When they 
came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, 
which, it seems, was the manner of their course in 
those days, we had very good weather, only excessive 
hot all the way on our own coast, till we came to 
the height of Cape St. Augustino : from whence, keep- 
ing fardier off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered 
as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha» 
holding our course N.£. by N. and leaving those isles 
on the east. In this course we passed the line in about 
twelve days' time, and were by our last observation, 
in 7 degrees 22 minutes northern latitude, when a vio- 
ieBt tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our 
knowledge : it began from the south-east, came about 
t^the north-west, and then settled in the north-east; 
from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that 
for twelve, days together we could do nothing but 
driye^ and, scudding away before it, let it carry us 
whither ever fate and the fury of the winds directed ; 
and, during these twelve days, I need not say that I 
expected every day to be swallowed up ; nor, indeed^ 
dia liny in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In. tins distress, we had,, besides the terror of the 
s|omi, one of our men died of the calenture, and one 
anda boy washed overboaid. About the twelfth 



44 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

day/ the weather abating a little, the master made an 
observation as well as he could, and found that he 
was in about 11 degrees north latitude, but that he 
was 22 degrees of longitude difference, west from 
Gape St. Augustino; so that he found he was got 
on the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, 
beyond the river Amazons, toward that of the ri- 
ver Oroonoque, commonly called the Great River; 
iand began to consult with me what course he should 
take, for the ship was leaky and very much disabled, 
and he was going directly back to the coast of 
Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the 
charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we con-> 
duded there was no inhabited country for us to have 
recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Ca- 
ribbee islands, and therefore resolved to stand away 
for Barbadoes ; which by keeping off to sea, to avoid 
the in-*draft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we might 
easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' 
sail ; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage 
to the coast of Africa without some assistance, both to 
om ship and ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and 
steered away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of 
our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our 
voyage was otherwise determined; for being in the 
latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes, a second storm 
came on us, which carried us away with the same im- 
petuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very 
way of all human commerce, that had all our lives 
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of 
being devoured by savages than ever returning to our 
own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard; 
one of our men early in the morning cried out, Land ! 
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look 
Duty in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the worid we 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 46 

Were, -but the ship struck on a sand, and in a moment, 
h^ motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in 
such a mtmner, that we expected we should all have 
perished immediately ; and we were inmiediately dri« 
Yen into our close quarters, to shelter us from the yery 
foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the 
Uk^ condition, to describe or conceive the consterna- 
tion of men in such circumstances ; we knew nothing 
where we were, or on what land it was we were driven, 
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or 
not inhabited ; and as the rage of the wind was still 
great, though rather less than at first, we could not so 
much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes, 
without brea,king in pieces, unless the wind, by a kind 
of miracle, should immediately turn about. In a 
word, we sat looking on one another, and expecting 
death every moment, and every man acting accord- 
ingly, as preparing for another world ; for there was 
little or nothing more for us to do in this : that which 
ms our present comfort, and all the comfort we had, 
was,, that^ contrary to our expectation, the ship did 
not break yet, and that the master said the wind be- 
gan to.abate. 

. Now, though we thought that the wind did a little 
abate, yet the ship having thiis struck on the sand, and 
•dboking too fast for us to expect her getting off, we 
were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothings 
to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we 
eould. We had a boat at our stem just before the 
stcNrm, but she was first staved by darilAng against the 
itiip's rudder,. and, in the next place, she broke away, 
aqd either sunk, or was driven off to seft ; so there 
was no hope from her : we had another boal on board, 
but 'bow to get her. off into the sea was a doubtful 
thmg ; however, there was no room to de^te, for we 
fiuicied the ship would break in pieces every minute> 
aad some told us she was actually brokeo already. 



46 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In this distress, the mate of our yessel laid hold of 
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they 
got her flung over the ship's side ; and getting all into 
her, let her go, and committed ourselves, being eleven 
in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea : for 
though the storm was abated considerably, yet the 
sea went dreadful high on the shore, and might be 
well called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a 
storm. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we 
all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the 
boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably 
drowned. As to making sail, we had none ; nor if 
we had, could we have done any thing with it ; so we 
worked at the oar towards the land, though with 
heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we 
all knew that when the boat came nearef to the 
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by 
the breach of the sea. However, we committed our 
souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the 
wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our 
destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as 
we could towards land. 

What the shore was — whether rock or sand, whe- 
ther steep or shoal — ^we knew not ; the only hope that 
could rationally give us the least shadow of expecta- 
tion, was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, 
or the mouth of some river, where by great chance we 
might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the 
landi and perhaps made smooth water. But there 
was nothing of this appeared ; and as we made nearer 
and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful 
than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a 
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, 
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly 
bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it took 
us with sudi afury, that it overset the boat at omse; 



,OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

and separating us, as well from the boat as from one 
another, gaye us not time hardly to say, ** O God !" 
fer we were all swallowed up in a moment. 
. Nothing can describe the confusion of thought 
wiiich I felt, when I sunk into the water ; for though 
I swam Tery well, yet I could not deliver myself 
from the waves so as to draw my breath, till that 
wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast 
way on towards the shore, and having spent itself, 
went back, and left me on the land almost dry, 
but half dead with > the water I took in. I had so 
much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that 
seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected, 
I got on my feet, ' and endeavoured to make on to- 
wards the land as fast as I could, before another 
wave should return and take me up again ; but I 
soon found it was impossible to avoid it ; for I saw 
the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as 
furious as an enemy, which I had no means or 
strength to contend with : my business was to hold 
my breath, and raise myself on the water, if I 
could ; and so, by swimming, to preserve my breath- 
ing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible ; 
ray greatest concern now being, that the wave, as it 
would carry me a great way towards the shore when 
it came on, might not carry me back .again with it 
when it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came on me again, buried me at 
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body ; and 
I could feel myself carried with a mighty force 
and swiftness towards the shore/ a very great way ; 
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim 
still forward with all my might. I was ready to 
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself 
rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my 
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the 
water ; and though it was not two seconds of time 
iluit I -could keep myself so, yet it relieved me 



48 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

greatly y gave me breath, and new courage. I was 
covered again with water a good while, but not so 
long but I held it out; and finding the water had 
spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward 
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again 
with my feet* I stood still a few moments, to re- 
cover . breathy and till the water went from me, and 
then took to my heels, and ran with what strength I 
had farther towards the shore. But neither would 
this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came 
pouring in after me again; and twice more I was 
lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as be- 
fore, the shore being very flat. 

Ilie last time of these two had well nigh been 
fatal to me ; for the sea having, hurried me along, as 
before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a 
piece of a rock, and that with such force, that it left 
me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deli- 
verance ; for. the blow taking my side and breast, 
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body ; 
and h^ad it returned again immediately, I must have 
been strangled in the water : but I recovered a little 
before the. return of the waves, and seeing I should 
again be covered with the water, I resolved to hold 
fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if 
possible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves 
were not so high as the first, being nearer land, I 
held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched 
another run., which brought me so near the shore, 
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet 
did not so swallow me up as to carry me away ; 
and the next run I took, I got to the main land ; 
where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the 
cliffs of the dbore, and sat me down upon the grass, 
free from danger, and quite out of the reach of the 
water. 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began 
to look up and thank God that my life was saved.

in a case where in there was, some minutes before, 
scarce any room to hope. I beUeve it is impossible 
to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and trans- 
ports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may 
say, out of the grave : and I did not wonder now at 
that custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the 
halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be 
turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him ; 1 say, 
I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to 
let him blood that very moment tbey tell him of it, 
that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from 
the heart, and overwhelm him. 

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first. 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, 
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the 
contemplation of my deliverance ; making a thousand 
gestures and motions, which I cannot describe ; re- 
flecting on my comrades that were drowned, and 
that there should not be one soul saved but myself ; 
for, ^s for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any 
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and 
two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel — when the 
breach and froth of the sea being so big I could hardly 
see it, it lay so far off — and considered, Lord ! how 
was it possible I could get on shore ! 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable 
part of my condition, I begah to look round me, to 
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next 
to be done ; and I soon found my comforts abate, 
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance : for 
I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing 
either to eat or drink, to comfort me ; neither did I 
see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with 
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts : and that 
which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had 
VOL. I. D 



60 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my 
sustenance, or to defend myself against any other crea- 
ture that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, 
I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, 
and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my pro- 
vision ; and this threw me into such terrible agonies 
of mind, that, for a while, I ran about like a madman. 
Night coming on me, I began, with a heavy heart, 
to consider what would be my lot if there were any 
ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they 
always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that 
time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, 
but thorny — which grew near me, and where I re- 
solved to sit all night — and consider the next day 
what death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect 
of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to 
see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which 
I did, to my great joy ; and having drank, and 
put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent hun- 
ger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endea- 
voured to place myself so, as that if I should sleep, 
I might not fall; and having cut me a short sticK, 
like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my 
lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell 
fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few 
could have done in my condition ; and found myself 
the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on 
such an occasion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather 
clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not 
rage and swell as before; but that which surprised 
me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night 
from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of 
the tide, and w&is driven up almost as far as the 
rock which I first mentionea, where I had been so 
bruised by the wave dashing me against it. This 
being within about a mile from the shore where I was, 
and the ship seeming to stand upright stilly I wished 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5L 

myself on board, that at least I might save some ne- 
cessary things for my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, 
I looked about me again, and the first thing I found 
was the boat ; which lay, as the wind and the sea 
bad tossed her up, on the land, about two miles on my 
right hand. I walked as far as I could on the shore 
to have got to her; but found a neck or inlet of 
water between me and the boat, which was about 
half a mile broad ; so I came back for the pre- 
sent, being more intent on getting at the ship, 
where I hoped to tind something for my present sub- 
sistence. 

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and 
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within 
a quarter of a mile of the ship : and here I found a 
fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that 
if we had kept on board, we had been all safe ; that 
is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had nbt 
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all 
comfort and company, as I now was. This forced 
tears from my eyes again ; but as there was little relief 
in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so 
I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to 
extremity, and took the water ; but when I came to 
the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how 
to get on board ; for as she lay aground, and high out 
of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay 
hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second 
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered 
I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains 
so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, 
and by the help of that rope got into the forecastle of 
the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and 
had a great deal of water in her hold ; but that she lay 
so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, 
that her stern lay lifted up on the bank, and her head 
low, almost to the water. By this means all her 



52 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Suarter was free, and all that was in that part was 
ry; for you may be sure my first work was to 
search and to see what was spoiled and what was 
free : and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions 
were dry and untouched by the water ; and, being 
very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, 
and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it a$ I 
went about other things, for I had no time to lose. I 
also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I 
took a large dram, and which I had indeed need 
enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now 
I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with 
many things which I foresaw would be very necessary 
to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not 
to be had, and this extremity roused my application : 
we had several spare yards, and two or three large 
spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the 
ship ; I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung 
as many overboard as I could manage for their weight, 
tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive 
away. When this was done, I went down the ship's 
side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast 
together at both ends, as well as I could, in the form 
of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank 
on them crossways, I found I could walk on it 
very well, but that it was not able to bear any great 
weight, the pieces being too light: so I went to work, 
and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-mast 
into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a 
great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of fur- 
nishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to go 
beyond what I should have been able to have done 
on another occasion. 

N My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea- 
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it 
with, and how to preserve what I laid on it from the 
surf of the sea ; but I was not long considering this. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

I first laid all the planks or boards on it that I could 
get, and having considered well what I most wanted, 
I got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken 
open and emptied, and lowered them down on my 
raft ; these I filled with provisions, viz. bread, rice^ 
three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goats' flesh, 
(which we lived much on,) and a little remainder of 
European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls 
which we had brought to sea with us, but the fowls 
were killed. There had been some barley and wheat 
together, but, to my great disappointment, I found 
afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As 
for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging 
to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; 
and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack. These I 
stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them 
into the chests, nor any room for them. While I was 
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though 
very calm ; and I had the mortification to see my coat, 
shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore, on the 
sand, swim away ; as for my breeches, • which were 
only linen, and open-knee'd, I swam on board in 
them, and my stockings. However, this put me on 
rummagiilkg for clothes, of which I found enough, but 
took no more than I Wanted for present use, for I had 
other things.which my eye was more on ; as, first, tools 
to work with on shore : and it was after long searching 
that I found the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a 
very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than 
a ship-lading of gold would have been at that time. I 
got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without 
losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what 
it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. 
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great 
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured first, with 
some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two 
old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of 



A. 



54 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner 
had stowed them ; but with much search I found them, 
two of them dry and good, the third had taken water : 
those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now 
I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to 
think how I should get to shore with them, having 
neither sail, oar, nor rudder ; and the least cap-full of 
wind would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements : Ist, A smooth, calm 
sea : 2dly, The tide rising, and setting in to the shore : 
3dly, "What little wind there was, blew me towards 
the land. And thus, having found two or three bro- 
ken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools 
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, 
and a hammer ; and with this cargo I put to sea. For 
a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, only 
that I found it drive a little distant from the place 
where I had landed before; by which I perceived 
that there was some indraft of the water, and conse- 
quently I hoped to find some creek or river there, 
which I might make use of as a port to get to land 
with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was : there appeared before 
me a little opening of the land, and I found a strong 
current of the tide set into it ; so I guided my raft, 
as well as I could, to get into the middle of the 
stream. But here I had like to have suffered a second 
shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would 
have broken my heart: for knowing nothing of the 
coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it on a 
shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it 
wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off 
towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the 
water. I did my utmost, by setting my back against 
the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not 
thrust off the raft with all my strength ; neither durst 
I stir from the posture I was in, but holding up the 
chests with all my might, I stood in that planner near 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55 

half an hour, in which time the rising of the water 
brought me a little more on a level ; and a little 
after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and 
I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, 
and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in 
the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, 
and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on 
both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was 
not willing to be driven too high up the river ; hoping, 
in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved 
to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore 
of the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty 
I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that 
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her di- 
rectly in ; but here I had like to have dipped all 
my cargo into the sea again ; for that shore lying pretty 
steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to 
lana, but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, 
would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, 
that it would endanger my cargo again. All that I 
could do, was to wait till the tide was at the highest, 
keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold 
the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of 
ground, which I expected the water would flow over ; 
and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for 
my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her on 
that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored 
her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground ; 
one on one side, near one end, and one on the other 
side, near the other end : and thus I lay till the water 
ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo safe on 
shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek 
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow 
my goods, to secure them from whatever might hap- 
pen. Where I was, I yet knew not ; whether on the 
coDtinenty or on an island ; whether inhabited, or not 



56 LIFE AND.44Jf>lt)NTURES 

inhabited ; lyhether in daiMf of wild beasts, or not. 
There was a hill, not abowa mile from me, which 
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed ^to 
overtop some other hills^ which lay as in a ridge 
from it, northward. I took out one of the fowling- 
pieces, and one of the pistols, and ia horn of powder ; 
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top 
of that hill; where, after I had, with great labour 
and difficulty, got up to the top, I saw my fate, to my 
great affliction, viz. that I was in an island, environed 
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except 
some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small 
islands, less than this, which lay about three leagues 
to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, 
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, ex- 
cept by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none ; 
yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their 
Kinds; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what 
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, 
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting on a 
tree, on the side of a great wood. I believe it was 
the first gun that had been fired there since the crea- 
tion of the world : I had no sooner fired, but from 
all the parts of the wood there arose an innumerable 
number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused 
screaming, and crying, every one according to his 
usual note ; but not one of them of any kind that I 
knew; As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a 
kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but 
had no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh 
was carrion, and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my 
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, 
which took me up the rest of that day : what to do 
with myself at night 1 knew not, nor indeed where to 
rest : for I was afraid to lie down on the gi-ound, not 
knowing but some wild beast might devour me ; 



OF ROBINSdN CRUSOE. 57 

though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need 
for those fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself 
round with the chests and boards that I had brought 
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's 
lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to 
supply myself, except that I had seen two or there 
creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I 
shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider, that I might yet get a 
great many things out of the ship, which would be 
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging and 
sails, and such other things as might come to land ; 
and I resolved to make another voyage on board the 
vessel, if possible. And as I knew that the tirst 
storm that blew must necessarily break her all in 
pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till I 
got every thing out of the ship that I could get. Then 
I called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, 
whether I should take back the raft; but this ap- 
peared impracticable : so I resolved to go as before, 
when the tide was down ; and I did so, only that I 
stripped before I went from my hut ; having nothing 
on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and 
a pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a 
second raft ; and having had experience of the first, 
I neither made this so unwieldly nor loaded it so 
hard, but yet I brought away several things very use- 
ful to me; &s, first, in the carpenter's stores, I found 
two or three bags of nails and spikes, a great screw- 
jack, a dozen or two of hatchets ; and, above all, that 
most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I 
secured, together with several things belonging to the 
gunner; particularl](; two or three iron crows, and 
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and 
another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of 
powder more ; a Uu*ge bag-full of small shot, and a great 



58 LIFE And adventures 

roll of sheet-lead ; but this last was so heavy, I could 
not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes 
that I could find, and a spare fore- top sail, a ham- 
mock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my 
second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my 
very great comfort. 

I was under some apprehensions, during my ab- 
sence from the land, that at least my provisions 
might be devoured on shore : but when I came back, 
I found no sign of any visitor ; only there sat a crea-* 
ture like a wild cat on one of the chests, which> 
when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, 
and then stood still. She sat very composed and un- 
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a 
mind to be acquainted with me. I presented my gun 
to her, but, as she did not understand it, she was per- 
fectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir 
away; on which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, 
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my 
store was not great : however, I spared lier a bit, I 
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, ate it, and 
looked (as pleased) for more ; but I thanked her, and 
could spare no more : so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore — though I 
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring them 
by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks 
•— I went to work to make me a little tent, with the 
sail, and some poles, which I cut for that purpose ; 
and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew 
would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled 
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round 
the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt either 
from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of 
the tent with some boards within, and an empty chest 
set up on end without ; and spreading one of the beds 
on the ground^ laying my two pistols just at my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for 
the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for t 
was very weary and heavy ; for the night before I had 
slept little, and had labored yery hard all day, as 
well to fetch all those things from the ship, as to get 
them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that 
ever was laid up, I believe, for one man : but I was 
not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in 
that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing out 
of her that I could : so every day, at low water, I 
went on board, and brought away something or other; 
but particularly the third time I went, I brought 
away as much of the rigging as I could, as also 
all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with 
a piece of spare canvass, which was to mend the 
sails on occasion, and the barrel of wet gun-pow- 
der. In a word, I brought away all the sails first 
and last ; only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, 
and bring as much at a time as I could; for they 
were no more useful to be sails, but as mere can- 
vass only. 

But that which comforted me still more, was, that, 
last of all, after I had made five or nx such voyages 
as these, and thought I had nothing more to expect 
from the ship that was worth my meddling with ; I 
say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, 
and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box of 
sugar, and a barrel of fine flour ; this was surprising 
to me, because I had given over expecting any more 
provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. 
I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrap- 
ped it up, parcel by parcel^ in pieces of the sails, 
which I cut out ; and, in a word, I got all this safe on 
shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now 
having plundered the ship of what was portable and 
fit to hand out, I began with the cables, and cutting 



60 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I 
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the 
iron-work I could get; and having cut down the 
spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I 
could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those 
heavy goods, and came away ; but my good luck be- 
gan now to leave me ; for this raft was so unwieldy, 
and so overladen, that after I had entered the little 
icove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not 
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it 
overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the 
water; as for myself, it was no great harm, for I 
was near the shore ; but as to my cargo, it was 
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I 
expected would have been of great use to me : how- 
ever, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces 
of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with in- 
finite labor ; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, 
a work which fatigued me very much. After this 
I went every day on board, and brought away what I 
could get« 

I had been now thirteen days ashore, and had been 
eleven times on board the ship ; in which time I had 
brought away all that one pair of hands could well be 
supposed capable to bring ; though I believe verily, 
had the calm weather held, I should have brought 
away the whole ship, piece by piece ; but preparing 
the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind 
began to rise : however, at low water, I went on 
board ; and though I thought I had rummaged the ca- 
bin so effectually, as that nothing more could be found, 
yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one 
pf which I found two or three razors, and one pair 
of large scissars, with some ten or a dozen of good 
knives and forks; in another I found about thirty- 
six pounds value in money, some European coin, 
some Brazil, some pieces of eighty some gold, and 
some silver. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 61 

I stuiled to myself at the sight of this money: 
" O drug !" said I aloud, " what art thou good for? 
Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off the 
ground ; one of those knives is worth all this heap : 
I have no manner of use for thee ; e'en remain where 
thou art, and go to the bottom, as a. creature whose 
life is not worth saving." However, on second ^ 
thoughts, I took it away ; and wrapping all this in a 
piece of canvass, I began to think of making another 
raft ; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky 
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quar- 
ter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It 
presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend 
to make a raft with the wind off shore ; and that it 
was my business to be gone before the ikide of flood 
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the 
shore at all. Accordingly I let myself down into the 
water, and swam across the channel which lay be- 
tween the ship and the sands, and even that with diffi- 
culty enough, partly with the weight of the things I 
had about me, and partly the roughness of the water ; 
for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite 
high water it blew a storm. 

But I was got home to my little tent, where T lay, 
with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew 
very hard all that night, and in the morning, when I 
looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen ! I 
was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this 
satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost no time, 
or abated no diligence, to get every thing out of her 
that could be useful to me, and that, indeed, there wa^ 
little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I 
had had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts jof the ship, or 
of anything out of her, except what niight drive on 
shore, from her wreck ; as, indeed, divers pieces of 
her afterwards did; but those things were of small 
use to me. 



62 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about se- 
curing myself against either savages, if any should ap- 
pear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island ; and I 
had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and 
what kind of dwelling to make, whether I should 
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent on the earth : 
and in short, I resolved on both; the manner and 
description of which it may not be improper to give 
an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my 
settlement, particularly because it was on a low, 
moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it would 
not be wholesome; and more particularly because 
there was no fresh water near it : so I resolved to find 
a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation, which I 
found would be proper for me : 1st, Health and fresh 
water, I just now mentioned : 2dly, Shelter from the 
heat of the sun : ddly. Security from ravenous crea- 
tures, whether men or beasts : 4thly, A view to the 
sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not 
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was 
not willing to banish all expectation yet. 

In search for a place proper for this, I found a lit- 
tle plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front 
towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, 
so that nothing could come down on me from the top. 
On the side of this rock there was a hollow place, 
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a 
cave ; but there was not really any cave, or way into 
the rock, at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow 
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was 
not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice as 
long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at 
the end of it, descended irregularly every way down 
into the low ground by the sea-side. It was on the

from the heat every day, till it came to a W, and by 
S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those t^ountries, is 
near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before 
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its 
semi^diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its 
diameter, from its beginning and ending. 

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong 
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood 
very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the 
ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on 
the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches 
from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in the 
ship, and laid them in rows, one on another, within 
the circle, between these two rows of stakes, up to 
the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning 
against them, about two feet and a half high, like a 
spur to a post : and this fence was so strong, that nei- 
ther man nor beast could get into it or over it. This 
cost me a great deal of time and labor, especially to 
cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, 
and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a 
door, but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which 
ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me ; and so 
I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, 
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in 
the night, which otherwise I could not have done; 
though, as it appeared afterwards, there was no need 
of all this; caution from the enemies that I appre- 
hended danger from. 

Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labor, I 
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, 
and stores, of which you have the account above ; 
and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me from 
the rains, that in one part of the year are very violent 
there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent within, and

with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed 
wliich I had brought on shore, but in a hammock, 
^irllkh was indeed a very good one, and belonged to 
tiii« ittah> of the ship. 

luio this tent 1 brought all my provisions, and 
^\%ty thing that would spoil by the wet ; and having 
UlM» enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance 
wllWh till now I had left open, and so passed and re- 
|MI»»ih)» as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way 
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones 
that 1 dug down out through my tent, I laid them 
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so 
that it raised the ground within about a foot and a 
half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my 
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. It 
CK)»t me much labor and many days, before all these 
things were brought to perfection; and therefore I 
must go back to some other things which took up 
some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, 
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my 
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain fal- 
ling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of 
lightning happened, and after that, a great clap of. 
thunder, as is naturally the ejQfect of it. I was not 
so much surprised with the lightning, as I was with 
a thought, which darted into my mind as swift as 
the lightning itself : O my powder ! My very heart 
sunk within me when I thought that ■ at one blast 
all my powder might be destroyed; on which, not 
my defence only, but the providing me food, as I 
thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so 
anxious about my own danger, though, had the 
powder took fire, I had never known who had 
hurt me. 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOE, "^ ^ ^ 

Snch impression did this make on me, tbaiS^ardly 
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, )ii^ 
building and fortifying, and applied myself to makeS. 
bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to. keep 
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope that whati 
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once; 
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible 
to make one part fire another. I finished this work 
in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, which 
in all was about 240lbs. weight, was divided into not 
less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that 
had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from 
that ; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my 
fancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up. 
and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet 
might come to it, marking very carefully where I 
laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I 
went out at least once every day with my gun, as 
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any 
thing fit for food; and as near as I could, to ac« 
auaint myself with what the island produced. The 
first time I went out, I presently discovered that 
there were goats in the island, which was a great 
satisfaction to me ; but then it was attended with 
this misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy, 
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most 
difficult thing in the world to come at them : but I 
was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might 
now and then shoot one, as it soon happened; for 
after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in 
this manner for them : I observed, if they saw me kl 
the valleys, though they were on the rocks, they 
would run away as in a terrible fright; but if. they 
were feeding in the valleys, and I was on th^ rdcks, 
they took no notice of me ; from whence I cbncluded^ 
that by the position of their optics^ their sight wai 
00 directed downward, that they did jQot lewdHyse^

iiich grieved me heartily ; but when 
/, the kid stood stock still by her, till 
^k her up ; and not only so, but when 
I carried the old one with me, on my shoulders, the 
kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; on which I 
laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, 
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it 
up tame ; but it would not eat ; so I was forced to 
kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me 
with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and pre- 
served my provisions (my bread especially) as much 
as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso- 
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, 
and fuel to burn ; and what I did for that, as also 
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I 
made, I riiall give a full account of in its proper 
place: but I must first give some little account of 
myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it 
may well be supposed, were not a few. 

1 had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as 
I was not cast away on that island without being 
driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite out of 
the course of our intended voyage ; and a great way, 
viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary 
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason 
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in 
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I 
should end my life. The tears would run plentifully 
down my face when I made these reflections; and 
sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Pro- 
vidence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and 
reader them so absolutely miserable ; so abandimMl 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE; 61 

iH^thout help, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly 
be rational to be thankful for such a life. 

But something always returned swift on me to 
check these thoughts, and to reprove me : and par- 
ticularly, one day, walking with my gun in my hand, 
by the sea-wde, I was very pensive on the subject of 
my present condition, when reason, as it were, ex- 
postulated with me the other way, thus : ** Well, you 
are in a desolate condition, it is true ; but, pray re- 
member, where are the rest of you? Did not you 
come eleven of you into the boat ? Where are the 
ten ? Why were not they saved, and you lost ? Why 
ware you singled out? Is it bettfer to be here or 
there V And then I pointed to the sea. All evils 
are to be considered with the good that is in them, f 
and with what worse attends them. ■ 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was 
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have 
been my case if it had not happened (which was a 
hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from 
the place where she first struck, and was driven so 
near to the shore, that I had time to get all these 
things out of her : what would have been my case, 
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which 
I at first came on shore, without necessaries of life, 
or necessaries to supply and procure them ? << Par- 
ticularly," said I aloud (though to myself,) " what 
should I have done without a gun, without ammu* 
nition, without any tools to make any thing, or to 
work witli, without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any 
manner of covering ?" and that now I had all thes^ 
to a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to 
provide myself in such a manner as to live without 
my gun, when my ammunition was spent: so that 
I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any 
want, as long as I lived ; for I considered, from the 
beginning, how I should provide for the accidents 
that mi^t happen, and fpr the time that was td 



08 tlFE AND ADVENTURES 

liome, not only after my ammunition should be 
spent, but even after my health or strength should 
4ecay. 

I confess, I had not entertedned any notion of my 
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my 
powder being blown up by lightning ; and this made 
the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it light- 
<ened and thundered, as I observed just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation 
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never 
heard of in the world before, I shall take it from its 
beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by 
my account, the dOth September, when, in the man- 
ner as above said, I first set foot on this horrid island ; 
when the sun being to us in its autumnal equinox, 
was almost just over my head : for I reckoned myself, 
by observation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 
minutes north of the Line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, 
it came into my thoughts that I should lose my reck- 
oning of time for want of books, and pen and ink, 
and should even forget the Sabbath days from the 
working days: but, to prevent this, I cut it with my 
knife on a large post, in capital letters : and mak- 
ing it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where 
I -first landed, viz. '* I came on shore here on the 
dOth of September, 1659.'\ On the sides of this 
fiqiiare post I cut every day a notch with my knife, 
and every seventh notch was as long again as the 
rest, and every first day of the month as long again as 
that long one : and thus I kept my calendar, or 
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time. 

But it happened, that among the many things which 
J brought out of the ship, in the several voyages 
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several 
things of less value, but not at all less useful to me, 
which I found, some time after, in rummaging the 
chests ; 9a, in particular, pens, ink, and paper ; ,8ey«? 



DP KOBINSON CftUSOti^ 60" 

ml pto^els in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and car^ 
peotor's keeping ; three or four compasses, some ma* 
thematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, 
and books of navigation ; all which I huddled toge* 
liier, whether I might want them or no : also I found 
three very good bibles, which came to me in my cargo 
from England, and which I had packed up among my 
things ; some Portuguese books also, and'^ among 
them, two or three popish prayer books, and several 
otilier books, all which I carefully secured. And I 
must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and 
two cats, of whose eminent history I may have oc* 
easton to say something in its place : for I carried 
Doth the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he jumped 
out of the ship himself, and swam on shore to me the 
day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and 
was a trusty servant to me for many years : I wanted 
nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that 
he could make up to me ; I only wanted to have him^ 
talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed 
before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I hus^v 
banded them to the utmost ; and I shall show that 
Tiiiile my ink lasted, I kept things very e^act^ but 
after that was gone I could not ; for I could not makd 
any ink, by any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, 
ttotwithstanding all that I had amassed together; 
and' of these, this of ink was one ; as also a spade, 
|Mck-axe» and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; 
seedles, pins, and thread : as for linen, I soon learned* 
to want t^at without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on 
heavily ; and it was near a whole year before I had 
^lUrely finished my little pale^ or surrounded my habi-* 
tation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy atf 
I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre<* 

C'ng in the woods, and more, by far, in bringing 
le ; BO that I spent Bometimes two days ib cattiag

UPE AND ADVBNTtJRES 



and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day 
in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose I got 
1^ hfeavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought 
myself of one of the iron crows; which, however, though 
J found it, yet it made driving these posts or piles very 
laborious and tedious work. Biit what need I have 
been concerned at the tediousness of any thing I had 
to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in ? nor had I 
any other employment, if that had been over, at least 
that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to 
seek for food ; which I did, more or less, every day. 
I now began to consider seriously my condition, 
and the circumstance I was reduced to ; and I drew 
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to 
leave them to any that were to come after me, (for I 
was like to have but few heirs,) as to deliver my 
thoughts from daily poring on them, and afilicting 
my mind ; and as my reason began now to master my 
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I 
could, and to set the good against the evil, that I 
might have something to distinguish my case from 
worse ; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and 
creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries 
I suffered, thus : 



£rxL. 

I am i^tst on a horrible, 
desolate island, void of all 
hope of recovery. 

1 am singled out and sepa- 
l^tad, as it were, from all the 
world, to be miserable. 



I am divided from mankind, 
a solitaire j one banished from 
human society. 

. I have no clothes to cover 
me. 

J am without any defence. 



Good. 

But I am alive ; and not 
drowned, as all my ship's com- 
pany were. 

But I am singled out too 
from all the ship's crew, to be 
spared from death ; and he 
that miraculously saved me 
firom death, can deliver me 
from this condition. 

But I am not starved, and 
perishing in a barren place, 
affording no sustenance. 

But I am in a hot climate, 
where, if I had clothes, I could 
hardly wear them. 

But I am cast on ts^ iiUiid

•r nteftaa to resist any yioUnce where I see no wild beast t9

of Africa : and what if I had

Or reheye me. the ship in near enough to the 

shore, that I have got out se 
many necessary things as will 
either supply my wants, or eur 
able me to supply myself, eren 
as long as I live. 

On the whole, here was an undoubted testi* 
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the 
world ^ miserable, but there was something nega- 
tive, or something positive, to be thankful for in it : 
and let this stand as a direction, from the experi- 
ence of the most miserable of all conditions in this 
world, that we may always find in it something to 
comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description 
of good and evil, on the credit side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish 
my condition, and giving over looking out to sea, to 
see if I could spy a ship ; I say, giving over these 
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my 
way of living, and to make things as easy to me as I 
could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was 
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a 
strong pale of posts and cables; but I might now 
rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall 
against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the out- 
side : and after some time (I think it was a year and 
a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, 
and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and 
such things as I could get, to keep out the rain ; 
which I found, at some times of the yeeur, very vio* 
Ient« 

I have already observed how I brought all my 
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had 
ma4e behind me. But I must observe too, that at 



?2 LIF& AND ADVENTURES 

first tliis tras a confased heap of goods, which» tei 
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place ; 
I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself to 
enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earthy 
for it was a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily 
to the labor I bestowed on it : and when I found I 
was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked 
sideways, to the right hand, into the rock, and then 
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and 
made me a door to come out in the outside of my 
pale or fortification. 

-This gave me not only egress and regress, as it 
Wer6, a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse, 
but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such 
necessary things as 1 found I most wanted, particu^ 
larly a chair and a table; for without these I watf 
not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the 
World ; I could not write, or eat, or do several 
things with so much pleasure, without a table : so 
I went to work. And here I must needs observe, 
that as reason is the substance and orio'inal of the 
mathematics, so by stating and squaring every thing 
by reason, and by making the most rational judg- 
ment of things, every man may be, in tim^, master 
of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool 
in my life ; and yet, in time, by labor, application, 
and contrivance, i found, at last, that I wanted no* 
thing but I could have made it, especially if I had 
had tools. However, I made abundance of things^ 
even without tools ; and some with no more tools 
than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were 
never made that way before, and that with infinite 
labors For example, if I wanted a board, I had 
no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an 
edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with 
my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank^ 
and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi« 7& 

by this method I could make but one board of a 
whole tree ; but this I had no remedy for but pa« 
tience^ any more than I had for a prodigious deal qt 
time and labor which it took me up to make a plank 
or board t but my time or labor was little worthy and 
so it was as well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I olw 
served above, in the first place; and this I did out 
of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my 
raft from the ship. But when I had wrought out some 
boards, as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth 
of ar foot and a half, one over another, all along one 
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-* 
work on ; and, in a word, to separate every thing at 
large in their places, that I might easily come at them« 
I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang 
my guns, and all things that would hang up : so that 
had my cave been seen, it looked like a general ma- 
gazine of all necessary things ; and I had every thing 
so ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure tx> 
me to see all my goods in such order, and especially 
to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 
- And now it was that I began to keep a journal of 
every day's employment ; for, indeed, at first, I waa 
in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to labour^ 
but ia much discomposure of mind; and my journal 
would, too, have been full of many dull things : for 
example, I must have said thus — '* Sept* 30th. After 
I had got to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead 
of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having^ 
first vomited, with the great quantity of salt water 
which was gotten into my stomach, and recovering 
myself a little, I ran about the shore^ wringing my 
hands, and beating my head and face^ exclaiming at 
my misery, and crying out, ' I was undone, undone 1* 
tiliy tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the 
groiud.to repose; but durst not sleep, for fear of 
beiBg devoured." 



74 . UFE AND ADVENTURES 

Some days after this, and after I had been on 
board the ship, and got all that I could out of her^ 
I could not forbear getting up to the top of a little 
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing 
a ship : then fancy that, at a vast distance, I spied 
a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and, after 
looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, 
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase 
my misery by my folly. 

But, having gotten over these things in some mea- 
sure, and having settled my household-stuff and habi- 
tation, made me a table and a chair, and all as 
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my 
journal : of which I shall here give you the copy 
(though in it will be told all these particulars over 
again) as long as it lasted ; for, having no more ink» 
I was forced to leave it off. 



THE JOURNAL. 

September 30th, 1669. I, poor miserable Robin- 
son Crusoe, being shipwrecked, during a dreadful 
storm, in the offing, came on shore on this dbmal 
unfortunate island, which I called the Island of 
Despair ; all the rest of the ship's company being 
drowned, and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting my* 
self at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, 
viz. I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, nor 
place to fly to : and, in despair of any relief, saw 
nothing but death before me ; that I should either 
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, 
6r starved to death for want of food. At the ap- 
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild 
creatures; bu^ slept soundly, though it rained all 
night. 



OF ROBINSOf^ CRUSOE. 7^ 

Oetober 1. In tbe morning I saw, to my great 
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and 
was driven on shore again much nearer the island; 
wiikh, as it was soAi6 comfort on one hand (for see* 
ing her sit upright, and not broken in pieces, I 
hmed, if the wind abated, I might get on board, 
ana get some food and necessaries out of her for my 
relief,) so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at 
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we 
had all staid on board, might have saved the ship, or 
at least that they would not have been all drowned, 
as they were ; and that, had the men been saved, we 
might perhaps have built us a boat, out of the ruins of 
tbe i^ip, to have carried us to some other part of the 
world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing 
myself on these things; but, at length, seeing the 
ship almost dry, I went on the sand as near as I 
could, and then swam on board. This day also it 
continued raining, though with no wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these dayii 
entirely spent in many several voyages to get all I 
could out of the ship; which I brought on shore,- 
every tide of flood, on rafts. Much rain also in 
these days, though with some intervals of foir wea* 
tiier : but, it seems, this was the rainy season. 

Oet^ 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I 
had got on it; but being in shoal water, and the 
things being chiefly heavy, I recov^ed many of them 
when the tide was out. 

Oc#. «25. It ra'med all night and all day, with aomB 
gusts of wind ; during which time the ship broke in 
pieoes (the wind blowing a little harder than before) 
waA was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her^ 
and that only at low water. I spent this day in con 
Tering and securing the goods which I had saved, that 
tUte rain might not spoil them. 
. Oct. 26. I walked about the shore JEtlmost al}

day, to find out a place to fix my habitation ; greatly 
concerned to secure myself from any attack in the 
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night 
I fixed on a proper place, under a rock, and marked 
out a semicircle for my encampment; which I re^ 
aolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifica'* 
tion, made of double piles, lined within with cablesi 
and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in 
harrying all my goods to my new habitation, though 
some part of the time it rained exceedingly hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into thd 
island with my gun, to see for some food, and disco* 
▼er the country ; when I killed a she-goat, and her 
kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also^ 
because it would not feed. 

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, i^d 
lay there for the first night; making it as large as 
I could, with stakes driven in to swing my ham- 
mock on. 

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and 
the pieces of timber which made my rafts ; and with 
them formed a fence round me, a little within the 
place I had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two 
fowls like ducks, which were very good food* In the 
afternoon 1 went to work to make me a table, 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my timed 
of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and 
time of diversion ; viz. every morning I walked out 
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not 
rain ; then employed myself to work till about eleven 
o^clock ; then ate what I had to live on ; and from 
twelve to two 1 lay down to sleep, the weather being 
excessive hot ; and then in the evening to work again. 
The working part of this day and the next was wholly 
employed in making my tabid, for I was yet but a 



OF KOBINSON CRUSOB, 77 

iftrjr sorry workman : though time and necessity made 
me a complete natural mechanic soon after^ as I be* 
fieTe they would any one else. 

Nov, 5. This day went abroad with my gun and 
dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but 
her fiesh good for nothing : of every creati|re that I 
killed I took off the skins, and preserved them. Com* 
ing back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowl 
which I did not understand ; but was surprised, and 
almost frightened, with two or three seals; whicbi 
while I was gazing at them (not well knowing what 
they were) got into the sea, and escaped me for that 
time. 

Nov, 6. After my morning walk, I went to work 
with my table again, and finished it, though not to 
my liking: nor was it long before I learned to 
mend it. 

Nov, 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather* 
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 
11th was Sunday, accqjrding to my reckoning) I took 
wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado» 
brou^t it to a tolerable shape, but never to please 
me ; and, even in the making, I pulled it in pieces 
several times. 

Note. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays ; for, 
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which 
was which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained ; which refreshed 
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth : but it was ac-* 
companied with terrible thunder and lightning, which 
frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder# As 
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock 
of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that 
it might not be in danger. 

Nov, 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in mak«^ 
ing little square chests or boxes, which might hold 
fibout a pound, or two pounds at most, of powder ; 
find so, putting the powaer in> I stowed it in places

las secure and as remote from one another as possibler. 
On one of these three days I killed a large bird that 
was good to eat ; but I knew not what to call it. 

Pl0p, 17. This day I began to dig behind my 
tent; into the rock, to make room for my farther con- 
venience. 

N^te. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this 
work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-barrow, 
or basket ; so I desisted from my work, and began to 
consider how to supply these waAts, and make me 
8<Hne tools. As for a pick-axe, I made use of the 
iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy : 
but the next thing was a shovel or spade ; this was se 
absolutely necessary, that, indeed, 1 could do notliing 
effectually without it ; but what kind of one to make 
I knew not. 

Nov, 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I 
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the 
Brazils, they call the iron tree, from its exceeding 
hardness : of this, with great labor, and almost spoil- 
ing my axe, I cut a piece; and brought it home, 
too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. 
The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having 
no other way, made me a long while on this ma- 
chine ; for I worked it effectually, by little and little, 
into the form of a shovel or spade ; the handle exactly 
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part 
having no iron shod on it at bottom, it would not 
last me so long : however, it served well enough for 
the uses which I had occasion to put it to ; but never 
was a shovel, I believe, made after that feu»hion, or so 
long a-making. 

I was still deficient : for I wanted a basket, or a 
wheel-barrow. A basket I could not make by any 
means, having no such things as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker^ware ; at least none yet found 
out : and as to the wheel-barrow, I fancied I could 
make all but the wheel, but that 1 had no notion of; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 70 

Beilher did I know how to go about it : besides, I had 
no possible way to make iron gudgeons for the s|Mn^ 
die or axis of the wheel to run in ; so I gave it over : 
and, for carrying away the earth which I dug but oiP 
the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the la- 
borers carry mortar in for the bricklayers. This was 
not so difficult to me as the making the shovel : and 
yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made 
in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took me up no less 
than four days ; I mean, always excepting my morn- 
ing walk with my gun, which I seldom omitted, and 
very seldom failed also bringing home something fit 
to eat. 

Nov, 23. My other work having now stood still, 
because of my making these tools, when they were 
finished I went on ; and working every day, as my 
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it 
might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note. During all this time I worked to make this 
room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me 
as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, 
and a cellar. As for a lodging, I kept to the tent ; 
except that sometimes, iu the wet season of the year, 
it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry t 
which qoused me afterwards to cover all lay plioe 
within fly pale with long poles, in the form of raf« 
t^s, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags 
and large leaves of trees, like a thatch. 

December 10. I began now to think my cave or 
vault finished ; when on a sudden (it seems I had 
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down 
from the top and on one side : so much, that, in short, 
it frightened me, and not without reason too ; for if I 
had been under it, I should never have wanted a grave- 
digger. On this disaster, I had a great deal of work 
to do over again, for I had the loose earth to carry 
out; andy which was of more importance/ 1 had the 



aO UFB AND ADVENTURES 

ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more 
would come down. 

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accord* 
ingly ; and got two shores or posts pitched upright to 
the top» with two pieces of board across over each 
post; this I finished the next day ; and setting more 
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the 
loof secured ; and the posts, standing in rows, served 
jne for partitions to part off my house. 

Dec* 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed 
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang 
every thing up that could be hung up ; and now I 
began to be in some order within doors. 

Dec* 20. I carried every thing into the cave, and 
began to furnish ^my house, and set up some pieces of 
boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals on ; but 
boards began to be very scarce with me : also I made 
me another table. 

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day: no 
Ulirring out. 

Dec. 25. Kain all day. 

Dec* 26. No rain ; and the earth much cooler thaa 
before, and pleasanter, 

Dec* 27. Killed a young goat ; and lamed an«i 
other, so that I catched it, and led it home in a string: 
when I had it home, I bound and splintejgd up its 
leg, which was broke. 'W 

N. B*, I took such care of it that it lived ; and 
the leg grew well, and as strong as ever': but, by 
nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed on the 
little green at my door, and would not go away. 
This was the first time that I entertained a thought of 
breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have 
food when my powder and shot was all spent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze ; 
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the 
evening, fof^food : this time I spent in putting all my 
things in order within doors* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 81 

^JMuary 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad 
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the mid- 
dle of the day. This evening, going farther into the 
valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I 
founa there was plenty of goats, though exceeding 
shy, and hard to come at ; however, I resolved to try 
if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down. Ac- 
cordingly, the next day 1 went out with my dog, 
and set him on the goats : but I was mistaken, 
for they all faced about on the dog ; and he knew 
his danger too well, for he would not come near 
them. 

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which, being 
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I re- 
solved to make very thick and strong. 

iV. J5. This wall being described before, I pur- 
posely omit what was said in the Journal : it is suffi- 
cient to observe, that I was no less time than from 
the 3rd of January to the 14th of April, working, 
finishing, and perfecting this wall ; though it was no 
more than about 25 yards in length, being a half- 
circle from one place in the rock to another pliace 
about twelve yards from it, the door of the cave being 
in the centre behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard ; the rains hin^ 
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together : 
but I tl4|ight I should never be perfectly secure till 
this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible what 
inexpressible labor every thing was done with, espe- 
cially the bringing piles out of the woods, and driving 
them into th6 ground ; for I made them much bigger 
than I needed to have done. 

When this wall was finished,, and the outside 
double-fenced with a turf- wall raised up close to itj 
I persuaded myself that if any. people were to come 
on shore there they would not perceive any thing 
like a habitation : and it was very well I did so, as 
VOL. I. • F 



82 LIFE AMD ADVENTURES 

nmy to obseired hereafter^ on a very remariutble 
occasion. . 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods 
for game every day, when the rain permitted me» and 
made frequent discoveries, in these walks, of some- 
thing or other to my advantage ; particularly, I found 
a kind of wild pigeons, who build, not as wood- 
pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in th^ 
ooles of the rocks : and taking some young ones, I 
endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; 
but when they grew older, they flew away ; which, 

rrhaps, was at first for want of feeding them, for 
had nothing to give them : however, I frequently 
found their nests, and got their young ones, which 
were very good meat. And now, in the managing 
my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many 
things, which I thought at first it was impossible for 
me to make ; as indeed, as to some of them, it was : 
for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped. 
I had a small runlet or two; as I observed before ; 
but I could never arrive to the capacity of making 
one by them, though I spent many weeks about it : 
I could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves 
so true to one another as to make them hold water ; 
so I gave that also over. In the next place, I was at 
a* great loss for candle ; so that as soon as it was dark, 
which was generally by seven o'clock, I wAi obliged 
to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-wax 
with which I made candles in my African adventure ; 
but I had none of that now ; the only remedy I had 
was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved the 
tallow ; and with a little dish made of clay, which I 
baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some 
oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me light, 
though not a clear steady light like a candle. In the 
middle of all my labors it happened, that in rum- 
maging my things, I found a little bag ; which, as I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSO g- 

Uated before, had been filled with < '^ 'ts 

log oi poultry ; not for this voyag* ,^ ^ * 

I suppose, when the ship came fro; ^ • o ^ 

lifcde remainder of com had been 
all devoured with the rats, and I s 
bag but husks and dust ; and beii 
the bag for some other use (I thiil 
powder in, when I divided it for fear of tft^lighl^ 
Ding, or some such use,) I shook the husks of corn 
cmt of it, on one side of my fortification, under the 
rook. -f 

• It was a little before the gre&^jfttin just now men* 
tioned, that I threw this stuff away ; taking no notice 
ef any thing, and not so much as remembering that I 
had thrown any thing there : when about a month 
after, I saw some few stalks of something green 
shooting out of the ground, which I fancied might be 
some plant I had not seen ; but I was surprised, and 
perfectly astonished, when after a little longer time 
I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were 
perfect green barley of the same kind as our European, 
nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and 
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion : I had 
hitherto acted on no religious foundation at all ; 
indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my 
head, n<!^ had entertained any sense of any thing 
that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, 
as we lightly say, what pleases God ; without so 
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these 
things, or his order in governing events in the world. 
But -after I saw barley grow thejre, in a climate 
which I knew was not proper for corn, and espe- 
cially as I knew not how it came there, it startled me 
strangely ; and I began to suggest that God had mi- 
raculously caused this grain to grow without any help 
of seed sown, and that it was so directed purely for 
my sustenance on that wild miserable place. 




LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

m touched my heart a little, and brought tears 
of my eyes ; and I began to bless myself tjiat 
a prodigy of nature should happen on my ac« 
count : and this was the more strange to me, because 
I saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock, 
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks 
of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow 
in Africa, when I was ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of 
Providence for my support, but, not doubting that 
there was more in the place, I went over all. that 
part of the island where I had been before, search- 
ing in every corner, and under every rock, for more 
of it ; but I could not find any. At last it oc- 
curred to my thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of 
chickens'-meat in that place, and then the wonder 
began to ceeise : and I must confess, my religious 
thankfulness to God's providence began to abate too, 
on the discovering that all this was nothing but 
what was common ; though I ought to have been as 
thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence, 
as if it had been miraculous : for it was really the 
work of Providence, as to me, that should order or 
appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should re- 
main unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the 
rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven ; as also, 
that I should throw it out in that particular place, 
where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang 
up immediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it any 
where else at that time, it would have been burnt up 
and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may 
/be sure, in their season, which was about the end 
of June ; and laying up every corn, I resolved to 
sow them all again ; hoping, in time, to have some 
quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But it 
was. not till the fourth year that I could allow my- 
self the least giain of this corn to eat, and even then 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

but sparingly, as I shall show afterwards in its 
order; for I lost all that I sowed the first season, 
by not observing the proper time ; as I sowed just 
before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, 
at least not as it would have done ; of which in its 
place. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty 
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the 
same care ; and whose use was of the same kind, or 
to the same purpose, viz. to make me bread, or rather 
food ; for I found ways to cook it up without baking, 
though I did that also after some time. — But to return 
to my Journal. 

I worked excessively . hard these three or four 
motiths, to get my wall done ; and the 14th of April ' 
I closed it up ; contriving to get into' it, not by a 
door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there might 
be no sign on the outside of my habitation. 

April 16. I finished the ladder ; so I went up 
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up 
after me, and let it down in the inside : this was a 
complete enclosure to me ; ' for within I had room 
enough, and nothing could come at me from without, 
unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I 
had almost all my labor overthrown at once, and 
myself killed ; the case was thus : — As I was busy 
in the inside of it, behind my tent, just at the en- 
trance into my cave, I was terribly frightened with 
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for all on 
a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down 
from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the 
hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set 
up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was 
heartily scared ; but thought nothing of what really 
Was the cause, only thinking that the top of my 
cave was falling in, as some of it had done before : 
and for fear I should be buried inat, I ran forward 



66 LIFE AND ADVEMTX7RB8 

to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe theh^ 
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of 
the hill which I expected might roll down on me. 
I had no sooner stepped down on the firm ground, 
than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; for 
the ground I stood on shook three times at about 
eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as 
would have overturned the strongest building thst 
could be supposed to hare stood on the earth; and 
a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about 
half a mile frbm me, next thp sea, fell down, with 
such a terrible noise as I nerer heard in all my life« 
I perceived also that the very sea was put into yW' 
lent motion by it ; and I believe the shocks were 
stronger under the water than on the island. 

I was so much amazed with the thing itself (having 
never felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that 
had) that I was like one dead or stupified ; and the 
motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one 
that was tossed at sea : but the noise of the falling of 
the rock awaked me, as it were ; and rousing me from 
the stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, 
and I thought of nothing but the hill falling on my 
tent and my household goods, and burying all iU 
tmce : this sunk my very soul within me a second 
time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no mote 
for some time, I began to take courage ; jet I imd 
not heart enough to go over my wall again, for fear 
of being buried altve, but sat still on the ground 
greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing 
what to do. All this while I had not the least 
serious religious thought; nothing but the commoii 
'Lord have mercy on me I and when it was over, that 
went away too. * 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and 
grow cloudy, as if it would rain ; and soon after the 
wind rose by little and little^ so that in less than half 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 87 

aa hour it blew a most dreadful hurri<^ane : the sea 
was all on a sudden covered with foam and froth ; 
the shore was covered with the breach of the water ; 
the trees were torn up by the roots ; and a terrible 
storm it was. This held about three hours, and then 
begi^n to abate ; and in two hours more it was quite 
calm^ and began to rain very hard. All this while I 
fliat on the groiind, very much terrified and dejected ; 
when pn a sudden it came into my thoughts that 
th^se winds and rain being the consequence of the 
earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over, 
and X might venture into my cave again. With this 
thought my spirits began to revive ; and the rain also 
helping to persuade me, I went in, and sat down in 
my tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent 
was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was 
forced to get into my cave, though very much afraid 
and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. This 
vioient rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut a 
hol^ through my new fortification, like a sink, to let 
the water go out, which would else have drowned my 
«ave. After I had been in my cave for some time, 
mid found no more shocks of the earthquake follow^ I 
began to be more composed. And now to support my 
spirits; which indeed wanted it very much, 1 went to 
my little store, and took a small sup of rum ; ^hich, 
however, I did then, and always, very sparingly, 
Ipiowing I could have no more when thatwas gone. 

It continued raining all that night, and great part of 
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad : but my 
miiid beiag more composed. I began to think of whiU 
J. had best do ; concluding, that if the island was sub-> 
ject \Q these earthquakes^ there would be no living for 
nifi in a cave, but I must consider of building me: 
some little hut in an open place, which 1 might sur* 
round with a wall, as I had done here, and so make 
myself secure from wild bqasts or men : for if I staid 



88 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, he 
buried alive. 

. With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent 
from the place where it now stood, being just under 
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it 
should be shaken again, would certainly fall on my 
tent. I spent the two next days, being the i9ih and 
20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove 
my habitation. The fear of being swallowed alive 
aftected me so, that I never slept in quiet ; and yet 
the apprehension of lying abroad, without any fence,' 
was almost equal to it : but still, when I lookea about, 
and saw how every thing was put in order, how plea* 
santly I was concealed, and how safe from danger, it 
made me very loth to remove. In the mean time, it oc- 
curred to me that it would require a vast deal of time 
for me to do this ; and that I must be contented to 
run the risk where I was, till I had formed a conve- 
nient camp, and secured it so as to remove to it. With 
this resolution I composed myself for a time ; and 
resolved that I would go to work vnth all speed to 
build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a 
circle as before, and set up my tent in it when it was 
finished ; but that I would venture to stay where I 
was till it was ready, and fit to remove to. This was 
the 21st. 

April 22. The next morning I began to consider 
of means to put this measure into execution ; but I 
was at a great loss about the tools. I had three large 
axes, and abundance of hatchets, (for we carried the 
hatchets for traffic with the Indians;) but with much 
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all 
full of notches, and dull : and though I had a grind-^. 
stone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. 
This cost me as much thought as a statesman would 
have bestowed on a grand point of politics, or a judge 
on the life and death of a man. At length I con* 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfir 89 

tiived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my Ibot^ 
that I might have both' my hands at liberty. 

Note, I had never seen any such thing in England, 
or at least not to take notice how it was done, though 
since I have observed it is very common there : be- 
sides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. 
This machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to 
perfection. 

April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in 
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grind- 
stone performing very well. 

April ZO. Having perceived that my bread had 
been low a great while, I now took a survey of it, 
and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which 
made my heart very heavy. 

Ma^ 1. In the morning, looking toward the sea- 
side, Uie tide being low, I saw something lie on the 
shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask : 
when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or 
three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were 
driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and looking 
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie 
higher out of the water than it used to do. I ex- 
amined the barrel that was driven on shore, and 
soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder ; but it 
had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard 
as a stone : however, I rolled it farther on the shore 
for the present^ and went on upon the sands, as 
near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for 
more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely 
removed. The forecastle, which lay before buried in 
sand, was heaved up at least six feet : and the ^m 
(which was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest 
by the force of the sea, soon after* I had left rummag- 
ing her) was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one 
side ; and thi^sand was thrown so high on that side 
Best her stern, that I could. now walk quite up to her 



80 UV% AND ADVENTURES 

when the tide was out; whereas there was a great 
piece of water before, so that I could not come within 
a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming. I 
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded 
it must oe done by the earthquake ; and as by this 
violence the ship was more broke open than formerly, 
sp many things came daily on shore, which the sea 
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled 
by degrees to the, land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design 
of removing my habitation ; and I busied myself 
inightily, that day especially, in searching whether I 
could make any way into the ship : but I found no* 
thing was to be expected of that kind, for all the 
inside of the ship was choked up with sand. How* 
ever, as I had learned not to despair of any thing, I 
resolved to pull every thing to pieces that 1 could of 
the ship, concluding that every thing I could get from 
her would be of some use or other to me. 
: Majf 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of 
e beam through, which I thought held some of the 
upper part or quarter deck togeUier ; and when I had 
cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I 
could from the side which lay highest ; but the tide 
coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time* 

May 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish 
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport ; 
when, just going to leave off, I caught a young dol- 
phin. I had made me a long line of some rope-*yani» 
out I had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught fM) 
enough, as much as I cared to eat ; all which I dried 
in the sun, and ate them dry. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck : cut another beam 
asunder, and brought three great fir-planks off from 
the decks ; which I tied together, and made swim on 
shore when the tide of flood came on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck ; got several iron 
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron- work ; worked 



OF ROBINSON CRU SOB. 91 

frenr hard, and came home very much tired, and 
had thoughts of giving it over. 

' May 7. Went to the wreck again, hut not with an 
inlrat to work : but found the weight of the wreck had 
broke itself down, the beams being cut ; that several 
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose ; and the inside 
of the hold lay so open that I could see into it ; but 
almost full of water and sand. 

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron 
evow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite 
clear of the water and sand. I wrenched up two 

?lanks, and brought them on shore also with the tidew 
left the iron crow in the wreck for next day. 
, May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow 
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several 
casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could 
not break them up. I felt also the roll of English lead» 
and could stir it ; but it was too heavy to remove. 

May 10 — 14. Went every day to the wreck ; and 
got a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or 
-plank, and two or three hundred weight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could 

not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by phcing the edge 

of 4>ne hatchet, and driving it with the other ; but as it 

lay dbout a foot and a half in the water, I could not 

. jMtke any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the 
^rreck appeared more broken by ^e force of the 
water ; but I staid so long in the woods to get pi* 
geons . for food, that the tide prevented my going to 
the wreck that day. 

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on 
shcM'e at a great distance, two miles off me, but re« 
•olved to see what they were, and. found it was a 
piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring 
away. 

May 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the 
w^ick ; and with hard labor I loosened some things 



92 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

SO much with the crow, that the first hlowing tide 
several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's 
chests : hut the wind hlowing from the shore, nothing 
came to land that day hut pieces of timber, and a 
hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it ; but the 
salt-water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued 
this work every day to. the 15th of June, except the 
time necessary to get food ; which I always appointed, 
during this p^rt of my employment, to be when the 
tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed 
out; and by this time I had gotten timber, and plank, 
and iron-work, enough to have built a good boat, if I 
had know^n how : and I also got, at several times, and 
in several pieces, near one hundred weight of the 
sheet-lead. 

June 16. Going down to the sea -side, I found a 
large tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen ; 
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any de* 
feet of the place, or scarcity : for had I happened to 
be on the other side of the island, I might nave had 
hundreds of them every day,- as I found afterwards ; 
but pei:haps had paid dear enough for them. 

June 17. f spent in cooking the turtle. I found in 
her threescore eggs ; and her flesh was to me, at that 
time, the most savoury and pleasant that I ever tasted 
in my life ; haying haa no flesh, but of goats and fowls, 
since I landed in' this horrid place. 

June 18. Rained all day, and I staid within. I 
thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, aiid I was 
somewhat chilly ; which I knew was not usual in that 
latitude. 

. Jtf fijsJO. Very- ill, and shivering, as if the weather 
had been cold. 

June 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my 
head, and feverish. 

June 21. Very ill ; frightened almost to death with 
the apprehensions of my sad condition,, to be sick, and 
no .help : prayed to God for the first time since the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

storm off Hull ; but scarce knew what I said, or why, 
my thoughts being all confused. 

June 22. A little better ; but under dreadful ap« 
prehensions of sickness. 

June 23.. Very bad again ; cold and shivering, and 
then a violent head-ache. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague very violent : the fit held me 
seven hours ; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats af-> 
ter it. 

June 26. Better ; and having no victuals to eat, 
took my gun, but found myself very weak : however 
I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it 
home, and broiled some of it, and ate; I would 
fain have stewed! it^ and made some broth, but had 
no pot. 

June 27. The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed 
all day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready to 
perish with thirst ; but so weak, I had not strength 
to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. 
Prayed to God again, . but was light-headed : and 
when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not 
what to say ; I only lay and cried, ** Lord, look on 
me ! Lord, pity me ! Lord, have mercy on me !" 
I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours ; 
till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake 
till far in the night. When I awoke, I found myself 
much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty : 
however, as I had no water in my whole habitation* 
I was forced to lie till morning and went to sleep 
again.. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream : 
I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the out- 
side of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after 
the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend frona a 
great black cloud, in a bright fiame of fire, and alight 
on the ground : he was all over as bright as a flame, 
so that I could but just bear to look towards him : his 
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impos- 



./■ 



94 UFB AND ADVENTURES 

sible for words to describe : when he stepped on iki^ 
ground with his feet, I lliought the earth trenibM* 
just as it had done before in the earthquake ; and all 
the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been 
filled with dairies of fire. He had no sooner landed 
on the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with 
a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and 
when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, be 
spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible that it is 
impossible to express the terror of it : all that I c^ 
say I understood, was this : '< Seeing all these things 
have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt 
die ;" at which words I thought he lifted up the spear 
that was in his hand, to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account, will ex- 
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of 
my soul at this terrible vision ; I mean, that even 
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor- 
rors ; nor is it any more possible to describe the im* 
pression that remdned on my mind when I awaked, 
and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas I no divine knowledge : what I had re<^ 
ceived by tha.good instruction of my father was then 
iVorn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years, 
of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation 
with none but such as were, like myself, wicked and 
profane to the last degree. I do not remember that I 
had, in all that time, one thought that so much as 
tended either to looking upward towards God, or in- 
ward towards a reflection on my owir ways : but a 
certain stupidity of soul, without desire of good, or 
consciousness of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me ; 
and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, 
wicked creature among our common sailors, can be 
supposed to be ; not having the least sense, either of 
the fear of God in danger^ or of thankfulness to him * 
in deliverances. 

In the relation of what is already past of my story, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 0& 

will be the more easily believed, when I shall 
fudd, that through all the variety of miseries that had 
to l^is day brfallen me, I never had so much as one 
thought of its being the hand of Ood^ or that it 
wa» a just punishment for my sin, my rebellious be- 
haviour against my father, or my present sins, which 
were great ; or even as a punishment for the general 
course of my wicked life. When I was on the des« 
perate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I 
never had so much as one thought of what would be*> 
oome of me ; or one wish to God to direct me whither 
I should go, or to keep me from the danger which ap» 
parently surrounded me, as well from voracious crea- 
tures as cruel savages; but I was quite thoughtless of 
a Grod or a Providence ; acted like a mere brute, 
from the principles of nature, and by the dictates of 
common sense only ; and indeed hardly that. When 
I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portu- 
guese captain, well used, and dealt with justly and 
honorably, as well as charitably, I had not the least 
thankfulness in my thoughts. 'When^ agam, I was 
shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning, on 
this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it 
as a judgment : I only said to myself often, that I 
was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always mise- 
rable. 

It is true, when I first got on shore' here, and found 
all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was 
surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of 
soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have 
come up to true thankfulness ; but it ended where it 
began, in a mere common flight of joy ; or, as I may 
say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflec- 
tion on the distinguished goodness of the band which 
had preserved me, and bad singled me out to be pre- 
served when all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry 
why Providence had been thus merciful to me : just 
the same common sort of joy which seamen generally 



^ UFB AND ADVENTURES 

0<fcvi^» nfter they have got safe ashore from a ship- 
wwH>k. which they drown all in the next bowl of 
|uinch» and forget almost as soon as it is over : and all 
tht> rest of my life was like it. Even when I was 

IS^*^^' ^n due consideration, made sensible of my 
condiUon, — how I was ^ast on this dreadful place, out 
w the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, 
<* prospect of redemption, — as soon as I saw but a 
prospect of living, and that I should not starve and 
perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore 
on» and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the 
works proper for my preservation and supply, and was 
far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a 
judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against 
me : these were thoughts which very seldom entered 
into my head. 

The growing of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, 
had at first some little influence on me, and began to 
affect me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had 
something miraculous in it; but as soon as that part of 
the thought was removed, all the impression which 
was raised from it wore off also, as I have noted al- 
ready. Even the earthquake, though nothing could 
be more terrible in its nature, or more immediately 
directing to the invisible Power which alone directs 
such things, yet no sooner was the fright over, but the 
impression it had made went off also. I had no more 
sense of God, or his judgments, much less of the pre- 
sent affliction of my circumstances being from his 
hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous con- 
dition of life. But now, when I began to be sick, and 
a leisure view of the miseries of death came to place 
itself before me ; when my spirits began to sink under 
the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was ex- 
hausted with the violence of the fever ; conscience, 
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I re- 
proached myself with my past life, in which I had so 
evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

j^Biice of God to lay me under uncommon sti 
to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. 
Auctions oppressed me for the second or thiW 
my distemper; and in the violence, as well^ 
fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my cons 
extorted from me some words like praying to God : 
though I cannot say it was a prayer attended either 
with desires or with hopes ; it was rather the voice of 
mere fright and distress. My thoughts were confused ; 
the -convictions great on my mind ; and the horror of 
dying in such a miserable condition, raised vapours in 
my head with the mere apprehension : and in these 
hurries of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might 
express: but it was rather exclamation, such as, 
'* Lord, what a miserable creature am I ! If I should be 
sick, I shall certainly die for want of help ; and what 
will become of me ?" Then the tears burst out of my 
eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In 
this interval, the good advice of my father came to my 
mind, and presently his prediction, wnich I mentioned 
at the beginning of this story, viz. that if I did take 
this foolish step, God would not bless me ; and I 
should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having 
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to 
assist in my recovery. " Now," said I, aloud, '* my 
dear father's words are come to pass ; God's justice 
has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear ' 
me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had 
mercifully put me in a station of life wherein I might 
have been happy and easy ; but I would neither see it 
myself, nor learn from my parents to know the bles- 
sing of it. I left them to mourn over my folly ; and 
now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it : 
I refused their help and assistance, who would have 
pushed me in the world, and would have made every 
thing easy to me ; and now I have difficulties to 
struggle with, too great for even nature itself to sup- 
port; and no assistance, no comfort^ no advice.^

LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Xhen I cried out, << Lord, be my help, for I am in great 
distress !" This was the first prayer, if I may call it 
so, that I had made for many years. But I return 
to my Journal. 

June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with 
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I 
got up ; and though the fright and terror of my dream 
was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the 
ague would return again the next day, and now was 
my time to get something to refresh and support my* 
self when I should be ill. The first thing I did was 
to fill a large s(][uare case-bottle with water ; and set 
it on my table, in reach of. my bed : and to take off 
the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put 
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed 
them together. Then I got a piece of the goat's 
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very 
little. I walked about ; but was very weak, and 
withal very sad and heavy-hearted under, a sense of 
my miserable condition, dreading the return of my 
distemper the next day. At night, I made my supper 
of three of the turtle's eggs ; which I roasted in the 
ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell : and this 
was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's 
blessing to, as I could remember, in my whole life. 
After I had eaten, I tried to walk ; but found myself 
so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I 
never went out witiiout that ;) so I went but a little 
way, and sat down on the ground, looking out on the 
sea, which was just before me, and very calm and 
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these 
occurred to me : What is this earth and sea, of which 
I have seen so much ? Whence is it produced ? And 
what am I, and all the other creatures, wild and 
tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we ? Surely, 
we are all made by some secret power, who formed 
the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is that ? 
Then it followed most naturally, It is God that has 
made all. Well^ but theii it came on strangely, if 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

God has made all these things, he guides and goveros 
them all, and all things that concern them ; for the 
power that could make all things, must certainly haVe 
power to guide and direct them : if so, nothing can 
happen in the great circuit of his works, either with^ 
out his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he 
knows that I am here« and am in this dreadful condi- 
tion : and if nothing happens without his appoini- 
ment, he has appointed all this to hefall me. Nothing 
occurred to my thought, to contradict any of these 
conclusions : and therefore it rested on me with the 
greatest force, that it must needs be that God had 
appointed all this to befall me ; that I was brought to 
this miserable circumstance by his direction, he having 
the sole power, not of me only, but of every thing that 
happens in the world. Immediately it followed, Why 
has Grod done this to me ? What have I done to be 
thus used ? My conscience presently checked me in 
that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed ; and methought 
it spoke to me like a voice, '' Wretch! dost thou ^sk 
what thou hast done ? Look back on a dreadful mis- 
spent life, and ask thyself, what thpii hast not done ? 
' Ask, ^y is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed? 
Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads ; 
killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the 
Sallee man of war ; devoured by the wild beasts oh 
the coast of Africa ; or drowned here, when all the 
crew perished but thyself? Dost thou ask what thou 
hast done ?" I was struck dumb with these refled- 
tions, as one astonished, and had not a word to say; 
no, not to answer to myself; and, rising up pensive 
and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went over 
my wall, as if I had been going to bed : but my 
thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclina- 
tion to sleep ; so I sat down in the chair, and lighted 
my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now^ as the ap- 



100 UFE AND ADVENTURES 

prehension of the return of my distemper terrified mb 
very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Bra- 
zilians take no physic hut their tobacco for almost all 
distempers ; and I had a piece -of a roll of tobacco in 
one of the chests, which was quite cured ; and some 
also that was green, and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt : for in this 
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I 
opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz, 
the tobacco ; and as the few books I had saved lay 
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I men- 
tioned before, and which to this time I had not found 
leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into. I say, 
I took it out, and brought both that ietnd the tobacco 
with me to the table. TV hat use to make of the tobacco 
I knew not, as to my distemper, nor whether it was 
good for it or not; but I tried several experiments 
with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or 
other. I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it 
in my mouth ; which, indeed, at first, almost stupified 
my brain ; the tobacco being green and strong, and 
such as I had not been much used to. Then I took 
some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and 
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down : and, 
lastly, I burnt some on a pan of coals, and held my 
nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could 
bear it ; as well for the heat, as almost for suffocation. 
In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, 
and began to read ; but my head was too much dis^ 
turbed with the tobacco to b.ear reading, at least at 
that time; only, having opened the book casually, 
the first words that occurred to me were these : ** Call 
on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, 
and thou shalt glorify me." These words were very 
apt to my case ; and made some impression on my 
thoughts at the time of reading them, though not s6 
much as they did afterwards ; for, as for being ^jfe/t- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 101 

veredf the word had no sound, sis I may say, to me; 
the thing was so remote, so impossible in my appre- 
hension of things, that, as the children of Israel said 
when they were promised flesh to eat, ** Can, God 
spread a table in the wilderness ?" so I began to say, 
Can even God himself deliver me from this place ? 
And as it was not for many years that any hopes ap- 
peared, this prevailed very often on my thoughts : 
but, however, the words made a great impression on 
me» and I mused on them very often. It now grew 
late : aad the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head 
so much, that I inclined to sleep : so I left my lamp 
burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing in • 
the night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, 
I did what I never had done in all my life ; I kneeled 
down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, 
that if I called on him in the day of trouble, he would 
deliver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer 
was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the 
tobacco; which was so strong and rank of the to- 
bacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down : imme- 
diately on this I went to bed. I found presently the 
rum flew up into my head violently ; but I fell into a 
sound sleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it 
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon 
the next day : nay, to this hour I am partly of opi- 
nion, that I slept all the next day and night, and till 
almost three the day after ; for otherwise, I know not 
how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the 
days of the week, as it appeared some years after I 
had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re- 
crossing the line, I should have lost more than one 
day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and 
never knew which way. Be that, however, one way 
or the other, when I awaked I found myself exceed- 
ingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful : 
when I got up, I was stronger than I was the day 
before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; 



102 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but con-, 
tinned much altered for thie better. This was the SMi. 

The 30th was my well day, of course ; and I went 
abroad with my gun, but aid not care to travel too 
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a 
brand goose, and brought them home ; but was not 
very forward to eat them ; so I ate some more of 
the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This even- 
ing I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed 
did me good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped 
in rum ; only I did not take so much as before, nor 
did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over 
the smoke : however, I was not so well the next day, 
which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I should have 
been ; for I had a little of the cold fit, but it was not 
much. 

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; 
and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the 
quantity which I drank. 

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though 
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks 
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my 
thoughts ran exceedingly on this Scripture, ** I will 
deliver thee ;" and the impossibility of my deliver- 
ance lay much on my mind, xjk bar of my ever ex- « 
pecting it : but as I was discouraging myself with 
such ^ouffhts, it occurred to my mind that I pored 
80 much on my deliverance from the main affli^on. 
that I disregarded the deliverance I had received ; 
and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such ques- 
tions as these, viz. Have I not been delivered, and 
wonderfully too, from sickness ; from the most dis- 
tressed condition that could be, and that was so 
frightful to me ? and what notice have I taken of it ? 
Have I done my part ? God has delivered me, but 
I have not glorified him ; that is to say, I have not 
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance : 
and how can I expect a greater deliverance 7 This 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

touched my heart very much; and immediately I 
knelt down, and gave God thanks aloud for my re- 
coTery from my sickness. 

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and 
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously 
to read it; and imposed on myself to read awhile 
ey^ry morning and every night; not binding myself 
to the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts 
should engage me. It was not long after I set seri- 
ously to this work, that I found my heart more deeply 
aad sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past 
life. The impression of my dream revived ; and the 
words, ^* All these things have not brought thee to 
pepetftance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I was 
earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when 
it happened providentially, the very same day, that, 
reading the Scripture, I came to these words, *^ He 
is exalted a Prince and a Saviour; to give repent- 
ance, and to give remission." I threw down the 
book ; and yrith my heart as well as my hands lifted 

r'o heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out 
d, '' Jesus, thou Sou of David ! Jesus, thou ex- 
alted Prince and Saviour ! give me repentance!" This 
was the first time in all my life I could say, in the 
true sense of the words, that I prayed ; for now I 
prayed with a sense of my condition, and with a true 
Scripture view of hope, founded on the encourage- 
ment of the word of Grod : and from this time, I may 
say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned 
above, ^* Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a 
different sense from what I had ever done before ; for 
then I had no notion of any thing being called de^ 
liverance, but my being delivered from the captivity I 
was in : for though I was indeed at large in the place, 
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that 
m the worst sense in the worla. But now I learned 
lo take it in another sense : now I looked I 



104 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared 
so dreadful, that my soul dought nothing of God but 
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all 
my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing ; 
I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or 
think of it; it was all of no consideration, in com- 
parisoa with this. And I add this part here, to hint 
to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come 
to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance 
from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance 
from affliction. But, leaving this part, I return to 
my Journal. 

My condition began now to be, though not less 
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier 
to my mind : and my thoughts being directed, by 
constantly reading the Scripture and praying to God^ 
to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of 
comfort within, of which, till now, I knew nothing; 
also, as my health and strength returned, I bestirred 
me to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, 
and make my way of living as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the I4th, I was chiefly 
employed in walking about with my gun in my hand, 
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was 
gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness : for 
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to 
what weakness I was reduced. The application which 
I made use of was perfectly new, ana perhaps what 
had never cured an ague before; neither can I re- 
commend it to any one to practise, by this experi- 
ment : and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather 
contributed to weaken me ; for I had frequent con- 
vulsions in my nerves and limbs for some time : I 
learned from it also this, in particular ; that being 
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious 
thing to my health that could be, especially in those 
rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes 
of wind ; for as the rain which came in the dry season

was almost always accoinpaniedv 
I found that this rain was much nK 
the rain which fell in September ^^iK 

I had now been in this unhapp^ 
months : all possibility of deliverancV 
dition seemed to be entirely taken fri 
firmly believed that no human shape haX^ 
on that place. Having secured my habv^ a- 

thought, fully to my mind, I had a gresK ^re to 
make a more perfect discovery of the island, Hnd to see 
l¥hat other productions I might find, of which I yet 
knew nothing. 

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take ik 
more particular survey of the island itself. I went up 
the creek first, where, as I hinted^ I brought my rafts 
on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up, 
that the tide did not flow any higher ; and that it was 
no more than a little brook of running water, very 
firesh and good : but this being the dry season, there 
was hardly any water in some parts of it ; at least, not 
any stream. On the banks of this brook I found many 
pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and 
covered with grass : and on the rising parts of thera^ 
next to the higher grounds (where the water, as it 
might be supposed, never overflowed,) I found a great 
deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a very great 
and strong stalk : and there were divers other plants, 
of which I had no knowlege or understanding, and 
that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which 
I could not find out. I searched for the cassava root, 
of which the Indians, in all that climate, make their 
bread ; but I could find none. I saw large plants of 
aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several 
sugar-canes, but wild; and, for want of cultivation, 
imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries 
for this time; and came back, musing with myself 
what course I might take to know the virtue and 
goodness of any of the fruits or plants whiv,h I should 



104 ^^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

my ^^^rf; but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in 
I had made so little observation while I was In 
18 Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the 
field ; at least, very little that might serve me to any 
purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way 
again ; and after going something farther than I had 
gone the day before, I found. the brook and the savan- 
nahs begin to cease, and the country become more 
woody than before. In this part I found different 
fruits ; and particularly I found melons on the ground, 
in great abundance, and grapes on the trees : the vines, 
indeed, had spread over the trees, and the clusters of 
grapes were now just in their prime, very ripe and 
rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was ex* 
<^®^ngly glad of them, but I was warned by my 
experience to eat sparingly of them ; remembering 
that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of 
grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were 
slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and< fevers. 
I found, however, an excellent use for these grapea; 
and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep 
them as dried grapes or raisins are kept; which 1 
thought would be (as indeed they were) as wholescmie 
and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes were to be 
had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to 
my habitation ; which, by the way, was the first night, 
as I might say, I had lain from home. At night, I 
took n^ first contrivance, and got up into a tree, 
where I slept well ; and the next morning proceeded 
on my discovery, travelling near four miles, as I might 
judge by the length of the valley ; keeping still due 
north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north 
sides of me. At the end of this march I ,came to an 
opening, where the country seemed to descend to the 
west i and a little spring of fresh water, which issued 
out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way» 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

tiiat is, due east ; and the country appeared so fresh, sa 
green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant 
vcrdare, or flourish of spring, that it looked like a 
planted garden. I descended a little on the side of 
that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of 
pleasure (though mixed with other afflicting thoughts,) 
to think that this was all my own ; that I was king 
and lord of this country indefeasibly, and had a right 
of possession ; and, if I could convey it, I might have 
it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor 
in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, 
and orange, lemon, and citron-trees, but all wild, and 
very few bearing any fruit ; at least not then. How- 
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not only 
pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ; and I mixea 
their juice afterwards with water, which made it very 
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found 
now I had business enough to gather and carry home ; 
and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as 
limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season* 
which I knew was approaching. In order to this, I ' 
gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser 
heap in another place ; and a great parcel of limes and 
melons in another place ; and, taking a few of each 
with me, I travellea homeward ; and resolved to come 
again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, 
to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent 
three days in this journey, I came nome (so I must 
now call my tent and my cave); but before I got 
thither, the grapes were spoiled ; the richness of the 
fruits, and the weight of the juice, having broken and 
bruised them, they were good for little or nothing : as 
to the limes, they were good, but I could bring only 
a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having 
made two small bags to bring home my harvest ; but i 
was surprised, when, coming to my heap of grapes, 
which were so rich and fine when I gathered them» 



./ 



108 UFE AND ADVENTURES 

I found them all spread abroad, trod to piecea, and 
dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance 
eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were 
some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this, 
but what they were I knew not. However, as I found 
there was no laying them up in heaps, and no carrying 
them away in a sack ; but that one way they would b^ 
destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed 
with their own weight ; I took another course : I then 
gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them 
on the out-branches of the trees, that they might 
cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and 
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand 
under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contem- 
plated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that 
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation; the 
security from storms on that side ; the water and 
the wood : and concluded that I had pitched on a 
place to fix my abode in, which was by far the 
worst part of the country. On the whole, I began 
to consider of removing my habitation, and to look 
out for a place equally safe as where I was now si- 
tuate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the 
island. 

This thought ran long in my head ; and I was ex- 
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of 
the place tempting me : but when I came to a nearer 
view of it, I considered that I was now by the sea- 
side, where it was at least possible that something 
might happen to my advantage, and that the sama ill 
fate which brought me hither, might bring some other 
unhappy wretches to the same place ; and though it 
was scarce probable that any such thin^ should ever 
happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and 
woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate 
my bondage, and to render such an affair not -only im- 
probable, but impossible ; and that therefore I ought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

not by any means to remove. However, I was so 
enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my 
time there for the whole remaining part of the month 
of July ; and though, on second thoughts, I resolved, 
as above stated,. not to remove; yet I built a little 
kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with 
a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I 
could reach, well staked, and filled between with 
brushwood. Here I lay very secure, sometimes two 
or three nights together ; always going over it with a 
ladder, as before : so that I fancied now I had my 
country and my sea-coast house. This work took me 
up till the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to 
enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made 
me stick close to my first habitation : for though I had 
made a tent like the other, with a piece of sail, and^, 
spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill 
to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to re- 
treat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had 
finbhed my bower, and began to enjoy myself. Tho 
dd of August, I found the grapes I had hung up were 
perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good rai- 
sins of the sun : so I began to take them down from 
the trees ; and it was very happy that I did so, as the 
rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I 
ediould have lost the best part of my winter food ; for 
I had above two hundred large bunches of them. No 
sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most of 
them home to my cave, but it began to rain : and from 
hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained more 
or less every day till the middle of October; and 
sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of 
my cave for several days. 

In this season, I was much surprised with the in- 
crease of niiy family. I had been concerned for the 
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or^ as 



110 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I thought, had been dead ; and I heard no more of 
her^ till, to my astonishment, she came home with 
three kittens. This was the more strange to me, he*' 
cause, about the end of August, though I had killed 
a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet 1 thou^it 
it was quite a different kind from our European cats ; 
yet the young cats were the same kind of house-breed 
as the old one ; and both my cats being females, I 
thought it very strange. But from these three, I after- 
wards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was 
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and 
to drive them from my house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant 
rain ; so that I could not stir, and was now very care- 
ful not to be much wet. In this confinement, I began 
to be straitened for food ; but venturing out twice, I 
one day killed a goat, and the last day, which was 
the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a 
treat to me. My food was now regulated thus : I ate 
a bunch of raisins for my breakfast ; a piece of the 
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, broiled, for my dinner 
(for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil 
or stew any thing) ; and two or three of the turtle's 
eggs for my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, 
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my 
cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one side, 
till I came to the outside of the hill ; and made a door 
or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall : 
and so I came in and out this way. But I was not 
perfectly easy at lying so open : for as I had managed 
myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure ; whereas 
now, I thought I lay exposed ; and yet I could not 
perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the 
biggest creature that I had yet seen on the island be- 
ing a goat. 

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy 
'"^anniversary of my landing. I cast up the notches on 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

my post, ieind found I had been on shore three hun- 
dred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn 
fast ; setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating 
mjTself on the ground with the most serious humilia- 
tion, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging hk 
righteous judgments on me, and praying to him tk> 
have mercy on me through Jesus Christ ; and not hav- 
ing tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even 
till the going down of the sun, I then ate a biscuit 
'and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the 
day as I began it. I had all this time observed n!o 
sabbath-day ; for as at first I had no sense of religion 
on my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to dis- 
tinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than 
ordinary for the sabbath-day, and so did not really 
know what any of the days were : but now having 
cast op the days, as above, I found I had been there 
a year ; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every 
seventh day for a sabbath : though I found, at the end 
of my account, I had lost a day or two in my reckon- 
ing. A little after this, my ink beginning to fail me, 
I contented myself to use it more sparingly; and tb 
write down only the most remarkable events of my 
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other 
things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to 
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them 
•o as to^ provide for them accordingly ; but I bought 
all my experience before I had it ; and what I am 
going to relate was one of the most discouraging expe- 
riments that I had made at all. 

I have mentioned that I had saved the few eai^ of 
barley, and rice, which I had so surprisingly found 
sprung up, as I thought, of themselves. I believe 
there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about 
twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper time 
to sow it after the rains ; the sun being in its southern 
position, going from me* Accordingly I dug a piec^ 



112 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of ground, as well as I could, with my wooden spade i 
and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; 
but, as I was sowing, it casually occurrea to my 
thoughts that I would not sow it all at first, be* 
cause I did not know when was the proper time for 
it ; so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving 
about a handful of each : and it was a great comfort 
to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of 
vrhat I sowed this time came to any thing ; for the 
dry month following, and the earth having thus had 
no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to 
assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet 
season had come again, and then it grew as if it had 
been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not 

row, which I easily imagined was from the drought, 
sought for a moister piece of ground to make an- 
other trial in : and I dug up a piece of ground near 
my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in 
February, a little before the vernal equinox. This, 
having the rainy months of March and April to water 
it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very ffood 
<^m ; but having only part of the seed left, and not 
daring to sow all that 1 had, I got but a small quan- 
tity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above 
half a peck of each kind. But by this experiment 
I was made master of my business, and knew ex- 
actly when was the proper time to sow ; and that 
I might expect two seed-times, and two harvests, 
every year. 

W hile this com was growing,- 1 made a little dis- 
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon 
as the rains were over, and the weather began to 
settle, which was about the month of November, I 
made a visit up the country to my bower ; where, 
though I had not been some months, yet I found all 
things just as I left them. The circle or double hedge 
that I had made was not only firm and entire, but 
tiie stakes which I had cut off of some trees that grew 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE,r J13 

thereabouts/ were all shot out, and grown with long 
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the 
. first year after lopping its head ; but I could not tell 
what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from, 
I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see the 
young trees giow ; and I pruned them, and led them 
to grow as much alike as 1 could : and it is scarcely 
credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three 
years: so that, though the hedge made a circle of 
about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for 
such I might now call them, soon covered it, and it 
was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all the 
dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more 
stakes, and make a hedge like this, in a semicircle 
round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling,) 
which I did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a 
double row, at about eight yards distance from my 
first fence, they grew presently ; and were at first a 
fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards served 
for a defence also ; as I shall observe in its order. 
. I found now that the seasons of the year might ge- 
nerally be divided, not into summer and winter, asjg i 
Burope, but into the rainy seasons and the dr^^tUt- 
sons, which were generally thus : From the middle of 
February to the middle of April, rainy; the sun 
being then on or near the equinox. From the middle 
of April till the middle of August, dry ; the sun being 
then north of the line. From the middle of August 
till the middle of October, rainy ; the sun being then 
come back to the line. From the middle of October 
till the middle of February, dry ; the sun being then 
to the south of the line. 

The rainy seasons held sometimes longer an^d some-i 
times shorter, as the winds happened to blpw ; but 
this was the general observation I made. After X 
had found, by experience, the ill consequences of 
being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself 

VOL.1. H 



114 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

with provisions beforehand, that I migkt not h^ 
olbligea to go out : and I sat within doors as mueh m 
possible daring the wet months. In this time I found 
much employment, and very suitable also to the^ time; 
for I found great occasion for* many things which I 
had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard 
labor and constant application : particularly, I tried 
many ways to make myself a basket: but all th^ 
twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle* 
that they would do nothing. It proved of excellient 
advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I ssecl 
to take great delight in standing at a basket-maket 'cr 
in the town where my father lived, to see them mak^ 
their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys usually arey 
very officious to help, and a great observer of thd 
manner how they worked those things, and sometime&r 
lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge 
of the methods of it, so that I wanted nothing bat .the 
materials ; when it came into my mind, that the twig» 
of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that gvew, 
might possibly be as tough as the sallows, wilk)ws, 
and osiers, in England ; and I resolved to try. Ac- 
cordingly, the next day I went to my country house, 
as I called it; and catting some of the smaller twigs, 
I found them to my purpose as much as I could de- 
sire : whereon I came the next time prepared with^ a 
hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 1 soon found, 
for there was gre^t plenty of them. These I set up 
to dry within niy circle or hedge; and when they 
were lit for use, I carried them to my cave : and her^^ 
during the next season, I employed myself in making, 
as well as I could, several baskets; both to carry 
earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had occa- 
sion for. Though I did not finish them very baad'# 
somely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable fof 
my purpose : and thus, afterwards, 1 took care nevei 
to be without them ; and as- my wicker ware decayedi 



OV ROBmsON CRtSOE. 115 

T ikiflEde more ; especially strong deep baskets, to keep 
my corn in, instead of sacks^ when I should come to 
Itave any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a 
world of time about It, I bestirred myself to see, if 
possible, how to supply two other wants. I had no 
teasel to hold any thing that was liquid, except two 
runlets, which were almost full of rum ; and somd 
glass bottles, some of the common size, and others 
(which were case-bottles) square, for the holding of 
waters, spirits, &c. I had ilot so miuch as a pot to 
boil any thing ; Except a ^reat kettle, \¥hich I saved 
out of the ship, and which was too big for such use as 
I desired it for, viz. to make bi^oth, atid iMew a bit of 
meat by itself. The secoiid thing 1 would fain have 
had, was a tobacco-pipe ; but it wsus impossible for 
itie to make one ; however, I found a contrivance for 
tibat too at lasttf I employed myself in planting my 
second row of stakes or piles, and also in this Wicker- 
working, all the summer or dry season ; wh^n another 
business took me up more time than it could be ima* 
gined I could spare. 

I mentioned before, that I had a great niind to 
see the whole island ; and that I had travelled up 
the brook, and so on to where 1 had built my bower, 
and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the 
other side of the island. 1 liow resolved to travel 
qaite across to the sea-shore, on that side : so taking 
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quan- 
tity of powder and shot than usual ; with two biscuit- 
cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for 
my store ; I began my journey. When I had passed 
thcr vale where my bower stood, as above, I came 
within view of the sea, to the west ; and it being a 
very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an 
island or continent I could not tell ; but it lay very 
high, extending from W. to W.S.W. at a very great 



116 WFE AND ADVENTURES 

distance; by my guess, it could not be less than fif« 
teen or twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this night 
be ; otherwise than that 1 knew it must be part of 
America ; and, as I concluded, by all my observa** 
tions, mnst be near the Spanish dominions ; and per** 
haps was all inhabited by savages, where, if L should 
have landed, I had been in a worse condition than 
I was now. I therefore acquiesced in the disposi* 
tions of Providence, which I began now to own and 
to believe ordered every thing for the best 7 I say, 
I quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting 
myself with fruitless wishes of being there. 

Besides, after some pause on this affair, I con-» 
sidered that if this land was the Spanish coast, I 
should certainly, one time or other, see some vessel 
pass or repas3 one »way or other ; but if not, then it 
was the saveige coast between the Spanish country 
and the Brazils^ whose inhabitants are indeed the. 
worst of savages ; for they are cannibals, or men-^ 
eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all human 
beings that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations, walking very leisurely 
forward, I found this side of the island, where I now 
was, much pleasanter than mine ; the open or savan- 
nah fields sweetly adorned with flowers and grass, 
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of 
parrots ; and fain would have caught one, if possi- 
ble, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to 
speak to me. I did, after taking some pains, catch 
a young parrot : for I knocked it down with a stick, 
and, having recovered it, I brought it home : but it 
was some years before I could make him speak ; how- 
ever, at last I taught him to call me by my name very 
familiarly. But the accident that followed, though it 
be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 
^ I was exceedingly amused v^ith this journey, I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

found in the low grounds hares, as I thought them tb 
i)e, and foxes : but they differed greatly from all the 
other kinds I had met with ; nor could I satisfy my- 
self to eat them, though I killed several. But I had 
no need to be venturous : for I had no want of food, 
and of that which was very good too ; especially 
these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or 
tortoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leaden- 
hall-Market could not have furnished a better table 
than I, in pro{)ortion to the company; and though 
my case was deplorable enough^ yet I had great 
cause for thankfulness ; as I was not driven to any 
extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even to 
dainties. 

I never travelled on this journey above two miles 
x^utright in a day, or thereabouts ; but I took so many 
turns and returns, to see what discoveries I could 
make, that I came weary enough to the place where 
I resolved to sit down for the night; and then I 
either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself 
with a row of stakes, set upright in the ground, either 
from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature 
could come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I tvas sur- 
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on tte 
worst side of the island : for here indeed the shore 
was covered with innumerable turtles ; whereas, on 
the other side, I had found but three in a year and 
a half. Here was also an iiiiinite number of fowls 
of tnany kinds ; some of which I had seen, and some 
of which I had not seen before, and many of them 
very good meat ; but such as I knew not the names 
of, except those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was 
very sparing of my powder and shot ; and therefore 
bad more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I 
could better feed on. But though there were many 
goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it 



118 LIFE AND ADY^NTURSB 

wa9 with much pnore difficulty that I could come mtwr 
them ; the country being flat and even, and they saw 
me much sooner than when I was on the hills. 

I confess this side of the country was much plea-^ 
santer than mine ; yet I had not the least inclination 
to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation , it 
became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I 
was here to be as it were upon a journey, and from 
home. However, I travelled along the sea-shore to^ 
wards the east, I suppose about twelve miles; and 
then setting up a great pole on the shore for a mark, 
I concluded I would go home again ; and that the 
next journey I took should be. on the other side of 
the island, east from my dwelling, and so round till I 
came to my post again : of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, 
thinking I could easily keep so much of the island 
in my view, that I could not miss my first dwelling 
by viewing the country; but I found myself mis- 
taken; for being come about two or three miles, 1 
found myself descended into a very large valley, but 
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with 
woods, that I could not see which was my way by 
^y direction but that of the sun, nor even then, 
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at 
that time of the day. And it happened to my far- 
ther misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for 
three or four days while I was in this valley ; and 
not being able to see the sun, I wandered Bboui 
very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find 
out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back 
the same way I went ; and then by easy journeys I 
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, 
and my gun, ammunition » hatchet, and other things 
very heavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and 
seized it ; and running to take hold of it, I caught it, 
and saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind

to bring it hoBie if I could; for I had often been 
musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid 
or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which 
might supply me when my powder and shot should 
be all spent. I made a collar for this little creature, 
and with a string which I had made of some rope- 
yam, which I always carried about me. I led him 
along* though with some difficulty, till I came to my 
bower, and there I enclosed him and left him ; for I 
was Tery impatient to be at home, from whence I had 
been absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me 
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my ham* 
mock-bed. This little wandering journey, without a 
settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to 
me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, was 
a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and 
it rendered every thing about me so comfortable, tliat 
I resolved I would never go a great way from it 
again, while it should be my lot to stay on die island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale 
myself after my long Journey : during which, mo»t 
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of 
ttafcing a cage for my Pol, who began now to be 
more domestic* and to be mighty well acquainted 
witb me. Then I began to think of the poor kid 
which I had penned within my little circle, and re- 
flolired to fetch it home, or give it some food : accord- 
ingly I went, and found it where I left it ; for indeed 
k couid not get out, but was almost starved lor want 
of food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches 
<tf such shrubs as I could find,' and threw them over, 
and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it 
away ; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I 
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a 
io^ : and as I continually fed it, the creature became 
•o loving, BO gentle, and so fond, that it was from 



12d LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

that time one of my dolnestics also, and would never 
leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now 
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same 
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of my 
landing on the island; having now been there two 
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than 
the iirst day I came there. I spent the whole day in 
humble ana thankful acknowledgments for the many 
wonderful mercies with which my solitary condition 
was attended, and without which it might have been 
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty 
thanks to God for having been pleased to discover td 
me, that it was possible I might be more happy evefi 
in this solitary condition, than I should have been in 
the enjoyment of society, and in all the pleasures of 
the world : that he could fully make up to me the 
deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of 
human society, by his presence, and the communi* 
cations of his grace to my soul ; supporting, comr 
forting, and encouraging me to depend upon his pro- 
vidence here, and to hope for his eternal presence 
hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much 
more happy the life I now led was, with all its mise- 
rable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abomi- 
nable life I led all the past part of my days : and 
now I changed both my sorrows and my joys: my 
very desires altered, my affections changed their gust, 
and my delights were perfectly new from what they 
were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years 
past. 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, 
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul 
at my condition would break out on a sudden, and 
hiy very heart would die within me, to think of the 
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in ; and how

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 12L 

I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars and 
bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, with- 
out redeniption. In the midst of the greatest com- 
posures of my mind, this would break out on me 
like a storm, and make me wring my hands, and weep 
like a child : sometimes it would take me in the mid- 
dle of my work> and I would immediately sit down 
and 8igh> and look on the ground for an hour or 
two together: this was still worse to me; but if I 
could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings by 
words, it would go off; and my grief being exhaust^ 
would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with iew 
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and ap- 
plied all the comforts of it to my present state. One 
morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible at these 
words, " I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee :" 
immediately it occurred that these words were to me; 
why else should they be directed in such a mannefji 
just ^t the moment when I was mourning over my 
condition, as one forsaken of God and man ? ** Well 
then," said I, " if God does not forsake me, of what 
ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though 
the world should forsake me ; seeing on the other 
haiid, if I had all the world, and should lose the 
favor and blessing of God, there would be no com- 
parison in the loss V 

From this moment I began to conclude in my 
mind that it was possible for me to be more happy 
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was pro* 
bable I should ever have been in any other particu- 
lar state in the world ; and with this thought I was 
going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this 
place. I know not what it was, but something 
shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not 
speak the words. ** How canst thou be such ^ hy- 
pocrite," said I, even audibly, ** to pretend to be 
ihankful for a condition^ from whicby however tho« 



122 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

mayest eiideaYour to be ooatented witk k, tbon 
vrouldest ratber pray heartily to be delivered V Heite 
I stopped : but though I could not say I thankad 
God for being here, yet I sincerely gave thanks to 
God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting pro* 
vidences, to see the former condition of my life, and 
tD>mouiti for my wickedness, and repent. I never 
<^ened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within 
me blessed God for directing my mend in England, 
without any order of mine, to pack it up among my 
goods ; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out 
of the wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my 
third year ; and though I have not given the reader 
the trouble of so particular an account of. my works 
this year as the nrst, yet in general it may be ob* 
served, that I was very seldom idle ; but having re- 
gularly divided my time, according to the several 
4aily employments that were before me ; such as, first. 
My duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures^ 
wmch I constantly set apart some time for, thrice 
every day : secondly, Going abroad with my gun for 
food, which generally took me up three hours every 
tnorning, when it did not rain : thirdly, Ordering, 
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or 
catched for my supply : these took up great part of 
the day ; also it is to be considered, that in the mid* 
die of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the 
violence of the heat was too great to stir out ; so that 
about four hours in the evening was all the time I 
could be supposed to work in ; with this exception, 
that sometimes I changed tny hours of hunting and 
.working, and went to work in the morning, and 
abroad with my gun in the afternoon. 
. To this short time allowed. for labor, I desire may 
-be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work ; 
the many hours which, for want of tools, want of 
lielpi and want of skUl, evei^ thing I did took up out 



OF ROBINSON CBUSOE. 129 

ti my time : for example, I was full two-and'-forty 
days roakiag me a board ^£or a long skelf, which i 
wanted in my cave ; whereas, two sawyers, with their 
tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out 
of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this ; it was a large tree which was 
to be cut down, because my board was to be a Inroad 
one. This tree I was three days cutting down, and 
two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to 
a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hack- 
ing and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into 
chips, till it was light enough to move ; then I turned 
it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board, 
from end to end ; then turning that side downward, 
cut the other side, till I brought the plank to be 
about three inches thick, and snK>oth on both sides, 
^ny one may judge the labor of my hands in such « 
piece of work ; but labor and patience carried me 
through that, and many other things : I only obsery« 
this in particular, to show the reason why so much 
of my time went away with so little work, viz. that 
what might be a little to be done with help and tools, 
was a vast labor, and required a prodigious time to 
do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with 
patience and labor I went through many things; and 
indeed, every thing that my circumstances made ne- 
eessary for me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

I was now in the months of rS^ovember and Decemi- 
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The 
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not 
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not 
above the quantity of half a peck, having lost one 
whole crop by sowing in the dry season : but now my 
crop promised very well ; when on a sudden I fonitd 
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of ^ 
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to kefMii/ 
from it ; as, first, the goats, and wild creatures whioln^^ 
called hares, which^ tasting the sweetness of the bUM^ 



124 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

lay in it night' and day, as soon as it came up, aiid 
ate it so close^ that it could get no time to shoot up 
into stalks. 

I saw no remedy for this, but by making an enclo-^ 
sure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great 
deal of toil ; and the more, because it required speed. 
However, as my arable land was but small, suited td 
my crop, I got it tolerably well fenced in about three 
weeks' time ; and shooting some of the creatures in 
the day-time, I set my dog to guard it in the 
night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where 
he would stand and bark all night long ; so in a 
little time the enemies forsook the place, and the 
corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripeii 
apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corii 
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin 
me now, when it was in the 6ar : for going along by 
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop 
surrounded with fowls, I know not of how many 
sorts, who stood, as it were, watching till I should be 
gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I always 
had my gun with me) ; I had no sooner shot, but 
there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not 
seen at all, irom among the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a 
few days they would devour all my hopes ; that I 
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop 
at all ; and what to do I could not tell : however, I 
resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I 
should watch it night and day. In the first place, 
I went among it, to see what damage was already 
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; 
but that as it was yet too green for them, the loss was 
not so great, but that the remainder was likely to be 
a good crop, if it could be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming 
#tway> I could easily see the thieves sitting on all 



Df ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125 

Ihe trees about me, as if they only Waited till I was 
p^one away ; and the event proved it to be so ; for as 
I walked off, as if gone, I was no sooner out of their 
sight, than they dropped down, one by one, into the 
com again. I was so provoked, that I could not 
have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that 
every grain they eat now was, as it might be said, a 
peck-loaf to me in the consequence ; so coming up to 
the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. 
This was what I wished for ; so I took them up, and 
served them as we serve notorious thieves in England ^^ 
viz. hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It 
ii^ impossible to imagine that this .should have such an 
effect as it had ; for the fowls not only never came 
to the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part 
of the island, and -I could never see a bird near the 
place as long as my scare-crows hung there. This T 
was very glad of, you may be sure ; and about the 
latter end of December, which was our second harvest 
of the year, I reaped my corn. 

' I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it 
down : and all I could do was to make one as well as 
I could, out of one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses,> 
which I saved among the arms out of the ship. Howo: 
ever, as my first crop was but small, I had no great, 
difficulty to cut it down : in short, I reaped it my 
way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it 
away in a great basket which I had made, and so 
robbed it out with Iny hands ; and at the end of all 
my harvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of. 
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two 
bushels and a half of barley ; that is to say, by my 
guess, for I had no measure. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me ; 
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to. 
supply me with bread; and yet here I was perplexed 
again ; for I neither knew how to grind, or make meat 
of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it ; nor 



126 LIFE AND ADVENTURBf 

if made into meal, how to make bread of it ; aaA if 
kow to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it : tiieie 
things being added to my desire of haying a good 
quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply ^ I 
resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve 
it all for seed against the next season ; and, in the 
mean time, to employ all my study and hours of work-» 
iHg to accomplish this great work of providing myself 
with corn and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my 
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe 
few people have thought much on, viz. the strange 
multitude of little things necessary in the providing^ 
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing 
this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found 
this to my daily discouragement, and was made more 
sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the first 
handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up 
unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth ; no 
spade or shovel to dig it : well, this I conquered by 
making a wooden spade, as I observed before ; but this 
did my work but in a wooden manner ; and though it 
cost me a great many days to make it, yet, for want of 
iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but made my 
work the harder, and performed it much worse. How- 
ever, this I bore with, and was content to work it out 
with patience, and bear with the badness of the per- 
formance. When the corni was sown, I had no har- 
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a 
great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it 
may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. When 
it was growing and grown, I have observed already 
how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow 
or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it 
from the chaff, and save it : then I wanted a mill to 
grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into 



OF BOBINSO'N CRUSOE. 127 

bread, and an OTen to bake it ; and yet all these 
tbiags I did without, as shall be observed ; and the 
corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to 
me ; all this, as I said, made every thing laborious 
and tedious to me, but that there was no help for ; 
neither was my time so much loss to me, because, as 
I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day 
appointed to these works ; and as I resolved to use 
none of the com for bread till I had a greater quantity 
by me, I had the next six months to apply myself 
wholly ,^ by labor and invention, to furnish myself with 
titensib proper for the performing all the operationa 
necessary for making corn fit for my use. 

But now I was to prepare more land ; for 1 had 
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before 
) did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a 
spade ; which, when it was done, was but a sorry one 
iadeed^ and very heavy, and required double labor to 
work with it : however, I went through that, and 
sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, a» 
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and 
fenced them in with a good hedge ; the stakes of 
which were all cut off that wood which I had set be- 
fore, and knew it would grow ; so that in one year's 
time I knew I should have a quick or living hedge 
that would want but little repair. This work took 
me up full three months ; because a great part of the 
time was in the wet season, when I could not go 
abroad. Within doors, that is, when it rained, and 1 
could not go out, I found employment on the follow- 
ing occasions ; always observing, Uiat while I was at 
work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and 
teaching bim to speak ; and I quickly learned him to 
jftiiow his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty 
loud, Pol ; which was the first word I had ever 
beard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. 
This,, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to 
pijfcwork ; for now, as I said, I had a great employ- 



128 LIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

ment upon my hands, as (bUows : I had long studied^' 
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen 
ressels, which indeed I wanted much, but knew not 
where to come at them : however, considering the 
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could 
find out any clay, I might botch up some such pot as 
might, being dried in the sun, be hard and strong 
enough to bear handling, and to hold any thing that 
was dry, and required to be kept so ; and as this was 
necessary in the preparing corn, meal. Sec, which was 
the thing I was on, I resolved to make some as large 
as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold 
what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh 
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to 
raise this pastil ; what odd, misshapen, . ugly things I 
made ; how many of them fell in, and how many fell 
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own 
weight ; how many cracked by the over violent heat 
of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many 
fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as 
after they were dried : and, ,in a ^ord, how, after 
having labored hard to find the clay, to dig it, to 
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not 
make above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot 
call them jars) in about two months' labor. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and 
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them down 
again in two great wicker baskets, which I had made 
on purpose for them, that they might not break ; and 
as between the pot and the basket there was a little- 
room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barleys- 
straw ; and these two pots being to stand always dry, 
I thoupiht would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the 
meal, when the corn was bruised. 
. Though I miscarried so much in my design for large 
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better 
success ; such as little round pots, 0at dishes, pitchers. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 128 

aad pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to ; and 
the heat of the sun baked them very hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to 
get an earthen pot to hold liquids, and bear the fire, 
which none of these could do« It happened some 
time after, making a pretty large fire for cooking my 
meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with 
it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen-ware 
vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as 
a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it ; and said 
to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn 
whole, if they would burn broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to 
make it burn some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, 
such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with 
lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; but I 
placed three large pipkins and two or three pots in 
a pile, one on another, and placed my fire-wood all 
round it, with a great heap of embers under them. I 
plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and 
on the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot 
quite through, and observed that they did not crack at 
all : when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in 
that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of 
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for 
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the 
violence of the heat, and would have run into glass, if 
I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually, till 
the pots began to aba^e of the red colour ; and watch- 
ing them all night, that I might not let the fire abate 
too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I will 
jiot say handsome, pipkins, and two other earthen 
pots, as hard burnt as could be desired ; and one of 
them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted 
no sort of earthen-ware for my use ; but I must needs 
say, as to, the shapes of them, they were very indiffe- 
rent, as any one may suppose, as I had no w^^ <:s^^

makiag them but as the children make dirt pies, ot 
as a woman would make pies that never learned to 
raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was eret 
equid to mine, when I found I had made an earthen 
pot that would bear the fire ; and I had hardly pa- 
tience to stay till they were cold, before I set one on 
the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me some 
meat, which it did admirably well ; and with a piece of 
a kid I made some veiy good broth ; though I wanted 
oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to 
make it so good as I would have had it. 

My next concern was to get a stone mortar to 
stamp or beat some corn in ; for as to the mill, there 
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art 
with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was at 
a great loss ; for of all trades in the world, I was as 
perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any 
whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about it with* 
I spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough 
to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar ; but could 
find none at sdl, except what was in the solid rock, 
and which I had no way to dig or cut out : nor, indeed, 
were the rocks in the island of sufficient hardness, as 
they were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would 
neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would 
break the com without filling it with sand : so, after 
a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I 
gave it over, and resolved to loo^ out a great block of 
hard wood, which I found indeed much easier ; and 
getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded 
it, and formed it On the outside with my axe and 
hatchet ; and then, with the help of fire, and infinite 
labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in 
Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great 
heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called iron-wood; 
and this I prepared and laid by against I had my next 
crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grinds 



OF ROBINSON CItUSOB. 131 

or rather pound , my com into meal, to make my 
bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or searce, 
to dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and the 
husk, without which I did not see it possible I could 
haye any bread. This was a most difficult thing, even 
but to think on ; for I had nothing like the necessary 
thing to make it ; I mean fine thin canvass or stuff, to 
scarce the meal through. Here I was at a full stop 
for many months ; nor did I really know what to do ; 
linen I had none left, but what was mere rags ; I had 
goats'-hair, but neither knew how to weave it nor spin 
it ; and had I known how, here were no tools to work 
it with : all the remedy I found for this was, at last 
recollecting I had, among the seamen's clothes which 
were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico 
or muslin, with some pieces of these I made three 
small sieves, proper enough for the work ; and thus I 
made shift for some years : how I did afterwards, I 
shall show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be consi-* 
dered, and how I should make bread when I came to 
have corn : for, first, I had no yeast : as to that part 
there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern 
myself much about it ; but for an oven I was indeed 
puzzled. At length I found out an expedient for that 
also, which was this; I made some earthen vessels, 
very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two 
feet diameter, and npt above nine inches deep : these 
I burned in the fire, as I had done the other, and laid 
them by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great 
fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some 
square tiles, of my own making and burning also ; but 
J should not call them square. 

\¥hen the fire-wood was burned into embers, or 
Uve coals, I drew them forward on the hearth, so 
mft to cover it all over, and there let them lie till the 
hearth was very hot ; then sweeping away all ^^ 



132 UFE AND ADVENTURES 

embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and corerinff 
them with the earthen pot, drew the embers all round 
the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat ; 
and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I 
baked my barley loaves, and became, in a little time,, 
a good pastrycook into the bargain ; for I made my-» 
self several cakes and puddings of the rice ; but made 
no pieSy as I had nothing to put into them' except the 
flesh of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took 
me up most part of the third year of my abode here ; 
for, it is to be observed, in the intervals of these 
things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to ma- 
nage : I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it 
home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, 
in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out ; for 
I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash 
it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I 
really wanted to build my barns bigger : I wanted a 
place to lay it up in ; for the increase of the corn now 
yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about 
twenty bushels, and of rice as much, or more, inso- 
much that now I resolved to begin to use it freely ; 
for my bread had been quite gone a great while : 
I resolved also to see what quantity would be suffi- 
cient for me a whole year, and to sow but once 
a year. 

. On the whole, I found that the forty bushels of 
barley and rice were much more than I could con- 
sume in a year ; so I resolved to sow just the same 
quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes 
that such a quantity would fully provide me with 
bread, &c. 

All the while these things were doing, you may be 
sure my thoughts ran many times on the prospect 
of land which I had seen from the other side of the 
island : and I was not without some secret wishes 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

that I was on shore there ; fancying, that seeing the 
main land, and an inhabited country I might find 
some way or other to convey myself farther, and peir- 
haps at last find some means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the 
dangers of such a condition, and that I might fall into 
the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I might 
have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers 
of Africa ; that if I once came in their power, I 
should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one 
of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had 
heard that the people of the Caribbean coast were 
cannibals, or man-eaters ; and I knew, by the lati- 
tude, that I could not be far off from that shore.- 
Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet that 
they might kill me, as they had many Europeans who 
had. fallen into their hands, even when they have been 
ten or twenty together ; much more I, who was but 
one, and could make little or no defence ; all these 
things, I say, which I ought to have considered well 
of, and did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, took 
up none of my apprehensions at first ; yet my head 
ran mightily on the thought of getting over to the 
shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat 
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed 
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; but 
this was in vain : then I thought I would go and look 
at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was- blown 
up on the shore a great way, in the storm, when we 
were first cast away. She lay nearly where she did 
at first, but not quite ; having turned, by the force of 
the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward,' 
against a high ridge of beachy rough sand ; but no 
water about her, as before. If I had had hands to 
have refitted her, and to have launched her into the 
water, the boat would have done very well, and I 
leight have gone back into the Brazils with het e^sAk^ 






\S4 LITK AND ADVENTURES 

^ou^; bill I night have foreseen » that I could no 
mwe Uuft kef and set her upright on her bottom, than I 
OQuki i^move the island; however^ I went to the 
woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them 
%o th^ boat» resolving to try what I could do ; sug- 
i«afti«g to myself, that if I could but turn her down, 
Md repair the damage she had received, she would 
W a very good boat, and I might venture to sea 
in her. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless 
loll, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it : 
at last, finding it impossible to heave her up with my 
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to un- 
dermine her, and so as to make her fall down, set-^ 
ting pieces of wood to thrust and guide her right in 
the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir her 
vp again, or to get under her, much less to move her 
forward towards the water ; so I was forced to give 
it over : and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the 
boat, my desire to venture over the main increased, 
rather than diminished, as the means for it seemed 
impossible. 

At length, I began to think whether it was not 
possible to make myself a cano^, or periagua, such as 
the natives of those climates make, even without 
tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk 
of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but 
easy, and pleased myself extremely with the idea of 
making it, and with my having much more conve« 
Bience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ; but 
not at all considering the particular inconveniences 
which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. 
the want of hands to move it into the water when it 
made, a difficulty much harder for me to sur* 
cnint than all the consequences of want of tools 
ittld be to them : for what could it avail me, if, after 
hftd Chosen my tree, and with much trouble e^^ it 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

down, and might be able with my tools to hew and 
dub the outside into tbe proper shape of a boat, and 
burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to 
make a boat of it ; if, after all this, I must leave it 
just where I found it, and was not able to launch it 
into the water ? 

; One would imagine, if I had had the least reflection 
on my mind of my circumstances while ^ I was making 
this boat, I should have immediately thought how I 
was to get it into the sea : but my thoughts were so 
intent on my voyage in it, that I never once consi- 
dered how I should get it off the land ; and it was 
really, in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it 
over forty-five miles of sea, than the forty-five &thomc 
of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 
: I went to work on this boat the most like a fool 
that ever man did, who had any of his senses awake. 
I pleased myself with the design, without determining 
whether I was able to undertake it ; not but that the 
difficulty of launching my boat often came into my 
bead ; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by 
this foolish answer : Let me first make it : I warrant 
I will find some way or other to get it along when it is 
done. 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the 
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. 
I felled a cedar tree, and I question much whether 
Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the 
Temple at Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches dia* 
meter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet 
eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
where it lessened, and then parted into branches. It 
was not without infinite labor that I felled this tree ; 
I was twenty days hacking and hewing at the bottom, 
and fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and 
the vast spreading head of it, cut off: after this, it 
cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proporr 
Uon, and to somatbuig like the bottom pf n boat, that 



130 LIFK A^^ ADVENTURES 

it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me 
near three months more to clear the inside, and work 
it out 80 as to make an exact boat of it : this I did, 
indetHl, without lire, by mere mallet and chisel, and 
by the dint of hard labor, till I had brought it to be a 
Tery handsome periagua, and big enough to have car-^ 
rfed six and twenty men, and consequently big enough 
to have carried me and all my cargo. 

^Vhen I had gone through this work, I was ex- 
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really much 
bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua, that was 
made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it 
had cost, you may be sure ; and there remained no- 
thing but to get it into the water ; which, had I ac- 
complished, I make no question but I should have be- 
gun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be 
performed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed 
me ; though they cost me inexpressible labor too. It 
lay about one hundred yards from the water, and not 
more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill 
towards the creek. Well, to take away this discou- 
ragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the 
earth, and so make a declivity : this I begun, and it 
0OBt me a prodigious deal of pains ; (but who grudge 
gains that nave their deliverance in view ?) when this 
^fiiis worked through, and this difficulty managed, it 
^ras still much the same, for I could no more stir the 
oanoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured 
ibe distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or 
canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I 
uould not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, 
I began this work ; and when I began to enter on 
it, and calculate how deep it was to be dug, how 
uoad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found 
WmH» number of hands I had, having none but my 

i^that it must have been ten or twelve years before 
lid have gone through with it i for the shore lay so; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

liigfa, that at the upper end it must haye been at least 
twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with great 
reluctancy, I was at length obliged to give over also* 

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though 
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we 
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our 
own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of ^this work I finished my fourth 
'^ta.T in this place, and kept my anniversary with the 
flame devotion, and with as much comfort as before } 
for, by a constant study and serious application to thd 
word of God, and by the assistance of his grac^, I 
gained a different knowledge from what I had before ; 
I entertained different notions of things ; I looked now 
on the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing 
to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no de*' 
sires about : in a wordj I had nothing to do with it/ 
nor was ever likely to have ; I thought it looked, m 
we may perhaps look on it hereafter; viz. as a place I 
had lived in, but was come out of it ; and well might 
^ 1 say, as father Abraham to Dives, " Between ma 
and thee is a great gulf fixed.'' 

In the first place, I was here removed from all thd^ 
wickedness of the world ; I had neither the lust of thor 
. flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life. I had 
nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now capable 
of enjoying : I was lord of the whole manor ; or, if J. 
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the 
whole country which I had possession of ; there were 
no rivals ; I had no competitor, none to dispute so- 
vereignty or command with me : I might have raised> 
ship- loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I 
let as little grow as I thought enough for my occa- 
sion. I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and- 
then one was as much as I could put to' any use : I 
had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships ; and> 
I had grapes enough, to have made wine, or to hav9 



138 UFB AND ADVBNTURES 

cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it 
had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valu- 
able : I had enough to eat and supply my wants, and 
what was the rest to me ? If I killed more flesh than 
I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin ; if I 
sowed more com than I could eat, it must be spoiled ; 
he trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the 
ground ; I could make no more use of them than for 
fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to dreta 
my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dic- 
tated to me, on just reflection, that all the good things 
of this world are of no farther good to us than for our 
use; and that whatever we may heap up to give 
Others, we enjoy only as much as we can use, and no 
more. The most covetous griping mber in the world 
would have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if 
he had been in my case ; for I possessed infinitely 
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room 
for desire, except it was for things which I had not, 
and they were comparatively but trifles, though indeed 
of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel 
of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six 
pounds sterling. Alas I there the nasty, sorry, use* 
less stuff lay : I had no manner of business for it ; 
and I often thought within myself, that I would have 
|dven a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or 
K>r a hand*mill to grind my corn ; nay, I would have 
g^ven it all for sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot 
seed from £ngla,nd, or for a handful of peas and beans, 
and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least 
advantage by it, or benefit from it ; but there it lay in 
a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave 
in the wet seasons ; and if I had had the drawer full 
of diamonds, it had been the same case — they had 
been of no manner of value to me because of no use. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 139 

I had now brought my state of life to be much more 
comfortable in itself than it was at first, and much 
easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I fre<^ 
quently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and ad- 
mired the hand of God's providence, which had thus 
spread my table in the wilderness : I learned to look 
more on the bright side of my condition, and less on 
the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather 
than what I wanted : and this gave me sometimes such 
secret comforts, that I cannot express them ; and 
which I take notice of here, to put those discontented 
people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably 
what God has given them, because they see and coVet 
something that he has not given them. All our di»* 
contents about what we want, appeared to me to 
spring from the want of thankfulness for what we 
have. 

. Another reflection was of great use to me, and 
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into 
such distress as mine was ; and this was, to compare 
my present condition with what I at first expected it 
would be ; nay, with what it would certainly haiw 
been, if the good providence of God had not wonder* 
fully ordered the ship to be cast up near to the shcnre, 
where I not only could come at her, but could bring 
what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and 
comfort; without which I had wanted for tools to 
work, weapons for defence^ and gunpowder and shot 
for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in re« 
presenting to myself, in the most lively colors, how I 
must have acted if I had got nothing out of the ship. 
J. could not have so much as got any food, except fish 
and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found 
any of them, I must have perished ; that I should have 
lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage ; that 
if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance,; 
{•had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh froni 






140 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up ; but must 
gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, 
like a beast. 

• These reflections made me very sensible of the 
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful for 
my present condition, with all its hardships and mis- 
fortunes : and this part also I cannot but recommend 
to the reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, 
to say, Is any aflHiction like mine ? Let them consi- 
der how much worse the cases of some people are^ 
and their case might have been, if Providence had 
thought fit. 

' I had another reflection, which assisted me also to 
comfort my mind with hopes ; and this was compar'« 
ing my present condition with what I had deserved; 
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of 
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly 
destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. I had 
been well instructed by my father and mother ; neither 
had they been wanting to me, in their endeavours to 
infuse an early religious awe of God into my mind, a 
sense of my duty, and what the nature and end of my 
being required of me. But, alas ! falling early into 
the seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most desti- 
tute of the fear of God, though his terrors are always 
before them ; I say, falling early into the seafaring 
life, and into seafaring company, all that little sense 
of religion which 1 had entertained was laughed out of 
me by my messmates ; by a hardened despising of dan-^ 
gers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to 
me ; by my long absence from all manner of opportu- 
nities to converse with any thing but what was like 
myself, or to hear any thing that was good, or tending 
towards it. 

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of 
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the 
greatest deliverances I enjoyed (such as my escape 
fiom Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

master of a ship, my being planted so well in the Bra- 
zils, my receiving the cargo from England, and the 
like,) I never had once the words. Thank God, so 
much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the 
greatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray 
to him, or so much as to say. Lord, have mercy on 
me ! no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it 
was to swear by, and blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections on my * mind for many 
months, as I have already observed, on account of my 
wicked and hardened life past; and when I looked 
about me, and considered what particular providences 
had attended me since my coming into this place, and 
how God had dealt bountifully with me, — had not 
only punished me less than my iniquity had deserved.^ 
but had so plentifully provided for me, — this gave me 
great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and that 
God had yet mercies in store for me. 

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not 
only to a resignation to the will of God in the present 
disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere 
thankfulness for my condition ; and that I, who was 
yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had 
not the due punishment of my sins ; that I enjoyed so 
many mercies which I had no reason to have expected 
in that place, that I ought never more to repine at my 
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for 
that daily bread, which nothing but a crowd of won- 
ders could have brought ; that I ought to consider I 
had been fed by a miracle, even as great as that of 
feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of 
miracles : and that I could hardly have named^ place 
in the uninhabitable part of the world where I could 
have been cast more to my advantage ; a place where, 
as I had no society, which was my aflliction on one 
hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves 
or tigers, to threaten my life ; no venomous or poison- 
ous creatures which I might feed on to my hurt ; no 



142 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

fMivages to murder uid devour me. In a word, as my 
life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of 
mercy another ; and I wanted nothing to make it a life 
of comfort, but to make myself sensible of God's 
goodness to me, and care over me in this condition ; 
and after I did make a just improvement of these 
things, I went away, and was no more sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things 
which I brought on shore for my help were either 
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some 
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with 
water a little and a little, till it was so pale, it scarce 
left any appearance of black on the paper. As 
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down 
the days of the month on which any remarkable thing 
happened to me : and, first, by casting up times past, 
I remember that there was a strange concurrence of 
days in the various providences which befel me, andi 
which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to ob- 
serve days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had 
reason to have looked on with a great deal of curi- 
osity. 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I 
broke away from my father and my friends, and nutf 
away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day 
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, 
and made a slave : the same day of the year that I 
escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yarmouth 
Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my 
escape from Sallee in the boat: and the same day 
of the year I was born on, viz. the 30th of Septem- 
ber, that same day I had my life so miraculously 
saved twenty-six years after, when I was cast on 
shore in this island : so that my wicked life and my 
solitary life began both on one day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that 
of my breads I mean the biscuit which I brought out 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

of the ship : this I had husbanded to the last degree^ 
allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above 
a year; and yet I was quite without bread for neav 
a year before I got any corn of my own ; and great 
reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the 
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to 
miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily : as to 
linen, I had none for a great while, except some 
chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the 
other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, be- 
cause many times I could bear no clothes on but a 
shirt ; and it was a very great help to me that I had, 
among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three 
dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several 
thick watch-coats of the seamen's which were left, 
but they were too hot to wear : and though it is true 
that the weather was so violently hot that there was 
BO need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked^ 
no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was 
not, nor could I abide the thought of it, though I 
was all alone. The reason why I could not go quite 
naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so 
well when quite naked as with some clothes on ; 
nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin ! 
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some 
motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold 
cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring 
myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a 
cap or hat; the heat of the sun beating with such 
violence as it does in that place, would give me the 
head-ach presently, by darting so directly on my 
head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could not 
bear it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would pre* 
sently go away. 

On these views, I began to consider about put- 
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into 
some (Mrder : I had worn out all the waistcoats I haud^^ 



144 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and my business was now to try if I could not niake 
jackets out of the great watch-coats that I had by me, 
and with such other materials as I had ; so I set to 
work a tailoring, or rather, indeed, a botching, for I 
made most piteous work of it. However, I made 
shift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I 
hoped would serve me a great while : as for breeches or 
drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed till 
afterwards. 

I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the 
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones ; and 
I had hung them up, stretched out with sticks, in the 
£un, by which means some of them were so dry and 
hard that they were fit for little, but others I found 
very useful. The first thing I made of these was a 
great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to 
shoot off the rain ; and this I performed so well, that 
after this I made me a suit of clothes wholly of the 
skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at 
the knees, and both loose ; for they were rather want- 
ing to keep me cool than warm. I must not omit to 
acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I 
was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However, 
they were such as I made very good shift with ; and 
when I was abroad, if it happened to rain^ the hair of 
my waistcoat and cap being uppermost, I was kept 
very dry. 

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to 
make me an umbrella : I was indeed in great want of 
one, and had a great mind to make one ; I had seen 
them made in the Brazils, where they were very use- 
ful in the great heats which are there ; and I felt the 
heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being 
nearer the equinox : besides, as I was obliged to be 
much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well 
for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at 
it, and was a great while before I could make any 
thing likely to hold ; nay» after I thought I had hit 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to 
my mind ; but at last I made one that answered indif- 
ferently well ; the main difficulty I found was to make 
it to let down 1 1 could make it spread, but if it did not 
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me 
any way but just over my head, which would not do. 
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer, 
and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it 
cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept off the 
sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the 
hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I 
could before in the coolest ; and when I had no need 
of it, could close it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being 
entirely composed by resigning to the will of God, and 
throwing myself wholly on the disposal of his pl^ 
vidence. This made my life better than sociable : 
for when I began to regret the want of conversation, I 
would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually 
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, 
with even God himself, by ejaculations, was not 
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in 
the world ? 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex- 
traordinary thing happened to me, but I lived on in 
the same course, in the same posture and place, just 
as before ; the chief things I was employed in, besides 
my yearly labor of planting my barley and rice, and 
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up 
just enough to have sufficient stock of one year's pro- 
vision beforehand ; I say, besides this yearly labor, 
and my daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I 
had one labor, to make me a canoe, which at last I 
finished ; so that by digging a canal to it of six feet 
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, 
almost half a mile. As for the first, which was so 
vastly big, as I made it without considering before- 
hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to

146 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the wa- 
ter, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie 
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be 
wiser the next time : indeed, the next time, though I 
could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place 
where I could not get the water to it at any less dis- 
tance than, as I have said, near half a mile, yet as I 
saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over : 
and though I was near two years about it, yet I never 
grudged my labor, in hopes of having a boat to go off 
to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, 
vet the size of it was not at all answerable to the de- 
sign which I had in view when I made the first; I 
mean, of venturing over to the terra firmOy where it 
was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the small- 
ness of my boat assisted to put an end to that de- 
sign, and now I thought no more of it. As I had a 
, boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the 
island; for as I had been on the other side in one 
place, crossing, as I have already described it, over 
the land, so the discoveries I made in that little jour- 
ney made me very eager to see other parts of the 
coast ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing 
but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, that I might do every thing with 
discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast 
in my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the 
pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and of 
which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my 
mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would 
sail very well : then I made 'little lockers, or boxes, 
at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, 
ammunition, &c. into, to be kept dry, either from 
rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little long hollow 
place I cut in the inside of the boat, where Iinpuld 
lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it, to 
keep it dry. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, 
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the 
heat of the sun off me> like an awning : and thus I 
eyery now and then took a little voyage on the sea, 
but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. 
At last, being eager to view the circumference of my 
little kingdom, I resolved on my cruise ; and accord- 
ingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in 
two dozen of loaves (cakes I should rather call them) 
of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a 
food 1 ate a great deal of,) a little bottle of rum, half 
a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two 
larse watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned 
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these 
I took, one to lie on, and the other to cover me in the 
night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of 
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I 
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer 
than I expected ; for though the island itself was not 
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I 
found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues 
into the sea, some above water, some under it ; and 
beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league 
more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to 
sea to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give 
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know- 
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and 
above all, doubting how I should get back again ; so 
I came to an anchor ; for I had made me a kind of an 
anchor with a piece of broken grappling which I got 
out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went 
on shore, climbing up on a hill, which seemed to over-, 
loc^ that point, where I saw the full extent of it, and 
yesolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hilWV!kfctfe\^V»^^^ 



148 LIFB AND ABVENTURBS 

I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious (Cur- 
rent, which ran to the east, and even came close to the 
point ; and I took the more notice of it, because I saw 
there might be some danger, that when I came into it» 
I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and 
not be able to niake the island again : and, indeed, 
had I not got first on this hill, I believe it would have 
been so ; for there was the same current on the other 
side the island, only that it set off at a farther dis- 
tance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the 
shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the 
first current, and I should presently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind 
blowing pretty fresh at IB.S.E. and that being just 
contrary to the said current, made a great breach of 
the sea on the point ; so that it was not safe for me to 
keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go 
too far off because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having 
abated over-night, the sea was calm, and I ventured : 
but I am a warning-piece again to all rash and igno- 
rant pilots ; for no sooner was I come to the point, 
when I was not even my boat's length from the shore, 
but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a 
current like the sluice of a mill ; it carried my boat 
along with it with such violence, that all I could do 
pould not keep her so much as on the edge of it ; but 
I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the 
eddy, which was on my left hand. There was no 
wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my 
paddles signified nothing : and now I began to give 
myself over for lost ; for as the current was on both 
sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues distance 
they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably 
gone ; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it ; so 
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, 
not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of 
starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

(he shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed 
it into the boat ; and I had a great jar of fresh water, 
that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but what was 
all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to 
be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, 
for tL thousand leagues at least ? 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence 
of God to make even the most miserable condition of 
inankind worse. Now I looked back on my deso- 
late solitary island as the most pleasant place in the 
#orld ; and all the happiness my heart could wish for 
was to be but there again. I stretched out my hands 
to it, with eager wishes : " O happy desert !" said I, 
** I shall never see thee more. O miserable creature ! 
whither am I going !" Then I reproached myself 
i^th my unthankful temper, and how I had repined 
kt my solitary condition ; and now what would I give 
to be on shore there again ! Thus we never see the 
true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us 
by its contraries, nor know how to value what we en- 
Joy, but by the want of it. It is scarce possible to 
imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven 
from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now 
to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and 
in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again. 
However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was 
almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the 
northward, that is, towards the side of the current 
which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could ; when 
about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I 
t{iou8:ht I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, 
springing up from S.S.E. this cheered my heart i 
Utile, and especially when, in about half an hour 
more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I was 
got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the 
feai^t cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been 
undone another way too ; for I had no compass on 
board, and should never have knoWn how to ha?(4 



150 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

steered towards the island, if I had but once lost sight 
of it ; but the weather continuing clear, I applied my- 
self to get up my mast again, and spread my sail» 
standing away to the north as much as possible, to 
get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat 
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of 
the water some alteration of the current was near ; for 
where the current was so strong, the water was foul ; 
but perceiving the water clear, I found the current 
abate; and presently I found to the east, at about 
half a mile, a breach of the sea on some rocks: 
these rocks I found caused the current to part agaiOf 
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly, 
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other re- 
turned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong 
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a 
very sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve 
brought to them on the ladder, or to be rescued from 
thieves just going to murder them, or who have been 
in such-like extremities, may guess what my present 
surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat 
into the stream of this eddy ; and the wind also 
' freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running 
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or 
eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way 
back again, directly towards the island, but about two 
leagues more to the northward than the current which 
carried me away at first : so that when I came near 
the island, I found myself open to the northern shore 
of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, oppo- 
site to that which I went out from. 

When I had made something more than a league of 
way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it was 
spent, and served me no farther. However, I found 
^at being between two currents^ viz* that on the south 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 151 

Bide, which had hurried me away, and that on the 
northy which lay about a league on the other side ; I 
say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I 
found the water at least still, and running no way ; 
and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept 
on steering directly for the island, though not making 
such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then 
within a league of the island, I found the point of the 
rocks which occasioned this disaster, stretching out, 
as is described before, to the southward, and casting 
off the current more southerly, had, of course, made 
another eddy to the north ; and this I found very 
strong, but not directly setting the way my course 
lay, which was due west, but almost Full north. HoWi* 
ever, haying a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, 
slanting north-west : and, in about an hour, came 
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being- 
smooth water, I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and 
gave God thanks for my deliyerance, resolving to lay 
aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; and 
refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought 
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had 
npied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, 
being quite spent with the labor and fatigue of the 
voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home 
with my boat : I had run so much hazard, and knew 
too much of the case to think of attempting it by th^ 
way I went out ; and what might be at the other side 
(I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any 
mind to run any more ventures; so I only resolved 
in the morning to make my way westward along" the 
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might 
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if 
I wanted her. In about three miles, ot thereabouts, 
;Qoastin^ the shore, I came to a very good inlet or 



152 LIFE AND ADVBNTURBS 

bay, about a mile oyer, which narrowed till it came to 
a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very 
convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay 
as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose 
for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat 
very safe, I went on shore, to look about me, and see 
where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place 
where I had been before, when I travelled on foot to 
that shore ; so taking nothing out of my boat but my 
gun and umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I beffan 
my march. The way was comfortable enough after 
such a voyase as I had been on, and I reached my 
old bower in the evening, where I found every thing 
standing as I left it ; for I always kept it in good or* 
der, being, as I said before, my country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the 
shade, to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and 
fell asleep : but judge you, if you can, that read my 
story, what a surprise 1 must be in, when I was 
awaked out of my sleep by a voice, calling me by 
my name several times, ** Robin, Robin, Robin Cru- 
soe; poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin 
Crusoe ? Where are you ? Where have you been V* 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued vrith 
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of 
thb day, and with walking the latter part, that I did 
not wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping 
and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spok^ 
to me ; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin 
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake more 
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and 
started up in the utmost consternation ; but no sooner 
were my eyes open, but I saw my Pol sitting on the 
top of the hedge ; and immediately knew it was he 
that spoke to me ; for just in such bemoaning language 
I had used to talk to him, and teach him ; and he had 
learned it «o perfectly, that b« would sit on my finger, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi. 158 

and iay his bill close to my ftice, and cry, " Poor 
Robin Crusoe ! Where are you ? Where have you 
been ? How came you here ?" and such things as I 
had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, 
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good 
while before I could compose myself. JPirst, I was 
amazed how the creature got thither, and then, how 
he should just keep about the place, and no where 
else : but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody 
but honest Pol, I got over it; and holding out my 
hand, and calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable 
creature came to me, and sat on my thumb, as he 
used to do, and continued talking to me. Poor Robiil 
Crusoe ! and how did I come here ? and where had I 
been ? just as if he had been overioyed to see m^ 
again : and so I carried him home along ^th me. 

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some 
time, and had enough to do for many days, to sit stilly 
and reflect on the danger I had been in. I would 
have been very glad to have had my boat again on 
my side of the island ; biit I knew not how it was 
practicable to get it about. As to the east side of 
the island, which I had gone round, I knew well 
enough there was no venturing that way ; my very 
heart would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but 
to think of it ; and as to the other side of the island, 
I did not know how it might be there ; but supposing 
the current ran with the same force against the shori 
at the east ds it passed by it on the other, I might 
mn the same risk of being driven down the stream, 
and carried by the island, as I had been before of 
being carried away from it ; so, with these thoughts, 
X contented myself to be without any boat, though it 
had been the P^o^UHtef ^^ many months' labor to 
make it, and of so ma^lkfore to get it into the settl 

In this government of my temper I remained neat 
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you m^^ 



154 UFE AND ADVENTURES 

well suppose; and my thoughts being very much 
composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in 
resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I 
thought I lived really very happily in all things, ex-* 
oept that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic 
exercises ivhich my necessities put me on applying 
myself to ; and I believe I could, on occasion, have 
made a very good carpenter, especially considering 
how few tools 1 had. 

Besides this, I ieirrived at an unexpected perfection 
in my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to 
make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely 
easier and better ; because I made things round and 
shapable, which before were filthy things indeed to 
look on. But I think I was never more vain of my 
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I 
found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco- 
pipe ; and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing 
when it was done, and only burnt red, like other 
earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would 
draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, 
for I had been always used to smoke : and there were 
pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not think - 
uig that there was tobacco in the island ; and after- 
wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not 
come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and 
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my 
invention showed me ; though not very handsome, yet 
they were such as were very handy and convenient 
for my laying things up in, or fetching things home. 
For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang 
it ap in a tree, fiay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces, 
md bring it home in a basket; and the like by a 
tutle : I could cut it up, take out the eggs,, and a 
WBca or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, 
ipi bring them home in a basket^ and leave the rest 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 165 

behind me. Also large deep baskets were the re- 
ceivers of my corn, which I always rubbed out as 
90on as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great 
baskets. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated con- 
siderably ; this was a want which it was impossible 
for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider 
what I must do when I should have no more powder ; 
that is to say, how J should do to kill any goats. I 
bad, as is observed, in the third year of my being 
here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I 
was in hopes of getting a he-goat : but I could not by 
any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old 
goat; and as I could never find in my heart to kill 
her, she died at last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my residenoe» 
^d, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I 
set myself to study some art to trap and snare the 
goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them 
alive; and particularly, I wanted a she-goat great 
with young. For this purpose, I made snares to 
hamper them ; and I do believe they were more than 
once taken in them ; but my tackle was not good, foir 
I had no wire, and I always found them broken, and 
my bait devoured. At length I resolved to try a pit- 
fall : so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places 
where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over 
those pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too^ 
with a great weight on them ; and several times I put 
ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap ; 
and I could easily .perceive that the goats bed gone 
in and eaten up the corn, for I could see the marks of 
their feet. At length I set three traps in one nighty 
and going the next morning, I found them all stand- 
ing, and yet the bait eaten and gone ; this was yery. 
discouraging. However, I altered my traps; and» 
not to trouble you with particulars, going one mominf^ 
to see my traps, I found in one of them a lar^ o1|L 



145 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

he-goat, and in one of the others three kids, a male 
and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with 
him ; he was so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to 
him ; that is to say, to go about to bring him away 
aliye, which was what I wanted : I could have killed 
him, but that was not my business, nor would it an- 
swer my end ; so I even let him out, and he ran away, 
as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I 
did not then know what I afterwards learned, that hun- 
ger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there three 
or four days without food, and then have carried him 
some water to drink, and theii a little corn, he would 
have been as tame as one of the kids ; for they are 
mighty sagacious tractable creatures, where they are 
well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no 
better at that time : then I went to the three kids, 
and taking them one by one, I tied them with strings 
together, and with some difficulty brought them all 
home. 

It was a good while before they woUld feed ; but 
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and 
they began to be tame. And now I found that if I 
expected to supply myself with goat s flesh when I 
had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame 
was my only way ; when, perhaps, I might have them 
about my house like a flock of sheep. But then it 
occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the' 
wild, or else they would always run wild when they 
grew up : and the only way for this was, to have some 
enclosed piece of ground, well fenced, either with 
hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that 
those within might not break out, or those without 
break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; 
yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing 
il^, my first work was to £nd out a proper piece of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 15? 

giround, where there was likely to be herbage for thesn 
to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep 
tiiem from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures will think 
I bad very little contrivance, when I pitched on a 
plsice very proper for all these, (being a plain open 
piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people 
c^ll it in the western colonies,) which had two or 
tl^ree little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end 
was very woody ; I say, they will smile at my fore- 
cast, when I shall tell them, I began my enclosing 
this piece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge 
or pale must have been at least two miles about. Nor 
was the madness of it so great as to the compass, 
for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time 
enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that my 
goats would be as wild in so much compass as if they 
had had the whole island^ and I should have so much^ 
room to chase thein in, that I should never catch 
them. 

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe 
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me ; 
90 I presently stopped short, and, for the first begin- 
ning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about 150 yards 
Ui length, and 100 yards in breadth; which, as it 
would maintain as many as I should have in any rea- 
sonable time, so, as my stock increased, I could add 
more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to 
work with courage. I was about three months hedg-^ 
ing in the first piece ; and, till I had done it, I te-c 
thered the three kids in the best part of it, and used 
them to feed as near me as possible, to make them 
familiar ; and very often I would go and carry them 
some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed 
therm out of my hand: so that after my enclosure 
was finished, and I let them loose, they would follow 



158 I/IFE AND ADVENTURES 

tne up and down, bleating after me for a handful of 
corn. 

This answered my end ; and in about a year and a 
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and 
all ; and in two years more, I had three and forty, 
besides several that I took and killed for my food. 
After that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to 
feed the'm in, with little pens to drive them into, to 
take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of 
ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's 
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too ; a thing 
which, indeed, in the b^inning, I did not so much as 
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, 
was really an agreeable surprise : for now I set up my 
dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a 
day. And as nature, who gives supplies of food to 
every creature, dictates even naturally how to make 
use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much 
less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, only when 
I was a boy, after a great many essays and miscar- 
riages, made me both butter and cheese at last, and 
also salt (though I found it partly made to my hand 
by the heat of the sun on some of the rocks of the 
sea,) and never wanted it afterwards. How merci- 
fully can our Creator treat his creatures, even in those 
conditions in which they seem to be overwhelmed in 
destruction ! How can he sweeten the bitterest pro- 
vidences, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons 
and prisons ! What a table was here spread for me in 
a wilderness, where I saw nothing, at first, but to pe- 
rish for hunger ! 

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me 
and my little family sit down to dinner : there was my 
majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island ; I had 
the lives of ail my subjects at my absolute command ; 
I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 160 

and no rebels among all my subjects. Then to see 
how like a king I dined too^ all alone, attended by 
my servants ! Pol, as if he had been my favorite, 
was the only person permitted to talk to me. My 
dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, and had 
found no species to multiply his kind on, sat always 
at my right hand ; and two cats, one on one side of 
the table, and one on the other, expecting now and 
then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favor. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought 
on shore at first, for they were both of them dead, and 
had been interred near my habitation by my own 
hand ; but one of them having multiplied by I know 
not what kind of creature, these were two which I 
had preserved tame ; whereas the rest run wild in the 
woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last; 
for they would often come into my house, and plunder 
me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did 
kill a great many ; at length they left me. With this 
attendance, and in this plentiful manner, I lived ; 
neither could I be said to want any thing but society : 
and of that, some time after this, I was like to have 
too much. 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, fee 
have the use of my boat, though very loth to run any 
more hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving 
ways to get her about the island, and at other times I 
sat myself down contented enough without her. But 
I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to 
the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my 
last ramble, I went tip the hill to see how the shore 
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I 
had to do : this inclination increased on me every 
day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by 
land, following the edge of the shore.^ I did so ; but 
had any one in England been to meet such a man as- 
I was, it must either have frightened him, or raised a 
great deal of laughter ; and as I frequently stood still 



1^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion 
of my travelling through Yorkshke with such an equi* 
page, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a 
sketch of my figure, as follows : 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's 
skin, with a fiap hanging down behind, as well to 
keep the sun from me a3 to shoot the rain off from 
running into my neck : nothing being so hurtful in 
these climates as the rain on the fiesh, under the 
clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skurts com- 
ing down to about the middle of the thighs, and a 
pair of open-kneed breeches of the same ; the breeches 
were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair 
hung down such a length on either side, that, like pan- 
taloons, it reached to the middle of my legs ; stockings 
and shoes I had no#e, but had made me a pair of 
somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like 
buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side 
like spatterdashes : but of a most barbarous shape, as 
indeed were all the rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which 
I drew together with two thongs of the same, instead 
of buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on either side of 
this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw 
and a hatchet ; one on one side, and one on the other. 
1 had another belt, not so broad, and fastened in the 
same manner, which hung over my shoulder ; ' and at 
the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, 
both made of goat's skin too ; in one of which hung 
my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I 
caxried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun ; 
and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin 
umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary 
thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for my 
face, the color of it was really not so mulatto-like 
as one might expect from a man not at all careful of 
it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equi- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 161 

nox. My beard I had once suflfered to grow till it 
was about a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both 
scissars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, 
except what grew on my upper lip, which I had 
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such 
as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee ; for the 
Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did : of 
these mustachios or whiskers, I will not say they 
were long enough to hang my hat on them, but 
they were of a length and shape monstrous enough, 
and such as, in England, would have passed for 
frightful. 

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I 
had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of 
consequence ; so I say no more to that part. In this 
kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out 
five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, 
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to 
an anchor, to get on the rocks ; and having no boat 
now to take care of, I went over the land, a nearer 
way, to the same height that I was on before ; when 
looking forward to the point of the rocks which lay 
out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as 
IS said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth 
and quiet ; no rippling, no motion, no current, any 
more there than in any other places. I was at a strange 
loss to understand this, ana resolved to spend some 
time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the 
sets of the tide had occasioned it ; but I was presently 
convinced how it was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting 
from the west, and joining with the current of waters^ 
from some great river on the shore, must be the occa- 
sion of this current ; and that according as the wind 
blew more forcibly from the west, or from the north, 
this current came nearer, or went farther from the 
shore ; for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up* 
to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being 
made, I plainly saw the current again as before, onlY 
VOL. I. \* 



162 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that it ran fastber off, being near half a league {irom 
the shore ; whereas in my case, it set close oo the 
$hore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it ; 
which, at another time, it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing 
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the 
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about the 
island again : but when I began to think of putting it 
in practice, I had such a terror on my spirits at the 
remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I 
could not think of it again with any patience ; but, cm 
the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was 
more safe, though more laborious ; and this was, that 
I would build, or rather make me another periagua or 
canoe ; and so have one for one side of the island, and 
one for the other. 

You are to understand that now I had, as I may 
call them, two plantations in the island ; one, my little 
fortification or tent, with the wall about it, under the 
rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time, I 
had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one 
within another. One of these, which was the driest 
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or 
fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall 
joined to the rock, was all filled up with the large 
earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and 
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would 
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores 
of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut 
off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with 
my hand. 

As forjny wall, made, as before, with long stakes or 
piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by this 
time grown so big, and spread so very much, that 
there was not the least appearance, to any one's view, 
of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the land, and on lower ground, lay my two 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB* 163 

pieces of corn land, which I kept duly cultivated and 
aowed, and which duly yieldea me their harvest in 
its season : and whenever I had occasion for more 
corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country seat ; and I had now 
a tolerahle plantation there also : for, first, I had my 
little hower, as I called it, which I kept in repair ; 
that is to say, I kept the hedge which encircled it in 
constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder 
standing always in the inside : I kept the trees, which 
at first were no more than my stakes, hut were now 
grown very firm and tall, always cut so, that they might 
spread and grow thick and wild, to make the more 
agreeahle shade; which they did effectually to my 
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always 
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles, set 
ttp for that purpose, and which never wanted any 
repair or renewing ; and under this I had made me a 
squab or couch, with the skins of the creatures I had 
killed, and with other soft things ; and a blanket laid 
OB them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I 
had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me ; and 
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my 
ehief seat, I took up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, 
that is to say, my goats ; and as I had taken an in- 
conceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this 
ground, I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the 
goats should break through, that I never left off, till 
with infinite labor I had stuck the outside of the 
hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one an- 
other, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and 
there was scarce room to put a hand through between 
them ; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as 
they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclo- 
sure strong like a wall, — indeed, stronger than any 
wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle^ a!id 



164 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that I spared no pains to bring to pass whaterer ap- 
peared necessary for my comfortable support ; for I 
considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures 
thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, 
milk, butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in 
the place, if it were to be forty years ; and that keep- 
ing them in my reach depended entirely on my per- 
fecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I might 
be sure of keeping them together ; which, by this me- 
thod, indeed, I so effectually secured, that when these 
little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so 
very thick, that I was forced to pull some of them up 
again. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which 
I principally depended on for my winter store of rai- 
sins, and which I never failed to preserve very care- 
fully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my 
whole diet : and indeed they were not only agreeable, 
but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing 
to the last degree. 

As this was also about half-way between my other 
habitation and the place where I had laid up my 
boat, T generally stayed and lay here in my way thi- 
ther ; for I used frequently to visit my boat ; and I 
kept all things about, or belonging to her, in very 
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert 
myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, 
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the 
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out 
of my knowlege again by the currents or winds, or 
any other accident. But now I come to a new scene 
of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards 
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print 
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very 
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thun- 
* dei]3truck, or as if I had seen an apparition ; I list- 
«ied> I looked round me, but I could hear nothing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165 

nor see any thing; I went up tcy a rising ground, to 
look farther; I went up the shore, and down the 
shore, but it was all one ; I could see no other impres- 
sion but that one. I went to it again to see if there 
were any more, aad to observe if it might not be my 
fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there was 
exactly the print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part 
of a foot : how it came thither I knew not, nor could 
I in the least imagine ; but after innumerable flutter- 
ing thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out 
of myself, I came home to my fortification, not feel- 
ing, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to 
the last degree ; looking behind me at every two or 
three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancy- 
ing every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it 
possible to describe how many various shapes my af- 
frighted imagination represented things to me in, how 
many wild ideas were found every moment in my 
fancy, and what strange unaccountable whimsies came 
into my thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called 
it ever after this,) I fled into it like one pursued; 
whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, 
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called 
a door, I cannot remember ; no, nor could I remem- 
ber the next morning ; for never frightened hare fled 
to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind 
than I to this retreat. 

I slept none that night ; the farther I was from 
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen- 
sions were ; which is something contrary to the na- 
ture of such things, and especially to the usual prac- 
tice of all creatures in fear ; but I was so embar- 
rassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that 
I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, 
even though I was now a great way off it. Some- 
times I fancied it must be the Devil, and reason joined 
in with me on this supposition; for how should 



166 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

any other thing in human shape come into the place } 
Where was the vessel that brought them ? What 
marks were there of any other footsteps ? And how 
was it possible a man should come there ? But then 
to think that Satan should take human shape on 
him in such a place, where there could be no manner 
of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot 
behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he 
could not be sure I should see it, — this was an amuse- 
ment the other way. I considered that the Devil 
might have found out abundance of other ways to 
have terrified me than this of the single print of a 
foot ; that as I lived quite on the other side of the 
island, he would never have been so simple as to 
leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to 
one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the 
sand too, which the first surge of the sea, on a high 
wind, would have defaced entirely : all liiis seemed 
inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the 
notions we usually entertain of the subtilty of the 
Devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue 
me out of all apprehensions of its being the Devil ; 
and I presently concluded that it must be some more 
dangerous creature, viz. that it must be some of the 
savages of the main land over against me, who had 
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and either driven 
by the currents or by contrary winds, had made the 
island, and had. been on shore, but were gone away 
again to sea ; being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed 
in this desolate island as I would have been to have 
had them. 

While these reflections were rolling on my mind, 
I was very thankful in my thoughts that I was so 
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that 
they did not see my boat, by which they would have 
concluded that some inhabitants had been in the 
plsice, and perhaps have searched farther for me : 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 167 

then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about 
their having found my boat, and that there were people 
here; and that if so, I should certainly have them 
come again in greater numbers, and devour me ; that 
if it should happen so that they should not find me^ 
yet they would find my enclosure^ destroy all my 
corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and 
I should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all 
that former confidence in God, which was founded 
on such wonderful experience as I had had of his 
goodness, as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto 
could not preserve, by his power, the provision which 
he had made for me by his goodness. I reproached 
myself with my laziness, that would not sow any more 
corn one year than would just serve me till the next 
season, as if no accident would intervene to prevent 
my enjoying the crop that was on the ground; and 
this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for 
the future to have two or three years' corn before- 
hand ; so that whatever might come, I might not 
perish for want of bread. 

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the 
life of man ! and by what secret different springs are 
the affections hurried about, as different circumstances 
present ! To-day we love what to morrow we hate ; 
to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun ; to-day we 
desire what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at 
the apprehensions of; this was exemplified in me, at 
this time, in the most lively manner imaginable ; for 
I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished 
from human society, that I was alone, circumscribed 
by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and 
coiidemned to what I called silent life ; that I was 
as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-'' 
bered among the living, or to appear among the rest 
of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own 
species would have seemed to me a raising me from 



168 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

death to life, and the greatest blessing that Heaven 
itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could 
bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the 
very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready 
to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent 
appearance of a man's having set his foot on the 
island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life ; and it af- 
forded me a great many curious speculations after- 
wards, when I had a little recovered my first sur- 
prise. I considered that this was the station of life 
the infinitely wise and good providence of God had 
determined for me ; that as I could. not foresee what 
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I 
was not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his 
creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to 
govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought 
fit ; and who, as I was a creature that had offended 
him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn me to 
what punishment he thought fit ; and that it was my 
part to submit to bear his indignation, because I had 
sinned against him. I then reflected, that as God, 
who was not only righteous, but omnipotent, had 
thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was 
able to deliver me ; that if he did not think fit to do 
so; it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself ab- 
solutely and entirely to his will; and, on the other 
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to 
him, and quietly to attend the dictates and directions 
of his daily providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, 
I may say, weeks and months; and one particular 
effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot 
omit : One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled 
with thoughts about my danger from the appearances 
of savages, I found it discomposed me very much ; on 
which these words of the Scripture came into my 
thoughts, /'Call upon/ne in the day of trouble, and I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." On 
this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was 
not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged 
to pray earnestly to God for deliverance : when I had 
done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to 
read, the first words that presented to me were, 
** Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and he 
shall strengthen thy heart ; wait, I say, on the Lord." 
It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me. 
In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and was 
no more sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, 
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, 
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and 
that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when 
I came on shore from my boat : this cheered me up a 
little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a 
delusion ; that it was nothing else but my own foot : 
and why might I not come that way from the boat, as 
well as I was going that way to the boat ? Again, I 
considered also, that I could by no means tell for 
certain where I had trod, and where I had not ; and 
that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, 
I had played the part of those fools who try to make 
stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are 
frightened at them more than any body. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad 
again, for 1 had not stirred out of my castle for three 
days and nights, so that I began to starve for pro- 
visions ; for I had little or nothing within doors but 
some barley-cakes and water: then I knew that my 
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my 
evening diversion ; and the poor creatures were in 
great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, 
indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost 
dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, therefore, 
with the belief that this was nothing but the print of 
oae of my own feet^ and that I might be truly said 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 171 

and still be prompted to frequeitt the island : then to 
demolish my bower and tent, that they might not sea 
any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look 
farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subjects of the first night's cogita* 
tions after I was come home again, while the appre- 
hensions which had so overru^ my mind were ^4.h 
on me, and my head was full of vapours, as above. 
Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terri- 
fying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes ; 
and ve find the burthen of anxiety greater, by much, 
than the evil which we are anxious about : and, what 
was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this 
trouble from the resignation I used to practise, that I 
hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who 
complained not only that the Philistines were on him, 
but that God had forsaken him ; for I did not now 
fake due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God 
in my distress, and resting on his providence, as I 
had done before, for my defence and deliverance; 
which, if I had done, I had at least been more 
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and per- 
haps carried through it with more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all 
night ; but in the morning I fell asleep ; and having, 
by the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, tired, 
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and 
waked much better composed than I had ever been 
before. And now I began to think sedately; and, on 
the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that this 
idiand, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and 
no farther from the main land than as I had seen, was 
not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine ; that 
although there were no stated inhabitants who lived 
on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come 
boats off from the shore, who, either with design, or 
perhaps never but when they were driven by cross 
windsy might come to this place ; that I had lived 



172 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least 
shadow or figure of any people yet ; and that if at any 
time they should he driven here, it was probable they 
went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing 
they had never thought fit to fix here on any occa- 
sion ; that the most I could suggest any danger from, 
was from any casual accidental landing of straggling 
people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they 
were driven hither, were here against their wills, so 
they made no stay here, but went off again with all 

{possible speed ; seldom staying one night on shore, 
est they should not have the help of the tides and 
daylight back again ; and that, therefore, I had no- 
thing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case 
I should see any savages land on the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my 
cave so large as to bring a door through again, which 
door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortifica- 
tion joined to the rock. On maturely considering this, 
therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, 
in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from 
my wall, just where I had planted a double row of 
trees about twelve years before, of which I made 
mention : these trees having been planted so thick be- 
fore, they wanted but few piles to be driven between 
them, that they might be thicker and stronger, and my 
wall would be soon finished : so that I had now a 
double wall ; and my outer wall was thickened with 
pieces of timber, old cables, and every thing I could 
think of, to make it strong ; having in it seven little 
holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In 
the inside of this, I thickened my wall to about ten 
feet thick, with continually bringing earth out of my 
cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walk- 
ing on it ; and through the seven holes I contrived to 
plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had 

!^ot seven on shore out of the ship ; these I planted 
ike my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven 
guns in two minutes' time : this wall I was many a 
weary month in finishing, and yet never thought my- 
self safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground with- 
out my wall, for a great length every way, as full 
with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like wood, which 
I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand ; in- 
somuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty 
thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be- 
tween them and my wall, that I might have room to 
see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from 
the young trees, if they attempted to approach my 
outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and 
in five or six years' time I had a wood before my 
dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, 
that it was indeed perfectly impassable ; and no men, 
of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there 
was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As 
for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and 
out (for I left no avenue,) it was by setting two lad- 
ders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and 
then broke in, and left room to place another ladder 
on that; so when the two ladders were taken down, 
no man living could come down to me without doing 
himself mischief; and if they had come down, they 
were still on the outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudenoe 
could suggest for my own preservation ; and it will 
be seen, at length, that they were not altogether with- 
out just reason ; though I foresaw nothing at that 
time more than my mere fear siiggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether care- 
less of my other affairs ; for I had a great concern on 
me for my little herd of goats ; they were not only a 
ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to 
be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder 



174 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

and shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after 
the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the advan- 
tage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over 
again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could 
think of but two ways to preserve them : one was, to 
find another convenient place to dig a cave under 
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and 
the other was, to enclose two or three little bits of 
land, remote from one another, and as much con- 
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half a 
dozen young goats in each place ; so that if any disas- 
ter happened to the flock in general, I might be able 
to raise them again with little trouble and time : and 
this, though it would require a great deal of time and 
labor, I thought was the most rational design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the 
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched on 
one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart could 
wish for : it was a little damp piece of ground, in the 
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is 
observed, I almost lost myself once before, endea- 
vouring to come back that way from the eastern part 
of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, 
near three acres, so surrounded with woods that it was 
almost an enclosure by nature; at least it did not 
want near so much labor to make it so as the other 
pieces of grolind I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of 
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so 
fenced it round, that my flock, or herd, call it which 
you please, which were not so wild now as at first they 
might be supposed to be, were well enough secured in 
it : so, without any farther delay, I removed ten young 
she-goats and two he-goats to this piece ; and when 
they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till 
I had made it as secure as the other ; which, how- 
ever^ I did at more leisure, and it took me up more 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 

time by a great deal. All this labor I was at the 
ezpease of, purely from my apprehensions on the ac- 
count of the print of a man's K>ot which I had seen ; 
for, as yet, I never saw any human creature come 
near the island ; and I had now lived two years under 
|his uneasiness, which, indeed, made my life much 
IjBss comfortable than it was before, as may be well 
imagined by any who know what it is to live in the 
constant snare of the fear of man. And this I must 
observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of my 
mind had too great impressions also on the religious 
part of my thoughts : for the dread and terror of fall- 
ing into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so on 
my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due tem- 
per for application to my Maker, at least not with the 
sedatil calmness and resignation of soul which I was 
wont to do : I rather prayed to God as under great 
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with dan- 
ger, and in expectation every night of being murdered 
and devoured before morning; and I must testify 
from my experience, that a temper of peace, thank- 
fulness, love, and affection, is much the more proper 
frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure ; 
and that under the dread of mischief impending, a 
man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the 
duty of praying to God, than he is for a repentance 
on a sick bed; for these discomposures affect the 
mind, as the others do the body ; and the discompo- 
sure of the mind must necessarily be as great a dis- 
ability as that of the body, and much greater ; pray- 
ing to God being properly an act of the mind, not of 
the body. 

But to go on : after I had thus secured one part of 
my little living stock, I went about the whole island, 
searching for another private place to make such an- 
other deposit; when, wandering more to the west 
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and 
looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat on the sea 



176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

at a great distance. I had found a perspective-glass 
or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved 
out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and 
this was- so remote, that I could not tell what to 
make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were 
not able to hold to look any longer : whether it was a 
boat or not, I do not know, but as I descended from 
the hill I could see no more of it ; so I gave it over ; 
only I resolved to go no more out without a perspec- 
tive-glass in my pocket. When I was come down 
the hill to the end of the island, where, indeed, I had 
never been before, I was presently convinced that the 
seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange 
thing in the island as I imagined : and, but that it 
was a special providence that I was cast on the side 
of the island where the savages never came, I Aould 
easily have known that nothing was more frequent 
than for the canoes from the main, when they hap- 
pened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to 
that side of the island for harbour : likewise, as they 
often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, 
having taken any prisoners, would bring them over to 
this shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, 
being ^all cannibals, they would kill and eat them ; of 
which hereafter. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I 
said above, being the S.W. point of the island, I was 
perfectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it possible 
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing 
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other 
bones of human bodies ; and particularly I observed 
a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle 
dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where I supposed 
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman 
feastings on the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, 
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself 
from it for ^ long while : all my apprehensions weie 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. l77 

buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish 
brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human 
nature, which, though I had heard of it often, yet I 
never had so near a view of before : in short, I turned > 
away my face from the horrid spectacle ; my stomach 
grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, 
when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach; 
and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a 
little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place 
a moment; so I got me up the bill again with all the 
speed I could, and walked on towards my own habi- 
tation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, 
I stood still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering 
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my 
soul, tod, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God 
thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the 
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful 
creatures as these ; and that, though I had esteemed 
my present condition very miserable, had yet given 
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to 
give thanks for than to complain of : and this, above 
all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been 
comforted with the knowlege of Himself, and the 
hope of His blessing ; which was a felicity more than 
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had 
suffered, or could suffer. 

In this fratne of thankfulness, I went home to my 
castle, and began to be much easier now as to the< 
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before': 
for I observed that these wretches never came to this 
island in search of what they could get ; perhaps not 
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any thing 
here ; and having often, no doubt, been up in the 
covered, woody part of it, without finding any thing 
to their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost 
eighteen years, and never saw the least fo#t|teps of hu- 
miiii creature there before; and I might b^ eighteen' 

VOL. I. VL 



X?C^ XIFB AND ADVENTURES 

years more as entirely concealed as I was now^ if I 
did not discover myself to them, which I had no m^in-' 
ner of occasion to do ; it being my only business to 
keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I 
found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make 
myself known to. Yet I entertained such an abhor- 
rence of the savage wretches that I have been speak- 
ing of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their 
devouring and eating one another up, that I continued 
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle 
for almost two years after this ; when I say my own 
circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my 
castle, my country-seat, which I called my bower, 
and my enclosure in the woods : nor did I look after 
this for any other use than as an enclosure for my 
goats ; for the aversion which nature gave me t9 these 
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of 
seeing them as of seeing the Devil himself. I did not 
so much as go to look after my boat all this time, but 
began rather to think of making me another ; for I 
could not think of ever making any more attempts to 
bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I 
should meet with some of these creatures at sea ; in 
which if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, 
I knew what would have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I 
was in no danger of being discovered by these people, 
began to wear off my uneasiness about them ; and I 
b^an to live just in the same composed manner as 
before; only with this difference, that I used more 
caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than I did 
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of 
them ; and particularly, I was niore cautious of firing 
my gun, lest any of them being on the island should 
happen to hear it. It was therefore a very good pro- 
vidence to me that I had furnished myself with a 
tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt 
any more about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if L 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOEr 379 

did catch any of them after this, it was by traps and 
snares, as I had done before : so that for two years after 
this, I believe I never fired my gun off once, though 
I never went out without it ; and which was more, as 
I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always 
carried them out with me, or at least two of them, 
sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I also furbished 
up one of the great .cutlasses that I had out of the 
ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also ; so 
that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at 
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-^ 
tion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a 
great broad-sword hanging at my side in a belt, but 
without a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, 
I seenlbd, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to 
to my former calm sedate way of living. AW these 
things tended to show me, more and more, how far my 
condition was from being miserable, compared to some 
others ; nay, to many other particulars of life, which 
it might have pleased God to have made my lot. It 
put me on reflecting how little repining there would 
be among mankind at any condition of life, if people 
would rather compare their condition with those that 
were worse, in order to be thankful, than be always 
comparing them with those which are better, to assist 
their murmurings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really 
many things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought 
that the frights I had been in about these savage 
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own 
preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention 
for my own conveniences ; and I had dropped a good 
design, which I had once bent my thoughts too much 
on, and that was, to try if I could not make some of 
my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself 
some beer. This was really a whimsical thought, 
and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it ; 
for I presently saw there would be the yf%Xk\. ^i ^i^^^\^ 



IQO UFE AND ADVENTURES 

things necessary to the making my beer, that it would 
be impossible for me to supply : as, first, casks to 
preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have ob- 
served already, I could never compass ; no, though I 
spent not only many days, but weeks, nay, months, in 
attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, 
I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it 
work, no copper or kettle to make it boil ; and 
yet, with all these things wanting, I verily be- 
lieve, had not the frights and terrors I was in about 
the savages intervened, I had undertaken it, and 
perhaps brought it to pass too ; for I seldom ' gave 
any thing over without accomplishing it, when once 
I had it in my head to begin it. But my inven-- 
tion now ran quite another way ; for, night and day, 
I could think of nothing but how I might destroy 
some of these monsters in their cruel, bloody enter- 
tainment, and, if possible, save the victim they should 
bring hither to destroy. It would take up a lai^r 
volume than this whole work is intended to be, to set 
down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded 
on, in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, 
or at least frightening them so as to prevent their 
coming hither any more : but all this was abortive ; 
nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was 
to be there to do it myself : and what could one man 
do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty 
or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their 
bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as true 
to a mark as I could with my gun ? 

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the 
place where they made their fire, and putting in five or 
six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled 
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up 
all that was near it : but as, in the first place, I should 
be unwilling to waste so much powder on them, my 
store being now within the quantity of one barrel, so 
neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain 
time, wheu it might surprise them ; and^ at best> that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 18l 

it would do little more than just blow the fire about 
their ears, and fright them, but not sufficient to make 
ihem forsake the place : so I laid it aside ; and then 
proposed that I would place myself in ambush in 
some convenient place, with my three guns all double 
loaded, and, in the middle of their bloody ceremony^ 
let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound 
perhaps two or three at every shot ; and then falling 

• in on them with my three pistols and my sword, I 
made no doubt but that if there were twenty I should 
kill them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for 
some weeks ; and I was so full of it, that I often 
dreamed of it, and sometimes that I was just going to 
let fly at them in my sleep. I went so far with it in 
my imagination, that I employed myself several days 
to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade » 
as I said, to watch for them ; and I went frequently 
to the place itself, which was now grown more fami- 
liar to me : but while my mind was thus filled with 
thoughts of revenge, and a bloody putting twenty or 
thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the hor- 
ror I had at the place, and at the signals of the bar- 
barous wretches devouring one another, abetted my 
malice. Well, at length, I found a place in the side 
of the hill, where I was satisfied I might securely 
wait till I saw any of their boats coming ; and might 
then, even before they would be ready to come on 
shore, convey myself, unseen, into some thickets of 
trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough 
to conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and 
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim 
«t their heads, when they were so close together as 
that it would be next to impossible that I should miss 
my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four 
of them at the first shot. In this place, then, I re- 
solved to fix my design ; and, accordingly, I pre- 
pared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. 

. .The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs jBach, 



182 UPB AND ADVENTURES ^ 

find four or five smaller bullets, about the size of 
pistol-bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded with 
near a handful of swan-shot, of the largest size : I 
also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each ; 
and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for 
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my 
expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, 
in my imagination, put it in practice, I continually 
made my tour every morning up to the top of the 
hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about 
three miles, or more, to see if I could observe any 
boats on the sea, coming near the island, or staiuL- 
ing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard 
duty, after I had, for two or three months, constantly 
^ept my watch, but came always back without any 
discovery ; there having not, in all that time, been the 
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but 
on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could 
reach every way. 

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look 
jout, so long also I kept up the vigor of my design, 
and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable 
tform for so outrageous an execution as the killing 
twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which 
I had not at all entered into a discussion of in my 
thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first 
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural cus- 
tom of the people of that country ; who, it seems, had 
been suffered by Providence, in his wise disposition of 
the world, to have no other guide than that of their 
; own abominable and vitiated passions ; and, conse- 
quently, were left, and perhaps had been so for some 
ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dread- 
ful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned 
by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, 
could have run them into. But now, when, as I hare 
.said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE,' l8S 

which I had made so long and so far every morning 
in Tain, so my opinion of the action itself began to 
alter ; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, 
to consider what I was going to engage in ; what au* 
thority or call I had to pretend to be judge and exe* 
cutioner on these men as criminals, whom Heaven 
had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpu- 
nislied, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execution- 
ers of his judgments one on another. How far 
these people were offenders against me, and what right 
I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which 
■they shed promiscuously on one another, I debated 
this very often with myself, thus : How do I know 
what God himself judges in this particular case ? It 
is certain these people do not commit this as a crime ; 
it is not against their own consciences reproving, or 
their light reproaching them; they do not know it to 
be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of di«- 
vine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we com- 
mit. They think it no more a crime to kill a captive 
taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat 
human flesh than we do to eat mutton. 

When I considered this a little, it followed neces- 
sarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it ; that 
these people were not murderers in the sense that I 
had before condemned them in my thoughts, any 
more than those Christians were murderers who often 
put to death the prisoners taken in battle ; or more 
frequently, on many occasions, put whole troops of 
men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they 
threw down their arms and submitted. In the next 
place, it occurred to me, that although the usage they 
gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet 
it was really nothing to me ; these people had done 
me no injury : that if they attempted me, or I saw it 
necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall on 
them, something might be said for it ; but that I was 
yet out of their power, and they really had no know* 



184 UFB A17D ADVBNTURBS 

Jedge of me, and consequently no design on jne ; end 
therefore it could not be just for me to fall on tltem; 
that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards 
in all their barbarities practised in America, where 
they destroyed millions of these people ; who, howeyer 
they were idolaters and barbarians, and had several 
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as 
sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to 
the Spaniards, very innocent people ; and that the 
rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the 
utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spa^ 
niards themselves at this time, and by all other Chns«* 
tian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody 
and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to 
God or man ; and for which the very name of a Spar 
liiard is r.eckoned to be frightful and terrible to all 
people of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if 
the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for 
the produce of a race of men who were without prin^ 
ciples of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to 
the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of 
generous temper in the mind. 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and 
to a kind of a full stop ; and I began, by little and 
little, to be off my design, and to conclude I had 
taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the 
savages ; and that it was not my business to meddle 
with them, unless they first attacked me ; and this it 
was my business, if possible, to prevent ; but that if I 
were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my 
duty. On the other hand, I argued with myself, that 
this really was the way not to deliver myself, but en* 
tirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was 
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore 
at that time, but that should ever come on shore after- 
wards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country- 
people what had happened, they would come over 
again by thousands to revenge the death of their fel- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 166 

lows, and I should only bring on myself a certain 
deHtraetion, which, at present, I had no manner of 
oecasion for. On the whole, I concluded that neither 
in principle nor in policy I ought, one way or other, 
to concern myself in this affair ; that my business was, 
by all possible means, to conceal myself from them, 
and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by 
that there were any living creatures on the island, I 
jnean of human shape. Religion joined in with this 
prudential resolution; and I was convinced now, 
many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when 
I was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruc* 
tion of innocent creatures, I mean innocent as to me. 
As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one 
another, I had nothing to do with them ; they were 
national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of 
God, who is the governor of nations, and knows how, 
by national punishments, to make a just retribution 
for national offences, and to bring public judgments 
on those who offend in a public manner, by such 
ways as best pl^ease him. Ihis appeared so clear to 
me now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to mo 
than that I had not been suffered to do a thing which 
I now saw so much reason to believe would have 
been no less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had 
committed it ; and I gave most humble thanks on my 
knees to God, that had thus delivered me from bloocU 
guiltiness ; beseeching him to grant me the protection 
of his providence, that I might not fall into the hands 
of the barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands 
on them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven 
to do it, in defence of my own life. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year 
after this ; and so far was I from desiring an occasion 
for falling on these wretches, that in all that time 
I never once went up the hill to see whether there 
were any of them in sight, or to know whether any 
of them had been on shore there or not, that I might 



186 LIFE AND ADVENTURBS 

not be tempted to renew any of my cobtrivanM 
against them, or be provoked, by any advantage 
which might present itself, to fall on them : only 
.this I did, I went and removed my boat, which I 
|iad on the other side of the island, and carried it 
down to the east end of the whole island, where I 
ran it into a little cove, which I found under some 
high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the cur- 
rents, the savages durst not, at least would not come; 
with their boats, on any account whatever. With 
my boat £ carried away every thing that I had left 
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the 
bare going thither, viz. a mast and sail which I had 
made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, 
indeed, could not be called either anchor or grapnel ; 
however, it was the best I could make of its kind : 
all these I removed, that there might not be the least 
shadow of any discovery, or any appearance of any 
boat, or of any human habitation, on the island. Be- 
sides this, I kept myself, as [ said, more retired than 
ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than on 
my constant employment, viz. to milk my she-goats, 
and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as At 
was quite on the other part of the island, was quite 
out of danger ; for certain it is, that these savage 
people, who sometimes haunted this island, never 
came with any thoughts of finding any thing here, 
and consequently never wandered off from the coast ; 
and I doubt not but they might have been several 
times on shore after my apprehensions of them had 
made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed, I looked 
back with some horror on the thoughts of what my 
condition would have been if I had chopped on 
them, and been discovered before that, when, naked 
and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded 
often only with small shot, I walked every where, 
peeping and peering about the island to see what I 
could get ; what a surprise should I have been in, if. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 187 

when I discoYered the print of a man's foot, I had, 
instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and 
found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their 
running, no possibility of my escaping them ! The 
thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within 
me, and distressed my mind so much, that I could 
not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, 
and how I should not only have been unable to resist 
them, but even should not have had presence of mind 
enough to do what I might have done ; much less 
what now, after so much consideration and prepara* 
tion, I might be able to -do. Indeed, after serious 
thinking of these things, I would be very melancholy^ 
and sometimes it would last a great while ; but I re* 
solved it all, at last, into thankfulness to that Provi- 
dence which had delivered me from so many unseen 
dangers, and had kept from me those mischiefs which 
I could have no way been the agent in delivering 
myself from, because I had not the least notion of 
any such thing depending, or the least supposition 
of its being possible. This renewed a contempla- 
tion which often had come to my thoughts in former 
time, when first I began to see the merciful dispo* 
sitions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in 
this life ; how wonderfully we are delivered wheil 
we know nothing of it ; how, when we are in a quan- 
dary, (as we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to 
go this way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct us 
this way, when we intended to go that way: nay, 
when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps busi* 
ness, has called to go the other way, yet a strange 
impression on the mind, from we know not what 
springs, and by we know not what power, shall over«> 
rule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards ap- 
pear, that had we gone that way which we should 
have gone, and even to our imagination ought to have 
gone, we should have been ruined and lost. On 
these, and .many like reflections, I afterwards made 



188 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found thoJBd 
secret hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not doing 
any thing that presented, or going this way or that 
way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate ; though 
I knew no other reason for it than that such a pres-» 
sure or such a hint hung on my mind. I could give 
many examples of the success of this conduct in the 
course of my life, but more especially in the latter 
part of my inhabiting this unhappy island ; besides 
many occasions which it is very likely I might have 
taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then 
that I see with now. But it is never too late to be 
wise ; and I cannot but advise all considering men, 
whose lives are attended with such extraordinary in* 
cidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, 
not to slight such secret intimations of Providence, 
let them come from what invisible intelligence they 
will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot 
account for ; but certainly they are a proof of the 
converse of spirits, and a secret communication be- 
tween those embodied and those unembodied, and 
such a proof as can never be withstood ; of which I 
shall have occasion to give some very remarkable in- 
stances in the remainder of my solitary residence in 
this dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange 
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dan- 
gers I lived in, and the concern .that was now on 
me, put an end to all invention, and to all the con- 
trivances that I had laid for my future accommoda- 
tions and conveniences. I bad the care of my safety 
more now on my hands than that of my food. I 
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood 
now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard : 
much less would I fire a gun, for the same reason : 
and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making 
any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great 
distance in the day, should betray me. For this 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

reasoh I removed that part of my business nrhich re-* 
quired fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c« 
into my new apartment in the woods ; where, after I 
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable con* 
solation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went 
in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had 
he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to 
venture in ; nor, indeed, would any man else, but 
one who, like roe, wanted nothing so much as a safe 
retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a 
great rock, where by mere accident (I would say, if I 
did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such things 
now to Providence,) I was cutting down some thick 
branches of trees to make charcoal ; and before I go 
on, I must observe the reason of my making this char- 
coal, which was thus : I was afraid' of making a smoke 
about my habitation,' as I said before ; and yet I 
(20uld not live there without baking my bread, cook- 
ing my meat, &c. ; so I contrived to bum some wood 
here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it 
became chark, or dry coal : and then putting the fire 
out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perfonn 
the other services for which fire was wanting, without 
danger of smoke. * But this is by the by : — While I 
was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that 
behind a very thick branch of low brushwood, or 
underwood, there was a kind of hollow place : I was 
curious to look in it, and getting with difficulty into 
the mouth of it, I found it was pretty large ; that is 
to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and 
perhaps another with me : but I must confess to you 
that I made more haste out than I did in, when, look- 
ing farther into the place, and which was perfectly 
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, 
whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled 
like two stars ; the dim light from the cave's mouth 
riiining directly in, and making the reflection^ How* 



190 UFE AND ADVENTURES 

ever, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began 
to call myself a thousand fools, and to think, that he 
that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live 
twenty years in an island all alone ; and that I might 
well think there was nothing in this cave that was 
more frightful than myself. On this, plucking up my 
courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed again^ 
with the stick flaming in my hand : I had not gone 
three steps in, but £ was almost as much frightened as 
I was before ; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that 
€i a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken 
noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh 
again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck with 
such a surprise, that put me into a cold sweat ; and if 
I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it^ 
that my hair might not have lifted it off. But still 
plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encou- 
raging myself a little with considering that the power 
and presence of God was every where, and was able 
to protect me ; on this I stepped forward again, and 
by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little 
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most mon- 
strous, frightful^ old he-goat, just making his will, as 
we say, and gasping for life ; and dying, indeed, of 
mere old age. I stirred him a little to see if I could 
get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not 
able to raise himself; and I thought with myself he 
might even lie there ; for if he had frightened me, so 
he would certainly fright any of the savages, if any 
one of them should be so hardy as to come in there 
while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began 
to look round me, when I found the cave was but 
very small, that is to say, it might be about' twelve 
feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round 
nor square, no hands having ever been employed in 
making it but those of mere Nature. I observed also 
that there was a place at the feurtber side of it that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19t 

went in further, but was so low that it required me to 
creep on my hands and knees to go into it, and wbi* 
ther it went I knew not : so haying no candle, I gave 
it over for that time ; but resolved to come again tlra 
next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box^ 
which I had made of the lock of one of the muskets^ 
with some wild fire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with 
six large candles of my own making (for I made very 
good candles now of goats' tallow, but was hard set 
for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, 
and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles ;) 
and going into this low place, I was obliged to creep: 
on all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards; which^ 
by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough^ 
considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor 
what was beyond it. When I had got through the 
strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe neap 
twenty feet ; but never was such a glorious sight seen 
in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the 
sides and roof of this vault or cave ; the wall reflected 
an hundred thousand lights to me from my two can- 
dles. What it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or 
any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather sup- 
posed it to be, I knew not. The place I was in was a 
most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind, as could 
be expected, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry 
and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel on it^ 
so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to 
be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the 
sides or roof: the only difficulty in it was the en- 
trance; which, however, as it was a place of security^ 
and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a 
convenience ; so that I was really rejoiced at the dis-«, 
CO very, and resolved, without any delay, to bring 
some of those things which 1 was most anxious about 
to this place ; particularly, I resolved to bring hither 
my magazine of powder^ and all my spar^ arms^ vizr 



102 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

two fowliDg-pieces, for I had three in all, and three 
muskets, tor of them I had eight in all; so I kept 
at my castle only five, which stood ready- mounted, 
like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence ; and 
vere ready also to take out on any expedition. On 
Ihb occasion of removing my ammunition, I happened 
to open the barrel of powder, which I took up out of 
the sea, and which had been wet ; and I found that 
the water had penetrated about three or four inches 
into the powder on every side, which, caking, and 
lowing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel 
in the shell ; so that I had near sixty pounds of very 
good powder in the centre of the cask : this was a 
very agreeable discovery to me at that time ; so I car- 
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or three 
pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a 
surprise of anv kind : I also carried thither all the 
lead I had leu for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, 
which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, 
where none could come at them ; for I persuaded my- 
^f» while I was here, that if five hundred savages 
W«f« to hunt me, they could never find me out ; or, if 
lltf-y did, they would not venture to attack me here. 
XW old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the 
guijyylh of the cave the next day after I made this dis- 
fgverv : and I found it much easier to dig a great hole 
^f^v' and throw him in and cover him with earth, 
lo drag him out ; so I interred him there, to pre-

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 198 

aIso arrived to some little diversions and amusements, 
which made the time pass a ^eat deal more plea- 
santly with me than it did before : as, first, I had 
taught my Pol, as I noted before, to speak ; and he 
did it so faniiliarly, and talked so articulately and 
plain, that it was very pleasant to me ; for I believe 
no bird ever spoke plainer ; and he lived with me no 
less than six-and-twenty years: how long he might 
have lived afterwards I know not, though I know 
they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a 
hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and 
loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years 
of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for 
my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that 
degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at 
first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had ; 
but at length, when the two old ones I brought with 
me were gone,^ and after some time continually driving 
them from me, and letting them have no provision 
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two 
or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose 
young, when they had any, I always drowned ; and 
these were part of my family. Besides these, I always 
kept two or three household kids about me, whom I 
taught to feed out of my hand ; and £ had two more 
parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call 
Kobin Crusoe, but none like my first ; nor, indeed, 
did I take the pains with any of them that I had done 
with him. I had also several tame sea>fowls, whose 
names I knew not, that I caught on the shore, and 
cut their wings ; and the little stakes which I had 
planted before my castle wall being now grown up to 
a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among. these 
low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable 
to me ; so that, as I said above, I began to be very, 
well contented with the life I led, if I could have 
been secured from the dread of the savages. But it 
WE8 otherwise directed ; and it may not be amiss for 

VOL. I. V. 



194 LIFB AND ADVENTI7RBS 

all people who shall meet with my story, to make 
this just observation from it, viz. How frequently, in 
the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek 
most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is 
the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means 
or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be 
raised again from the aiBiction we are fallen into. I 
could give many examples of this in the course of my 
unaccountable life ; but in nothing was it more parti- 
cularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last 
years of solitary residence in this island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said 
above, in my twenty-third year ; and this, being the 
southern solstice (for winter I cannot call it), was the 
particular time of my harvest, and required my being 
pretty much abroad in the fields : when going out 
pretty early in the morning, even before it was tho« 
rough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of 
some fire on the shore, at a distance from roe of about 
two miles, towards the end of the island where I had 
observed some savages had been, as before, and not 
on the other side ; but to my great affliction, it was oH 
my side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and 
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out^ 
lest I might be surprised, and yet I had no more 
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if 
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find 
my corn standing or cut, or any of my works and 
improvements, they would immediately conclude that 
there were people in the place, and would then never 
give over till they had found me out. In this extre- 
mity, I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the 
ladder after me, and made all things without look as 
wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a 
posture of defence: 1 loaded all my cannon, as I 
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 195 

niouiited on my new fortification » and all my pistols, 
and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp ; not 
forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine 
protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me 
out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in 
this posture about two hours ; and began to be mighty 
impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to 
send out. After sitting a while longer, and musing 
what I should do in this, I was not able to bear sit- 
ting in ignorance any longer ; so setting up my ladder 
to the side of the hill, where there was a fiat place, as 
I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up 
after me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of 
the hill ; and pulling out my peri4>ective-glass, which I 
had taken on purpose, I laid me down fiat on my 
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place; 
J presently found there were no less than nine naked 
savages, sitting round a small fire they had made, not 
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the wea« 
ther being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dresS 
some of their barbarous diet of human fiesh, which 
they had brought with them, whether alive or dead^ I 
could not tell. 

They had two canoes with thenr, which they had 
hauled up on the shore ; and as it was then tide of 
ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return of the 
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine 
what confusion this sight pnt me into, especially seeing 
them come on my side of the island, and so near me 
too ; but when I considered their coming must be 
always with the current of the ebb, I began after- 
wards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied 
that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the 
tide of flood, if they were not on shore before : and 
having made this observation, I went abroad about my 
harvest- work with, the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the 
tide made to the weatwara, I saw them all take boat, 



106 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

• 

and row (or paddle, as we call it) away. I should 
have obseryed, that for an hour or more before they 
went off, they went a dancing ; and I could easily dis- 
cern their postures and gestures by my glass. I could 
not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they 
were stark naked, and had not the least covering on 
them ; but whether they were men or women, I 
could not distinguish. 

. Aa soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took' 
two guns on my shoulders, and two pistols in my 
girdle, . and my great sword by my side, without a 
scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make, 
went away to the hill where I had discovered the first 
appearance of all ; and as soon as I got thither, which 
was not in less than two hours (for I could not go 
apace, being so loaden with arms as I was,) I per- 
ceived there had been three canoes more of savages at 
that place; and looking out farther, t saw they w6re 
all at sea together, making over for the main. This 
was a dreadful sight to me, especiaHy as, going down 
to the shore, I could see the marks of horror, which 
the dismal work they had been about had left behind 
it, viz. the blood, tne bones, and part of the flesh, of 
human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches 
with merriment and sport. I was so nlled with indig- 
nation at the sight, that I now began to premeditate 
the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them 
be whom or how many soever. It seemed evident to 
me that the visits which they made thus to this island 
were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months 
before any more of them came on shore there again ; 
that is to say, I neither saw them, nor any footsteps 
or signals of them, in all that time ; for, as to the 
rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at 
least not so far : yet all this while I lived uncomfort- 
ably, by reason of the constant apprehensions of their 
coming on me by surprise : from whence I observe, 
that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 197 

suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off 
that expectation, or those apprehensions. 

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, 
and took up . most of my hours, which , should have 
been better employed, in contriving how to circum- 
vent and fall on them, the very pext time I should see 
them ; especially if they should be divided, as they 
were the last time, into two parties : nor did I con- 
sider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a 
dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to 
kill another, ahd so another, even ad infinitum^ till I 
should be at length no less a murderer than they were 
in being man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. I 
spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of 
mind, expecting that I should, one day or other, fall 
into the hands of these merciless creatures; and if 
I did at any time venture abroad, it was not without 
looking round me with the greatest care and caution 
imaginable. And now I found, to njy great comfort, 
how happy it ^as that 1 had provided a tame flock or 
herd of goats ; for £ durst not, on any account, fire 
my gun, especially pear that side of the island where 
they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages ; 
- and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have 
them come again, with perhaps two or three hundred 
canoes with them, in a few days and then I knew 
what to expect. However, I wore out a year and 
three months more before I ever saw any more of die 
savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon 
observe. It is true, they might have been there once 
or twice, but either they made no stay, or at least I 
did not see them : but in the month of May, as near 
as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth 
year, I had a very strange encounter with them ; of 
of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or 
sixteen months' interval, was very great; I slept un- 
quiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 



198 LIFE AND ADTENTURBS 

Started out of my sleep in the night: in the day 
great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the 
night, I dreamed often of killing the savages, and of 
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. Bitt, 
to wave all this for a while. — It was in the middle of 
May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as ray 
poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all 
on the post still ; I say, it was on the sixteenth of 
May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, 
with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very 
Ibul night it was after it. I knew not what was the par- 
ticular occasion of it, but as I was reading in tlie Bible, 
and taken up with very serious thoughts about my pre* 
sent condition, I was surprised with Uie noise uf a gun, 
as I thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a sur* 
prise quite of a different nature from any I had met 
with before ; for the notions this put into my thoughts 
were quite of another kind. I started up in the 
greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, clapped my 
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it 
after me ; and mounting it the second time, got to the 
top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid 
me listen for a second gun, which accordingly, in 
about half a minute, I heard, and by the sound 
knew that it was from that part of the sea where I 
was driven down the current in my boat. I imme- 
diately considered that this must be some ship in dis- 
tress, and that they had some comrade, or some other 
ship in company, and fired these guns for signals of 
distress, and to obtain help. I had the presence of 
tnind, at that minute, to think, that though I could 
not help them, it might be they might help me : so I 
brought together all the dry wood I could get at 
hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on 
fire on the hill. The wood was, dry, and blazed 
freely; and though the wind blew very hard, yet 
it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there was 
uny such thing as a ahip« they must needs see it, and 



OF EOBINSON CRUSOB* 109 

90 doubt they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed 
up I heard another gun, and after that several others, 
all from the same quarter, I plied my fire all night 
loBg, till daybreak ; and when it was broad day, and 
the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance 
at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail or a 
bull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glass; 
the distance was so great, and the weather still some- 
thing hazy also ; at least it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon per- 
ceived that it did not move ; so I presently concluded 
that it was a ship at anchor ; and being eager, you may 
be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, 
and ran towards the south side of the island, to the 
rocks where I had formerly been carried away with 
the current ; and getting up there, the weather by this 
time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my 
great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the 
night on those concealed rocks which I found when I 
was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as they checked 
the violence of the stream, and made a kind of coun- 
ter-stream, or eddy, we^e the occasion of my recover- 
ing from the most desperate, hopeless condition that 
ever I had been in, all my life. Thus, what is one 
man's safety is another man's destruction ; for it seems 
the^e men, whoever they were, being out of their 
knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, 
had been driven on them in the night, the wind 
blowing hard at E.N.E. Had they seen the island, 
as £ must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, 
as I thought, have endeavoured to have saved them- 
selves on shore by the help of their boat ; but their 
firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I 
imagined^ my fire, filled me with many thoughts : first, 
I imagined that on seeing my light, they might have 
put themselves into their boat, and endeavoured to 
make the shore ; but that the sea going- very high, 
they might have been cast away : other times I ima- 



200 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

gined that they might have lost their boat before, as 
might be the case many ways ; as, particularly, by the 
breaking of the sea on their ship, which many times' 
obliges men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and 
sometimes to throw it overbo*ard with their own hands : 
other times I imagined they had some other ship or 
ships in company, who, on the signals of distress 
they had made, had taken them up and carried them 
off : other times £ fancied they were all gone off to sea 
in their boat, and being hurried away by the~current 
that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the 
great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and 
perishing ; and that, perhaps, they might by this time 
think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat 
one another. 

As ail these were but conjectures at best, so, in 
the condition I was in, I could do no more than look 
on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them ; 
which had still this good effect on my side, that it gave 
me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who 
had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my 
desolate condition ; and that of two ships' companies 
who were now cast away on this part of the world, 
not one life should be spared but mine. I learned 
here again to observe, that it is very rare that the pro- 
vidence of God casts us into any condition of life so 
low, or any misery so great, but we may see some- 
thing or other to be thankful for, and may see others 
in worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly 
was the case of these men, of whom I could not so 
much as see room to suppose any of them were slaved ; 
nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or 
expect that they did not ail perish there, except the 
possibility only of their being taken up by another 
ship in company ; and this was but mere possibility 
indeed, for I saw not the least sign or appearance of 
any such thing. I cannot explain, by any possible 
energy of words, what a strange lon^ng or hankering 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 201 

of desires I felt in my soul on this sight, breaking 
out sometimes thus : *' O that there had been but one 
or two, nay, or but one soul, saved out of this ship; 
to have escaped. to me, that I might but have had one 
companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken to me; 
and to have conversed with !" In all the time of my 
solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire 
after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a 
regret at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the affec- 
tions, which, when they are set a going by some- ob- 
ject in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered pre- 
sent to the mind by the power of imagination, that 
motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to 
such violent, eager embracings of the object, that thje 
absence of it is insupportable.' Such were these ear- 
nest wishings that but one man had been saved. X 
believe I repeated the words, '* O that it had been 
but one !" a thousand times ; and my desires were so 
moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands 
would clinch together, and my fingers would press the 
palms of my hands, so that if I hsLd bad any soft thing 
in my han^, it wpuld have crushed it involuntarily ; 
and the teeth in my head would strike together, and 
set against one another so strong, that for some time I 
could not part them again. Let the naturalists ex- 
plain these things, and the reason and manner of 
them : all I can say to them is, to describe the fact^ 
which was 6ven surprising to me*, when I found it, 
though I knew not from wheiice it proceeded : it was 
doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and. of strong 
ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which 
the conversation of one of my fellow-christians would 
have been to me. — But it was not to be ; either their 
fate or mine, or both, forbade it : for, till the last year 
of my being on this island, I never knew whether 
any were saved out of that ship or no ; and had only 
the affliction^ some days after, to see the corpse of a 



302 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island 
which was next the shipwreck. He had no clothes 
pn but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed 
linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but nothing to 
direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of : 
be had nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight 
imd a tobacco-pipe ; — the last was to me of ten times 
more value than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture 
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might 
find something on board that might be useful to me ; 
but that did not altogether press me so much as the 
possibility that there might be yet some living crea- 
ture on board,> whose life I might not only save, but 
might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last 
degree ; and this thought clung so to my heart, that I 
JDould not be quiet night or day, but I must venture 
out in my boat on board this wreck ; and committing 
the rest to God's providence, I thought the impression 
v(Bs so strong on my mind that it could not be resisted, 
that it must come from some invisible direction, aqd 
that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened 
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my voy- 
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh 
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I 
had still a great deal of that left,) and a basket of 
raisins : and thus, loading myself with every thing 
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out 
of her, put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and 
then went home again for more. My second cargo was 
a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head 
for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and 
about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, 
more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a 
cheese : all which, with great labor and sweat, I car- 
ried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my 
voyage, I put out ; and rowing, or paddling, the canoe 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 208 

along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of 
the island on the north-east side. And now I was to 
launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not 
to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran 
constantly on both sides of the island at a distance, 
and which were very terrible to me, from the remem* 
brance of the hazard I had been in before, and my 
heart began to fail me ; for I foresaw that if I was 
driven into either of those currents, I should be carried 
a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, 
or sight of the island again; and that then, as my 
boat was but small, if any little gale of wind should 
rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began 
to give over niy enterprise; and having hauled my 
boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out» 
and sat roe down on a rising bit of ground, very pen« 
sive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my 
voyage ; when, as I was musing, I could perceive 
that the tide was turned, and the flood come on ; 
on which my going was impracticable for so many 
hours. On this, presently it occurred to me, that I 
should go up to the highest piece of ground £ could 
find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide 
or currents lay when the flood came in, that I might 
judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might 
not expect to be driven another way home, with the 
same rapidness of the currents. This thought was np 
sooner in my head than I cast my eye on a little hill, 
which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and 
from whence I had a clear view of. the cuiTents, or sets 
of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in 
my return. Here I found, that as the current of the 
ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so 
the current of the flood set in close by the shore of 
the north side ; and that I had nothing to do but to 
keep to the north side of the island in my. return, and 
I should do well enough. 



204 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the 
next morning, to set out with the first of the tide ; 
and reposing myself for the night in my canoe, under 
the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out.' 
I first made a little out to sea, full north, till I began 
to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, 
and which carried me at a great rate ; and yet did not 
so huri'y me as the current on the south side had done 
before, so as to take from me 'all government of the 
boat ; but having a strong steerage with my paddle^ I 
went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and Jn less 
than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal sight 
to look at : the ship, which, by its building, was Spa- 
nish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks ;. all 
the stem and quarter of her were beaten to pieces with 
the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the 
rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast 
and foremast were brought by the board, that is to 
say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and 
the head and bow appeared firm. When I came close 
to her, a dog appeared on her, who, seeing me coming, 
yelped and cried ; 'and as soon as I called him, jumped 
into the sea to come to me ; I took him into the boat, 
but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst. I 
gave him a cake of my bread, and he devoured it like 
a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in 
the snow : I then gave the poor creature some fresh 
water, with which, if I would have let him, he would 
have burst himself. After this, I went on board ; but 
the first sight I met with was two men drowned in the 
cock-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms 
fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed 
probable, that when the ship struck,' it being in a 
storin, the sea broke so high, and so continually over 
her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were 
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water, as 
much as if they had been under water. Besides the 
dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 206 

nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled 
by the water. There were some casks W liquor,, whe- 
ther wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in 
the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I 
could see ; but they were too big to meddle with. I 
saw several chests, which I believed belonged to some 
of the seamen ; and I got two of them into the boat« 
without examining what was in them. Had the stern 
of the ship been fixed, and the fore-part broken off, I 
am persuaded I might have made a good voyage ; for, 
by what I found in these two chests, 1 had room to 
suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; 
and, if I may guess from the course she steered, she 
must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the 
Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond 
the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, 
and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great 
treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to any 
body ; and what became of her crew, I then knew 
not. 

: I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of li- 
quor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my 
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus- 
kets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about 
four pounds of powder in it ; as. for the muskets, I had 
no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the 
powder-horn. I took a fireshovel and tongs, which I 
wanted extremely ; as also two little brass kettles, a 
copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron : and 
with this cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide 
beginning to make home again ; and the same evening, 
about an hour within night, 1 reached the island again, 
weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that 
night in the boat ; and in the morning I resolved to 
harbour what 1 had got in my new cave, and not carry 
it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got 
all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the par- 
ticulars. The cask of liquor I found- to be a kind of 



sod LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

rum, but not such as we bad at the Braziis, andy is a 
word^ not at all good ; but when I came to open tha 
chests, I found several things of great use to me : for 
example, I found in one a fine case of botdes, of an 
extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine 
and very good; the bottles held about three pints 
each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pote 
of very good suc(^es, or sweetmeats, so fastened also 
on the top, that the salt water had not hurt them ; and 
two more of the same, which the water had spoiled* 
I found some very good shirts, which were very welt 
come to me ; and about a dozen and a half of white 
linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths ; the for- 
mer were also very welcome, being exceeding refresh^ 
lag to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, whmi 
I came to the till in the chest, I found there three 
great bags of pieces-of-eight, which held about eleven 
hundred pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped up 
in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small 
bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all 
weigh near a pound. In the other chest were some 
clothes, but of little value; but, by the circumstances^ 
'it must have belonged to the gunner's mate ; though 
there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine 
glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose^ 
tor charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. On 
the whole, I got very little by this voyage that wa6 of 
any use to me ; for, as to the money, i had no manner 
of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my 
feet ; and I would have given it all for three or four 
pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things 
I greatly wanted, but had none on my feet for many 
years. I had indeed got two pair of shoes now, whieh 
I took off the feet of the two drowned men whom I 
saw in the wreck, and I found two pair more in one 
of the chests, which were very welcome to me ; but 
they were not like our English shoes, either for ease 
or service, being rather what we call pumps tha^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE; W7 

shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about ^(tf 
pieces-of-eight in rials, but no gold : I suppose this 
belonged to a poorer man than the otlier, which seemed 
to belong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged 
this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I 
had done that before which I brought frofn our own 
ship : but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other 
part of this ship had not come to my share ; for I am 
satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times 
over with money ; and, thought I, if I ever escape to 
England, it might lie here safe enough till I may come 
again and fetch it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and 
secured ^em, I went back to iny boat, and rowed 
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, 
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to 
my old habitation, where I found every thing safe and 
quiet. I began now to repose myself, live after my 
old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and, 
for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I was more 
vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did 
not go abroad so much ; and if at any time I did stir 
with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the 
island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages 
never came, and where I could go without so many 
precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition 
as I always carried with me if I went the other way; 
I lived in this condition near two years more ; but my 
unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was 
born to make my body miserable, was all these two 
years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were 
possible, I might get away from this island ; for; 
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the 
wreck, though my reason told me that there was no-^ 
thing left there worth the hazard of my voyage ; some-^ 
times for a ramble one way, sometimes another ; and I 
believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went froni 
Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound any 



208 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

where, I knew not whither. I have been, in all iny 
circumstances, a^ memento to those who are touched 
with the general plague of mankind, whence, for 
aught I know, one half of their miseries flow ; 1 mean 
that of not being satisfied with the station wherein 
God and nature hath placed them ; for, not to look 
back on my primitive condition, and the excellent 
advice of my father, the opposition to which was, as I 
may call it, my original nin, my subsequent mistakes 
of the same kind had been the means of my coming 
into this miserable condition ; for had that Providence, 
which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a plan- 
ter, blessed me with confined desires, and I could 
have been contented to have gone on gradually, I 
might have been, by this time, I mean in the time of 
my being in this island, one of the most considerable 
planters in the Brazils ; nay, I am persuaded that by 
the improvements I had made in that little time I 
lived there, and the increase I should probably have 
made if I had remained, I might have been worth h 
hundred thousand moidores : and what business had I 
to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, 
improving and encreasing, to turn supercargo to Gui- 
nea t<) fetch negroes, when patience and time would 
have so increased our stock at home, that we could 
have bought them at our own door from those whose 
business it was to fetch them ? and though it had cost 
us something more, yet the difference of that price 
was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard. 
But as this is usually the fate of young heads, so re- 
flection on the folly of it is as commonly the exercise 
of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of 
time : so it was with me now ; and yet so deep had the 
mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not 
satisfy myself in my station, but was continually por- 
hig on the means and possibility of my escape from 
this place : and that I may, with the greater pleasure 
to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, 



* OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 209 

it may not be improper to give some account of my 
first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme 
for my escape^ and how, and on what foundation I 
acted. 

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle^ 
after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up 
and secured under water, as usual, and my conditicm 
restored to what it was before ; I had more wealth, 
indeed, 1»han I had before, but was not at all the 
richer ; for I had no more use for it than the Indians 
of Peru had before the Spaniards came there. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in 
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting 
loot in this island of solitude, I was lying in my bed, 
or hammock, awake; very well in health, had no 
pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body^ nor an;^ 
uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, but could by 
no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep ; no, 
not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows : — 
It is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of 
thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare 
of the brain, the memory, in this night's time : I ran 
over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by 
abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this 
island, and also of that part of my life since I came 
to this island. In my reflections on the state of my 
oase since I came on shore on this island, I was 
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first 
years of my habitation here, compared to the life of 
anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived in, eve^ 
since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand ; not 
that I did not believe the savages had frequented th^ 
island even all the while, and might have been several 
hundreds of them at times on shore there ; but I bad 
never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions 
about it ; my satisfaction was perfect, though my dan^ 
ger was the same, and 'I was as happy in not knowing 
my danger as if I had never really been exposed to itw 
VOL. I. o 



210 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

This furnished my thoughts with many very printable 
reflections, and particularly this one : How infinitely 
good that Providence is, which has provided, in iti 
government of mankind, such narrow bounds to fais 
sight and knowledge of things ; and though he walks in 
the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of 
which, if discovered jto him, would distract his mind 
and sink his spirits, he is kiept serene and calm, by 
having the events of things hid from his eyes, ana 
knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him. . 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained 
me, I came to reflect seriously on the real danger I 
bad been in for so many years in this very island, and 
how I had walked about in the greatest security, and 
with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps no- 
thing but the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the ca- 
sual approach of night, had been between me and the 
worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into the 
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have 
seized on me with the same view as I would on a goat 
or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to kill 
and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or curlew. I 
would unjustly slander myself, if 1 should say I was 
not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose 
singular protection I acknowledged, with great humi- 
lity, all these unknown deliverances were due, and 
without which I must inevitably have fallen into their 
merciless hands. 

When these thoughts W€re over, my head was for 
some time taken up in considering the nature of these 
wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and how it 
^ame to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of 
all things should give up any of his creatures to such 
inhumanity, nay, to something so m*uch below even 
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind: but as 
this ended in some (at that time) fruitless specula- 
tions, it occurred to me to inquire, -what part of the 
^prki these wretches lived in ? how far off* the coast 
was, from whence they came? what they ventured 



* OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

over SO far from home fori wbat kind of boats the^ 
had? and why I might not order myself and my bu- 
siness so, that I mi^t be as able to go over thither 
as tfauBy were to come to me ? * 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider 
what I should do with myself when I went thither ; 
what would become of me, if I fell into the hands 
of the savages ; or how I should escape from them,' 
if they attacked me ; no, nor so much as how it was 
possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attacked 
by some or other of them, without any possibility of 
delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their 
hands, what 1 should do for provision, or whither I 
should bend my course : none of these thoughts, I 
say, so much as came iii my way ; but my mind was 
wholly bent on the notion of my passing over in my 
boat to the main land. 1 looked on my present con- 
dition, as the most miserable that could possibly be ; 
that I was notable to throw myself into any thing, but 
death, that could be called worse; and if I reached 
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with re- 
lief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African 
shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and 
where I might find some relief; and after all, perhaps,' 
I might fall in with some Christian ship that might 
take me in ; and if the worst came to the worst, I' 
could but die, which would put an end to all these 
miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of 
a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made despe^ 
rate, as it were, by the long continuance of my trou- 
bles, and the disappointments I had met in the wreck 
I had been on board of, and where I had been so near 
obtaining what I so earnestly longed for, viz. some- 
body to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from 
them of the place where I was, and of the probable 
means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly by 
these thoughts ; all my calm of mind, in my resigna-*' 
tion to Providence, and waiting the issue of the disr 



212 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Gitions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended ; and I 
[, as it were, no power to tarn my thoughts to any 
thing but to the project of a voyage to the main ; 
which came on me with such force, and such an iape- 
Uiosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours 
or more, with such violence that it set my very blood 
into a ferment, and my pulse beat as if I had been ki 
a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervor of my 
mind about it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and 
exhausted with the very thought of it, threw me hi'to 
a sound sleep. One would have thought I ^should 
have dreamea of it, but I did not, nor of any thing 
relating to it : but I dreamed that as I was going out 
in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw on the 
shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to land, 
and that they brought, with them another savage, 
whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him ; 
when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to 
kill jumped away, and ran for his life ; and I thought, 
in mv sleep, that'he came running into my little thick 
grove before my fortification, to hide himself; and 
that I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the 
others sought him that way, showed myself to him, 
and smiling on him, encouraged him : that he kneeled 
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; on 
which I showed him my ladder, made him go up, and 
carried him into my cave, and he became my servant : 
and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to my- 
self, ** Now I may certainly venture to the main 
land ; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will 
tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, 
and wliither not to go for fear of being devoured ; 
what places to venture into, and what to shun." I 
waked with this thought; and was under such in- 
expressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my 
escape in my dream, that the disappointments which 
I felt on coming to myself, and finding that it was no 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

more than ^, dream, were equally extravagant the 
othei: way, and threw me into a very great dejection 
of spirits. 

On this» however, I made this conclusion ; that 
my only way to go about to attempt an escape wa», 
if possible, to get a savage into my possession ; and, 
if possible, it should be one of their prisoners whom 
they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring 
hither to kill. But these thoughts still were at<^ 
tended with this difficulty, that it was impossible to 
effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, 
and killing' them all ; and this was not only a very 
desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the 
other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of 
it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts 
of shedding so much blood, though it was for my de-> 
liverance. I need not repeat the arguments which 
occurred to me against this, they being the same men- 
tioned before ; but though I had other reasons to 
offer now, viz. that those men were enemies to my 
life, and would devour me if they could ; that it was 
self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver my- 
self from this^ death of a life, and was acting in my 
own defence as much as if they were actually assault- 
ing me, and the like ; I say, though these things ar- 
gued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood 
for my deliverance \vere very terrible to me, and such as 
I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great 
while. However, at last, after many secret disputes 
with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for 
all these arguments, one way and another, struggled 
in my head a long time,) the eager prevailing desire 
of deliverance at length mastered all the rest ; and I 
resolved, if possible, to get oi^e of those savages into 
my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to 
contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very diffi)- 
cult to resolve on :. but as I could pitch on no pro^^ 
bable means for it, so I resolved to put myself on the 



214 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

watch, to see them when they came on shore, and 
leave the rest to the event ; taking such measures as 
the opportunity should present, let what would be*. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself 
on the scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, 
that I was heartily tired of it ; for it was above a year 
and a half that I waited ; and for great part of that 
time went out to the west end, and to the south-west 
corner of the island, almost every day, to look for 
canoes, but none appeared. This was very discou- 
raging, and began to trouble me much; though I 
caniiot say that it did in this case (as it had done 
some time before) wear off the edge of my desire to 
the thing ; but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the 
more eager I was for it : in a word, I was not at first 
so careful to shun the sight of these savages, find avoid 
being seen by them, as I was now eager to be on 
them. Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, 
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to 
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I 
should direct them, and to prevent their being able 
at any time to do me any hurt. It was a great while 
that I pleased myself with this affair^ but nothing 
still presented ; all my fancies and schemes came to 
nothing, for no savages came near me for a great 
while. 

About a year and a half after I entertained these 
notions (and by long musing had, as it were, resolved 
them all into nothing, for want of an oecasion.to put 
them into execution,) I was surprised, one morning 
early, with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore 
together on my side the island, and the people who 
belonged to them all landed, and out oi my sight. 
The number of them broke all my measures; for 
seeing so many, and knowing'that they always came 
four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not 
tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures, 
to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed ; so I lay 



OF ROBINSON CRtSOE. 215 

Still in my castle, [>erplexed and discomforted : how- 
ever, I put myself into all the same postures for an 
attack that I had formerly provided, and was just 
ready for action, if any thing had presented. Having 
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made 
any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my 
^ns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to 
the top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; stand- 
ing so, however, that my head did not appear above 
the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any 
means. Here I observed, by the help of my per- 
spective-glass, that they were no less than thirty in 
number ; that they had a fire kindled, and that they 
had meat dressed. How they had cooked it I knew 
not, or what it was ; but they were all dancing, in I 
know not how many barbarous gestures and figures, 
their own way, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, 
by my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged 
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, 
and were now brought out for the slaughter. I per- 
ceived one of them immediately fall, being knocked 
down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for 
that was their way, and two or three others were at 
work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, 
while the other victim was left standing by himself, 
till they should be ready for him. In that very mo- 
ment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at li- 
berty, and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes 
of life, and he started away from them, and ran with 
incredible swiftness along the sands, directly towards 
me, I mean towards that part of the coast where my 
habitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, I must 
acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way, 
and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued 
by the whole body : and now I expected that part of 
my dream was coming to pass, and that he would cer- 
tainly take shelter in my grove : but I could not de-. 
pend, by any means, on my dxeam io\ >^% "t^eX^ ^^ ^x^

▼iz.'that the other savages would not pursve him 
tbither, and find him there. Howevei, I kept4fty 
station, and my spirits began to recover when I ^nd 
that there were not above three men that followed 
him ; aod still more was I encouraged when I found 
that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and 
gained ground of them ; so that if he could but hold 
it for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get 
away from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, 
which I mentioned often in the first part of my story, 
where I landed my cargoes out of the ship ; and thk 
I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the 
poor wretch would be taken there : but when the 
savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of 
it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in, 
swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, 
landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and swift- 
ness. When the three persons came to the creek, I 
found that two of them could swim, but the third 
could not, and that, standing on the other side, he 
looked at the others, but went no farther, and soon 
after went softly back again ; which, as it happened, 
was very well for him in the end. I observed that 
the two who swam were yet more than twice as long 
swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled 
from them. It came now very warmly on my thoughts, 
and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get 
me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, 
and that I was called plainly by Providence to save 
this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the 
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two 
guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladders, as 
I observed above, and getting up again, with the same 
haste, to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea, 
and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed 
myself in the way between the pursuers and the pur- 
sued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking 
back, was at first, perhaps, as much frightened at me 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

AS ttt ihem ; but I beckoned ^th my hand to him to 
come back ; and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced 
towards the two that followed ; then rushing at once 
on the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock 
of my piece. I was loth to fire, because I would not 
have the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would 
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of 
the smoke too, they would not have easily known 
what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow 
down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he 
had been frightened, and I advanced apace towards 
him : but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he 
had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at 
me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, 
which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The 
poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw 
both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet 
was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, 
that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward 
nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined 
still to fly, than to come on. I hallooed again to him, 
and made signs to come forward, which he easily un- 
derstood, and came a little way ; then stopped again, 
and then a little farther, and stopped again ; and I 
could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he 
had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be 
killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him 
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of 
encouragement that I could think of; and he came 
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve 
steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his. life« 
I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned 
to him to come still nearer : at length he came close 
to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the 
ground, and laid his head on the ground, and taking 
me by the foot, set my foot on his head; this, it 
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for 
ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and 



tlj^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ftorcragied him all I could. But there was more 
«irk to do yet ; for I perceived the savage whom I 
fi:iif<ik€d down was not killed, but stunned with the 
3u'«-. and began to come to himself: so I pointed to 
not. Asd showed him the savage, that he was not

the wound the bullet had made, which, it seems, was 
just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no 
g;reat quantity of blood had followed ; but he had 
bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up 
his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I turned to 
go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making 
signs to him that more might come after them. On 
this, he made signs to me that he should bury them 
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, 
if they followed; and so I made signs to him again 
to do so. He fell to work ; and, in an instant, he 
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big 
enough to bury the tirst in, and then dragged himi 
into it, and covered him; and did so by the other 
also : I believe he had buried them both in a quarter 
of an hour. Then calling him away, I carriea him, 
not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the 
farther part of the island ; so I did not let my dream 
come to pass in that part, viz. that he came into my 
grove for shelter. Here I gave' him bread and a 
bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which 
I found he was indeed in great distress for, by his 
funning ; and having refreshed him, I made signs for 
him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him a place 
where T had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket on it, 
which I used to sleep on myself sometimes ; so the 
poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well 
made, with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall, 
and well shaped ; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six 
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not 
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some- 
thing very manly in his faqe ; and yet he had all the 
sweetness and softness of an European in his counte- 
nance tooj especially when he smiled. His hair was 
long and black, not curled like wool ; his forehead 
, very high and large ; and a ^reat vivacity and spark- 
ling sharpness in his eyes. The color of his skin waa 



220 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

not quite black, but very tawny ; and yet not an ugly, 
yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virgi* 
nianSf and other natives of America are, but of a 
bright kind of a dun olive color, that had in it some- 
thing very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. 
His face was round and plump ; his nose small, not 
flat like the negroes ; a very good mouth, thin lips» 
and his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about 
half an hour, he awoke again, and came out of the 
cave to me, for I had been milking my goats, which I 
had in the enclosure just by : when he espied me^ he 
came running to me, laying himself down again on the 

?;rouud, with all the possible signs of an bumble thank- 
ill disposition, making a great many antic gestures to 
show it. At last he lays his head flat on the ground, 
close to my foot, and sets my other foot on his head, 
as he had done before ; and after this, made all the 
signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission » 
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so 
long as he lived. I understood him in many things, 
and let him know I was very well pleased with him. 
In a little time I began to speak to him, and teach 
him to speak to me ; and, first, I let him know his 
name should be Friday, which was the day I saved 
his life : I called him so for the memory of thei time, 
I likewise taught him to say Master ; and then let hind 
know that was to be my name : I likewise taught him 
to say Yes and No, and to know the meaning of 
them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and 
let him see me drink it before him, and sop my bread 
in it ; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, 
which he quickly complied with, and made signs that 
it was very good for him. I kept there with him all 
that night ; but as soon as it was day, I beckoned to 
him to come with me, and let him know I would give 
him some clothes ; at which he seemed very glad, for 
he was stark nake<L As we went by the place where 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 221. 

he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the 
place, and showed me the marks that he had made to 
find them again, making signs to me that we should dig 
them up again, and eat them. At this I appeared 
very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if 
I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned 
with my hand to him to come away ; which he did 
immediately, with great submission. I then led him 
up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were 
gone ; and pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw 
plainly the place where they had been, but no ap-. 
pearance of them or their canoes ; so that it was plain 
they were gone, and had left their two comrades be- 
hind them, without any search after them. 

But I was not content with this discovery; but 
having now more courage, and consequently more cu- 
riosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him the 
sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his 
back, which I found he could use very dexterously, 
making him carry one gun for me, and I two for my- 
self; and away we marched to the place where these 
creatures had been ; for I had a mind now to get some 
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, 
my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart 
sank within me, at the horror of the spectacle ; indeed, 
it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though 
Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered 
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, 
and great pieces of flesh left h^re and there, half- 
eaten, mangled, and scorched ; and, in short, all the 
tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making 
there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three 
skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs 
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies ; 
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that 
they brought over four prisoners to feast on ; that three 
of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to hhn*' 
s^lf, was. the foprth ; that there had been a great baW 



^22 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tie between them and their next king, whose subjects, 
it seems, he had been one of, and that they had taken 
a great number of prisoners ; all which were carried to 
several places by those who had taken them in the 
fight, in order to feast on them, as was done here by 
tliese wretches on those they brought hither. - 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, 
jQesh, and whatever remained, and lay them together 
in a heap, and make a great fire on it, and burn them all 
to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering sto- 
mach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal 
in his nature ; but 1 showed so much abhorrence at 
the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of 
it, that he durst not discover it : for I had, by some 
means, let him know that I would kill him if he of- 
fered it. 

When he had done this, we came back to our cas- 
tle ; and there I fell to work for my man Friday : and, | 
first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which j 
I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned^ j 
which 1 found in the wreck ; and which, with a little 
alteration, fitted him very well : and then I made him 
a jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as my skill would al-i 
low (for I was now grown a tolerable good tailor ;) 
and I gave him a cap, which I made of hare's-skin, 
Tery convenient and fashionable enough : and thus he 
was clothed for the present*, tolerably well, and was 
mighty' well pleased to see himself almost as well 
clotht'd as his master. It is true, he went awkwardly in 
UlK^^' clothes at first : wearing the drawers was very 
i^wk^anl to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat 
iCtttUxi his shoulders, and the inside of his arms ; but a 
litit^ ««saug them where he complained they hurt him, 
;iU%i U&4U1S himself to them, he took to them at length 

'illw iMxl day after I came home to my hutch with

ai«LUiM 1 uujht do well for him, and yet be perfectly. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 223' 

easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacanf 
place between my two fortifications, in the inside of 
the last and in the outside of the first. As there was a 
door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal 
framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set 
it up in the passage, a little within the entrance ; and* 
causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up 
in the night, taking in my ladders too ; so that Friday 
could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- 
most wall, without making so much noise in getting 
over that it must needs waken me ; for my first wall 
had now a complete roof over it of long poles, cover- 
ing all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill ; 
which was asrain laid across with smaller sticks, in- 
stead of lathes, and then thatched over a great thick- 
ness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; 
and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out 
by the ladder, I bad placed a kind of trap-doory 
which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would 
not have opened at all, but would have fallen down, 
and made a great noise ; as to weapons, I took them 
all into my side every night. But I needed none of 
all this precaution ; for never man had a more faith- 
ful, loving, sincere servant, than Friday was to me ; 
without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly 
ebliged and engaged ; his very affections were tied to 
me, like those of a child to a father ; and 1 dare say 
he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, 
on any occasion whatsoever : the many testimonies 
he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon con- 
vinced me that I needed to use no precautions as to' 
my safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and 
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God, 
in his providence, and in the government of the works 
of his hands, to t^ke from so great a part of the world 
of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties/ 
and the powers of their souls are adapted, yet that Ji« 



224 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

has bestowed on them the same powers, the same 
reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of 
kindness and obligation, the same passions and resent- 
ments of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, 
fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good, and re- 
ceiving good, that he has given to us ; and that when 
he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, 
they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to 
the right uses for which they were bestowed, than we 
are. This made me very melancholy sometimes, in 
reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how 
mean a use we make of all these, even though we have 
these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruc- 
tion, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of bis 
word added to our understanding; and why it has 
pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from 
so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by 
this poor savage, would make a much better use of it 
than we did. From hence, I sometimes was led too 
far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and as it 
were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of 
things, that should hide that light from some, and re- 
veal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from 
both; but I shut it up, and checked my thonghts 
with this conclusion : first. That we did not know by 
what light and law these should be condemned, but 
that as God was necessarily, and, by the nature of bis 
being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, bnt 
if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from 
himself, it was on account of sinning against that 
light, which, as the Scripture says, was a law to them- 
selves, and by such rules as their consciences would 
acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was 
not discovered to us ; and, secondly, That still, as we 
all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel 
could say to him, '' Why hast thou formed me 
thus ? " 
Sttt to return to my new companion : — I was 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 225 

greatly delighted with him, and made it my business 
to teach him every thing that was proper to make him 
useful, handy, and helpful ; but especially to make him 
speak, and understand me when I spoke : and he was 
the aptest scholar that ever was ; and particularly was 
so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when 
he could but understand me, or make me understand 
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. 
Now my life began to be so easy, that I began to say 
to myself, that could I but have been safe firom mo^e 
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from 
the place where I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my 
castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off 
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish 
of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other 
flesh ; so I took him out with me one morning to the 
woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out 
of iny own flock, and bring it home and dress it ; but 
as I was going, I saw a she- goat lying down in the 
shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched 
hold of Friday ; — Hold, said I ; stand still ; and 
made signs to him not to stir: immediately I pre- 
sented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. 
The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, 
seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know, 
nor could imagine, how it was done, was sensibly sur- 
prised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, 
that I thought he would have sunk down. He did 
not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed 
it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was 
not wounded ; and, as I found presently, he thought I 
was resolved to kill him : for he came and kneeled 
down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great 
many things I did not understand ; but I could easily 
see the meaning was, to pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would 
do him no hann ; and taking him up by the hand, 
VOL. I. p 



229 UFS AND ADVENTURES 

laughed at him, and pointing to the kid whieh I had 
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he 
did : and while he was wondering, and looking to see 
how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again. 
By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting 
on a tree, within shot ; so, to let Friday understand 
a little what I would do, I called him to me a gain , 

ranted at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though 
thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the 
parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the 
parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made 
him understand that I would shoot and kill that bird ; 
accordingly, I fired, and: bade him look, and imme- 
diately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one 
frightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to 
him ; and I found he was the more amazed, because 
he did not see me put any thing into the gun, but 
thought that there must be some wonderful fund of 
death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, 
beast, bird, or any ibhing near or far off; and the asto- 
nishment this created in him was such, as could not 
wear off for a long time ; and I believe, if I would have 
let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. 
As for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch 
it for several days after ; but he would speak to it, 
and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was 
by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, 
was to desire it not to kill him. Well, after his 
astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to 
him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he 
did, but staid some time; for the parrot, not being 
quite dead, had fluttered away a good distance from 
the place where she fell : however, he found her, took 
her up, and brought her to me ; and as I had per- 
ceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this 
advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let him 
sec me do it, that I might be ready for any other 
mark that might present ; but nothing more offered 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 22T 

at that time : so I brought home the kid, and the 
same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as 
well as I could ; and having a pot fit for that purpose, 
I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some 
very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, 
I gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, 
and liked it very well ; but that which was strangest 
to him, was to see me eat salt with it. He made a 
sign to me that the salt was not good to eat ; and put- 
ting a little into bis own mouth, he seemed to nauseate 
it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth 
with fresh water after it : on the other hand, I took 
some meat into my mouth without salt, and I pre- 
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as 
be had done at the salt ; but it would not do ; he 
would never care for salt with his meat or in his broth ; 
at least, not for a great while, and then but a very 
little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, 
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting 
a piece of the kid : this I did, by hanging it before 
the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in 
England, setting two poles up, one on each side of 
the fire, and one across on the top, and tying the 
string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continu- 
ally. This Friday admired very much ; but when he 
came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell 
me how well he liked it, that I could not but under- 
stand him : and at last he tqld me, as well as he could, 
he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was 
very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some 
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as 
I observed before ; and he soon understood how to do 
it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the 
meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of ; 
for after that I let him see me make my bread, and 
bake it too ; and in a little time Friday was able to 



228 LIFE AND ADVENTURESS 

do all the work for me; as well as I could do it my- 
self. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths 
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground 
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn 
tiian I used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the same manner as be- 
fore, in which Friday worked not only very willingly 
and very bard, but did it very cheerfully : and I told 
him what it was for ; that it was for corn to make 
more bread, because he was now with me, and that I 
might have enough for him and myself too. He ap- 
peared very sensible of that part, and let me know 
that he thought * I had much more labor on me on 
his account, than I hani for myself; and that he 
would work the harder for me, if I would tell him 
what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in 
this place ; Friday began to talk pretty well, and un- 
derstand the names of almost every thing I had occa- 
sion to call for, and of every place I had to send him 
to, and talked a great deal to me ; so that, in shoirt, I 
began now to have some use for my tongue again, 
which, indeed, I had very little occasion for before, 
that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of 
talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the 
fellow himself : his simple unfeigned honesty appeared 
to me more and more every day, and I began really 
to love the creature ; and, on his side, I believe he 
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to 
love any thing before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering 
inclination to his own country again ; and having 
taught him English so well that he could answer me 
almost any question, I asked him whether the nation 
that he belonged to never conquered in battle ? At 
which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always 
fight the better :" that is, he meant, always get the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 229 

better in fight ; and so we began the following dis- 
course : 

Mailer, You always fight the better ; how came 
you to be taken prisoner then, Friday? 

Friday, My nation beat much for all that. 

Master, How beat ? If your nation beat them, 
how came .you to be taken ? 

Friday. They more many than my nation in the 
place where me was ; they take one, two, three, and 
me : my natiop over-beat them in the yonder place, 
where me no was; there my nation take .one, two, 
great thousand. 

Master, But why did not your side recover you 
from the hands of your enemies then ? 

Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and 
make go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that 
time. 

Master, Well, Friday, and what does your nation 
do with the men they take ? Do they carry them away 
and eat them, as these did ? 

Friday, Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 

Master, Where do they carry them ? 

Friday, Go to other place, where they think. 

Master, Do they come hither ? 

Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither ; come oihex 
else place. 

Master, Have you been h^e with them? 

Friday, Yes, I have been here (points to th^ 
N. W. side of the island; which, it seems, was their 
side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had for- 
merly been among the savages who used to come on 
shore on the farther part of the island, on the same 
man-eating occasions he was now brought for ; and, 
some time after, when I took the courage to carry him 
to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he 
presently knew the place, and told me he was there 
9nce when they eat up twenty men^ two women, ^nd 



230 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

one child : he could not tell twenty in English, but 
he numbered them by laying so many stones in a row, 
and pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces what 
follows; that after I had this discourse with him, I 
asked him how far it Was from our island to the shore, 
and whether the canoes were not often lost. He told 
me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, 
after a little way out to sea, there was a current and 
wind, always one way in the morning, the other in the 
afternoon. This I understood to be no more than the 
sets of the tide, as going out or coming in ; but I 
afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great 
draft and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the 
mouth or gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, 
our island lay ; and that this land which I perceived 
to the W. and N.W. was the great island of Trinidad, 
on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked 
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the in- 
habitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were 
near : he told me all he knew, with the greatest open- 
ness imaginable. I asked him the names of the seve- 
ral nations of his sort of people, but could get no 
other name than Caribs ; from whence I easily under- 
stood that these were the Caribbees, which our maps 
place on the part of America which reaches from the 
mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards 
to St. Martha. He told me that up a great way be- 
yond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the 
moon, which must be west from their country, there 
dwelt white-bearded men, like me, and pointed to my 
great whiskers, which I mentioned before ; and that 
they had killed much mans, that was his word : 
by all which I understood, he meant the Spaniards^ 
whose cruelties in America had been spread over the 
whole country, and were remembered by all the na- 
tions, from father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go twrn 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 231 

this island and get among those white men : he told 
me. Yes, yes,, you may go in two canoe. I could 
not understand what he meant, or make him descnh« 
to me what he meant hy two canoe ; till, at last, with 
great difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large 
boat, as big as two canoes. This part of Friday's dis^r 
course began to relish with me very well ; and from 
thb time I entertained some hopes that, one time or 
other, I might find an opportunity to make my esci^ 
from this place, and that this poor savage might be a 
means, to help me. 

During the long time that Friday had now been 
with me,- and that he began to speak to me, and unr 
derstand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation 
of religious knowledge in his mind : particularly I 
asked him one time. Who made him ? I'he poor crea* 
ture did not understand me at all, but thought I had 
asked him who was his father : but I took it up by 
another handle, and asked him who made the sea, the 
ground we walked on, and the hills and woods ? He 
told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived be- 
yond all ; he could describe nothing of this great per- 
son, but that he was very old, much older, he said> 
than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. 
I asked him then, if this old person had made all 
things, why did not all things worship him ? He 
looked very grave, and with a perfect look of inno- 
cence said, AH things say O to him. I asked him if 
the people who die in his own country went away 
any where ? He said, Yes ; they all went to Bena- 
muckee : then I asked him whether these they eat up 
went thither too ? He said, Yes. 

From these things I began to instruct him in the 
knowledge of the true God : I told him that the great 
Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up to- 
wards heaven ; that he governed the world by the 
same power and providence by which he made it; 
that he was omnipotent, and could do every thing for 



232 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

U8, give every thing to us, take every thing from us ; 
and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened 
with great attention, and received with pleasure the 
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of 
the manner of making our prayers to God, and his 
being able to hear us, even m heaven. He told me 
one day, that if our God could hear us up beyond 
the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their 
Benamuckee-, who lived but a little way off, and yet 
could not hear till they went up to the great moun-> 
tains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him 
if ever he went thither to speak to him ? He said. 
No ; they never went that were young men ; none 
went thither but the old men, whom he called their 
Oowokakee ; that is, as I made him explain it to me, 
their religious, or clergy ; and that they went to say 
O (so he called saying prayers,) and then came back, 
and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I 
observed that there is priestcraft even among the most 
blinded, ignorant pagans in the world ; and the policy 
of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the 
veneration of the people to the clergy, is not only to 
be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all reli- 
gions in the world, even among the most brutish and 
barbarous savages. 

' I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man 
Friday ; and told him that the pretence of their old 
men going up to the mountains to say O to their god 
Beilamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word 
from thence what he said was much more so ; that if 
they met with any answer, or spake with any one 
there, it must be with an evil spirit : and then I en- 
tered into a long discourse with him about the devil, 
the original of him, his rebellion against God, his en- 
mity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in 
the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead 
of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he 
made use of to delude mankind to their ruin ; how he 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

bad a secret access to our passions and to our affec- 
tions, and to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so 
as to cause us even to be- our own tempters, and run 
on our destruction by our own choice. 

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in 
his mind about the devil, as it was about the being of 
a God : nature assisted all my arguments to evidence 
to him even the necessity of a great First Cause, and 
over-ruling, governing Power, a secret, directing Pro- 
vidence, and of the equity and justice of paying ho- 
mage to him that made us, and the like ; but there 
appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil 
spirit; of his original, his being, his nature, and, 
above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw 
ns in to do so too : and the poor creature puzzled me 
once in such a manner, by a question merely natural 
and innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. 
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power 
of God, his omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his being 
a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity ; how, as 
he had made us all, he could destroy us and all the 
world in a moment ; and he listened with great seri- 
ousness to me all the while. After this, I had been 
telling him how the devil was God's enemy in the 
hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to 
defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin 
the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like. 
" Well,'' says Friday, ** but you say God is so 
strong, so great ; is he not much strong, much might 
as the devil?" — " Yes, yes," says I, ** Friday, God 
is stronger than the devil : God is above the devil, 
and therefore we pray to God to tread him down 
under our feet, and enable us to resist his tempta- 
tions, and quench his fiery darts."—*' But," says he 
again, '' if God much stronger, much might as the 
devil, why God no killthe devil, so make him no 
more do wicked f" • I was strangely surprised at this 
question ; and, after all, though I was now an old 



234 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

man, yot I was bat a young doctor, and ill qualified 
for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties ; and, at first, 
I could not tell what to say ; so I pretended not to 
hear him, and asked him what he said ; but he was 
too earnest for an answer, to forget his question, so 
that he repeated it in the very same broken words 
aa above. By this time I had recovered myself a 
littJe, and I said, <' God will at last punish him 
•everely ; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to 
be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell with ever- 
lasting fire." This did not satisfy Friday; but he 
returns on me, repeating my words, '* Reserve at 
hist ! me no understand : but why not kill the devil 
now ; not kill great ago V* — '* You may as well ask 
me,'' said I, '< why God does not kill you and me, 
when we do wicked things here that offend him : we 
are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He mused 
some time on this : ** Well, well," says he, mighty 
affectionately, '' that well : so you, I, devil, all wick- 
ed, all preserve, repent, God pardon all." Here I 
was run down again by him to the last degree ; and 
it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of 
nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to 
the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage 
due to the supreme being of God, as the consequence 
of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can 
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemp- 
tion purchased for us, of a Mediator of the new cove- 
nant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of God's 
throne ; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven 
can form these in the soul ; and that, therefore, the 
gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean 
the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised 
for the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the ab- 
solutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in 
the saving knowledge of God, and the means of sal- 
vation. 
I therefore diverted l\ie ^\«»&wt discourse between 



OF ROBINSON iCRVSOS. 235 

me and my man, rising up hastily as on some sud-* 
den occasion of going out ; then sending him for some-* 
thing a good way off, I seriously- prayed to God that 
he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor 
savage ; assisting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor 
ignorant creature to receive the light of the know- 
ledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, 
and would guide me to speak so to him from the word 
of God, as his conscience might be convinced, his 
eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came 
again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him 
on the subject of the redemption of man by the Sa- 
viour of the world, and of the doctrine of the gospel 
preached from heaven, viz. of repentance towards 
God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then 
explained to him as well as I could, why our blessed 
Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but 
the seed of Abraham ; and how, for that reason, the 
fallen angels had no share in the redemption ; that be 
came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, 
and the like. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge 
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in* 
struction, and must acknowledge, what I believe all 
that act on the same principle will find, that in laying 
things open to him, I really informed and instructed 
myself in many things that either I did not know, or 
had not fully considered before, but which occurred 
naturally to my mind on searching into them, for 
the information of this poor savage ; and I had more 
affection in my inquiry after things on this occasion 
than ever I felt before : so that, whether this poor 
wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had great 
reason to be thankful that ever he came to me ; my 
grief sat lighter on me ; my habitation grew com-* 
fortable to me beyond measure : and when I reflected, 
that in this solitary life which I had heen confined to, 
I had not only been moved to look >r^ \.^ V^<^^tv 



236 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

myself, and to seek to the hand that had brought me 
here, but was now to be made an instrument, under 
Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew, 
the soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the true 
knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, 
that he might know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eter- 
nal ; I say, when I reflected on all these things, a 
secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and 
I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this 
place, which I had so often thought the most dread- 
ful of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen 
me. 

Jt continued in this thankful frame all the remainder 
of my time; and the conversation which employed 
the hours between Friday and me was such, as made 
the three years which we lived there together perfectly 
and completely happy, if any such thing as complete 
happiness can be formed in a sublunary state. This 
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than 
I ; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for 
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted, re- 
stored penitents. We had here the word of God to 
read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct, 
than if we had been in England. I always applied 
myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as 
well as I could, the meaning of what I read ; and he 
again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made 
me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the 
Scripture-knowledge than I should ever have been 
by my own mere private reading. Another thing I 
cannot refrain from observing here also, from experi- 
ence in this retired part of my life, viz. how inhnite 
and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge 
of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ 
Jesus, is so plaiuly laid down in the word of God, so 
easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare 
reading the Scripture made me capable of under- 
standing enough of m^ dxxly to carry me directly on 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

to the great work of sincere repentance for my sins^ 
and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salvation^ 
to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to 
all God's commands, and this without any teacher or 
instructor, I mean human ; so the same plain instruc- 
tion sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage 
creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, as 
I have known few equal to him in my life. 

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and con- 
tention which have happened in the world about re- 
ligion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of 
church-government, they were all perfectly useless to 
us, and, for aught I can yet see, they have been so to 
the rest of the world. We had the sure guide to hea- 
ven, viz. the word of God ; and we had, blessed be 
God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching 
and instructing us by his word, leading us into all 
truth, and making us both willing and obedient to the 
instruction of his word. And I cannot see the least 
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points 
of religion, which have made such confusions in the 
world, would have been to us, if we could have ob- 
tained it. — But I must go on with the historical part 
of things, and take every part in its order. 

After Friday aVid I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and he could understand almost all I said 
to him, and speak pretty fluently, though in bro- 
ken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own 
history, or at least so much of it as related to my 
ccHning to this place; how I had lived here, and how 
long : I let him into the mystery, for such it was to 
him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to 
shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully 
delighted with ; and I made him a belt, with a frog 
hanging to it, such as*in England we wear hangers in ; 
and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a 
hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in 



td8 UFS AND ADVENTURES 

aome cases, but much more useful on other occa-' 

1 described to him the country of Europe, particu- 
hurlv Knsdand, which I came irom ; how we lived, 
baw we worshipped God, how we behaved to one an* 
«lber« aad bow we traded in ships to all parts of the 
w\vrM« I gave him an account of the wreck which J 
b«d been on board of, and showed him, as near as I 
c^mKK tbe place where she lay ; but she was all beaten 
Ml pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins 
«f our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and 
which I could not stir with my whole strength then ; 
bill it was now fallen almost all to pieces. On seeing 
Ibis boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said 
lM>lbiug. I asked him what it was he studied on ? ^t 
last, says he, ''Me see such boat like come to place 
ml my nation." I did not understand him a good 
while ; but, at last, when I had examined farther into 
it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that had 
been, came on shore on the country where he lived ; 
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress 
of weather. I presently imagined that some Euro* 
pean ship must have been cast away on their coast, 
and the boat might get loose, and drive ashore ; but 
was so dull, that I never once thought of men making 
their escape from a wreck thither, much less whence 
they might come : so 1 only inquired after a descrip- 
tion of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but 
brought me better to understand him when he added 
with some warmth, ** We save the white mans from 
drown." Then I presently asked him, if there were 
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat ? 
** Yes," he said ; ** the boat full of white mans." I 
asked him how many ? He told on his fingers seven- 
teen. I asked him then what became of them ? He 
told me, ** They live, they dwell at my nation." 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE; 239 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I pre^- 
sently imagined that these might be the men belong- 
ing to the ship that was cast away in the sight of my 
island, as I now called it ; and who, after the ship 
was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably 
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were 
landed on that wild shore among the savages. On 
this, I inquired of him more critically what was be- 
come of them ; he assured me they lived still there ; 
that they had been there about four years ; that the 
savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live 
on. I asked him how it came to pass they did not 
kill them, and eat them ? He said, '' No, they make 
brother with them ;" that is, as I understood him, a 
truce; and then he added, *^ They no eat mans but 
when make the war fight ;" that is to say, they never 
eat any men but such as come to fight with them, and 
are taken in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that being 
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, 
from whence, as I have said, I had, in a clear day, 
discovered the main or continent of America, Friday, 
the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly 
towards the main land, and, in a kind of surprise, 
falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for 
1 was at some distance from him. I asked him what 
was the matter ? " O joy !" says he ; " O glad ! 
there see my country, there my nation !'' I ob- 
served an extraordinary sense of pleasure ap^ar^d in 
his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance 
discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to 
be in his own country again. This observation of mine 
put a great many thoughts into me, which made me 
at first not so easy about my new man Friday as I 
was before ; and I made no doubt but that if Friday 
could get back to his own nation again, he would not 
only forget all his religion, but all his obligation to 
me, and would be forward enough to give his c^^^y&^sr^- 



S40 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

men an account of me, and come back perhaps with a 
hundred or. two of them, and make a feast on me, at 
which he might be as merry as he used to be with 
those of his enemies, when they were taken in war. 
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, 
for which I was very sorry afterwards. However, as 
my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I 
vras a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and 
kind to him as before : in which I was certainly in 
the wrong too ; the honest, grateful creature, having 
no thought about it, but what consisted with the best 
principles, both as a religious Christian, and as a 
grateful friend; as appeared afterwards, to my full 
satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure 
I was every day pumping him, to see if be would dis- 
cover any of the new thoughts which I suspected 
were in him : but I found every thing he said was so 
honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing to 
nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all my uneasi- 
ness, he made me at last entirely his own again ; nor 
did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and 
therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather 
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con- 
tinent, I called to him, and said, ** Friday, do not 
you wish yourself in your own country, your own 
nation V — ** Yes," he said, " I be much O glad to be 
at my own nation.'' — *' What would you do there?'' 
said I : '^ would you turn wild again, eat men's tlesh 
again, and be a savage as you were before ?" He 
looked full of concern, and shaking his head, said, 
** No, no, Friday tell them to live good ; tell them to 
pray God ; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, 
milk ; no eat man again." — ** Why then,'* said I to 
him, ** they will kill you." He looked grave at that, 
and then said, ** No, no ; they no kill me, they wil- 
ling love learn." He meant by this, they would be 



OF ROBIKSON CBUSOE. 241 

willing to learn. He added, they learned much of 
the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I 
asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled 
at that, and told me that he could not swim so far. I 
told him, I would make a canoe for him. He told 
me he would go, if I would go with him. ** I go !" 
says I, ** why, they will eat me if I come there." — 
" No, no," says he, ** me make they no eat you ; me 
make they much love you." He meant, he would 
tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved his 
life, and so he would make them love me. Then he 
told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to 
seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called 
them, who came on shore there in distress. 

From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture 
over, and see if I could possibly join with those 
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards 
and Portuguese : not doubting but if I could, we 
might find some method to escape from thence, being 
on the continent, and a good company together, better 
than I could from an island forty miles off the shore, 
and alone, without help. So, after some days, I took 
Friday to work again, by way of discourse ; and told 
him I would give him a boat to go back to his own 
nation ; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate, 
which lay on the other side of the island, and having 
cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in 
water,) I brought it out, showed it him, and we both 
went into it. I foiind he was a most dexterous fellow 
at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift 
again as I could. So when he was in, I saM to him, 
** Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your nation ?" 
He looked very dull at my saying so ; which, it 
seems, was because he thought the boat too small to 
go so far : I then told him I had a bi^er ;• so the next 
day I went to the place where the first boat lay which 
I had made, but which I could not get into the water. 
He said that was big enough : but then, as I haxL 
VOL. I. ^ 



242 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and- 
twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, 
that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such 
a hoat would do very well, and would carry '* much 
enough yittle, drink, hread ;!' that was his way of 
talking. 

On the whole, I was hy this time so fixed on my 
design of going over with him to the continent, that 
I told him we would go and make one as hi g as that, 
and he should go home in it. He answered not one 
word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him 
yrhat was the matter with him ? He asked me again, 
** Why you angry mad with Friday ? what me done ?" 
I asked him what he meant : I told him I was not angry 
with him at all. ** No angry !" says he, repeating the 
words several times, " why send Friday home away to 
my nation ?" — ** Why," says I, "Friday, did not you 
say you wished you were there?" — *' i es, yes," says 
he, " wish be both there ; no wish Friday there, no 
master there." In a word, he would not think of go- 
ing there without me. *' I go there, Friday !" says I, 
** what shfi^U I do there ?'' He returned very quick on 
me at this : <' You do great deal much good," says he ; 
'' you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans ; 
you tell them know God, pray God, and live new 
life." — *'Alas! Friday," says 1, "thou knowest not 
what thou sayest ; I am but an ignorant man myself." 
— ** Yes, yes," says he, "you teachee me good, you 
ieachee them good." — " No, no, Friday," says I, 
" you shall go without me ; leave me here to live by 
myself, as I did before." He looked confused again 
at that word ; and running to one of the hatchets 
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and 
gives it to me. " What must I do with this?" says 
I to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. "What 
must I kill you lor ?" said I again. He returns very 
quick, " What you send Friday away for ? Take kill 
Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so 



k 
I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 

earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes: in a 
word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in 
him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told 
him then, and often after, that I would never send 
him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me. 
On the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a 
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part 
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his dei 
sire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent 
affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing 
them good ; a thing, which, as I had no notion of my- 
self, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or 
desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong 
inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, 
founded on the supposition gathered from the dis- 
course, viz. that there were seventeen bearded men 
there : and, therefore, without any inore delay, I 
went to work with Friday, to find out a great tree 
proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to 
undertake the voyage^ There were trees enough in 
the island to have built a little fleet, not of {)eriaguas, 
or canoes, but even of good large vessels : but the main 
thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water 
that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid 
the mistake I committed at first. At last, Friday 
pitched on a tree ; for I found he knew much better 
than I what kind of wood was fittest (or it ; nor can 
I tell, to this day, what wood to calttiie tree we cut 
down, except that it was v^rylike the tree we call 
fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it 
was much of the same color and smell. Friday was 
for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to 
make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it 
with tools ; which, after I had showed him how to 
use, he did very handily : and in about a month's hard 
labor we finished it, and made it very handsome ; 
especially when, with our axes, which I showed him 
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the 



244 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us 
near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were inch 
by inch, on great rollers into the water ; but wheti slie 
was in, she would have carried twenty men with great 



When she was in the water, and though she wan so 
big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and 
how swift my man Friday would manage her, turn 
her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if h« 
would, and if we might venture over in her. " Yes,*' 
he said,' **we venture over in her very well, thou^ 
great blow wind." However, I bad a farther des^ 
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a mast 
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cables 
As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I 
pitched on a straight young cedar tree, which I found 
near the place, and which there was great plenty-of 
in the island : and I set Friday to work to cut it 
down, and gave him directions how to shape and 
order it. But as to the sail, that was my particnlar 
care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old 
sails enough ; but as I had had them now six-and- 
twenty years by me, and had not been very careful 
to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever 
have this kind of use for theip, I did not doubt but 
they were all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were 
so. However, I found two pieces, which appeared 
pretty good, and with these I went to work; and 
with a great deal of pains, and awkward stitching; 
you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length 
made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in 
England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom 
at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as 
usually pur ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I 
best knew how to manage, as it was such a one I had 
to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, 
as related in the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work.

Tiz. rigging and fitting my mast und saih; for I 
finished them very complete, making a small stay, and 
a sail, or fore-sail,. to it, to assist, if we should turn to 
windward ; and, which was more than aU, I fixed a 
rudder to the stern of her to steer with. I was but a 
bungling shipwright; yet, as I knew the usefulness, 
and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself 
with so much pains to do it, that at lastvl brought it to 
pass ; though, considering the many dull contrivances 
I had for it that £aiied, I think it cost me almost as 
much labor as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my 
boat ; for, though, he knew very well how to paddle a 
canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and 
a rudder ; and was the most amazed when he saw me 
work the boat to and. again in the sea by the rudder, 
and how the sail ^bbed, and filled this way, or that 
way, as the course we sailed changed ; I say, when 
he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. 
However, with a little use, I made all these things 
familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, ex- 
cept that as to the compass ; I could make him under* 
stand very little of that. On the other hand, as there 
was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never 
any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for 
a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by 
night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy sea^ 
SOBS, and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by 
land or sea. 

I ^as now entered* on the ^eveo-and-twentietfti year 
of my captivity in this place ; though the three last 
years that I had this creature with me ou^bi rather to 
be left out of the account, my habitation being quite 
of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I 
kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same 
thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first ; and if 
I had SMch cause of acknowledgment at first, I had 



Ml UFB AND ADVENTURES 

HUfedi nore so now, having such additional testimonies 
of Uie care of Providence over me, and the great 
bofics I had of being effectually and speedily delivered; 
for I had an invincible impression on my thoughts 
Ikmi my deliverance was at hand, and that I should 
not be another year in this place. I went on, how- 
«T«r» with my husbandry; digging, planting, and 
fencings as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes^ 
mad did every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the mean time, on me, 
when I kept more within doors than at other times. 
We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, 
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the 
beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and 
hauling her up to the shore, at high- water mark, 
I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big 
enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her 
water enough to float in ; and then, when the tide 
was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it» 
to keep the water out ; and so she lay dry, as to the 
tide, from the sea ; and to keep the rain oif, we laid a 
great many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as 
well ' thatched as a house; and thus we waited for 
the months of November and December, in which I 
designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the 
' thought of my design returned with the fair weather, 
I was preparing daily for the voyage ; and the first 
thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pro- 
visions, being the stores for our voyage ; and in** 
tended, in a week or a fortnight's 4ime, to op^ the 
dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morn- 
ing on something of this kind, when I called to 
Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he 
could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which we ge« 
nerally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as 
well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone, 
when he came running back^ and flew over my outer 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 247 

wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the 
steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak 
to nim, he cries out to me, '< O master ! O master ! O 
sorrow ! O bad !" — "What's the matter, Friday ?" ^ays 
I. ** O yonder, there,'* says he, ** one, two, three, ca- 
noe; one, two, three !" By this way of speaking, I con^ 
eluded there were six ; but, on inquiry, I found it was 
but three. " Well, Friday," says I, ** do not be fright- 
ened." 60 I heartened him up as well as I could : 
however, I saw the. poor fellow was most terribly 
scared ; for nothing ran in his head but that they were 
come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, 
and eat him ; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I 
scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him 
as well as 1. could, and told him I was in as much 
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as 
him, ** But," says I, ** Friday, we must resolve to 
fight them. Can you fight, Friday ?"— *« Me shoot," 
says he; ** but there come many great number." — ** No 
matter for that," said I, again ; '^ our guns will fright 
them that we do not kill." So I asked him whether, 
if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and 
stand by me, and do just as I bid him. He said, 
** Me die, when you bid die. Master." So I went and 
fetched a good dram of rum and gave him ; for I had 
been so good a husband of ^my rum that I had a great 
deal left. When he drank it, I made him take the 
two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and 
loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small 
pistol-bullets : then I took four muskets, and loaded 
them with two slugs, and five small bullets each ; and 
my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each: I 
hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and 
gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared* 
myself, I took my perspective-glass, and went up to 
the side of the hill, to see what 1 could discover ; and 
I found quickly y by my glass, that there were one-sind« 
twenty savages, ^ee prisoners^ and three canoes; 



248 LIFB AND ADVENTURBS 

and thkt their whole business seemed to be the 
triumphant banquet on these three human bodies ; a 
barbarous feast indeed ! but nothing more than, as I 
had observed, was usual with them. I observed also 
that they were landed, not where they had done when 
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek : 
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood 
came almost close down to the sea. This, with the 
abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came 
about, filled me with such indignation, that I came 
down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to 
gQ down to them, and kill them all ; and asked him if 
he would stand by me. He had now got over his 
fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the 
dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told 
me, as before, he would die when I bid die. 

In this fit of fury 9 I took and divided the arms 
which I had charged, as before, between us : I gave 
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns 
on his shoulder; and I took one pistol and the 
other three guns myself ; and in this posture we 
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my 
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more pow- 
der and bullets ; and, as to orders, I charged him to 
keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do 
any thing, till I bid him ; and, in the mean time, not 
to speak a word. In this posture, I fetched a compass 
to my right hand of near a mile, as well *to get over 
the creek as to get into the wood, so that I might come 
within shot of them before I should be discovered, 
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former 
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolution : 
I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their 
number; for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, 
it is certain I was superior to them ; nay, thougb I 
had been alone. But it occurred to my thoughts, 
what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 249 

was in /to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack 
people who had neither done nor intended me any 
wrong; who« as to me, were innocent, and whose 
barbarous customs were their own disaster ; being, in 
them, a token indeed of God's having left them, with 
the other nations of that part of the world, to such 
stupidity, and to such inhuman courses ; but did not 
call me to take on me to be a judge -of their actions, 
much less an executionerof his justice; that, whenever 
he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own 
hands, and by national vengeance punish' them, as a 
people, for national crimes; but that, in the mean 
time, it was none of my business ; that, it was true, 
Friday might justify it, because he was a declared 
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particu- 
Jar people, and it was lawful for him to attacK them ; 
but I could not say the same with respect to myself. 
These things were so warmly pressed on my thoughts 
all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only 
go and place myself near them, that I might observe 
their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as 
God should direct; but that, unless something of- 
fered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, 
J would not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood; and, 
with all possible wai^iness and silence, Friday ioU 
lowing close at my heels, I marched till I came to 
the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to 
them, only that one corner of the wood lay between 
me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and 
showing him a great tree, which was just at the cornier 
of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me 
word if he could see there plainly what they were 
doing. He did so ; and came immediately back to 
me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there ; 
that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of 
one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound on 
the sand) a Uttie fr9m them^ whioh, Jbe said,- 



250 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

would kill next, and which fired the very soill within 
me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but 
one of the bearded men he had told me of, that came 
to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror 
at the very naming the white-bearded man ; and, going 
to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, 
who lay on the beach of the sea, with his hands and 
his feet tied with fiags, or things like rushes, and that 
he was an European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond 
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place 
where I was, which, by going a little way about, I 
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I 
should be within half a shot of them : so I withheld my 
passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest 
degree; and going back about. twenty paces, I got 
behind some bushes, which held all the way till I 
came to the other tree ; and then came to a little 
rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at 
the distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of 
the dreadful wretches sat on the ground, all close 
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to 
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, 
limb by limb to their fire; and they were stooping 
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to 
Friday — ** Now, Friday," said I, ** do as I bid thee." 
Friday said he would. ** Then, Friday," says I, ** do 
exactly as you see me do ; fail in nothing." So I set 
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece on 
the ground, and Friday did the like by his ; and vrith 
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bid- 
ding him to do the like : then asking him if he was 
ready, he said, " Yes." ** Then fire at them," said 
I ; and the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that 
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and 
wounded three more ; and on my side, I killed one^ 



i

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 26l 

and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in 
a dreadful consternation ; and all of them who were 
not hurt jumped on their feet, but did not imme- 
diately know which way to run, or which way to 
look, for they knew not from whence their destruo-^ 
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close on me, that, 
as I had bid him, he might observ;e what I did ; so, 
as soon as the first shot was made, 1 threw down the 
piece, and took up the fow'Iing-piece, and Friday did 
the like : he saw me cock and present ; he did the 
same again. ** Are you ready, Friday?" said I.— 
" Yes,*' says he. ** Let fly, then,** says I, ** in the 
name of God !'* and with that, I fired again among 
the amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and as our 
pieces were now loaded with what I called swan-shot, 
or small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but 
so many were wounded, that they ran about yelling 
and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and 
most of tbem miserably woundeil^ whereof three more 
fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 

** Now, Friday,** says I, laying down the dis- 
charged pieces, and taking yp th^ musket which was 
yet loaded, " follow me;'* which he did with a great 
deal of courage ; on which I rushed out of the wood, 
and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. As 
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud 
as I could, and bade Friday do so too t <Lnd running 
as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very 
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made dl' 
rectly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, 
lying on the beach, or shore, between the place where 
they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were 
just going to work with him, had left him at the sur- 
prise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to 
the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three 
more of the rest made the same way. I turned to 
Friday, and bade him step forwards^ and fire at them ; 
he understood me immediately, and running about 



252 I.IFS AND ADVENTURES 

forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I 
thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall 
of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up 
again quickly : however, he killed two of them, and 
wounded the third so, that he lay down in the bottom 
of the boat as if he had been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out 
my knife and cut the nags that bound the poor vic- 
tim ; and loosing his , hands and feet, I lifted him 
up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what 
he was. He answered in Latin, Cbristianus ; but 
was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand or 
speak. I took my botUe out of my pocket, and gave 
it him, making signs that he should drink, which he 
did ; and I gave him a piece of bread which he eat. 
Then I asked him what countr3riDAn he was : and he 
said, Espagniole ; and being a Uttle recovered, let me 
know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how 
much he was in my debt fojr his deliverance. '< Seig- 
nior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could make 
up, ** we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now : 
if you have any strength left^ take this pistol and 
sword, and lay, about you." He took them very 
thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his 
hands, but, as if they had put new vigor into him, 
he fiew on his murderers like a fury, and had cut two 
of them in pieces in an instant ; for the truth is, as the 
whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures 
were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces, 
that they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and 
bad no moTe power to attempt their own escape, than 
their fiesh had to resist our shot : and that was the 
case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat : for 
as three of them fell with the hurt they received, so 
the other two fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand ^ still without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I 
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword ; so I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2S3 

called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree 
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which 
lay there that had been discharged, which he did 
with great swiftness ; and then giving him my musket, 
I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and 
bade them come to me when they wanted. While 
I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce 
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the 
savages, who made at him with one of their great 
wooden swords, the same-like weapon that was to 
have killed him before, if I had not |»«^ented it. 
The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could 
be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian 
a good while, and had cut him two great wounds on 
his head ; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, 
closing in with him, had thrown him down, being 
faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand ; 
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting 
the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the 
savage through the body, and killed him on the spot, 
before I, who was running to help him, could come 
near him. 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the 
flying wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his 
hatchet; and with that he dispatched tho^e three, 
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and 
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with: and 
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one 
of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of 
the savages, and wounded them both ; but, as he was 
not able to run, they both got from him into the 
wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of 
them, but the other was too nimble for him ; and 
though he was wounded, yet had plunged himself 
into the sea, and swam, with all his might, off to 
those two who were . left in the canoe, which three in 
the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whe* 
^her he died or no> were all that escaped our hands .of 



254 I.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

one-and-twenty ; the accou^t of the whole is as 
follows : three killed at our first shot from the tree ; 
two killed at the next shot ; two killed hy Friday in 
the hoat; two killed by Friday of those at first 
wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three 
killed by the Spaniard ; four killed, being found 
dropped here and there, of their wounds, or killed by 
Friday in his chase of them ; four escaped in the boat,- 
whereof one wounded, if not dead. — Twenty-one in 
all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get 
out of gun-shot, and though Friday made two or three 
shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of them. 
Friday would fain have had me take one of their ca- 
noes, and pursue them ; and, indeed, I was very 
anxious about their escape, lest carrying the news 
home to their people, they should come back perhaps 
with two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us 
by mere multitude ; so I consented to pursue them 
by sea, and running to one of their canoes, I jumped 
in^ and bade Friday follow me ; but when I was in 
the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor crea* 
ture lie there j bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard 
was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with the fear, 
not knowing what was the matter; for he had not 
been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was 
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so 
long, that he had really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which 
jthey had bound him with, and would have helped him 
up ; but he could not stand or speak, but groaned 
most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was 
only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday 
came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him 
of his deliverance ; and, pulling out my bottle, niade 
him give the poor wretch a dram; which, with the 
news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat 
up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 255 

speak, and look in his face, it would have moved Uny 
one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, 
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, 
jumped about, danced, sang ; then cried again, wrung 
his hands, beat his own face and head ; ai|d then sang 
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature. 
It was a good while before I could make him speak 
to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when 
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was his 
father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me 
to see what ecstacy and filial affection had worked 
in this poor savage at the sight of his. father, and of 
his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can I 
describe half the extravagances of his affection after 
this ; for he went into the boat, and out of the boat, 
a great many tidies : when he went in to him, he 
would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold 
his father's head close to his bosom for many minutes 
together, to nourish it ; then he took his arms and 
ancles, which were numbed and stiff* with the bind- 
ing, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands ; 
and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some 
rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did 
them a great deal of good. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe 
with the other savages, who were now got almost out 
of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did not; 
for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before 
they could be got a quarter of their way, and con- 
tinued blowing so hard all night, and that from the 
north-west, which was against them, that I could not 
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached 
their own coast. 

But, to return to Friday ; he was so busy about 
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take 
him off for some time : but after I thought he could 
leave him a little^ I called him to me, and be came 



266 LIFB AND ADVBNTURES 

jumping and laughing*, and pleased to the highest ex- 
treme ; then I asked him if he had given bis father 
any hread. He shook his head, and said, " None ; 
ugly dog eat all up self.'^ I then gave him a cake of 
hread, out of a little pouch I carried on purpose ; I 
also gaye him a dram for himself, hut he would not 
taste it, hut carried it to his father. I had in my 
pocket two or three hunches of raisins, so I gave him 
a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner 
given his father these raisins, but I saw him come out 
of the boat, and run away, as if he had been be- 
witched, he ran at such a rate ; for he was the swift« 
est fellow on his feet that ever I saw : I say, he ran 
at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in 
an instant; and though I called, and hallooed out 
too, after him, it was all one, away he vrent ; and in 
a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, 
though not so fast as he went ; and as he came nearer, 
I found his ptice slacker, because he had something 
in his hand. When he came up to me, I found m 
had been quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to 
bring his father some iVesh water, and that he had 
two more cakes or loaves of bread ; the bread he 
gave me, but the water he carried to his father ; how- 
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of 
it. The water revived his father more than all the 
ram or spirits I had given him, for he was just faints 
ing with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called to him to 
know if there was any water left : he said, " Yes ;** 
and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who 
was in as much .want of it as his father ; and I sent 
oiie of the cakes that Friday brought, to the Spaniard 
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing 
himself on a green place under the shade of a tree ) 
and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much 
swelled with the rude bandas-e he had been tied with. 
When I saw that, on ^Friday's coming to him wHh 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread, 
and began to eat, I went to bim and gave him a hand- 
ful of raisins : he looked up in my face with all the 
tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could ap- 
pear in any countenance ; but was so weak, notwith- 
.standing he had so exerted himself in the light, that 
he could not stand on his feet; he tried to do it 
two or three times, but was really not able, his ancleis 
were so swelled and so painful to him ; so I bade him 
sit still, and caused Friday to rub his anoles, and 
bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every 
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was 
here, turn his head about, to see if his father was 
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting ; 
and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at which 
he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew 
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce per- 
ceive his feet to touch the ground as he went : but 
when he came, he only found he had laid himself 
down to ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me 
presently ; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let 
Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the 
boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, 
where I would take care of him : but Friday, a lusty 
strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite up on his back, 
and carried him away to the boat, and set him down 
softly on the side or gunnel of the canoe, with hfs 
feet in the inside of it ; and then lifting him quite in, 
he set him close to his father ; and presently stepping 
out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along 
the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind 
blew pretty hard too : so he brought them both safe 
into our creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran 
away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I 
spoke to him, and , asked him whither he went. He 
told me, ** Go fetch more boat:" so away he went 
like the wind, for sure nerer man or horse ran like

him ; and ke kad the other canoe in the creek alnmrt 
•as taoon as I got to it by land ; so he grafted me over, 
and then went to keip our new guests out of the boat, 
which he did ; but they were neither of them able to 
walk, so that poor Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, 
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the 
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kmd of 
a hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I 
carried them both up together on it, between us. 

But when we got them to the outside of our wall, 
or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, 
for it was JjBpossible to get them oyer, and I was 
•resolyed not to break it down : so I set to work again; 
and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a 
very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and aboye 
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without 
our outward fence, and between that and the grove of 
young wood which I had planted : and here we made 
them two beds of such things as I had, viz. of good 
rice-straw, with blankets laid on it, to lie on, and 
another to cover them, on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself 
very rich in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection, 
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked. 
First of all, the whole country was my own mere pro- 
perty, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. 
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected ; I was 
absolutely lord and lawgiver; they all owed their 
lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if 
there had been occasion for it, for me. It was re- 
markable, too, I had but three subjects, and they 
were of three different religions: my man Friday was 
a Protestant, his father wsis a Pagan and a cannibal, 
and the Spaniard was a Papist : however, I allowed 
liberty of conscience throughout my dominions : — But 
this is by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 250 

prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest 
them on, I began to think of making some provision 
for them ; and the first thing I did, 1 ordered Friday 
to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out 
of my particular flock, to be killed ; when I cut off 
the hinder»quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, 
I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, ana made 
them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and 
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the 
broth : and as I cooked it without^doors, for I made no 
fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into the 
new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat 
down, and eat my dinner also with them, and, as well 
as I could, cheered them, and encouraged them. Fri- 
day was my interpreter, especially to his father, and, 
indeed, to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke 
the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch 
our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of 
time, we had left on the place of battle: and, the 
next day, I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and 
would presently be offensive. I also ordered him to 
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which 
I knew were pretty much, and which I could not 
think of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see 
them, if I went that way ; all which he punctually 
performed, and effaced the very appearance of the 
savages being there; so that when I went again, I 
could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by 
the comer of th^ wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with 
my two new subjects : and, first, I set Friday to in- 
quire of his £Bither what he thought of thp escape of 
the savages in that canoe, and whether we might ex- 
pect a return pi them, with a power too great for us to 
resist. His first opinion was, that the savages in th& 



260 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

boat never could live out the storm which blew that 
night they went off, but must of necessity be drowned, 
or driven south to those other shores, where they were 
as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned, if 
they were cast away : but, as to what they would do, 
if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; but 
it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully fright- 
ened with the manner of their being attacked, the 
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell 
the people they were all killed by thunder and light- 
ning, not by the hand of man ; and that the two 
which appeared, viz. Friday and I, were two heavenly 
spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not 
men with weapons. This, he said, he knew ; because 
he heard them all cry out so, in their language, one to 
another ; for it was impossible for them to conceive 
that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and 
kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was 
done now : and this old savage was in the right ; for, 
as I understood since, by other hands, the savages 
never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, 
they were so terrified with the accounts given by those 
four men (for, it seems, they did escape the sea,) that 
they believed whoever went to that enchanted island 
would be destroyed with tire from the gods. This, 
however, I knew not ; and therefore was under con- 
tinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always 
on my guard, with all my army : for, as there were 
now four of us, I would have ventured on a hundred 
of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appear- 
ing, the fear of their coming wore off ; and I began 
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main 
into consideration ; being likewise assured, by Fri- 
day's father, that I might depend on good usage from 
their nation, on his account, if I would go. But my 
thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious 
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 261 

that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and 
Portuguese, who having been cast away, and made 
their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, 
with the savages, but were very sore put to it for ne- 
cessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the 
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a 
Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to the 
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, 
which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back 
what European goods they could meet with there; 
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom 
they took out of another wreck ; that five of their own 
men were drowned, when first the ship was lost, and 
that these escaped, through infinite dangers and 
hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal 
coast, where they expected to have been devoured 
every moment. He told me they had some arms with 
them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they 
had lieither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea 
having spoiled all their powder, but a little, which 
they used, at their first landing, to provide themselves 
some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of 
them there, and if they had formed any design of 
making their escape. He said they had many con- 
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel, 
nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, 
their councils always epded in tears and despair. I 
asked him how he thought they would receive a pro- 
posal from me, which might tend towards an escape ; 
and whether, if they were all here, it might not be 
done. I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their 
treachery and ill usage of me, if I put my life in their 
hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in 
the nature of man, nor did men always square their 
dealings by the obligations they had received, so 
much as they did by the advantages they expected. 
I told him it would be very hard that I should be the 



262 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

instrument of their deliverance, and that they should 
afterwards make me their priscAier in New Spain, 
where an Englishman- was certain to be made a sacri- 
iice, what necessity, or what accident soever brought 
him thither ; and that I had rather b<Melivered up to 
the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the 
merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the 
Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded, 
if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, 
build a bark large enough to carry us all away, either 
to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or Spanish 
coast, northward ; but that if, in requital, they snould, 
when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by 
force among their own people, I might be ill used for 
my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it 
was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candor and 
ingenuousness, that their condition was so miserable, 
and that they were so sensible of it, that, he believed, 
they would abhor th6 thought of using any man un- 
kindly that should contribute to their deliverance; 
and that if I pleased, he would go to them with the 
old man, and discourse with them about it, and return 
again, and bring me their answer; that he would 
make conditions with them on their solemn oath, that 
they should be absolutely under my leading, as their 
commander and captain ; and that they should swear 
on the holy sacraments and gospel, to be true to me, 
and go to such Christian country as that I should 
agree to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and 
absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely 
in such countrv as I intended; and that he would 
bring a contract from them, under their hands, for 
that purpose. Then he told me he would first swear 
to me himself, that he would never stir from me as 
long as he lived, till I gave him orders ; and that he 
would take my side to the last drop of his blood, if 
there should happen the least breach of faith among 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 263 

his countrymeo. He told me they were all of them 
very civil, honest men, and they were under the great? 
est distress imaginable, having^eith<^ weapons nor 
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discre-r 
tion of the samages ; out of all hopes of €iver return* 
ing to their own country ; and that he was sure, if I 
would undertake their relief, they would live and die 
by me. 

On these assurances, I resolved to venture to re- 
lieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage 
and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But when 
we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard 
himself started an objection, which had so much pru- 
dence in it, on one hand, and so much sincerity on 
the other hand, that I could not but be very well 
satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put off the deliver- 
ance of his comrades for at least half a year. The 
case was thus : He had been with us now about a 
month, during which time I had let him see in what 
manner I had provided, with the assistance of Pro- 
vidence, for my support ; and he saw evidently what 
stock oi corn and rice I had laid up ; which, though 
it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not 
sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now 
it was increased to four ; but much less would it be 
sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said, 
sixteen, still alive, should come over ; and, least of 
all, would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we 
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Chris- 
tian colonies of America ; so he told me he thought 
it would be more adviseable to let him and the other 
two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I 
could spare seed to sow, and that we should wait 
another harvest, that we might have a supply of corn 
for his countrymen, when they should come ; for 
want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or 
not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out 



264 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

of one difficulty into another. " You know/^ says 
he, ** the children of Israel, though they rejoiced 
at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet 
rebelled even against God himself, that delivered 
them, when they came to want bread in the wilder* 
ness." 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so 
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with 
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fide- 
lity : so we . fell to digging all four of us, as well as 
the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted ; 
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it 
was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and 
trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of 
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice; which was, in 
short, all the seed we had to spare : nor, indeed, did 
we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food, 
for the six months that we had to expect our crop ; 
that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our 
seed aside for sowing ; for it is not to be supposed it 
is si^ months in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being: 
sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they 
had come, unless their number had been very great, 
we went freely all over the island, whenever we found 
occasion ; and as here we had our escape or deliver- 
ance on our thoughts, it was impossible, at least 
for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For 
this purpose, I marked out several trees which I 
thought tit for our work, ^nd I set Friday and his 
father to cutting them down ; and then I caused the 
Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that 
aiiair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a 
large tree into single planks, and I caused them to 
do the like, till they had made about a dozen large 
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five 



OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 265 

feet long, and from two. inches to four inches thick : 
what prodigious labor it took up, any one may 
imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my iittle 
flock of tame goats as much as I could ; and for 
this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out 
one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for 
we . took our turns,) and by this means we got about 
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest ; for 
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and 
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season 
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a pro- 
digious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, 1 be- 
lieve, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the 
sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty 
barrels ; and these, with our bread, was a great part 
of our food, and was very good living too, I assure 
you, for it is exceeding nourishing. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order : 
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in 
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer 
our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we 
brought in and threshed out above two hundred and 
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the 
rice ; which was store enough for our food to the 
next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had 
been on shore with me ; or if we had been ready for 
a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled 
our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, 
that is to say, any part of 'America. When we had 
thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we 
fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great 
baskets, in which we kept it ; and the Spaniard was 
very handy and dexterous at this part, and often 
blamed me that I did not make some things for de- 
fence of this kind of work ; but I saw no need of it. 

And now having a full supply of food for all the 
guests I expected, I ^ve the Spaniard^ave to go 



266 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

over to the main, to see what he could do with those 
he had left behind them there. I gave him a strict 
charge not to bring any man with him who would nol 
first swear, in the presence of himself and the old 
savage, that he would no way injure, fight witk,. o« 
attack the person he should find in the island, who 
was so kind as to send for them in order to their de*" 
liyerance ; but that they would stand by him, aad 
defend him against all such attempts, and wh^eyet 
they went, would be entirely under and subjected to 
his command ; and that this should be put in writing^ 
and signed with their hands. How they were to have 
done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, 
was a question which we never asked. Under these 
instru<itions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the 
leither of Friday, went away in one of the canoes 
which they might be said to come in, or rather were 
brought in, when they came as prisoners to be de- 
voured by the savages. I gave each of them a mus- 
ket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges of 
powder and ball, charging them to be very good hus- 
bands of both, and not to use either of them but on 
urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures 
used by me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty- 
seven years and some days. I gave them provisi<MM 
of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves 
for many days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for 
about eight days' time ; and wishing them a good 
voyage, I saw them go ; agreeing with them about a 
signal they should hang out at their return, by which 
I should know them again, when they came back, at 
a distance, before they came on shore. They went 
away with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was 
at full, by my account in the month of October ; but 
as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had once 
lost it, I could never recover it again ; nor had I kept 
even the number of years so punctually as to be sure 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOl. WT 

I was right ; though, as it proved, when I afterwards 
examined my account, I found I had kept a true 
reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for 
them, when a strange and unforeseen accident inter- 
vened, of which the like has not perhaps been heard 
of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one 
morning, when my man Friday came running in to 
me, and called aloud, ** Master, master, they are 
come, they are come !" I jumped up, and, regard- 
less of danger, I went out as soon as 1 could get my 
clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the 
way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood ; 
I say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, 
which was not my custom to do ; but I was surprised^ 
when turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a 
boat at about a league and a half distance, standing is 
for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they 
call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them 
in : also I observed presently, that they did not come 
from that side which the shore lay on, but from the 
southernmost end of the island. On this, I called 
Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were not 
the people we looked for, and that we might not 
know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In 
the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective- 
glass, to see what I could make of them ; and having 
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the 
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any 
thing, and to take my view the plainer, without being 
discovered. I had scarce set my foot on the hill, 
when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an 
anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance from 
me, S.S.E. but not above a league and a half from 
the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to 
be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an 
English long-boat, 

I cannot express the confusion I was in : though 



268 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the joy of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to 
belieye was manned by my own countrymen, i^nd con- 
sequentiy friends, was such as I cannot describe ; but 
yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cannot 
tell from whence they came, bidding me keep on my 
guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consi- 
der what business an English ship could have in that 
part of the world, since it was not the way to or from 
any part of the world where the English had any 
traffic ; and I knew there had been no storms to drive 
them in there, as in distress : and that if they were 
really English, it was most probable that they were 
here on no good design ; and that I had better con- 
tinue as I was, than fall into the hands of thieves and 
murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of 
danger, which sometimes are given him when he may 
think there is no possibility of its being real. That 
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that 
have made any observations of things can deny ; that 
they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and 
a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the 
tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, 
why should we not suppose they are from some friend- 
ly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordi- 
nate, is not the question,) and that they are given for 
our good ? 

The present question abundantly confirms me in the 
justice of this reasoning ; for had I not been made cau- 
tious by this secret admonition, come it from whence it 
will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse 
condition than before, as you will see presently. I 
had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the 
boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek 
to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing ; how- 
ever, as they did not come quite far enough, they did 
not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my 
rafts, but run their boat on shore on the beach, at 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

about half a mile from me, which was very happy for 
me : for otherwise they would have landed just at my 
door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me 
out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of 
all I had. When they were on shore, I was fully 
satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; 
one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove 
so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three of 
them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound; 
and when the first four or five of them were jumped 
on shore, they took those three out of the boat, as pri- 
soners : one of the three I could perceive using the 
most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and 
despair, even to a kind of extravagance ; the other 
two, 1 could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes^ 
and appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a de- 
gree as the first. I was perfectly confounded at the 
sight, and knew not what the meaning of it should be. 
Friday called out to me in English, as well as he 
could, ** O master ! you'see English mans eat prisoner 
as well as savage mans." — ** Why, Friday," says I, 
'* do you think they are going to eat them then ?" — 
** Yes," says Friday, *' they will eat them." — ** No, 
no," says I, ** Friday; I am afraid they will murder 
them, indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat 
them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter 
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of the 
sight, expecting every moment when the three prison- 
ers should be killed ; nay, once I saw one of the vil- 
lains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen 
call it, or sword, to strike one of the poor men ; and I 
expected to see him fall every moment; at which all 
the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. 
I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the sa- 
vage that was gone with him, or that I had any way 
to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that 
I might have rescued the three men, for I saw no fire- 



S7P LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

anas they had among them ; but it fell out to my 
mind another 'way. After I had observed the out- 
rageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, 
I observed the fellows run scattering about the island, 
as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that 
the three other men had liberty to go also where they 
pleased ; but they sat down all three on the ground, 
very pensive, and looked like men in despair. This 
put me in mind of the first time when I came on 
shore, and began to look about me ; how I gave my- 
self over for lost ; how wildly I looked round me ; 
what dreadful apprehensions I had ; and how I 
lodged in the tree all night, for fear of being devoured 
by wild beasts. As I knew nothing, that night, of 
the supply I was to receive by the providential driv- 
ing of tne ship nearer the land by the storms and tide, 
by which I have since been so lung nourished and 
supported; so these three poor desolate men knew 
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they 
were, how near it was to them, and how effectually 
and really they were in a condition of safety, at the 
same time that they thought themselves lost, and their 
case desperate. So little do we see before us in the 
world, and so much reason have we to depend cheer- 
fully on the great maker of the world, that he does 
not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but 
that, in the worst circumstances, they have always 
something to be thankful for, and sometimes are 
nearer their deliverance than they imagine ; nay, are 
even brought to their deliverance by the means by 
which they seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high water when these 
people came on shore ; and partly while they rambled 
about to see what kind of a place they were in, they 
had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the 
water was ebbed considerably away, leaving their 
boat aground. They had left two men in the boat, 
who, as I found afterwards, having drank a little too 



OF ROBINSON CRU80B. 271 

aiiich brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them wiJc« 
ing a little sooner than the other, and finding the boat 
too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the 
rest, who were straggling about; on which they all 
soon came to the boat : but it was past all their 
strength to launch her, the boat being very heayy, and 
the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost 
Like a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, 
who are perhaps the least of all mankind given to 
f<Hrethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled 
about the country again ; and I heard one of them say 
aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, '' Why^ 
let her alone. Jack, can't you? she'll float next tide :" 
by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry 
of what countrymen they were. All this while I 
kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of 
my castle, any farther than to my place of observa- 
tion, near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was to 
think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no 
less than ten hours before the boat could float again, 
«nd by that time it would be dark, and I might be at 
more liberty to se6 their motions, and to hear their 
discourse, if they had any. In the mean time, I fitted 
myself up for a battle, as before, though with more 
xsaution, knowing I had to do with another kind of 
enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, 
whom I had made an excellent marksman with his 
gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two 
£>wling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My 
figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had my formidable 
goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, 
a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and 
a gun on each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have inade 
uny attempt till it v^as dark ; but about two o'clock, 
being the heat of the day, I found that, in short, they 
were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I 
thought, laid down to sleep. The three poor dis- 



272 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tressed men, too anxious for their condition to get 
any sleep, were, however, sat down under the shelter 
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, 
and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. On 
this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn 
something of their condition ; immediately I marched 
in the figure as above, my man Friday at a good dis- 
tance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but 
not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as 
I did. I came as near them undiscoyered as I could, 
and then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud 
to them in Spanish, ** What are ye, gentlemen ?" 
They started up at the noise; but were ten times 
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth 
figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but 
I thought I perceived them just going to ily from me, 
when I spoke to them in English^: ** Gentlemen,^' said 
I, *' do not be surprised at me : perhaps you may have 
a friend near, when you did not expect it." — ** He 
must be sent directly from Heaven then," said one of 
them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the 
same time to me; '* for our condition is past the help 
of man." — ** All help is from Heaven, Sir," said I : 
** But can you put a stranger in the way how to help 
you ? for you seem to be in some great distress. I saw 
you when you landed ; and when you seemed to make 
application to the brutes that came with you, I saw 
one of them hft up his sword to kill you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, 
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, 
<' Am I talking to God or man ? Is it a real man or 
an angel ?" — ** Be in no fear about that. Sir," said 
I ; ** if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he 
would have come better clothed, and armed after 
another manner than you see me : pray lay aside your 
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to 
assist you : you see I have one servant only ; we 
have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 273 

serve you ? What is your case ?" — *' Our case," said 
he, " Sir, is too long to tell you, while our murderets 
are so near us ; but, in short, Sir, I was commander 
of that ship, my men have mutinied against me ; they 
have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me ; and 
at last have set me on shore in this desolate place, 
with these two men with me, one my mate, the other 
a passenger, where we expected to perish, believing 
the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to 
think of it." — ** Where are these brutes, your ene- 
mies ?" said I : "do you know where they are gone?" 
— ** There they lie. Sir," said he, pointing to a 
thicket of trees ; ** my heart trembles for fear they 
have seen us, and heard you speak; if they have, 
they will certainly murder us all." — ** Have they any 
fire-arms?" said I. He answered, ** they had only 
two pieces, one of which they left in the boat." 
*^ Well then," said I, " leave the rest to me; I sec 
they are all asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them all : 
but shall we rather take them prisoners ?" He told 
me there were two desperate villains among them, 
that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to ; but if 
they were secured, he believed all the rest would re- 
turn to their duty. I asked him which they were ? He 
told me he could not at that distance distinguish them, 
but he would obey my orders in any thing I would 
direct. ** Well," says I, ** let us retreat out of their 
view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve 
further." So they willingly went back with me, till 
the woods covered us from them. 

" Look you. Sir," said I, ** if I venture on your 
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions 
with me ?" He anticipated my proposals, by telling 
me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be 
wholly directed and commanded by me in every 
thing ; and, if the ship was not recovered, he would 
live and die with me in what part of the world soever 
I would send him ; and the two other men said the 
VOL. I. s 



274 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

same. " Well,'* says I, ** my conditions are but 
two : first. That wbile you stay in this island with me, 
you will not pretend to any authority here ; and if I 
put arms in your hands, you will, on all occasions, 
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or 
mine on this island ; and, in the mean time, be go- 
verned by my orders : secondly. That if the ship, is, or 
may be recovered, you will carry me and my man to 
England, passage free." 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention 
or faith of man could devise, that he would comply 
with these most reasonable demands; and, besides, 
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it on all 
occasions. As long as he lived." " Well then,** said 
Ij " here are three muskets for you, with powder and 
ball: tell me next what you think is proper to be 
done." He showed all the testimonies of his grati- 
tude that he was able, but offered to be wholly guided 
by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing 
any thing ; but the best method I could think of was 
to fire on them at once, as they lay, and if any were 
not killed at the first volley, and bffered to submit, 
we might save them, and sa put it wholly on God's 
providence to direct the shot. He said very modestly, 
that he was loath to kill them, if he could help it: 
but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had 
been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if 
they escaped, we should be undone still ; for they 
would go on board and bring the whole ship's com- 
pany, and destroy us all. " Well then/' says I, 
^' necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only 
way to save our lives." However, seeing him still 
cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should 
go themselves, and manage as they found conve- 
nient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of 
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on 
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275 

heads of the mutiny ? He said. No. " Well then/' 
said I, ** you may let them escape; and Providence 
seems to have awakened them on purpose to save 
themselves. — Now/' says I, ** if the rest escape you, 
it is your fault.'' Animated with this, he took the 
musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol 
in his Jbelt, and his two comrades with him, with each 
a piece in his hand ; the two men who were with him 
going first, made some noise, at which one of the 
seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing 
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too 
late then, for the moment he cried out they fired ; I 
mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving his own 
piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men 
they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, 
and the other very much wounded ; but not being 
dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for 
help to the other ; but the captain stepping to him, 
told him it was too late to cry for help, he should 
call on God to forgive his villany ; and with that word 
knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so 
that he never spoke more : there were three more 
in the company, and one of them was also slightly 
wounded. By this time I was come ; and when they 
saw their d'aiige^, and that it was in vain to resist, 
they begged for inercy. The captain told them he 
would spare their lives, if they would give him any 
assurance oif their abhorrence of the treachery they 
had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to 
him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying 
her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They 
gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that 
could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, 
and spare their lives, which I was not against, only 
that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot 
while they were on the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with thecap^ 
tain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure her. 



276 LIFE AND ADVEN'k'URES 

and bring away the oars and sails, which they did : 
and by and by three straggling men, that were (hap- 
pily for them) parted from the rest, came back on 
hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain, who 
before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they 
submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was 
complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should in- 
quire into one another's circumstances : I began first, 
and told him my whole history, which he heard with 
an attention even to amazement ; and particularly at 
the wonderful manner of my being furnished with pro- 
visions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story is 
a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. 
But when he reflected from ^thence on himself, and 
how I seemed to have been preserved there on pur- 
pose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and 
he could not speak a word more. After this commu- 
nication was at an end, I carried him and bis two 
men into my apartment, leading them in just where I 
came out, viz. at the top of the house, where I re- 
freshed them with such provisions as I had, and 
showed them all the contrivances I had made, during 
my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was per- 
fectly amazing ; but, above all, the captain admired 
my fortification, and how perfectly I had concealed 
my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been 
now planted near twenty years, and the trees growing 
much faster than in England, was become a little 
wood, and so thick, that it was impassable in any 
part of it, but at that one side where I had reserved 
my little winding passage into it. I told him this was 
my castle and my residence, but that I had a seat in 
the country, as most princes have, whither I could 
retreat on occasion, and I would show him that too 
another time : but at present our business was to con- 
sider how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 277 

to that ; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss what 
measures to take, for that there were still six-and- 
twenty hands on board, who having entered into a 
cursed conspiracy,- by which they had all forfeited 
their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now 
by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that, 
if they were subdued, they would be brought to the 
gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any 
of the English colonies; and that, therefore, there 
would be no attacking them with so small a number 
as we were. 

I mused for some time on what he had said, and found 
it was a very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, 
something was to be resolved on speedily, as well to 
draw the men on board into some snare for their sur- 
prise, as to prevent their landing on us, and destroying 
us. On this, it presently occurred to me, that in a 
little while the ship's crew, wondering what was be- 
come of their comrades, and of the boat, would cer- 
tainly come on shore in their other boat, to look for 
them ; and that then, perhaps, they might come 
armed, and be too strong for us : this he allowed to 
be rational. On this, I told him the first thing we 
had to do was to stave the boat, which lay on the 
beach, so that they might not carry her off: and 
taking every thing out of her, leave her so far use- 
less as not to be fit to swim : accordingly we went on 
board, took the arms which were left on board out of 
her, and whatever else we found there, which was a 
bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit- 
cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar 
in a piece of canvass (the sugar was five or six 
pounds ;) all which was very welcome to me, espe- 
cially the brandy and sugar, of which I had none 
left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore, 
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were 
carried away before, as above,) we knocked a great 



278 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong 
enough to master us, yet they could not carry off 
the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts 
that we could be able to recover the ship ; but my 
view was, that if they went away without the boat, 
I did not much question to make her fit again to 
carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call on our friends 
the Spaniards in my way ; for I had them still in my 
thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and 
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat on the 
beach so high, that the tide would not float her off 
at high-water mark, and besides had broke a hole in 
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were 
set down musing what we should do, we heard the 
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her 
ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board : but 
no boat stirred ; and they fired several times, making 
other signals for the boat. At last, when all their 
signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the 
boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my 
glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the 
shore ; and we found, as they approached, that there 
were no less than ten men in her, and that they had 
fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, 
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain 
sight even of their faces ; because the tide having set 
them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed 
up under shore, to come to the same place where the 
other had landed, and where the boat lay; by this 
means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the 
captain knew the persons and characters of all the 
men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three 
very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into 
this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and 
frightened ; but that as for the boatswain, who, it 
seems, was the chief officer among them, and all the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2791 

rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's 
crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new 
enterprise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that they 
would be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and. 
told him that men in our circumstances were past the 
operation of fear ; that seeing almost every condition 
that could be was better than that which we were 
supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the con- 
sequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be 
a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the 
circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance 
were not worth venturing for? " And where. Sir,'' 
said I, ** is your belief of my being preserved here on 
purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little 
while ago ? For my part," said I, " there seems to 
me but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it." — 
" What is that ?" says he. ** Why," said I, ** it is, 
that as you say there are three or four honest fellows 
among them, which shoiild be spared, had they been 
all of the wicked part of the crew I should have 
thought God's providence had singled them out to 
deliver them into your hands ; for depend on it, every 
man that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or 
live as they behave to us." As I spoke this with a 
raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it 
greatly encouraged him ; so we set vigorously to our 
business. 

We had, on the first appearance of the boat's 
coming from the ship, considered . of separating our 
prisoners ; .and we had, indeed, secured them e£fec- 
tually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less 
assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of 
the three delivered men, to my cave, where they were 
remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or 
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if 
they could have delivered themselves : here they left 
them bound, but gave them provisions ; and promised 
them, if they continued there quietly, to give thei« 



280 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

their liberty in a day or two ; but that if they at-' 
tempted their escape, they should be put to deatlf 
without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their 
confinement with patience, and were very thankful 
that they bad such good usage as to have provisions 
and light left them; for Friday gave them candles 
(such as we made ourselves) for their comfort ; and 
they did not know but that he stood centinel over 
them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them 
were kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was 
not free to trust them ; but the other two were taken 
into my service, on the captain's recommendation, and 
on their solemnly engaging to live and die with us ; 
so with them and the three honest men we were seven 
men well armed ; and I made no doubt we should be 
able to deal well enough with the ten that were 
coming, considering that the captain had said there 
were three or four honest men among them also. As 
soon as they got to the place where their other boat 
lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all 
on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was 
glad to see ; for I was afraid they would rather have 
left the boat at an anchor, some distance from the 
shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so 
we should not be able to seize the boat. Being on 
shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to their 
other boat ; and it was easy to see they were under a 
great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that 
was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. After 
they had mused a while on this, they set up two or 
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to 
try if they could make their companions hear ; but all 
was to no purpose : then they came all close in a ring, 
and fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, 
we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring ; but it 
was all one; those in the cave we were sure could 
not hear^ and those in our keeping, though they heard 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 281 

it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them I 
They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, 
as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on 
board again, to their ship, and let them know that the 
men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved; 
accordingly, they immediately launched their boat 
again, and got all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board the 
ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades over for 
lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was 
in hopes we should have recovered ; but he was quickly 
as much frightened the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but 
we perceived them all coming on shore again ; but 
with this new measure in their conduct, which it seems 
they consulted together on, viz, to leave three men in 
the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into 
the country to look for their fellows. This was a great 
disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what 
to do ; as our seizing those seven men on shore would 
be no advantage to us, if we let the boat escape ; be- 
cause they would then row away to the ship, and then 
the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, 
and so our recovering the ship would be lost. How- 
ever, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the 
issue of things might present. The seven men came 
on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put 
her off to a good distance from the shore, and came 
to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impos- 
sible for us to come at them in the boat. Those that 
came on shore kept close together, marching towards 
the top of the little hill under which my habitation 
lay; and we could see them plainly, though they 
could not perceive us. We could have beeit very 
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we 
might have fired at them, or that they would have gone 
farther off, that we might have come abroad. But 



282 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

when they were come to the brow of the hill, where 
they could see a great way into the valleys and woods, 
which lay towards the north-east part, and where the 
island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they 
were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to venture far 
from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat 
down together under a tree, to consider of it. Had 
they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the 
other part of them had done, they had done the job 
for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of 
danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could 
not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me on 
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they 
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make 
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally on 
them just at the juncture when their pieces were all 
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we. 
should have them without bloodshed. I liked this 
proposal, provided it was done while we were near 
enough to come up to them before they could load 
their pieces again. But this event did not happen ; 
and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what 
course to take. At length I told them there, would 
be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and then, 
if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might 
find a way to get between them and the shore, and so 
might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get 
them on shore. We waited a great while, though 
very impatient for their removing ; and were very un- 
easy, when, after long consultations, we saw them all 
start up, and march down towards the sea : it seems 
they had such dreadful apprehensions on them of the 
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board 
the ship again, give their companions over for lost, 
and so go on with their intended voyage with the 
ship. 

As soon as I perceived them to go towards the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 283 

shore, I imagined it to be, as it really was, that they 
had given over their search, and were for going back 
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my 
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it : 
but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them 
back again, and which answered my end to a tittle. 
I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over 
the little cre^k westward, towards the place where the 
savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and 
as soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about 
half a mile distance, I bade them halloo out, as loud 
as they could, and wait till they found the seamen 
heard them ; that as soon as ever they heard the sea- 
men answer them, they should return it aga,in ; and 
then keeping out of sight, take a round, always an- 
swering when the others hallooed, to draw them as far 
into the island, and among the woods, as possible, 
and then wheel about again to me, by such ways as I 
directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday 
and the mate hallooed : and they presently heard 
them, and answering, run along the shore westward, 
towards the voice they heard, when they were pre- 
sently stopped by the creek, where the water being 
up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to 
come up and set them over ; as, indeed, I expected. 
When they had set themselves over, I observed that 
the boat being gone a good way into the creek, and, as 
it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one 
of the three men out of her, to go along with them, 
and left only two in the boat, having fastened her to 
the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was 
what I wished for ; and immediately leaving Friday 
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the 
rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their sight, 
we' surprised the two men before they were aware ; 
one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in 
the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping 



284 LIlPE AND ADVENTURES 

and waking, and going to start up; the captain, who 
was foremost, ran in on him, and knocked him down ; 
and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he 
was a dead man. There needed very few arguments 
to persuade a single man to yield, when he saw five 
men on him, and his comrade knocked down ; besides, 
this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so 
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and 
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but 
afterwards to join very sincerely with us. In the 
mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well ma- 
naged their business with the rest, that they drew 
them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to 
another, and from one wood to another, till they not 
only heartily tired them, but left them where they 
were very sure they could not reach back to the boat 
before it was dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily 
tired themselves also, by the time they came back 
to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them 
in the dark, and to fall on them, so as to make sure 
work with them. It was several hours after Friday 
came back to me before they came back to their boat ; 
and we could hear the foremost of them, long before 
they came quite up, calling to those behind to come 
along ; and could also hear them answer, and com- 
plain how lame and tired they were, and not able to 
come any faster ; which was very welcome news to 
us. At length they came up to the boat ; but it is 
impossible to express their confusion when they found 
the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, 
and their two men gone. We could hear them call 
to one another in a most lamentable manner, telling 
one another they were got into an enchanted island ; 
that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should 
all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits 
in it, and they should be all carried away and de- 
voured. They hallooed again, and called their two 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

comrades by their names a great many times ; but no 
answer. After some time, we could see them, by the 
little light there was, run about, wringing their hands 
like men in despair ; and that sometimes they would 
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves : then 
come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the 
same thing oyer again. My men would fain have had 
me give them leave to fall on them at once in the 
dark ; but I was Mrilling to take them at some advan-' 
tage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as I 
could ; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the 
killing any of our men, knowing the others were very 
well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not 
separate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I 
drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and 
the captain to creep on their hands and feet, as close 
to the ground as they could, that they might not be 
discovered, and get as near them as they could pos^- 
bly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the 
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the mu- 
tiny, and had now shown himself the most dejected and 
dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, 
with two more of the crew : the captain was so eager 
at having this principal rogue so much in his power, 
that he could hardly have patience to let him come so 
near as to be sure of him, for they only heard hii^ 
tongue before : but when they came nearer, the cap- 
tain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at 
them. The boatswain was killed on the spot; the 
next man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, 
though he did not die till an hour or two after ; and 
the third run for it. At the noise of the fire, I imme- 
diately advanced with my whole army, which was 
now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo ; Friday, 
my lieutenant-general ; the captain and his two men, 
and the three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted 
with arms. We came on them, indeed, in the dark. 



286 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

SO that they could not see our number ; and I made 
the man they had left in the boat, who was now one 
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring 
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to 
terms ; which fell out just as we desired : for indeed it 
was easy to think, as their condition then was, they 
would be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out 
as loud as he could to one of them, ''Tom Smith! 
Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered immediately, 
" Is that Robinson ?" For it seems h6 knew the voice. 
The other answered, ** Aye aye ; for God's sake, Tom 
Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are 
all dead men this moment." — " Who must we yield 
to ? Where are they ?" says Smith again. ** Ilere 
they are," says he ; " here's our captain and fifty 
men with him, have been hunting you these two 
hours : the boatswain is killed. Will Fry is wounded, 
and I am a prisoner ; and if you do not yield, you are 
all lost." — ** Will they give !us quarter then ? " says 
Tom Smith, ** and we will yield." — "I'll go and asic, 
if you promise to yield," says Robinson : so he asked 
the captain ; and the captain himself then calls out, 
** You, Smith, you know my voice ; if you lay down 
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have 
your lives, all but Will Atkins." 

On this Will Atkins cried out, ** For God's sake, 
captain, give me quarter; what have I done ? They 
have all been as bad as I :" which, by the way, was 
not true neither ; for, it seems, this Will Atkins was 
the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his 
hands, and giving him injurious language. However, 
the captain told him he must lay down his arms at dis- 
cretion, and trust to the governor's mercy: by which 
he meant me, for they all called me governor. In a 
word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their 
lives ; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, 
and two more, who bound them all; and ^hen my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 287 

great army of fifty men, which, particularly with 
those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized 
on them, and on their boat ; only that I kept myself 
and one more out of sight for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of 
seizing the ship : and as for the captain, now he had 
leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with 
them on the villany of their practices with him, and at 
length on the further wickedness of their design, and 
how certainly it must bring them to misery and dis- 
tress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They 
all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their 
lives. As for that, he told them they were none of 
his prisoners, but the commander's of the island; 
that they thought they had set him on shore in a bar- 
ren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to 
direct them, that it was inhabited, and that the go- 
vernor was an Englishman ; that he might hang them 
all there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all 
quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, 
to be dealt with there as justice required, except At- 
kins, whom he was commanded by the governor to 
advise to prepare for death, for that he would be 
hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it 
had its desired effect : Atkins fell on his knees, to 
beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his 
life ; and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake^ 
that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the timie of our deliver- 
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy 
thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting 
possession of the ship ; so I retired in the dark from 
them, that they might not see what kind of a go- 
vernor they had, and called the captain to me : when 
I called, as at a good distance, one of the men was 
ordered to speak again, and say to the captiiin, '* Cap- 
tain, the commander calls for you;" an^: pisesotitly the 



288 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

captain replied, '^ Tell his excellehcy I am just a 
coming." This more perfectly amused them, and they 
all believed that the commander was just by with his 
. fifty men. On the captain's coming to me, I told 
him my project for seizing the ship, which be liked 
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution 
the next morning. But, in order to execute it with 
more art, and to be secure of success, I told him we 
must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and 
take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and 
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. 
This was committed to Friday, and the two men who 
came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them 
to the cave, as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dis- 
mal place, especially to men in their condition. The 
others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which 
I have given a full description ; and as it was fenced 
in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough, 
considering they were on their behavior. 

To these in the morning I sent the cieiptain, who 
was to enter into a parley with them ; in a word, to 
try them, and tell me whether he thought they might 
be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. 
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the con- 
dition they were brought to, and that though the go* 
vernor had given them quarter for their lives as to the 
present action, yet that if they were sent to England, 
they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure ; but 
that if they would join in so just an attempt as to re- 
cover the ship, he would have the governor's engage- 
ment for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal 
would be accepted by men in their condition ; they fell 
* down on their knees to the captain, and promised, with 
the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful 
to him to the last drop of blood, and that they should 
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all 
over the world ; that they would own him as a father 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 28^ 

as long as they Uved. " "Weli,"** says the captain, " I 
must go and tell the governor what you say, and see 
what I can do to bring him to consent to it/^ So he 
brought me an account of the temper he found them 
in, and that he yerily believed they would be faithful. 
However, that we might be very secure, I told him 
he should go back again and choose out those five, 
and tell them that they might see he did not want 
men, that he would take out those five to be his as- 
sistants, and that the governor would keep the other 
two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the 
castle (my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those 
five ; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execu- 
tion, the five hostages should be hanged ih chains 
alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced 
them that the governor was in earnest : however, they 
had no way left them but to accept it; and it was 
now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the 
captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expe- 
dition : first. The captain, his mate, and passenger : 
second. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, ta 
whom, having their character from the captain, I had 
given their liberty, and trusted them with arms : third, 
The other two that I had kept till now in my bower 
pinioned, but on the captain's motion had now re- 
leased : fourth. These five released at last ; so that 
they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners 
in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain* if he was willing to venture 
with these hands on board the ship : but as for me and 
my man Friday, I did npt think it was proper for us 
to stir, having seven men left behind ; and it was em- 
ployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and 
supply them with victuals. As to the five in the 
cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday went 
in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessa- 
VOJU !• T 



?00 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ries ; and I made the other two carry proriuons to t 
certain distance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was 
with the captain, who told them I was the pei^on the 
governor had ordered to look after them ; and that it 
was the governor's pleasure they sholild not stir any 
where but by my direction ; that if they did, they 
would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons : 
so that as we never suffered them to see me as a go- 
vernor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke 
of the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, 
upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but 
tc^ furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and 
man them. He made his passenger captain of one, 
with four of the men ; and himself, his mate, and five 
more, went in the other ; and they contrived their busi- 
ness very well, for they came up to the ship about mid- 
night. As soon as they came within call of the ship, 
he made Robionson hail them, and tell them they had 
brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a 
long time before they had found them, and the like, 
holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's 
side ; when the captain and the mate entering first, 
with their arms, immediately knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter with the but end of their muskets, 
being very faithfully seconded by their men ; they se- 
cured all the rest that were on the main and quarter- 
decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them 
down that were below ; when the other boat and their 
men entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle 
of the ship, and the scuttle whicfai went down into the 
cook-room, making three men they found there pri« 
soners. When this was done, and all safe on deck, 
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break 
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, 
who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and with 
two men and a boy had got fire-arms in their bands ; 



'OP ROBINSON CRUSOS. ^1 

and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, 
the new captain' and his men fired boldly among them, 
and wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which 
broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, 
but killed nobody. The mate calling for help, rushed, 
however, into' the round-house, wounded as he was, 
and with his pistol shot the new captain through the 
head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and coming out 
again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a 
word more ; on which the rest yielded, and the ship 
was taken effectually, without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain 
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal 
agreed on with me to give me notice of his success, 
which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, hav- 
ing sat watching on the shore for it till near two 
o'clock in the morning. Having thus heard the sig- 
nal plainly, I laid me down ; and it having been a day 
of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was 
something surprised with the noise of a gun ; and pre- 
sently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name 
of Governor, Governor, and presently I knew the 
captain's voice ; when climbing tip to the top of the 
hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he em- 
braced me in his arms. ** My dear friend and deli- 
verer," says he, " there's your ship, for she is all 
your's, and so are we, and all that belong to her." I 
cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode withiqi 
little more than half-a-mile of the shorie ; for they had 
weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of 
her, and the weather being fair, had brought her to an 
anchor just against the mouth of the little creek ; and 
the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace 
in near the place where I at first landed my rafts, and 
so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to 
sink down with the surprise ; for I saw my deliverance, 
indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and 
a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I 



292 UFB AND ADVXNTURIS 

pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was not aUe 
to answer him one word ; but as he had taken me ia 
his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen 
to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and imme- 
diately pulls a bottle out of his pocket, and gaye me 
a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose 
for me. After I had drank it, I sat down on the 
ground ; and though it brought me to myself, yet it 
was a good while before I could speak a word to hinu 
All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstacy 
as I, only not under any surprise, as I was ; and he 
said a thousand kind and tender things to me, to com- 
pose and bring me to myself : but such was the flood 
of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into con- 
fusion ; at last it broke out into tears ; and in a little 
while after I recovered my speech. I then took my 
turn, and embraced him as my deliyerer, and we re- 
joiced together. I told him I looked on him as a maa 
sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole 
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that 
such things tis these were the testimonies we had of a 
secret hand of Providence governing the world, and 
an evidence that the eye of an infinite power could 
search into the remotest corner of the world, and send 
help to the miserable whenever he pleased. I forgot 
not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven ; and 
what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not 
only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such 
a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but 
from whom every deliverance must always be acknow- 
leged to proceed ? 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me 
he had brought me some little refreshment, such as 
the ship afibrded, and such as the wretches that had 
been so long his masters had not plundered him of. 
On this he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men 
bring the things ashore that were for the governor ; 
andj indeed, it was a present as if I had been ona 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 203 

that waB not to be carried away with them, but as if 
I had been to dwell on the island still. First, he had 
brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial 
waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine, (the bottles 
held two quarts each,) two pounds of excellent good 
tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship^s beef, and six 
pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about an hun* 
dred weight of biscuit : he also brought me a box of 
sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two 
bottles of lime juice, and abundance of other things. 
3ut, besides these, and what was a thousand times 
more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, 
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloyes, one pair 
of shoes» a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very 
good suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn 
but yery little ; in a word, he clothed me from head 
to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as 
any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; 
but never was any thing in the world of that kind so 
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to 
wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his 
good things were brought into my little apartment, we 
began to consult what was to be done with the pri-^ 
soners we had ; for it was worth considering whetner 
we might venture to take them away with us or no, 
especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorri- 
gible ana refractory to the last degree ; and the cap- 
tain said he knew they were such rogues, that there 
was no obliging them ; and if he did carry them away, 
it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered 
over to justice at the first English colony he could 
Come at ; and I found that Uie captain himself was 
very anxious about it. On this I told him, that if he 
desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he 
spoke of to make it their own request that he should 
leave them on the island. '* I should be very glad of 
)bat/' «ays the captain, ** with all my heart.'' — 



204 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

f 

" "Well," says I, " I will send for them up, and talk 
with them for you." So I caused Friday and the two 
hostages, for they were now discharged, Uieir comrades 
having performed their promise; I say, I caused 
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, 
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them 
there till I came. After some time, I came thither I 
dressed in my new habit; and now I was called go- 
vernor again. Being all met, and the captain with 
me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I 
told them I had got a full account of their villanous 
behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away 
with the ship, and were preparing to commit farther 
robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them id 
their own ways, and that they had fallen into the pit 
which they had dug for others. I let them know that 
by my direction the ship had been seized ; that she 
lay now in the road ; and they might see, by and by, 
that their new captain had received the reward of his 
villany, and that they would see him hanging at the 
yard-arm : that as to them, I wanted to know what 
they had to say, why 1 should not execute them as pi- 
rates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they 
could not doubt but I had authority so to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that 
they had nothing to say but this, that when they were 
taken, the captain promised them their lives, and they 
humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I 
knew not what mercy to show them ; for as for my- 
self, I had resolved to quit the island with all my 
men, and had taken passage with the captain to go for 
England ; and as for the captain, he could not carry 
them to England other than as prisoners, in .irons, to 
be tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship ; 
the consequence of which, they must needs know, 
would be the gallows ; so that I could not tell what 
was best for them, unless they had a mind to take 
their fate in the island; if they desired that, as I had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295 

liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to 
give them their lives, if they thought they could shift 
on shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and said 
they would much rather venture to stay there, than be 
carried to England to be hanged : so I left it on that 
issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some diffi- 
culty, of it, as if he durst not leave them there. On 
this I seemed a little angry with the captain,, and told 
him that ^they were my prisoners, not his ; and that 
seeing I had offered them so m^uch favor, I would be 
as good as my word; and that if he did not think lit 
to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I 
found them ; and if he did not like it, he might take 
them again if he could catch them. On this they ap- 
peared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at 
liberty, and bade them retire into the woods to the 
place whence they came, and I would leave them 
some fire-«arms, some ammunition, and some directions 
how they should live very well, if they thought fit. 
On this I prepared to go on board the ship ; but tolcf" 
the captain I would stay that night to prepare my 
things, and desired him to go on board, in the mean 
time, and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat 
on shore next day for me ; ordering him, at all events, 
to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be 
hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see 
him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up 
to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into dis* 
course with them on their circumstances. I told them 
I thought they had made a right choice ; that if the 
captaii) had carried them away, they would certainly 
be hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging 
at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had 
nothing less to expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to 
stay, I then told them I would let them into the story 



296 UFS AND ADVBNTVRS8 

of my living there, and put them into the way of 
making it easy to them : accordingly, I gave them 
the whole history of the place, and of my coming to 
it; showed them my fortifications, the way I nradt 
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ; and, in 
a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I 
told them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards 
that were to be expected, for whom I l^t a letter, and 
made th^m promise to treat them in common with 
themselves. Here it may be noted, that the captaiii 
had ink on board, and was greatly surprised that I 
never hit on a way of making ink of charcoal and 
water, or of something else, as I had done things 
much more difficult. 

1 left them my fire-arms, viz. five muskets, three 
fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had above a 
barrel and a half of powder left ; for after the first 
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I 
gave them a description of the way I managed the 
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to 
make both butter and cheese : in a word, I gave them 
every part of my own story ; and told them I should 
prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of 
gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I 
told them I would have been very glad of: also I 
gave them the bag of peas which the captain had 
brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and 
increase them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and 
went on board the ship. We prepared immediately 
to sail, but did not weigh that night. The next mom-< 
ing early, two of the five men came swimming to the 
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint 
of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship, 
for God's sake, for they should be murdered, and 
begged the captain to take them on board, though he 
hanged them immediately. On this, the captain pre- 
tended to have no power without me ; but aftev soma; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 297 

difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amend* 
ment, they were taken on board, and were some tim^ 
after soundly whipped and pickled : after which they 
proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore^ 
the tide being up, with the things promised to the 
men ; to which the captain, at my intercession, caused 
their chests and clothes to be added, which they took^ 
and were very thankful for. I also encouragea them, 
by telling them that if it lay in my power to send 
any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this isltod, I carried on 
board, for reliques, the great eoat-skin cap I had 
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots ; also I 
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned^ 
which had lain by me so long useless, that it was 
grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for 
silver, till it had been a little rubbed and hanaled ; as 
also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish 
ship. And thus I left the island, Uie 19th of Decem- 
ber, as I found by the ship's account, in the year 
1686, after I had been on it eight-and-twenty years, 
two months, and nineteen days ; being delivered from 
this second captivity the same day of the month that 
I first made my escape in the long-boat, from among 
the Moors of Salee. In this vessel, after a long 
voyage, I arrived in England the 11th of June, in the 
year 1687, having been thirty-years absent. 

When I came to England, I was as perfect a 
stranger to all the world as if I had never been known 
there. My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I 
had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had 
had great misfortunes in the world ; was become a 
widow the second time, and very low in the world. 
I made her very easy as to what she owed me, 
assuring her I would give her no trouble ; but on the 
contrary, in gratitude for her former care and faithful- 
QjBSS to mei I relieved her as my little stock would 



MG LIFE AND ADVENTURE^ 

afford ; which, at that time, would indeed allow mt 
to do but little for her ; but I assured her I would 
never forget her former kindness to me; nor did I 
forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall 
be observed in its proper place. I went down after- 
wards into Yorkshire ; but my father was dead, and 
my mother and all the family extinct, except that I 
found two sisters, and two of the children of one of 
my brothers ; and as I had been long ago given over 
for dead, there had been no provision made for me : so 
that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist 
me ; and that the little money I had would not do 
much for me as to settling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which 
I did not expect ; a^d this was, that the master of 
the ship whom I had so happily delivered, and by the 
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a 
very handsome account to the owners of the manner 
how I saved the lives of the men, and the ship, they 
invited me to meet them, and some other merchants 
concerned, and all together made me a very handsome 
compliment on the subject, and ft present of almost 
200/. sterling. 

But after making several reflections on the circum- 
stances of my life, and how little way this would go 
towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go to 
Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some informa- 
tion of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and 
of what was become of my partner, who, I had reason 
to suppose, had some years past given me over for 
dead. -With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, 
where I arrived in April following; my man Friday 
accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings, 
and proving a most faithful servant on all occasions. 
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, 
and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the 
captain of the ship who first took me up at sea off the 
shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and bad 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 290 

left off going to sea, haying put his son, who was far 
from a young man^ into his ship, and who still used 
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ; 
and, indeed, I hardly knew him : but I soon brought 
him to my remembrance, and as soon brought myseK 
to his remembrance, when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old ac- 
quaintance between us, I inquired, you may be sure> 
after my plantation and my partner. The old man 
told me he had not been in Brazils for about nine 
years; but that he could assure me, that when he 
came away my partner was living; but the trustees, 
whdm I had joined with him to take cognizance of 
my part, were both dead : that, however, he believed 
I would have a very good account of the improve- 
ment of the plantation ; for that on the general belief 
of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had 
given in the account of the produce of my part of the 
plantation to the procurator-fiscal,. who had appro- 
priated it, in case 1 never came to claim it, one-thiid 
to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. 
Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the 
poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the 
Catholic faith ; but that if I appeared, or any one for 
me, to claim the inheritance*, it would be restored; 
only that the improvement or annual production, 
being distributed to charitable uses, could not be re- 
stored: but he assured me that the steward of the 
king's revenue from lands, and the provedore, or 
steward of the monastery, had taken great care all 
along that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, 
gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of 
whi<;h they had duly received my moiety. I asked 
him if he knew to what height of improvement he had 
brought the plantation, and whether he thought it 
might be worth looking after ; or whether, on my 
going thither, I should meet with any obstruction to 
my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told 



300 LIFB AND ADVENTURB9 

me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plan- 
tation was improved ; but this he knew, that my part^ 
ner was grown exceeding rich on the enjoying Ms part 
of it ; and Uiat, to the best of his remembrance, h» 
had heard that the king's third of my part, which was, 
it seems, granted away to some other monastery or re* 
ligious house, amounted to above two hundred moi- 
dores a year : that as .to my being restored to a quiet 
possession of it, there was no question to be made of 
that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and 
my name being also enrolled in the register of the 
country ; also he told me that the survivors of my 
two trustees were very fair honest people, and very 
wealthy ; and he believed I would not only have their 
assistance for putting me in possession, but would find 
a very considerable sum of money in their hands im 
my account, being the produce of the farm while their 
fathers held the trust, and before.it was given up, as 
above ; which, as he remembered, was for about 
twelve years. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at 
this account, and inquired of the old captain how it 
came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of 
my effects, when he knew' that I had made my will, 
and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my unir 
versal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true ; but that as there was no 
proof of my being dead, he could not act as executor, 
until some certain account should come of my death ; 
and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a 
thing so remote : that it was true he had registered 
my will, and put in his claim; .and could he have 
given any account of my being dead or alive, he would 
have acted by procuration, and taken possession of 
the ingenio, (so they called the sugar -house) and have 
given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to 
do it. " But," says the old man, " I have one piece 
of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so ac« 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOX. 301 

c«ptable to you as the rest ; and that is, believing you 
were lost, and all tixe world believing so also, your 
partner and trustees did offer to account with me, in 
your name, for the first six or eight years' profits, 
which I received. There being at that time great 
disbursements for increasing the works, building an in- 
genio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so 
much as afterwards it produced : however,'' sa^s the 
old man, ** I shall give you a true account of what I 
have received in all, and how I have disposed of it." 

After a few days' farther conference with this an<» 
cient friend, he brought me an account of the first six 
years' income of my plantation, signed by my partner 
and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered in 
goods, viz. tobacco, in roll, and sugar in chests, besides 
rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence of a 
sugar-work ; and I found, by this account, that every 
year the income considerably increased ; but, as 
above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first 
was small : however, the old man let me see that he 
was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores 
or gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and nfteeA dou-^ 
ble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship ; he 
having been shipwrecked coming hcmie to' Lisbon, 
about eleven years after my leaving Uie place. The 
good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, 
and how he had been obliged to make use of my 
money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a 
new ship. " However, my old friend," says he, 
** you shall not want a supply in your necessity ; and 
as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied." 
On this, he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me one 
hundred ana sixty Portugal moidores in gold ; and 
giving the writings of his title to the ship, which his 
son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was a 
quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them 
both into my hands for security of the rest. 
. I was too mudi moved with the honesty and kiad^ 



a02 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ness of the poor man to be able to bear this ; and re- 
membering what he had done for me, liow he had 
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used 
me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a 
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weep- 
ing at what he had said to me ; therefore I asked him 
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much 
money at that time, and if it would not straiten him ? 
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him 
a little ; but, however, it was my money, and I might 
want it more than he. 

Every thing the good man said was full of afieo- 
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he 
spoke ; . in short, I took one hundred of the moidores, 
and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for 
them : then I returned him the rest, and told him if 
ever I had possession of the plantation, I would re- 
turn the other to him also, (as, indeed, I afterwards 
did ;) and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his 
son's ship, I would not take it by any means ; but 
that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest 
enough to pay me ; and if I did not, but came to re- 
ceive what he gave me reason to expect, I would 
never have a penny more from him. 

When this was past, the old man asked me if he 
should put me into a method to make my claim to my 
plantation ? I told him I thought to go over to it my- 
self. He said I might do so if I pleased ; but that if 
I did not, there were ways enough to secure my'right, 
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use ; 
and as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just 
ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my 
name in a public register, with his affidavit, affirming, 
on oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same 
person who took up the land for the planting the said 
plantation at first. This being regularly attested by a 
notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to 
send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE4 303 

his acquaintance at the place ; and then proposed my 
staying with him till an account came of the return. 

Never was any thing more honorable than the pro- 
ceedings on this procuration ; for in less than seveti 
months I received a large packet from the survivors of 
my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went 
to sea, in which were the following particular letters 
and papers enclosed. 

First, There was the account-current of the produce 
of my farm or plantation, from the year when their 
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain, 
being for six years ; the balance appeared to be one 
thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in 
my favor. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years more, 
while they kept 'the effects in their hands, before the 
government claimed the administration, as being the 
effects of a person not to be found, which they called 
civil death ; and the balance of this, the value of the ^ 
plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand 
four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being about 
three thousand two hundred and forty moidores* 

Thirdly, There was the prior of Augustine's ac- 
count, who had received the profits for above four- 
teen years ; but not being to account for what was 
disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he 
haa eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not dis- 
tributed, which he acknowleged to my account: as to 
the king's part, that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's congratulating 
me very affectionately on my being aUve, giving roe 
an account how the estate was improved, and what it 
produced a year; with a particular of the number of 
squares or acres that it contained, how planted, how 
many slaves there were on it, and making two-and- 
twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many 
Ave Marias to thank the blessed Virgin that I was 
alive ; inviting me very passionately to come over and

804 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

take possession of my own ; and, in the mean time, 
to give him orders to whom he should deliver my 
effects, if I did not come myself ; concluding with a 
hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family ; 
and sent me, as a present, seven fine leopards' skins, 
which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some 
other ship that he had sent thither, and who, it seems, 
had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also 
five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred 

Sieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moi> 
ores. By the same fleet, my two merchant-trustees 
shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, 
eight hundred rolls of tobaccc, and .the rest of the 
whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of 
Job was better than the beginning. It is impossible 
to express the flutterings of my very heart when I 
found all my wealth about roe ; for as the Brazil ships 
come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my- 
letters brought my goods ; and the effects were safe 
in the river before the letters came to my hand. In a 
word, I turaed pale, and grew sick ; and had not the 
old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the 
sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had 
died on the spot : nay, after that I continued very 
ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent 
for, and something of the real cause of my illness be- 
ing known, he ordered me to be let blood ; after which 
I had relief, and grew well : but I verily believe, if I 
had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to 
the spirits, I should have died. 

'f I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five 
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate, 
as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thou- 
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in 
England ; and, in a word, I was in a condition which 
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose 
myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing X did 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

was to recompense my original benefactor, my good 
old captain, who had been tirst charitable to me in my 
distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to 
me at the end. I showed him all that was sent to 
me; I told him, that next to the providence of Hea- 
ven, which disposed all things, it was owing to him ; 
and that it now, l|Eiy on me to reward him, which I 
would do a hundred-fold : so I first returned to him 
the hundred moidores I had received of him ; then I 
sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a gene- 
ral release or discharge from the four hundred and 
seventy moidores, which he bad acknowledged he 
owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible. 
After which I caused a procuration to be drawn, em- 
powering him to be my receiver of the annual profits 
of my plantation, and appointing my partner to ac-^ 
count with him, and make the returns by the usual 
fleets to him in my name ; and a clause in the end, 
being a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him 
during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores 
a year to his son after him, for his life : and thus I 
requited my old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my 
course next, and what to do with the estate that Pro- 
vidence had thus. put into my hands ; and, indeed, I 
had more care on my head now than I had in my 
silent state of life in the island, where I wanted no- 
thing but what I had, and had nothing but what I 
wanted ; whereas I had now a great charge on me, 
and my business was how to secure it. I had never a 
cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it 
might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and 
tarnished before any body would meddle with it : on 
the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to 
trust with' it. My old patron, the captain, indeed, 
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In 
the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to 
summon me thither; but now I could not. tell how to 
VOL. I. u 



I 



306 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

think of going thither till I had settled my affairs^ and 
left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At 
first, I thought of my old friend the widow, who I 
knew was honest, and would be just to me ; but then 
she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, 
might be in debt ; so that, in a word, I had no wa 
but to go back to England myself, and take my e 
fects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved on 
* this ; and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain 
fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my former 
benefactor, so I began to think of my poor widow, 
whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she, 
while it was in her power, my faithful steward and in- 
structor. So the nrst thing I did, I got a mierchant 
in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not 
only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry 
her in money a hundred pounds for me, and to talk 
with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling 
her she should, if I lived, have a further supply : at 
the same time I sent my two sisters in the coun^ a 
hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, 
yet not in very good circumstances ; one having been 
married and left a widow; and the other haying a 
husband not so kind to her as he should be. But 
among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not 
yet pitch on one to whom I durst commit the gross of 
my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and 
leave things safe behind me; and this greatly per- 
plexed me, 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, 
and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were, 
naturalized to the place ; but I had some little scruple 
in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me 
back. However, it was not religion that kept me 
from going ther^ for the present ; and as I had made 
no scruple of being openly of the religion of the coun- 
try all the while I was among them^ so neither did I 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 807 

yet ; only that, now and then, having of late thought 
more of it than formerly, when I beg^n to think of 
living and dying among them, I began to regret my 
having professed myself a papist, and thought it might 
not be the best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing 
that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that really 
I did not know with whom to leave my effects be- 
hind me ; so I resolved, at last, to go to England with 
it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make 
some acquaintance, or find some relations that would 
be faithful to me ; and, accordingly, I prepared to go 
to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I 
first, the Brazil fleet being just going away, resolved 
to give answers suitable to the just and faithful ac- 
count of things I had from thence ; and, first, to the 
prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks 
for their just dealings, and the offer of the eight hun- 
dred and seventy-two moidores which were undisposed 
of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to 
the monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to 
the poor, as the prior should direct ; desiring the good 
padre's prayers mr me, and the like. I wrote next a 
letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the ac- 
knowledgment that so much justice and honesty called 
for ; as for sending them any present, they were far 
above having any occasion for it. Lastly, I wrote to 
my partner, acknowledging his industry in the im- 
proving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing 
the stock of the works ; giving him'instructions for his 
future government of my pert, according to the pow- 
ers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired 
him to send whatever became due to me, till he should 
hear from me more particularly ; assuring him that it 
was my intention not only to come to him, but to set- 
tle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this 
I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks 



d08 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for his wife and two daughters, for such the captain's 
son informed noie he had ; with two pieces of fine En- 
glish broad-cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five 
pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a 
good value. 

Haying thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and 
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my 
next difficulty was, which way to go to England : I 
had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had 
a strange aversion to go to England by sea at that 
time ; and though I could give no reason for it, yet the 
difficulty increased on me so much, that though I 
had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I 
altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three 
times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and 
this might be one of the reasons; but let no man 
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases 
of such moment : two of the ships which I had singled 
out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out 
than any other, having put my things on board one of 
them, and in the other to have agreed with the cap- 
tain ; I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz. one 
was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast 
away on the Start, nesu: Torbay, and all the people 
drowned, except three ; so that in either of those ves- 
sels I had been made miserable. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old 
pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, pressed 
roe earnestly not to go by sea, but either to go by land 
to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to 
Bochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe 
journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; 
or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land 
through France. In a word, I was so prepossessed 
tiuuiust my going by sea at all, except from Calais, to 
l>o>or, that I resolved to travel all the way by land; 
%%luch, as I was not in haste, and did not value the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 309 

charge/ was by much the pleasanter way ; and to 
make it more so, my old captain brought an English 
gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was 
willing to travel with me ; after which we picked up 
two more English merchants also, and two young 
Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only ; 
so that in all there were six of us, and five servants ; 
the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting 
themselves with one servant between two, to save the 
charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to 
travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday^ 
who was too much a stranger to be capable of supply- 
ing the place of a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our 
company being very well mounted and armed, we 
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour 
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest 
man, as because I had two servants, and, indeed, was 
the original of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea jour- 
nals, so I shall trouble you now with none of my 
land journal ; but some adventures that happened to 
us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not 
omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of uli 
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time 
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth 
observing ; but it being the latter part of the summer, 
we hastened away, and set out irom Madrid about 
the middle of October; but when we came to the 
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns 
on the way, with an account that so much snow was 
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that seve- 
ral travelleirs were obliged to come back to Pampe- 
luna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, 
to pass on. 

• When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it 
so indeed; and to me, that had been always used 



310 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to' a hot climate, and to countries where I could 
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable: 
nor, indeed, was it more painful than surprising, to 
come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where 
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and 
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean moun- 
tains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intoler- 
able, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our 
fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw 
the mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold 
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in 
his life. To mend the matter, when we came to 
Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much 
violence, and so long, that the people said winter 
was come before its time ; and the roads, which were 
difficult before, were now quite impassable ; for, in a 
word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to 
travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in 
the northern countries, there was no going without 
being in danger of being buried alive at every step. 
We stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; 
when seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood 
of its being better, for it was the severest winter all 
over Europe that had been known in the memory of 
man, I proposed that we should all go away to Fon- 
tarabia, and there take shipping for Bourdeaux, which 
was a very little voyage. But while I was consider- 
ing this, there came in four French gentlemen, who 
having been stopped on the French side of the passes, 
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, 
who, traversing the country near the head of Langue- 
doc, had brought them over the mountains by such 
ways, that they* were not much incommoded with the 
snow ; for where they met with snow in any quantity, 
they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and 
their horses. We sent for this guide, who told us he 
would undertake to carry us ^e same way with no 



OF ROBINSON CRI3SOE. 311 

hazard from the snow, provided we were armed suf- 
ficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts ; for, 
he said, on these great snows, it was frequent for 
some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the 
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the 
ground being covered with snow. We told him we 
were well enough prepared for such creatures as they 
were, if he would ensure us from a kind of two-legged 
wolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger 
from, especially on the French side of the mountains. 
He satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind 
in the way that we were to go : so we readily agreed 
to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, 
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, 
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to 
come back again. 

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with 
our guide, on the Idth of November; and, indeed, 
I was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he 
came directly back with us on the same road that 
we came from Madrid, about twenty miles; when 
having passed two ^rivers, and come into the plain 
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, 
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be 
se^i ; but on a sudden, turning to his left, he ap- 
proached the mountains another way : and though it 
is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he 
made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such 
winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of 
the mountains without being much encumbered with 
the snow; and, all on a sudden, he showed us th6 
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gas- 
cony, all green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a 
great distance, and we had some rough way to pass 
still. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found 
it snowed one whole day and a night so fast, that 
we could not travel ; but he bid us be easy ; we 



312 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

should soon be past it all : we found, indeed, that 
we began to descend every day, and to come more 
north than before ; and so depending on our guide, 
we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when our 
guide being something before us, and not just in 
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after 
them a bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a 
thick wood : two of the wolves made at the guide, 
and had he been far before us, he would have been 
devoured before we could have helped him ; one of 
them fastened on his horse, and the other attacked 
the man with that violence, that he had not time, or 

{>resence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hal- 
ooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man 
Friday being next me, I bade him ride up, and see 
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in 
sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the 
other, '' O master ! O master !'' but, like a bold 
fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and with 
bis pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the 
head. • 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my 
man Friday; for he having been used to such crea- 
tures in his country, he had no fear on him, but went 
close up to him and shot him, as above ; whereas any 
other of us would have fired at a farther distance, and 
have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered 
shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man 
than I ; and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, 
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard oa 
both 'sides the most dismal howling of wolves ; and 
the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, 
appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious num- 
ber of them ; and perhaps there was not such a few 
as that we had no cause of apprehensions ; however, 
as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

fastened on the horse left him immediately, and fied, 
without doing him any damage, having happily fast- 
ened on his head, where the bosses of the bridle had 
stuck in his teeth. But the man was most hurt ; f<tt 
the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the 
arm, and the other time a little above his knee ; and 
though he had made some defence, he was just as it 
were tumbling down by the disorder of his horse, 
when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's 
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast 
as the way, which was very difficult, would give us 
leave, to see what 'was the matter. As soon as we 
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we 
«aw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday 
had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not 
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had 
killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in 
such a surprising manner, as that which followed 
between Friday and the bear, which gave us all, 
though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, 
the greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a 
heavy clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the 
wolf does, who is swift a,nd light, so he has two par- 
ticular qualities, which generally are the rule of his 
actions : first, as to men, who are not his proper prey, 
(he does not usually attempt them, except they first 
attack him, unless he be excessive hungry, which it 
is probable might now be the case, the ground being 
covered with snow,) if you do not meddle with him, 
.he .will not meddle with you ; but then you must take 
eare to be very civil to him, and give him the road, 
for he is a very nice gentleman ; he will not go a step 
out of his way for a prince ; nay, if you are really 
afraid, your best way is to look another way» ana 
.keep going on ; for sometimes if you stop, and stand 
stilly and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an 



314 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

affront ; but if you throw or toss any thing at him» 
and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as 
big as your iSnger, he thinks himself abused, and sets 
fdl other business aside to pursue his revenge, and 
will have satisfaction in point of honor ; — this is his 
first quality : the next is, if he be once affronted, he 
will never leave you, night or day, till he has his 
revenge, but follows, at a good round rate, till he 
overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when 
we came up to him, he was helping him off* from his 
horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, 
when, on a sudden, we espied the bear come out of 
the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the big- 
gest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little 
surprised when we saw him ; but when Friday saw 
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's 
countenance : ** O, O, O !" says Friday, three times, 
pointing to him : '' O master ! you give me te leave, 
me shakee te hand with him ; me makee you good 
laugh.'' 

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased ; 
" You fool," says I, ** he will eat you up."^ — ** Eatee 
me up ! eatee me up !" says Friday, twice over again; 
*^ me eatee him up ; me makee you good laugh; you 
all stay her^, me show you good laugh." So down 
he sits, and gets off* his boots in a moment, and puts 
on a pair of pumps, (as we call the flat shoes they 
wear, and which he had in his pocket,) gives my other 
servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, 
swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to 
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, 
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him, 
** Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, ** me speakee 
with you." We followed at a distance ; for now be- 
ing come down on the Gascony side of the mountains, 
we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 315 

try was plain and pretty open, though it had many 
trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who had^ 
as we say, the heels of the hear, came up with him 
quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws it at 
him, and hit him just on the head, hut did him no more 
harm than if he had thrown it against a wall ; but it 
answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of 
fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow 
him, and show us some laugh, as he called it. As 
soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns 
about, and comes after him, taking devilish long 
strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would 
have put a horse to a middling gallop ; away runs 
Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us 
for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once on , the 
bear, and deliver my man ; though I was angry at 
him heartily for bringing the bear back on us, when he 
was going about his own business another way : and 
especially I was angry that he had turned the bear on 
us, and then run away ; and I called out, '^ You dog, 
is this your making us laugh ? Come away, and take 
your horse, that we may shoot the creature.'' He 
heard me, and cried out, *<!No shoot, no shoot ; stand 
still, and you get much laugh :" apd as the nimble 
creature ran two feet for the bear's one, he turned on 
a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a great oak 
tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; 
and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, 
laying his gun down on the ground, at about five or 
six yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon 
came to the tree, and we followed at a distance : the 
first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, 
but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climb-r 
ing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy.. I was 
amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and 
could not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till 
seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to 
bim» 



dl6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got 
out to the small end of a large hranch, and the bear 
got about half way to him. As soon as the bear got 
out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, 
■ — ** Ha!" says he to us, ** now you see me teachee 
the bear dance :" so he falls a jumping and shaking 
the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood 
still, and began to look behind him, to see how he 
should get back ; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. 
But Friday had not done with hiip by a great deal ; 
when seeing him stand still, he calls out to him again, 
as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, 
** What, you come no farther ? pray you come far- 
ther :" so he left jumping and shaking the tree ; and 
the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did 
come a little farther ; then he fell a jumping again, 
and the bear stopped again. We thought now was a 
good time to knock him in the head, and called to 
Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the bear : 
but he cried out earnestly, ** O pray ! O pray ! no 
shoot, me shoot by and then ;" he would have said by 
and by. However, to shorten the story, Friday 
danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that 
we had laughing enough, but still could not imagine 
what the fellow would do : for first we thought he de- 
pended on shaking the bear off; and we found the 
bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not 
go out far enough to be thrown down, but clings fast 
with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could 
not imagine what would be the end of it, and what 
the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of 
doubt quickly : for seeing the bear cling fast to the 
bough, and tnat he would not be persuaded to come 
any farther, ** Well, well," says Friday, " you no 
come farther, me go ; you no come to me, me come to 
you :" and on this he goes out to the smaller end 
of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, 
and gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the

bough, till he came near enough to jump down on his 
feet, and away he runs to his gun, takes it up, and 
stands still.' *' Well," said I to him, ** Friday, what 
will you do now? Why don't you shoot him !" — 
** No shoot," says Friday, " no yet; me shoot now, 
me no kill ; me stay, give you one more laugh ;" and, 
indeed, so he did, as you will see presently ; for when 
the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the 
bough where he stood, but did it mighty cautiously, 
looking behind him every step, and coming backward 
till he got into the body of the tree ; then with the 
same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, 
grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a 
time very leisurely. At this juncture, and just be- 
fore he could set his hiud foot on the ground, Friday 
stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his 
piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the 
rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and 
when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he falls 
a laughing himself very loud. '' So we kill bear in 
my country," says Friday. *f So you kill them ?" 
says I : ** why, you have no guns." — *' No," says he, 
**nogun, but shoot great much long arrow." This* 
was a good diversion to us; but we were still in a 
wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what 
to do we hardly knew : the howling of wolves ran 
much in my head ; and, indeed, except the noise I 
once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have 
said something already, I never heard any thing that 
filled me with so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us 
off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should 
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous crea- 
ture off, which was worth saving ; but we had near 
three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so 
we left him, and went forward on our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not 
^ deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the 



318 LIFE AND ADVBNTURB8 

raTenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come 
down into the forest and plain country, pressed by 
hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of 
mischief in the villages, where they surprised the 
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and 
horses, and some people too. We had one dangerous 
place to pass, which our guide told As, if there were 
more wolves in the country we should find them there ; 
and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods ob 
every side, and a long narrow defile, or lane, which 
we were to pass to get through the wood, and then 
we should come to the village where we were to 
lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we 
entered the first wood, and a little after sunset when 
we came into the plain ; we met with nothing in the 
first wood, except that, in a little plain within the 
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we 
saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one 
after another, as if they had been in dhase of some 
prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice of us, 
and were gone out of sight in a few moments. On 
this our guide, who, by the way, was but a faint- 
hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he 
believed there were more wolves a coming. We kept 
our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; but we saw 
no more wolves till we came through that wood, 
which was near half a league, and entered the plain. 
As soon as we came into the plain, we had occasion 
enough to look about us : the first object we met witb 
was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse which 
the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at 
work, we could not say eating of him, but picking of 
his bones rather ; for they had eaten up all the flesh 
before. We did not think fit to disturb them at their 
feast, neither did they take much notice of us. Friday 
would have let fly at them, but I would not sufi^er 
him by any means ; for I found we were like to have 
more business on our hands than we were aware of. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

We were not gone half over the plain, when we be- 
gan to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left 
in a frightful manner, and presently after we saw 
about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in 
a body, and most of them iii a line, as regularly as an 
army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce 
knew in what manner to receive them, but found, to 
draw ourselves in a close line was the only way ; so we 
formed in a moment : but that we might not have too 
much interval, I ordered that only every other man 
should fire, and that the others who had not fired 
should stand ready to give them a second volley im- 
mediately, if they continued to advance on us; and 
then that those who had fired at first should not pre- 
tend to load their fusees again, but stand ready every 
one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee 
and a pair of pistols each man ;. so we were, by this 
method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time : 
however, at present we had no necessity ; for on firing 
the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being 
terrified as well with the noise as with the fire ; four 
of them being shot in the head, dropped ; several 
others were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we 
could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but 
did not immediately retreat; whereon, remembering 
that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were 
terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the com- 
pany to halloo as loud as we could ; and I found the 
notion not altogether mistaken ; for on our shout they 
began to retire, and turn about. I then ordered a 
second volley to be fired in their rear, which put them 
to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and 
that we might lose no time, we kept going ; but we 
had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put 
ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise 
in the same wood, on our left, only that it was farther 
onward^ the same way we were to go. 



820 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The night was coming on, and the light began to be 
dusky, which made it worse on our side ; but the 
noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was 
the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; 
and, on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops 
of wolves, one on our left, one hehind us, and one in 
our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with 
them : however, as they did not fall on us, we kept 
our way forward, as fast as we could make our 
horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only 
a good hard trot. In this manner we came in view of 
the entrance of a wood, through which we were to 
pass, at the farther side of the plain ; but we were 
greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane or 
pass, we saw a copfused number of wolves standing 
just at the entrance. On a sudden, at another open- 
ing of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and 
looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle 
and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen 
or seventeen wolves after him, at full speed ; indeed 
the horse had the heels of them, but as we supposed 
that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not 
but they would get up with him at last ; no question 
but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding 
up to the entrance where the horse came out, we found 
the carcasses of another horse and of two men, de- 
voured by the ravenous creatures ; and one of the men 
was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, 
for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the 
man, his head and the upper part of his body were eaten 
up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what 
course to take ; but the creatures resolved us soon, for 
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey ; 
and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. 
It happened very much to our advantage, that at t.iii 
entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there 
lay some large timber-trees, which had been cut down 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 321 

the summer before, and I suppose lay there for car- 
riage. I drew my little troop in among those trees^ 
and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree» 
X advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree be- 
fore us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or 
three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre. We 
did so, and it was well we did ; for never was a more 
furious charge thah the creatures made on us in this 
place. They came on with a growling kind of noise, 
and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, 
was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing on 
their prey ; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was prin- 
cipally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind 
us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every other 
inan ; and they took their aim so sure, that they killed 
several of the wolves at the first volley ; but there was 
a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came 
on like devils, those behind pushing on those before. 

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, 
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they 
would have gone off, but it was but- a moment, for 
others came forward again ; so we fired two volleys 
of our pistols ; and I believe in these four firings we 
had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed 
twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath 
to spend our shot too hastily ; so I called my servant, 
•,npt my man ^Friday, for he was better employed, for, 
with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged 
my fusee and his own while we were engaged ; but, as 
I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn 
of powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece 
.of timber, and let it be a large train. He did so ; and 
had but just time to get away when the wolves came 
up to it, and some got on it, when I, snapping an un- 
charged pistol close to the. powder, set it on fire : 
^'«ose that were on the timber were scorched with it, 
and six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in 
^among us, with the force and fright of the fire; .we

dispatched these in an instant, and the rest were so 
frightened with the light, which the ni^t, for it was 
now very near dark, made more terrihle, that they 
drew back a little ; on which I ordered our last pis* 
tols to be fired o£f in one volley, and after that we 
gave a shout : on this the wolves turned tail, and we 
sallied immediately on near twenty lame ones, that 
we found struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting 
them with our swords, which answered our expecta- 
tion ; for the crying and howling they made wts 
better understood by their fellows ; so that they all 
fled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of 
them ; and had it been daylight, we had killed many 
tnore. The field of battle being thus cleared, we 
made forward again, for we had still near a league 
to go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl and 
yell in the woods as we went, several times, and 
sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but the 
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain : in 
about an hour more we came to the town where we 
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, 
and all in arms ; for, it seems, the night before, the 
wolves and some bears had broke into the village, 
and put them in such terror, that they were obli^d 
to keep guard night and day, but especially in the 
night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their 
people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his 
limbs swelled so much with the rankling of his two 
wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were 
obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Thon- 
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful 
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor any 
thing like them : but when we told our story at 
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what 
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the 
HAOuntains, especially when the snow lay on tiie^ 



OF SOBINSON CRUSOE. 923 

gvound ; but they inquired much what kind of a 
guide we had got, who would venture to bring us 
that way in such a severe season ; and told us it was 
surprbing we were not all devoured. When we told 
them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in 
the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us 
it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed ; 
for it was the sight of the horses which made the 
wolves so furious, seeing their prey; and that, at 
other times, they are really afraid of a gun ; but 
being excessive hungry, ana raging on that account, 
the eagerness to come at the horses had made them 
senseless of danger; and that if we had not, by the 
continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the 
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great 
odds but that we had been tcnrn to pieces : whereas, 
had we been cont^t to have sat still on horseback^ 
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken 
the horses so much for their own, when men were 
on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told 
us, that at last, if we had stood all together, and left 
our horses, they would have been so eager to have 
devoured them, that we might have come off safe, 
especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and 
being so many in number. For my part, I was never 
80 sensible of danger . in my life ; for seeing above 
three hundred devib come roaring and open-mouthed 
to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or 
retreat to, I gave myself over for lost ; and, as it 
was, I believe I shall never care to cross those moun- 
tains again ; I think I would much rather go a thou- 
sand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with 
a storm once a week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my 
passage through France, nothing but what other tra^ 
-Tellers have given an account of, with much more 
advantage than I can. I travelled from Thoulouse 
4o Paris, and without any. considerable stay came to 



a24 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of Jan. 
after having a severe cold season to travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and 
had in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe 
about me ; the bills of exchange which I brought with 
aie having been very currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my 

rod ancient widow ; who, in gratitude for the money 
had sent her, thought no pains too much, nor care 
too great, to employ for me ; and I trusted her so 
entirely with every thing, that I was perfectly easy as 
to the security of my effects : and, indeed, I was very 
happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the 
unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman. 

^nd now having resolved to dispose of my plan- 
tation in the Brazils, I wrote to my old friend at Lis* 
bon ; who having offered it to the. two merchants, the 
survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, 
they accepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three 
thousand pieces-of-eight to a correspondent or theirs 
at Lisbon, to pay for it. 

In return, 1 signed the instrument of sale in the 
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my 
old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for 32,800 
pieces-of-eight for the estate ; reserving the payment 
of 100 moidores a year to him (the old man) during 
his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his son for his 
life, which I had promised them ; and which the 
plantation was to make good as a rent-charge. And 
thus I have given the Arst part of a life of fortune 
and adventure, a life of Providence's chequer-work, 
and of a variety which the world will seldom be able 
to show the like of : beginning foolishly, but closing 
much more happily than any part of it ever gave me 
leave so much as to hope for. 

I Any one would think that in this state of compli- 
cated good fortune, I was past running any more 
•hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum- 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

ices had concurred : but I was inured to a wan- 
dering life, had no family, nor many relations ; nor, 
'bowefter rich, had I contracted much acquaintance ; 
and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet 
I could not keep that country out of my head, and 
had a great mind to be on the wing again ; especially 
I could not resist the strong inclination I had to see 
my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards were in 
being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly 
dissuaded me from it, and so far. prevailed with me, 
that, for almost seren years, she prevented my run- 
ning abroad ; during which time I took my two ne- 
phews, the children of one of my brothers, into my 
care : the eldest having something of his own, I bred 
up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some 
addition to his estate, after my decease. The other 
I put out to a captain of a ship : and after five years, 
finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fel- 
low, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea : 
and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old 
as I was, to farther adventures myself. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here ; 
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to 
my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three 
children, two sons and one daughter ; but my wife 
dying, and my nephew coming home with good suc- 
cess fircmi a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go 
abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged 
me to go in his ship as a private trader to the East 
Indies : this was in the year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the 
island, saw .my successors the Spaniards, had the 
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left 
there ; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, 
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa- 
rated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliged to 
use violence with them ; how they were subjected 
to the Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards- used 



326 UFS AND ADVKNTURSS 

them : an history, if it were entered into, as fuU^f 
variety and wonderful accidents as my own part j par- 
ticularly also as to their battles with the CariliMuu,' 
who landed several times on the island, and as to the 
improvement they made on the island itself; and how 
five of them made an attempt on the main land, aod 
brought away eleven men and five women prisoners ; 
by which, at my qpming, I found about twenty young 
children on the island. 

Here I stayed about twenty days ; left them sup- 
plies of all necessary things, and particularly of arms, 
rwder, shot, clotlies, tools, and two workmen, which 
brought from England with me ; viz. a carpenter 
and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with 
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole, 
but gave them such parts respectively, as they agreed 
on ; and having settled all things with them, and 
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them 
there. 

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence 
I sent a bark, which I bought there, with more peo- 
ple, to the island ; and in it, besides other supplies, 
I sent seven women, being such as I found proper 
for service, or for wives to^such as would take them, 
^s to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them 
some women from England, with a good cargo of 
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant- 
ing ; which I afterwards could not perform : the fel- 
lows proved very honest and diligent, after they were 
mastered, and had their properties set apart for them. 
I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three 
of them being big with calf, some sheep, and some 
hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably 
increased. 

But all these things, with an account how three 
hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and 
ruined their plantations, and how they fought with 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 327 

tUlt whole number twice, and were at first defeated 
and one of them killed ; but at last a storm destroy- 
ing tlltr enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed 
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the 
possession of their 'plantation, and still lived on the 
island. 

All these things, with some very surprising inci- 
dents in some new adventures of my own, for ten 
years more, I shall give a farther account of in an- 
other volume.
