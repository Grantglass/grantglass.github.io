IF ever the story of any private man's ad ventures in the
world were worth making public, and were accepta-
ble when published, the Editor of this account thinks
this will be lo.
The wonders of this man's life exceeded all that (he
thinks) is to be found extant; the lsfe of one man being
scarcely capable of a greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with serioushess, and
with a religious application of events to the uses to
which wife men always apply them, viz. to the instruc-
tion of others by their example, and to justify and ho-
nour the wisdom os Providence in all the variety of our
circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes the thing to be a just history of
facts; neither is there any appearance of siction in it;
and whoever thinks, because all suel) things are dispatch-
ed, that the improvement of it, as well to the diversion
as instruction of the reader, will be the same; and
as such, he thinks, without sarther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in the publica-
tion..

LIFE and ADVENTURES
ROBINSON* CRUSOE.
VOLUME THE FIRST,
I WAS born in the year 163z, in the city of York,
of a good samily, though not of that country, my
sather being a foreigner os Bremen, who fettled sirst at
Hull: he got a good estate by merchandize, and leav-
ing off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence
he had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good samily in that country, and from
whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by usual
corruption of words in England, we are now called, nay,
we call ourselves, and write our name Cfufoe; and so
my companions always called me,
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was a lieute.
nant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders,
formerly commanded by the samous Colonel Lockhart,
and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk, against the
Spaniards .. what became of my second brother I never
knew, any more than my sather or mother did know
what was become of me,.
Being the third son of the samily, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be silled very early with ram-
bling thoughts: my sather, who was very ancient, had
given me a competent share of learning, as sar as house-
education and a country free-school generally go, and
designed me for the law; but I would be satissied with
nothing but going to sea: and my inclination to this
led me so strongly against the will, nay the commands,
of my sather, and a gainst all the entreaties and persua-
sions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed
to be fomething satal in that propension of nature,
tending directly to the life os misery which was to be-
fal me. »
My father, a wife and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my
B 3 A&gn
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was consined by the gout, and expostulated
very warmly with me upon this liibject; he asked me
what reasons, more than a mere Wandering inclination,
I had for leaving my sather's house and my native coun-
try, where I might be well introduced, and had a pro-
spect of raising my sortune by application and industry,
with a life of ease and pleasure: he told me, it was men
of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior
fortunes on the other, and who went abroad upon ad-
ventures, to rife by enterprize, and make themselves sa-
mous in undertakings os a nature out of the common

Or too sar below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what might be called the upper station of low lise,
which he had found, by long experience, was the best
state in the world, the most suited to human h*ppinels,
not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour
and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not
embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge
of the happiness of this stale, by this one thing, viz.
that this was the state of life which all other people en-
vied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable
consequences of being born to great things, and wished
they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the great; that the wile man gave
his testimony to this, as the just standard of true felicity,
when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I mould always sind,
that the calamities of life-were shared among the upper
and lower part of mankind; but that the middle station
had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many
vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind;
nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and
uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were, who,
by vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean
or insussicient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers
a "upon
ROBINSON CRUSOE. f
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their
way of living; that the middle station of lire was cal-
culated for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjov-
ments; that Peace and Plenty were the handmaids of a
middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness,
health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all dessrable
pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle sta-
tion of life; that this way men went silently and smooth-
ly through the world, and comfortably out of it; not
embarrassed with the labours of the hands, or of the head;
not sold to a lite of slavery for daily bread, or harrassed
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul ot peace,
and the body of rest; ndt enraged with the passion of
envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but in easy circumstances, sliding gently through
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter; seeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day's experience to know it more
sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
asfectionate manner, not to play the young man, or to
piecipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my
bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour
to enter me sairly into the station of life which he had
been just recommending to me; and that it I was not
very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere
fate or sault that must hinder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty,
in warning me against measures which he knew would be
to my hurt: in a word, that as he would do very kind
things for me, if I would stay and settle at home, as he
directed; so he would not have so, much hand in my
mistwrtunes, as to give me any encouragement to go
aw^y: and to close all, he told me, I had my elder brother
for an example, to whom he had used the time earnest;
persuasions, to keep him from going into the Low Coun-
try wars, but could not prevail, his young desires
prompting
prompting him to run into the army, where he was
killed; and though, he said, he would not cease to pray
for me, vet he would venture to say -to me, that if I did
take this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I would
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his
counsel, when there might be none toaslistin my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not
know it to be so himself; I say I observed the tears run
down his sace very plentisully, especially when he spoke
of my brother who was killed; and that when he spoke
of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he
was so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me
his heart was so sull he could fay no more to me.
I was sincerely afflicted with this discourse, as indeed
who could be otherwise; and I resolved not to think
ef going abroad any more, but to settle at home, ac-
cording to my sather's desire: but, alas! a few days
wore it all eff; and, in short, to prevent anv of my fa-
ther's sarther importunities, in a few weeks after, I re-.
solved to run quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily neither, as the sirst heat of my resolu-
tion prompted; but I took my mother at a time when
I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary; and told
her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world, that I should never settle to any thing with resolu-
tion enough to go through with it; and my sather had
better give me his consent, than force me to go without
it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney;
that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my
time, but I should certainly run away from my master
besore my time was out, and go to lea; and is she would
speak to my sather to let me go one voyage abroad,
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go
no more, and I would promise, by a double diligencSj
to recover the time I hail lost.
This put my mother into a great paflson: she told
pie, she knew it would be to no purpose to ljpeak to my
father
sather upon any such subject; that he knew too well
what was my interest, to give his conient to any thing
so much for my bur*; and that she wondered how I
could think of any such thing, after the discourse I had
had with my sather, and such kind and tender expres-
sions as she knew my sather had used to me: and that,
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for
me; but I might depend I mould never have their con-
sent to it; that, for her part, she would not have so
much hand in my destruction; and I should never have
it to say, that my mother was willing, when my sa-
ther was not.
Though my mother resused to move it to my sather,
yet I heard afterwards, that slie reported all the discourse
to him: and that my sather, after shewing a great con-
cern at it, said to her, with a sigh' That boy might
'be happy, if he would stay at home; but if he goes
'abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever
* was born! I can give no conient to it.'
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obstinately
deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and fre-
quently expostulated with my sather and mother, about
their being so positively determined against what they
knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one
day at Hull,whither I went casually, and without anv pur-
pose of making an elopement at that time; I say being
there, and one of my companions being going by sea to
.London, in his sather's ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common allurement of a seasaring
man, that it should costme nothing for my passage ; Icon-
suited neither sather or mother any-more, nor so much as
sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they
might, without asking God's blessing or my sather's, with-
out any consideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill-hour, (God knows) on the sirst of Sep-
tember, 1651, I went on board a stiip bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,
began sooner, or continued longer, than mine: the ship
was
was no sooner got out of the Humber, but the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightsul man-
ner; and as I had never been at 'sea besore, I was most
inexpressibly lick in body, and terrisied in mind. I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Hea-
ven, for so my wickedly leaving my sather's house, and
abandoning my duty; ail the good counsel of my pa-
rents, my sather's tuars, and my mother's entreaties,
came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to
which it has been since, repreached me with the con-
tempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and
my sather.
All this while the storm encreafed, and the sea ran
very high, though nothing like what I have leen many
times since; no, nor what I saw a few (lays after; but
it was enough to asfect me then, who was but a young
sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I
expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and
that every time the siiip fell down, as I thought it did,
in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise
more. In this agony of mind I made many vows and
resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my life
in this one voyage, if ever I ijot once my foot upon dry
land again, I would go directly home to my sather, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would
takehis advice, and never runmyfelt into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of
his observations about the middle station of life, how
easy, how comfortable he had lived all his days, and never
had been exposed to tempests at sea, or trouble on
ftore; and, in short, I resolved that s would, like a
true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wile and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but
the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer,
and I began to be a little inured to it. However, I was
yery grave for all that day, being also a littie, fea-tsick-
still;
still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the
wind was quite over, and a charming sine evening fol-
lowed; the sun wet. down persectly clear, and role s6
the next morning , aud having little or no wind, and a
smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightsul I ever saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheersul; looking with wonder upon
the sea, that was so rough and terrible the day besore,
and could be so calm, and so pleasant, in so little a time
after: and now, lest my good resolutions should conti-
nue, my companion, who had, indeed, enticed me away,
came to me' Well, Bob,' says he,' clapping me
upon the moulder, ' how do you do aster it? I warrant
'you were frighted, were not you last night, when it
'blew but a cap sull of wind ?'' A cap sull d'ye call
'it!' said I, it was a terrible storm.'' A storm, you
* fool, you!' replies he, ' do you call that a storm?
'Why, it was nothing at all. Give us but a good ship,
* and sea room, and we think nothing of such a squall
'of wind as that; but, your but a fresh-water sailor,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. it
'forget all that. D'ye fee what charming weather 'tis
'now?' To make short this sad part of my story, we
went the way of all lailors; the punch was made, and I
was made half drunk with it, and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflec-
tions on my past conduct, and all my resolutions for the
suture. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of sursace, and settled calmness, by the
abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea, being forgotten, and the current
of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the
vows and promises I made in my distress. I
fuund, indeed, some intervals of reflection, and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again
fometimes; but I mook them off, and rouzed myself
lrom them, as it were from a distemper; and applying
myl'elt
myself todrinkingand company, soonmasteredtheresuin
of thole sits, (for sb I called them;) and I had, in sive or
six days, got as complete z victory over my conscience,
as any you:lg fellow that resolved not to be troubled with
it could desire: But I was to have another trial for it
still; and Providence, as in such cases generally happens,
resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I
would not take this for. a deliverance, the next was to be
such a one, as the worst and most hardened wretch among
us would consess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yar-
mouth roads; the wind having been contrary, and the
weather calm, we had made but little way since the
storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor,
and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, v\z. at
S. W. for seven or eight days; during which time,
a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same
roads; as the common harbour where the ships might
Wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long but we should
have tided it up the river, had not the wind blew too
fresh; and, after we had lain four or sive days, blew
very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good
as an harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger; but spent the
time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but
the eighth day in the morning, the wind increased, and
we had all hands to work to strike our top-masts, and
make every thing shug and close, that the ship might
ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea ran very high
indeed, and our ship rid forecastle-in, shipped several
seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home: upon which our master ordered out the sheet
anchor; so that we rode with two anchors a-head, and
the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now
I began to fee terror and amazement in the saces even of
the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant
in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went nj
and out ot' his cabin by me, 1 could hear him, softly to
himself, say several times' Lord be merciful to us!
'we shall be all lost, we mall be all undone!' and the
like. During these sirst hurries I was stupid, lying still
in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot de-
scribe my temper. I could ill resume the sirst penitence
which I had so apparently trampled upon, run! hardened
myself against: I thought the bitterness of death had
been passed; and that this would be nothing, too, like;
the sirst. But when the master himself came by me, as
I laid just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and
looked cut: but such a dilmal sight I never law; the
lea went mountains high, and broke upon us every three
or four minutes. When I could look about, I could
fee nothing but distress round us: two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their malts by the beard,
being deep laden; and our men cried cut, that a ship
winch rid about a mile a-head of us was foundered.
Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were
run out ot the roans to tea, at all adventures, and that
not with a mast standing. The light thips sared the
best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or
three of them drove, and came clole by us, running
away with only their sprit-sail out besore the wind.
Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain begged
the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-
malt, which he was very unwilling to do: but t lie boat-
swain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship
would founder, he consented; and when they had cut
away the foremast, the main-mast stood so loose, and
shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her
away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at
all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been
in iuch a fright besore at but a little. But is I can
express at this dittance the thoughts I had about me at
that tune, I was in ten-fold more horror of mind upon
C account
account of my sormer convictions, and the having re-
turned siom them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken
it sirst, than I was at death itlelf; and these, added to
the terror of the storm, put me into sihch a condition,
that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was
not come yet; the storm continued with such sury, that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
seen a worse. We had a good ship, but slie was deep
laden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every
now and then cried out me would sounder. It was my
advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they
meant by founder, till I enquired. However, the
ftorm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen,
the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible
than the rest, at their prayers, and exacting every mo-
ment the ship would go to the bottom. In the mid-
dle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses,
one of the men that had been down on purpose to see,
cried out we had sprung aleak; another laid, there wu
four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called
to the pump. At that very word my heart, as t
thought, died within me; and I sell backwards upon
the side os my bed where I fat, into the cabin. However,
the men rouzed me, ,ind told me, that I that was able
to do nothing besore, was as well able to pump as ai»-
ther; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, themustcr
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip and ran away to the
fea, and would come near us, ordered to sire a gun as a
signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they
meant, was so surprized, that I thought the soip had
broke, or some dreadsul thing happened; in a word,
I was fo surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when every body had his own life to think
os, noboJy minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and, thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had beeddead;
and it was a great whsle besore I came to mviclf.
We
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold,
it was apparent that the ship would founder; and though
the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not polh-
ble she could swim till we might run into any port, so
the master continued siring guns for help; and a light
ship, who had rid it out just a head of us, ventured a
boat cut to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the
beat came near us; but it was impossible sor us to get
on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till
at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the
stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great
length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took
hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and
got ail into their boat. It was to no purpose for them
or us, aster we were in the boat, to think, ot reaching to
their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only
to puil her in towards shore as much as we could; and
cur master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon more, he would make it good to their master:
so partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, siepirg towards the shore,
almost as sar as Wintertonnesse.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
cut of cur lhip, but we saw her sink; and then I
understood, for the sirst time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up, when the seamen told
me she was Iinking; for, from that moment they ra-
ther put me into the boat, than that I might be said
to go in, my heart was as it were dead witlun me;
paitly with fright, partly with honor of mind, and
the thoughts os what was yet besore me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bcui bag at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could fee (when our boat mounting the waves,
we were able to fee the shore) a great many people
running along the strand to assist us when we should
semi' ntai: but we made but How way towards the
C z shere;
shore: nor were we able to reach the shore, till be-
ing past the light-house at Winterton, the shere salls
osf to the westward towards Croiner; and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in, and though not without much disssiculty, got
all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth; where, as unsortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sussicient to carry us either to London, or
back to Hull, as we thought sit.
Had I now had the fense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my sather, an emblem of our Blessed Saviour's pa-
rable, had even killed the satted calf forme; for, hear-
ing the ship I went away in, was cast away in Yarmouth
Road, it was a great while besore he had any assurances
that I was not drowned.
But my ill-sate pushed me on now, with an obstinacy
that nothing could resist; and though I had several times
loud calls from my reason and my more composed judg-
ment, to g6 Lome, yet I had no power to do it; I know
not what to call this; nor will I urge, that it is a se-
cret-over-ruling decree that hurries us on to be the in-
struments of our own destruction, even though it be be-
fore us, and that we push upon it with our eyes open.
Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable
misery attending, and which it was impossible for me
to escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I
had met with in my sirst attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me besore,
and who was the master's so:i, was now less forward than
I. The sirst time he spoke to me after we were at Yar-
mouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were
separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the
sirst time he law me, it appeared his tone was alterc.l;
aiid,
and, looking very melancholv, and shaking bis head,
asked me how I did; and telling his sather who I wns,
and. hew I had come this voyage only for a trial, in Oider
to go sarther abroad; his sather turning to me with a
very grave and concerned tone, "Young man," savs
he, "vou ought never to go to lea any more; you ought
"to take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
"not to be a seasaring man."" Why, Sir," said I;
"will you go to sea no more?"" That is another
"cafe," said he; "it is my calling, and theresore my
"duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you
"fee what a taste Heaven has given you of what you
"are to expect, if you persist; perhaps all this has be .
"sallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of
"Tarshirh. Pray," continues he, what are you? and
*' on what account did you go to sea?" Upon that I
told him seme of my story; at the end of which, he burst:
out with a strange kind of pasiion. "What had I
"done," savs he, " that such an unhappy wretch
"should come into my ship! I would not set my foot
"in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds."
This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits,
which were yet agitated by the fense os his loss, and
was sarther than he could have authority to go: how-
ever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhort-
ing me to go back to mv sather, and not tempt Provi-
ridence to my ruin; told me I might fee a visible hav.d
of Heaven against me: "And young man," said lit?,
"depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you
"go, you will meet with nothing but disasters ..nd
"disappointments, till your sather's words are sul-
"silled upon you."
We parted seen after; for T made him little answer,
and 1 iaw him no more; which way he went, I know
not. As sor me, having some money in my pocket, I tra-
velled to London, bv land; and there, as well as on the
read, had mznv struggles with mysels, what course os
lisp 1 should take, and whether I should go home, or go
to sea.
C 3 As
As to going home, shame opposed the beit motions
that osfered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how 1 should be laughed at among the neigh-
bours, and should be ashamed to see, not mv father and
mother only, but even every body else. From whence I
have since often observed how incongruous and irrational
the common temper of mankind is, especially ot youth, to
that reason that ought to guide them in such cases ; viz.
that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to
repent; not ashamed of the action, for which they ought
juiHy to be esteemed fools: but are ashamed of the
returning, which only can make them esteemed wife men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time,
uncertain what measures to take, and what course of life
to lead. An irresistable reluctance continued to going
home; and as I staid awhile, the remembrance of the
distress I had been in, wore off; and as that abated,
the little motion I had in my desires to return, wore off
with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it,
and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me sirst away from
my sather's house, which hurried me into the wild and
indigested notion of raising my fortune, and that im-
pressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me
deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties, and even
tiie commands of my sather; I say, the same influence,
whatever it was, presented the most unsortunate of all
enterprizes to my view; and I went on board a vessel
bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vul-
garly call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that in all these adven-
tures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though
I might indeed have worked a little harder thai ordi-
nary, yet, at the same time, I had learned the duty and
ossice of a fere-mast-man; and in time might have quali-
sied myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master.
But as it was always my sate to chuse for the worst, so
I did here; for having money in my pocket, and good
cloaths on my back, I would always go on board in the
h-bit
habit os a gentleman; and so I neither had any busi-
ness in the ship, nor learned to do any.
It was my lot sirst of all to sall into pretty good com-
pany m London, which dees not always happen to such
loose and unguided young idlows as I then was; the
devil generally rot omitting to lay some share for them
very early ; bat it was not so with me. I sirst became ac-
quainted with the matter of a ship who had been on the
Coast of Guintia, and who, having had very good suc-
cess there, was resolved to go again: this captain, tak-
ing a sancy to my conversation, whichwas not disagree-
able at that tiire, and hearing me say I had a mind to
see the world, Sold me, it I would go the voyage with
him, I should he at no expence; I should be his mess-
mate, ;rd his companion; and if I could carry any
thing with me, I should have all the advantage of it
that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet
with some encouragement.
I embraced tht: offer; and entering into a strict friend-
ship with this captain, who was an honest plain-dealing
man, went the voyage with him, and carried a small ad-
venture with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of
my friend the ciptain, I increased very considerably;
for I carried about 40/. in such toys and trifles as the
captain directed me to buy. This 40/. I had mustered
together, by the assistance of some of my relations whom
I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my sather,
or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to
my sirst adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was suc-
cesssul in all my adventures, and which I owe to the in-
tegrity and honesty of my friend the captain; under
whom I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics,
and the rules of navigation: learned how to keep an ac-
count of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in
short, to understand somethings that were needsul to be
understood by a sailor: for, as he took delight'to intro-
duce me, I took delight to learn: and, in a word, this
vovage made me bodi a sailor and a merchant; for I
brought
brought home sive hundred pounds nine ounces of goH-
dust sor my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my
return, almost 300/. ar.d this silled me with those aspiring
thoughts which have since so complcated my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had misfortunes too; par-
ticularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into
a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate;
our principal trading being upon the coast, from the lat.
.of 15 deg. N. even to the line itsels.
I was now let up for a Guinea trader; and my frsend,
.to my great misfortune, dying soon aster his arrival, 1
.resolved to go the same voyage again; and I embarked
in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the for-
mer voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.
This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made;
for though I did not carry quite 100/. of my new-gained
wealth, so that I had zoo/, lest, and which I lodged with
my friend's widow, who was very lust to me, yet I fell
into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the sirst
was this: viz. our ship making her course towards the
Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the
African shore, was surprized in the grey of the meaning
by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chace to us with
all the sail she could make. We crouded also as much
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts cany,
to have got clear; but sinding the pirate gained upon,
us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours,
we prepared to sight; our ship having twelve guns, and
the rover eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and, bringing to, by mistake, just ath-
wart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he in-
tended, we brought eight of our guns to. bear on that
side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made
him sheer off again, aster returning our sire, and
pouring in also his small shot from near z00 men which
lie had on board. However, we had not a man touched,
all' our men keeping close. He prepared to attack us
again, and we to desend ourselves; but laying us on
board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered
ninety
ninety men upon our decks, who immediately fell t<?
cutting and hacking the decks and rigging. We plied
them with small-shot, hals-pikes, powder-chests, and
such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How-
ever, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadsul as at sirst I
apprehended; nor was I carried up the country, to the
emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but was
kept by the captain of the rover, as his proper prize, and
made his slave, being young and nimble, and sit for his
business. At this surprising change os my circumstances,
from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was persectly
overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my sather's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable,
and have none to relieve me; which I thought was now
so esFectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I
was undone without redemption. But, alas! this was
but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will
appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes, that he would take me
with him when he went to lea again, believing that it
would be some time or other his sate to be taken by a
Spanish or Portugal man os war; and that then I should
be set at libtrty. Bui this hope os mine was loon taken
.away: for when he went to sea, he lest me on shore to
look aster his little garden, and do the drudgery of,
slaves about his house; and when he came home again
s coin his cruize, he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look
aster theship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to esfect it; but found no way that
had the least probabilitv in it: nothing presented to
make the supposition of st rational; furl had nobody to
commu-
communicate it to, that would emhark with me; no fel-
low-stave, no Englishman, Irishman or Scotchman
there, but mysels; so that lor two years, though I often
pleased mysels with tie imagination, yet I never hal
the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two yea: s, an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the old thoughts of making some at-
tempt for my libertv again in my head; mv patron ly-
ing at home longer than usual, without sitting out his
ihip, which, as I heard, was tor want of money, he
. used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener,
if the weather was sair, to take the ship's pinnace,
.and go out into the road a sishing; and as he always
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat,
.we made him very merry, and I p;:oved very dexterous
in catching sishi insomuch, that sometimes he wjuld
fend me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth
the Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dilh of sish,
for him.
It happened one time, that goinga sishing with him in
a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we
were not half a league irom the shore, we loft sight of it;
and, rowing we knew not whither, or which way, we la-
boured all day, and all the next night; and when the
morning came, we found we had pulled .osf to sea, in-
stead os pulling in sor the sii.ire, and that we were al leair.
two leagues srom the land; however, we got well in
again, though vr.th a great deal of labour, and some
danger, for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the
.morning; but, particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this dilaler, resolved tQ
take more care oi himsels for the suture; ajid having ly
ing by him the long-boat of our English ship which he
.had taken, he resolved he would not go a rishing any
more without a compass and some provision; io he
ordered the carpenter of his ship, who was also an English,
slave, to build a little state-room,or cabin in the middle
of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to
iUnd behind it ,t,o steer, and haul home the main sheet;
and
and rccm besore sor an hand or two to stand and work.
the lads. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-
mutton sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the
cabm, which lay very shug and lew, and had in it room
for him to lie, with a stave or two, and a table to eat
on, with feme in all lockers to put in some bottles of
luch liquor as he thought sit to drink; particularly his
bread, rice, and coffee.
We went frequently out with this boat a sishing; and
as I was most dexterous to catch nsh sor him, he never
went without me. It happened one day, that he had
appointed to go out in tins boat, either for pleasure or
for sish, with two or three Moors of some distinction,
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had
theresore lent en board the beat over night a larger store
of provisions than usual; and had ordered me to get
ready three susils with powder and shot, which were on
beard his ship; for that they designed some sport of
fowling, as well as fuliing.
I gotail thingsrtady, as he had directed; and waited
the next morning with the beat washed clear;, her anci-
ent ami pendants on, and every thing to accommodate his
guests, when by and by my patron came on board alone,
and told me his guests had put off going, upon some bu-
siness that sell out ; and ordered me, with the man and bov,
as usual, to go out with the boat, and catch them some sish,
for that his friends were to sup at his house; he com-
manded me too, that as soon as I had got some sish, I
should bring it home to his hcule; all which I prepared
to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts; for now I found I was likely to have
a little ship at my command; and my master being gone,
I prepared to suinish myself, not for sishing business,
but sor a voyage; though I knew not, neitlier did I ill
much as consider,whither I would steer; for any where
to get cut of that place was my way.
My sirst contrivance was to make a pretence to speak
to this Moor, to get something for cur subsistence on
Doaiu;
board; for I told him we must not presume to eat of our
patron's bread; he {aid, that was true; so he brought
a large baiket of rusk,or biscuit of their kind, and three
jars with fresh water, into the boat: I knew where my
patron's cafe of bottles stood, which it was evident by
the make, were taken out of some English prize, and I
conveyed them into the boat, while the Moor was oil
shore, as if they had been there besore for our master:
I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat,
which weighed about half an hundred weight, with a
parcel of twine or thread, an hatchet, a saw, and an
hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards,
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I
tried upon him, which he innocently came into also; his
name was Iirruiel, whom they call Muley, or Moloy;
so I called to him. "Moloy," said I, "our patron's
"guns are all on board the boat: can you not get a lit-
"tie powder and shot? It may he we may kill some
"aleamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves; for
"I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."
"Yes," says he, "I'll bring some." Accordingly,
he brought a great leather pouch, which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and ano-
ther with shot, that had sive or six pounds, with some
bullets, and put all into the boat: at the same time I
had found some powder of my master's, in the great ca-
bin, with which I silled one of the large bottles in the
cafe, which was almost empty; pouring what was in
it into another; and thus surnished with every thing

which was at the entrance of the port, knew who we
were, and took no notice ot us; and we were not above
a mile out of the port, belore we hauled in our sail, and
sat us down to sish. The wind blew from the N. N. E.
which was contrary to my desire; for h::d it blown
southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain,
and at least reached to the Bay of Cadiz; but my reso-
lutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone
from that horrid place where I was, and leave the ret
to sate. After
Aster we had sished some time, and catched nothing,
(for when I had sish on my hook, I would not pull them
up, that he might not see them) I said to the Moor
"This will not do; our master will not be thus served;
' we must stand sarther osf." He, thinking no harm,
agreed; and being in the head of the boat, set the sails;
and as I had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league
sarther, and then brought her to, as if I would sish;
wheii, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to
whei e the Moor was; and, making as if I stooped for
fomething behind him, I took him by surprize with my
arm under his twist, and tossed him clear over-board into
the sea: he rose immediately, for he swam like a cork,
and called to me, begging to be taken in, and told me
he would go all over the world with me: he swam so
strong after the boat, that he would have readied me
very quickly, there being but little wind: upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-
pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had done
him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would do him
none: "But," said I, " you swim well enough to reach
"the shore, and the sea is calm: make the best of your
"way to the shore, and I will do you no harm: but if
"vou come near the boat, I will moot you through the
"head: for I am resolved to have my liberty." So he
turned himself about, and swam for the shore: and I
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was
an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy ; but there was no
venturing to trust him : when he was gone, I turned to
the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him
* Xury, if you will be saithsul to me, I will make you
'a great man; but if you will not stroke your sace to be
* true to me, that is, swear by Mahomet and his sather's
'beard, I must throw you into the sea too.' The boy-
smiled in my sace, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him ; and swore to be saithsul to me, and go
all ever the world with me.
P While
"While I was in the view ot the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea, with the boat rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me gone
to.wards the Streights Mouth, (as indeed any one that
had been in their wits must have been suppoied to do :)
for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole
nations ot Negroes were sure to surround us with their
canoes, and destroy us ; where we could never once go on
shore, but we mould be devoured by savage beasts, or
more merciless savages of human kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I changed
my course, and steered directly S. and by E. bending
my course a little towards the E. that I might keep in
with the more: and having a sair fresh gale of wind, and
a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe by
the next clay at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I
sirst made the land, I could not be less than 150 miles
south of Sallee, quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for
we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadsul apprehensions I had of salling into
their hands, that I would not stop or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, (the wind continuing sair) till I had
sailed in that manner sive days; and then the wind
shifting to the southward, I concluded also, that if any
ot our vessels were in chafe of me, they also would now
give over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river. I knew not
what or where; neither what latitude, what country,
what nation, or what river ; I neither saw, or dessred to
see, any people; the principal thing I wanted was fresh
water. We came into this creek in the evening, resolv-
ing to swim on shoreas soon as it was dark, and discover
the country; but as soon as it was quite dark., we heard
luch dreadsul noises ot the barking, roaring, and howling
of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me
3 not
not to go on shore till day. 'Well, Xury,' said I,
* then I won't; but it may be we may see men by day,
* who will be as bad to us as those lions.'' Then we
* may give them the moot gun,' says Xury, laughing,
'make them run way;' inch English Xury spoke by
conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad to
fee the boy so chearsul, and I gave him a dram out of
our patron's case or bottles, to chear him up: after all,
Xury's advice was good, and I took it; we dropped
our little anchor, and lay still all night; I fty, lay still,
for we flept none: for in two or three hours we law vast
great creatures, we knew not what to call them, of many
iiirts, come to the sea more, and run into the water,
wallowing and washing themselves,for the pleasure of
cooling themselves; and they made fiich hideous bowl-
ings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadsully frighted, and indeed so was I
too: but we were both worse srighted when we heard
one mighty creature come swimming towards our boat;
we could not fee him, but we might hear him by his
blowing, to be a monstrous, huge, and surious beatt.
Xury laid it was a lion, and it might be for ought I
know: poor Xury cried out to me to weigh the anchor,
and row away. 'No,' says I, ' Xury, we can slip our
* cable with a buoy to it, and go to lea: they cannot
'follow us far.' I had no sooner said so, but I perceived
the creature (whatever it was) within two oars length,
which something surprised me; however, I immediately
stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun sired
at him; upon which he immediately turned abou&s and
/"wam towards the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrid noises,
anc! hideous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well
upon the edge of the shore, as higher withinthe country,
i! pon the noise or report ot a gun, a thing I have some reason
to believe those creatures had never heard besore. This
convinced me, that there was no going on shore for us
in the night upon that coast; and how to venture on
jhorc jn the day was another question too } for, to kave
P * ialk4
sallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as
bad as to have sallen into the paws of lions and tygers;
at least, we were equally apprehensive of the danger of
it.
jBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on more
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
lest in the boat; when or where to get to it was the
point: Xury said, if.I would let him go on shore with
one of the jars, he would sind if there was any water,
and bring some to me. I asked him, why he would go;
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The
boy answered with so much asfection, that he made me
love him ever aster: says he, ' If wild mans come,
* they eat me, you go away,'' Well, Xury,' said I;
* We will both go, and if the wild mans come, we will
* kill them; they shall eat neither of us.' So I gave
Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of
our patron's cafe of bottles, which I mentioned besore,
and we hauled the boat in as near shore as we thought
was proper, and waded on shore, carrying nothing but
our arms and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing
the coming of the canoes with savages down the river:
but the boy seeing a low place, about a mile up the
country, rambled to it, and by and by I saw him come
running towards me: I thought he was pursued by
some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran
forwards, towards him, to help him: but when I
came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a
hare, but different in colour, and longer legs ; however,
we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell
me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards, that we need not take such
pains for water; for a little higher up the creek where
.we were, we found the water fresh when the tide was
out, which slows but a little way up; so we silled our
jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared
to
to go 011 our way, having seen no footsteps of any human
creature in that part of the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew
Very well, that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape
tie Verd islands also, lay not sar off from the coast: but
as I had no instruments to take an observation, to know
what latitude we were in, and did not exactlv know, or
at least remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand osf to sea towards
them, otherwise I might now easily have found lome of
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along
this coast till I came to that part where the English,
traded, I should sind some of their vessels upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the place where I now
was must be that country, which, lying between the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies
waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the ne-
groes having abandoned it, and gone sarther south for
fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth
inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness; and, indeed,
both forsaking it, because of the prodigious number of
tygers, lions, leopards, and other Jurious creatures which
harbour there; so that the Moors use it for their hunt-
ing only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time: and, indeed, for near an hun-
dred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but
a waste uninhabited ccuntry by day, and heard nothing
but bowlings and roarings of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice, in the day time, I thought I saw the
Pico os Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain
Teneriffe, in the Canaries; and had a great mind to
venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds,
the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I re-
lblved to pursue my sirst design, and keep along the
sliore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fre/h-water,
after we had lest thss place; and once in particular, being
P 3 *»%
early in the morning, we came to an anchor under a lit-
tle point os land, which was pretty high; and the tide
beginning to fl< w, we lay still to go sarther in. Xury,
whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were,
calls iestiy to me, and tells me, that we had best go sar-
ther osf the more; ' For,' says he, ' look! yonder lies
'a dreadsul monster on the side os that hillock, sast asleep.*
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadsul monster
indeed! for it was a terrible great lion, that lay on the
side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill,
that hung as it were a little over him. 'Xury,' said I,
"you shall go on shore and kill him.' Xury looked
frighted, and said' Me kill! he eat me at one mouth ;*
one mouthsul, he meant: however, I said no more to the
boy, but bade him be still, and took our biggest gun,
which was almost musquet bore, and loaded it with a
good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it
down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets, and
the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with sive
smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the
50 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
with his leg railed a little above his nose, that the slug
hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He
started up, growling at sirst; but sinding his leg broke,
fell down again, and then got upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar I ever heard. I was a
little surprised that I had not hit him on the head;
however, I took up the second piece immediately, and,
though he began to move off, sired again, and shot him
in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop; and,
making but little noise, he lay struggling tor life.
Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go
en shore. 'Well, go,' said I. So the boy jumped
into the water, and taking the little gun in one hand,
swam to the shore with the other hand; and coming
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him in the head again, which dispatched
him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food j
and
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to
us. However, Xury said, he would have some of him;
fo he comes on. board, and asked me to give him the
hatchet. 'For what, Xury?' laid I. 'Me cut osf
 his head,' said he. However, Xury could not cut off
his head; but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him
and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself, howtver, that perhaps the skin
of him might, one way or other, be of lome value to us,
and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So Xury
and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us (both) the whole day; but at last we
got osf the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of
our cabin, the sun esfectually dried it in two days time,
and it afterwards lerved me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward conti-
nually for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on
our provisions, which began to abate very much; and
going no oftener in to the more than we were obliged to
for fresh water. My design in this was, to make the
river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any where
about the Cipede Verd, where I was in hopes to meet
with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not
what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or
perish there among the negroes. I knew that all the
ships from Europe, which sailed either to the roast of
Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East-Indies, made
this cape, or thi le istands; and, m a word, I put the
whole of my fortune upon this singL point, either that
I must meet with some ship. or mull perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I said, I began to see that the land was in-
habited , and in ;>u<:> or three places, is we saiied by,
we saw people sland upon the shore to Icok at us: we
could also perceive they were quite black, and stark-
naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore
'to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and laid
to
Si LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
the shore, that I might talk to them, and I found they
ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed they
had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a
lbno- slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that
they would throw them a great way with good aim;
so I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs
as well as I could, and particularly made signs for
something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my
boat, and they would fetch me seme meat. Upon this
I lowered the top of my sail; and lay by; and two of
them ran up into the country, and in less than half an
hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh, and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country: but we neither knew what the one or the
other was; however, we were willing to accept it,
But how to come at it was our next dispute; for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as
much afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us all,
for they brought it to the more, and laid it down, and
went and stood a great way osf, till we setched it on
board, and then came cloie to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had no-
thing to make them amends: but an opportunity offer-
ed that very instant to oblige them wondersully; for
"while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty
creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with
great sury, from the mountains towards the sea: -whe-
ther it was the male pursuing the female, or whether
they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any
more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange;
hut I believe it was the latter; because, in the sirst
place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the
night; and, in the second place, we found the people
terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that
had the lance or dart, did not sly from them, but the rest
did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into
the water, they did not seem to osfer to sall upon the
negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swara
about
about as if they had come for their diversion : at last one
of them began to come nearer our boat than at sirst I
expected; but I lay ready for him; for I had loaded my
gun with all possible expedition, and bid Xury load
both the others. As soon as he came sairly within my
reach, I sired and shot him directly in the head:
immediately he "sunk down into the water, but rose in-
stantly, and plunged up and down as if he was struggling
for life: and so indeed he was. He immediately made
to the shore; but between the wound, which was his
mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
besore he reached the more.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and sire of my gun; some of
them were ready even to die for fear, and fell down as
dead with the very terror: but when they saw the crea-
ture dead, and sunk into the water, and that I made signs
to them to come to the shore, they took heart, and came
to the shore, and began to search for the creature. I
found him by his blood staining tha. water, and by the
help of a rope which I slung round him, and gave the
negroes to haul, they dragged him on more, and found
- it was a most curious leopard, spotted and sine to an ad-
mirable degree; and the negroes held up their hands
with admiration, to think what it was I killed him
with.
The other creature, frighted With the flam of sire, and
the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran up di-
rectly to the mountains, from which they came, nor
could I at that distance know what it was. I sound
quickly the negroes were for eating the flew of this crea-
ture; so I was willing to have them take it as a savour
from me, which, when I made signs to them t&at they
might take it, they were very thanksul for. Immediately
they fell to work with him; and though they had no
knife, yet, with a sharpened piece os wood, they took
off his skin as readilv, nay much more readily than we
Would have done with a knife; they offered me some ot
the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give
it
st them: but made signs for the skin, which they gave
me very freely> and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which though I did not understand, yet
I accepted. Then I made signs to them for some wa-
ter, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it's
bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, and that I
wanted to have it silled: they called immediately to
some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I
suppose, in the sun; this they sctdown for me, as besore,
and I lent Xury on more with my jars, and silled
them all three. The women were as stark naked as
the men.
I was now surnished with roots and corn, such as it
was, and water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I
made forward for about eleven days more, without of-
fering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a
great length into the sea, at about the distance of
four or sive leagues besore me: and the sea being
very calm, I kept a large ossing to make this
point: at length, doubling the point at about two
leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on the other
side to lea-ward: then I concluded,as it was most cer-
tain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the Islands called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could not
tell what I had best to do: for if I should be taken
with a fresh gale of wind, Imight neither reach one or other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped,
into the cabin, and let me down, Xury having the helm:
when on a sudden the boy cried out* Master, master, a
'ship was a sail!' and the foolish boy was sighted out
ot his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's
sliips sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten
sar enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the ca-
bin, and immediately saw not only the ship, but what she
was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.
J3ut when 1 observed, the course site steered, I was soor
convsnced,
Convinced they were bound some other way, and did
not design to go any nearer the more; upon which I
stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak
with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not
be able to come in their way, but that they would be
gone by besore I could make any signal to them: but-
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3j
they, it seems, saw me by the help of their perspective
glasses, and that it was some European boat, which they
supposed must belong to some ship that was lost: io they
shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged by
this: and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I
made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and
fired a gun, both which they saw: for they told me
they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun:
upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay
by for me, and in about three hours Icameupwiththem.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanilh, and in French, but I understood none of them;
but at last a, Scots sailor, who was on board, called to
me, and I aniv.-ered him, and told him I was an En-
glishman, that had made my escape out of slavery from
the Moors at Sallee; then they bid me come on board,
and very kindly took me in, and all ray goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, any one would be-
lieve, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
itich a miserable and almost hopeless condition as I was
in: I immediately offered all I had to the Captain of the
ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me, he would lake nothing from me, but that all I
had mould be delivered safe to me, when I came to the
Brazils. * For,' says he, I have saved your life on no
'other terms than as I would be glad to be saved my-
'self; and it may one time or other be my lot to betaken
* up in the same condition : besides,' says he, 'when
'I cany you to the Brazils, so great a way from your
* own country, if I should take from you, what little
* you have, you will be starved there, and then I only
'take
* take away that life I have given. No, no,' fays he,
'Signior Inglisc, (Mr. Englishman,) I would cany
'you thither in charity; and these things will help you
* to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
'again.'
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in:
the persormance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen,
that none should offer to touch any thing J had; then he
took every thing into his own possession, and gave me
back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them
again, even so much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat it was a very good one, and that he
saw; and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I told him
he had been so generous to me in every thing, that I
could not offer to make any price of the boat, but lest it
entirely to him; upon which he told me he would give
me a note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight
for it at Brazil: and when it came there, if any one
offered to give more, he would make it up: he offered
me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was loth to take; not that I was not willing
to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to fell
thepoor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so saithsully in
procuring my own. However, when I let him know
my reasons, he owned it to be just, and offered me this
medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to
set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon
this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let
the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and ar-
rived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or Saint's Bay,
in about twenty two days after. And now I was once
more delivered from the most miserable os all conditions
of life; and what to do next with myself I was to
consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me I can
never enough remember; he would take nothing of me for
my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
. skin,
flcin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in the
boat; and caused every thing I had in the ship to be
punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing to
iell, he bought; such as the cafe of bottles, two os my
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had
made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about 1z0
pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I
went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended to
the house of a good honest man like himself, who had
an Izgexio, as they call it, that is, a plantation, and a
sugar-house, I liv'd with him some time; and acquaint-
ed myselt, by that means, with the manner of their
planting, and making of iugar; and seeing how well
the planters lived, and how they grew rich iuddenly, I
resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I would
turn planter among- them; resolving, in the mean time,
to sind out some way to get my money which I had lest
in London, remitted to me. T this purpose, getting
a letter of naturalization, I purchaled as much land
as my money would reach; and such an one as
might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my-
selt to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born
of English Parents, whose name was Wells, and in
much such circumstances as I was: I call him neigh-
bour, because his plantation lay next to mine; and we
went on very sociably together; my stock was but low,
as well as his, and we rather planted for food, than any
thing else, for about two years. However, we began
to increase, and our land began to come in order; so
that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made
each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the year to come; but we both wanted help;
and now I found more than besore, I had done wrong
in parting with my boy Xury.
But, aias! for me to do wrong, that never did right,
was no great wonde I had no remedy but to go on.
I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my
E genius,
genius, anc! directly contrary to the life I delighted in,
and for which I forsook my sather's house, and broke
through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into the
very middle station, or upper degree os low life, which
my sather advised me to besore, and which, if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, and
ntver satigued my!ili in the world, as I had done; and
I used osten to say to mysels' I could have done this
'as well in England among my sriends, as have gone
* sive thousand miles osf to do it among strangers and
'savages in a wilderness, and at such a distance, as ne-
'ver to hear from any part of the world that had the
'least knowledge of me.'
In this manner I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with but
now and then this 'neighbour; no work to be done but
by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived
just Lkt a man cast away upon some desolate island, that
. had nobody there but himsels. But how just has it been,
and how mould all men reflect, that when they compare
their present condition with others that are worse, Hea-
ven may oblige them to makethe exchange, and be con-
vinced of their former felicity, by their experience! I
say, how just it has been, that the truly solitary life I
reflected on in an island, or mere desolation, should be
my lot, who had so osten unjustly compared it with the
life I then led, in which had I continued, I had,
in all probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich!
I was in some degree fettled in my measures for car-
rving en the plantation, besore my kind sriend, the cap-
tain of the ship, that took me up at sea, went back;
for the ship remained there in providing her loading,
and preparing for her voyage, near three months; when
telling him what little stock I had lest behind me in
London, he gave me this sriendly and sincere advice
'Signior Ingleie,' lays he, for so he always called me,
'if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in
'form to me, with orders to the person who has your
 money in London, to fend your esfects to Lisbon, to
'such
'such persons as I sha!l direct, and in such goods as are
* proper for this country, I will bring you the produce
'of them, (God willing) at my return; but sirce human
* assairs ave all subject to changes and disasters, I would
'have you give orders but sor iool. sterling, which you
'say is hals your stock, and let the hazard be run for
'the sirst; so that if it comes safe, you may order the
'rest the same way; and if it miscarries, you mav have
* the other half to have recourse to for your supply.'
This was such wholesome advice, and looked so friend-
ly, that I could not but be convinced it was the test
course I could take; so I accordingly prepared letters
to the gentlewoman with whom I had lest my money,
and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a sull account of
all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had
met with the Portuguese cr.ptain at sea, the humanity
os his behaviour, and what condition I whs now in, with
all other necessary directions for my supply; and when
this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means,
by some of the English merchants there, to fend over
not the order only, but a full account of my story to a
merchant in London, who presented it effectually to her;
whereupon sile not only delivered the money, but out
of her own pocket sent the Portuguese captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity tome.
The merchant in London vested this iool. in English
goods, such as the captain had written for; sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe
me to the Brazils; among which, without my direc-
tion, (for I was too young 111 my business to think of
them) he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-
work, and utensils necessary for my plantation, and which
were os great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprized with the joy os it; and my
good steward the captain had laid out the el. which
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to pur-
E a chase
chase and bring me over a sen-ant under bond for six
years service; and would not accept os any considera-
tion, except a little tobacco, which I would have him ac-
cept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all English
manusactures, such as clot\ stuff, baize, and things
particularly valuable and desirable in the country, I found
means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that
I may lay, I had more than four times the value of
my sirst cargo, and was now insinitely beyond my poor
neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation;
for the'sirst thing I did, I bought me a negro stave, and
an European servant also; I mean, another besides that
which the captain brought me from Lishon.
But as ?bused prosperity is oftentimes made the very
means or our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I
went on the nexr year with great success in my planta-
tion; I raised sisty great rolls or" tobacco, on my own
ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries
among my neighbours; and these sitly rolls being each
of a'iove one hundred pounds weight, were well cured and
laid by, against the return of the fleet from Li (ban. And
now, increasing in business and wealth, my head began to
be sull of projects andundertakings beyond my reach ; such
as are incited often the ruin ot the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet besallen me,
for which my sather so earnesly recommended a quiet
retired lite, and which he had so sensibly described the
middle station of life to be sull of; but other things at-
tended me, and I was still to be the wilsul agent of all
my own miseries: and particularly to encreaie my sault
and double the leflections upon myself which in my su-
ture sorrows I should have leisure to make; all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate
adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad,
and pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to
the clearest views of doing myself good in a sair and
plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of
life,
life, which Nature and Providence concurred to present
me with, and to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of rising saster than the na-
ture of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down
again into the deepest gulph ot human misery that ever
man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life
and a state of health in the world.
To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story; you may suppose, that having
now lived almost sour years in the Brazils, and begin-
ning to thrive and prosper very well upon my planta-
tion, I had not only learned the language, but had con-

planters, as well as among the merchants at St. Salva-
dore, which was our port; and that, in my discourse
among them, I had frequently given them an account of
my two voyages to the coast ot Guinea, the manner of
trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it was to
purchase upon the coast, for trifles, (such as beads, toys,
knives, kistars, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like) not
only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants teeth, &c.
but Negroes for the service of the Brazils in great
numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related
to the buying negroes, which was a trade at that time
not only not sar entered into, but, as sar as it was, had
been carried on by the Assientos, (or permission of the
King of Spain and Portugal) and engrossed in the public
stock; so that few Negroes were bought, and those ex-
cessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of thole things very earnestly, three of them came to me
the next morning, and told me they had been musing
E 3 very
very much upon what I had discoursed of with them the
last night; and they came to make a secret proposal to
me; and after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that
thev had a -nind to sit out a ship to go to Guinea; tl\at
they had ail plantations as well as I, and were straitened
for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade
that could not publicly fell the Negroes when they came
home, so. they desired to make but one voyage, to bring
the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them among
their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was
whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to ma-
nage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and
they offered me, that I should have my equal share of
the Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a sair proposal, it must be consessed, had it
been made to any one that had not had a settlement and1
plantation of his own to look after, which was in a sair
way of coming to be very considerable, and, with a good
stick upon it: but with me that was thus established,
and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
Jiree or four years more, and to have sent for the other
iool. from England, and who in that time, and with that
little addition, could scarce have tailed of being worth
3 or 400CI. sterling, and that increasing too: for me to
think of such a voyage, was the most preposteious.
thing that ever man in such circumstances could be
guilty of.
But 1, who was bom to be my own destroyer, could
no more resist the offer than I could restrain my sirst
rambling designs, when my sather's good counsel was
lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go
with all my heart, if they would undertake to look
after mv plantation in my absence, and would dispose
of it to fiich as I should direct, if I miscarried. This
they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or co-
venants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing;
of my plantation and effects, in cafe of my death, mak-
ing the captain olthe ship who had saved my life, as be-
fore, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of
my

produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my esfects, and to keep up my plantation. Had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own in-
terest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to
have done, and not to have dene, I had certainly never
gone away from so prosperous an undertaking; leav-
ing all the probable views of a thriving circumstance,
and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its
common hazards; to say nothing of the reasons I had
to expect particular misfortunes to mylelf.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dic-
tates of my sancy, rather than my reason; and accord-
ingly, the ship being sitted out, and the cargo sinished,
and all things done as by agreement by my partners in
the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour again, the
ist of September 1659, being the lame day eight years"
that I w»nt from my sather and mother at Hull, in or-
der to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my
own interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons
burden, carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the
master, his bov, and myself: we had on board no large
cargo of goods, except of such toys as were sit for our
fade with the Negroes; such as bends, bits of glass,
shdls, and odd trines; especially little looking-glasses,
knives, scislars, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, standing
away to the northward upon our own coasts, with de-
sign to stretch over for the African coast, when we came
into about ten or twelve degrees of 1101 them latitude;
which, it seems, was the manner of their course in
those days: we had very good weather, only excessive
hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came tothn
height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping
sarther oft'at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as
if we were bound for the Isle remand de Noronba,
liulding ,
holding our course N. E. byN. and leaving those isles
on the east. In this courie we passed the line in about
twelve days time, and were by our last observation in
7 degrees zz minutes northern latitude, when a violent
tornado or hurricane, took us quite cut os our know-
ledge. It began from the S. E. came about to the N.
W. then fettled in the N. E. from whence it blew in
such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together,
we could do nothing but drive; and scudding away be-
fore it, let it carry us wherever Fate and the sury of
the winds directed; and during these twelve days I
need not say, that I expected every day to be swallowed
up, nor did any in the ship expect otherwise.
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of a storm,
one of our men die of the calenture, and a man and a
boy wamed over board. About the twelfth day, the
weather abating a little, the master made an observa-
tion as well as he could, and found that he was in about
11 degrees of north latitude, but that he was z2 degrees
*^>f longitude difference west from Cape St. Auguslino,
so that he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guia-
na, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Ama-
zones, towards that ot the river Oroonoque, commonly
called the Great River; and now he began to consult
with me what courie he mould take; for the ship was
leaky, and very much disabled; and he was forgoing
directly back to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over the
charts of the sea coast of America with him, we con-
cluded there was no inhabited country for us to have re-
course to, till we came within the circle of the Caribbee
Islands; and theresore resolved to stand away for Bar-
badoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the in-
draught of the bay cr gulph of Mexico, we might easily
persorm, as we hoped, in about sisteen days sail; whereas
we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast
os Africa without, some assistance both to our ship and
to ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, ind steered
2 away
k
away N. W. by W. in older to reach some of our
English islands, where I hoped sor relies: but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for being in ihe la-
titude of u degrees 18 minutes, a second storm came
upon us, which carried us away with the same impetuo-
sity westward, and drove vis so out ot the way of all hu-
man commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to
the sea, we were rather in danger os being devoured by
savages, than ever returning to our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one
of our men, early one morning, cried out' Land !*
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to lookout,
in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, but
the ship struck upon.a sand, and in a moment, her mo-
tion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a
manner, that we expected we should all have perished im-
mediately; and we were even driven into our close
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of
the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the con^rrnation
of men in such circumstances; we knew nothing where
we were, or upon what land it was we were driven,
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not
inhabited: and, as the rage of the wind was still great
though rather less than at sirst, we could not so much as
hope to have the ship hold many minutes without break-
ing in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle,
stiould turn immediately about. In a word, we sat
looking upon one another, and expecting death every
moment, and every man acting accordingly, as prepar-
ing for another world; for there was little or nothing
more for us to.do in this: that which was our present
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that contrary
to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that
the master said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too sast for us to expect her getting off, we
V/ere in a dreadsul condition indeed, and had nothing to
do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could.
We had a boat at our stern, just besore the storm; but
she was sirst staved by dashing against the ship's rudder,
and in the next place she broke away, and was either
sunk, or driven off to sea; so there was no hope srom
her: we had another boat on board, but how to get her
off into the sea was a doubtful tiiing; however, there
was no room to debate; for we fancied the ship would
break in pieces every minute; and some told us slie was
actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they
got her stung over the ship's side, and getting all into
her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God's mercy, and the wide sea; for though
the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea went
dreadsully high upon the shore, and might well be
called den 'wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all
saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat
could not escape, and that we should be inevitably drown-
ed. As to making sail we had none; nor, if we had,
could we have done any thing with it; so we worked at
the oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like
men going to execution; for we all knew, that when the
boat came near shore, she would be broke in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we com-
mitted our souls to God in the most earnest manner, and
the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our
destruction with our hands, pulling, as well as we could,
towards the land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was,
if we might happen into some bay or gulps1, or the mouth
of some river, whereby great chance we might have run
our boat in, or got under the lee of the land; and per-
haps made smooth water. But there was nothing of
this
th;s appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
shore, the land looked more frightsul than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and an half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mauntain like, came rolling a-stern of us, and plainly-
bid us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it took 113
with inch a sury, that it overset the boat at once, and
separating us, as well srom the boat as from one ano-
ther, gave us not time hardly to say, ' O God V for
we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the contusion os thought which
I selt when I sunk into the water: for though I swam
very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves
ib as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me
or rather carried me a vast way on towards the shore, and
having spent itself, went back, and lest me upon the
land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took
in: I had so much presence os mind, as well as breath
lest, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got upon my seet, and endeavoured to make
on towards the land, as sast as I could, besore another
wave should return, and take me up again. But I
foon sound it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the
sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as surious
as an enemy which I had no means or strength to con-
tend with; my business was to hold my breath, and
raise myself upon the water, if I could, and so by iwim-
ing to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards
the shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being,
that the wave, as it would cany me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back
again with it, when it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet in its own body ; and I could
feel myself carried with a mighty force and swistness
towards the shore, a very great way; but I held my
breath, and assisted myself to swim still sorward with all
my might. I was ready to burst with holding my
breath, when, as I found myself rssing up, sa, to my
immediate
immediate rel.es, I found my head and hands shoot oirt
above the l'urlace ot the water; and though it was not
two seconds of time that I coi.ld keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage.
I v/as covered again with water a good while, but not
fo long bu* I held it out; and sinding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I struck, forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again
with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover
breath, and till the waters went from me, and then I
took to my heels, and ran with what strength I had sar-
ther towards the shore. Eut neither would this deliver
me from the sury of the sea, which came pouring aster
me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the waves,
and carried forwards as besore, the shore being very
siat.
The last time of these two had well near been satal
to me; for the sea, having hurried me along as besore,
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece os a
rock, and that with such sorce, as it lest me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the
blew taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it"
were, quite out of my body; and had i: returned again
immediately, I must have been strangled in the water;
but I recovered a little besore the return of the waves;
and seeing I sltoul.l be covered again with the water, I
resolved to hold sast by a piece of the rock, and fo to
4? LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
New as the waves were not so high as at sirst, being
near land, I held my hold till the wave abated; and
then fetched another run,' which brought me so near
the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me,
yet did not swallow me up so as to carry me away; and
the next run I took, I got to the main land, where, to
my great comfort, I clambered up the cliftsof the shore
and iat me down upon the grafs, free from danger, and
quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
lookup and tliank God that my life was saved, in a case
whevtin
wherein there was, some minutes besore, scarce any
.room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express to
the lite, what the ecstacies and transports of the fowl
are, when it is so savtd, a6 I may say, out of the very
grave; and I do not wonder now at that custom, viz.
that when a malesactor, who has the halter about his
neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and
has a reprieve brought him; I say, I do not wonder
that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that
very moment they tell him of it, that the surprize may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and over-
whelm him.
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at sirst.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands;
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions, which I cannot describe, reflecting
upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that
there should not be one soul saved but myself; for as
for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of
them, except ^hree of their hats, one cap, and two shoes
that were not sellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach,
and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it,
it lay so sar off; and considered, ' Lord! how was it
'possible I could get on shore!'
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to see
what kind of place I was in, and what was next to
be done; and I soon sound my comforts abate, and that,
in a word, I had a dreadsul deliverance; for I was wet,
had no clothes to shist me, nor any thing either to eat
or drink, to comfort me; neither did I lee any pro-
spect besore me, but that of perishing with hunger, or
being devoured by wild beasts; and that which was
partici'larly affecting to me was, that I had no wea-
pon either to hunt or kill any creature for my suste-
V nance,
nance, or to desend myself against any other creature*
that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about me but a knise, a tobacco-pipe, and
a little tobacco in a box ; this was all my provision; and
this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, so that for
a while I ran about like a mad man. Night coming upon
me, I began, with an heavy heart, to consider what
would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts in
that country, feeing at night they always come abroad
for their prey.
All the remedy that osfered to my thoughts at that
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a sir,
but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved
to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I
should die; for, as yet, I saw no prospect of life. I
walked about a surlong from the shcre, to see if I could
sind any fresli water to drink, which I did to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my
mouth, to prevent hunger, I went to the tree; and,
getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as
that, if I mould sleep, I might not fall; and, having
cut me a ftiort stick like a truncheon, for my desence,'I
took up my lodgings; and having been excessively sa-
tsgued, I sell sast asleep, and slept as comfortably as I
believe any person could have done in my situation.
When I awoke it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated ; I was greatly surprised so sind the
ship bad been lifted off in the night, from the sand
where me lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was
driven up almost as sar as the rock which I sirst men-
tioned, and where I had been so bruised by being
dashed against it: this being within about a mile srom
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
up still, I wished myself on board, that at least, I might
save some necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree,
I looked ahout me again; and the sirst thing I found
was the boas, which l?.y as the wind and sea had tossed.
her upon the land, aboui two miles to my right hand. I
walked
Walked as sar as I could upon the shore to get at her;
but sound a neck or inlet of water between me and the
boat, which was about half a mile broad; so I came
back for the present, being more intent upon getting
to'the ship, where I hoped to sind something for my pre-
fent subsidence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the
tide ebbed so sar out, that I could come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the rh p: and here I found a fresh re-
newing of my gries; for I saw evidently that if we had
kept on board, we had been all safe; that is to say we
had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so misera-
ble as to be lest entirely destitute of all comfort and
company, as I now was: this forced tears from my
eyes again; but as there was little relies in that, I re-
folved if possible to get to the ship; so I pulled osf my
cloathes and took to the water; but when I came to the
ship, my dissiculty was still greater to know how to get
on board: as she lay a-ground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of: I swam round her twice, and the second time I
espied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not
see at sirst, hang down by the fore-chains, so low, as
with great dissiculty I got hold of it, and by the help of
that rope, got up into the fore-castle of the ship. Here
1 found that she was bulged, and. a great deal of water
in the hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard
sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up on the
bank, and consequently her head low t"d the water: by this
means all her quarter was free, arid all that was in that
dry; for you may be sure my work was to search, and part
to see what was spoiled and what was not: and sirst I

touched by the water; and being very well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread-room, and silled my pockets
with biscuit, and eat as I went about other things, for I
had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had,
indeed, need enough of, to raise my drooping spirits.
F 2 No\t
Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to surnish myself
with many things which I foresaw would be very ne-
cessary.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to
behad; and this extremity rouzed my application. We
had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of
wood, and a spare top-maft or two in the ship; I re-
solved to go to work with these, and threw as many of
them over-board as I could manage for their weight,
tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive
away; when this was done, I went down the ship's side,
and drawing them to me, I tied four of them sast toge-
ther at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a
raft; and, laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it
very well, but that it was not able to bear any great
weight, the pieces being too light. To remove this
inconvenience, with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-
mast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with
a great deal of labour and pains; but the hope ct sur-
nishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to go be-
yond what I should have been able to have done upon
another occasion.
My raft being now strong enough to bear any rea-
fonable weight, my next care was what to load it with,
and how to preserve what was on it from the surs of the
sea; but I was not long considering this: I sirst laid
all the planks or boards upon it that I could get; and
having considered well what I most wanted, I got three
of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the sirst
of these I silled with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, sive pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we
lived much upon, and a little remainder of European
corn, which had been laid by for some fowls we brought
to sea with us, but the fowls were killed; there had
been some barley and wheat together; but to my great
disappointment, I found afterwards, that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several
caies
tales of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters, and in all abcut live or six gallons
os arrack; these I stowed by themselves, there being no
need to put them into the chest, nor indeed any room for
them. While I was doing this, I found the tide began
to flow, though very calm, and I had the mortisication
to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on
fliore upon the sand, go away; as for my breeches,
which were only linen, and open at the knees, I swam
on board in them and my stockings: however, this put
me upon rummaging sor cloaths, of which I found
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present
use, for I had other things which my eye was more
upon; as, sirst, tools to work with on shore, and it was
aster lor.r; searching that I found out the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very usesul prize to me, and
much more valuable than a ship-loading of gold
would have been at that time. I got it down to my
rast, even whole as it was, without losing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was tor some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured with some pow-
der horns, a small bag of shot, and two eld rusty swords:
I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship,
but could not tell where the gunner had stowed them;
but with much search I found them: two were dry and
good, but the third had taken water; the two that were
good I got to my raft with the arms. And now I
thought mylelf prettv well freighted, and began to think
how I should get tc shore with them, having neither sail,
oar, or rudder, and the least cap-lull ot wind would have
overset all my navigation.
- 1 had three encouragements: i. A smooth and calm
sea. z. The tide rising and setting in to the shore.
3. What little wind there was blew me towards the
l3nd. And thus, having feund two or three broken
oars belonsin;" to the bet, besides the tools which were
in the chest, two sews, an axe ,and a hammer, with this
F 3 cargo
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my
raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before; bjr
which I perceived there was some indraught of the wa-
ter, and consequently I hoped to sind some creek of the
river there, which I might make use of as a port to get to
land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared besore me
a little opening of the land. I found a strong current
of the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as
I could to keep in the middle of the stream: but here I
had like to have susfered a second shipwreck, which, if
I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for,
knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run aground at
one end upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other,
all my cargo had nearly slipped off towards that end
which was a-float, and so sallen into the water: I did
my utmost to prevent this, by setting my back against
the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust osf the raft with all my strength; neither durst I
stir from the posture I was in, but supporting the chests
with all my might, stood in that manner near half an
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me
a little more upon a level; and soon aster, the water itill
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with
the oar I had into the channel; and then driving up
higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little
river, with land on both sides, and a strong current of
tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper
place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high uptheriver, hoping in time to let- some ship at
sea, and theresore resolved to place myself as near
the coast as I could.
At length I espied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to which, with great pains and dissiculty, I
guided my raft; and at last got so near, that, reaching
ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in; but
here I had like to have dipped all my cargo in the sea
again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to sav,

slopsng, there was no place to land, but where one em*
os the float, if it ran on shore, would be so high, and the
otiier sink lower, as besore, that it would endanger my
cargo again: all that I could do, was to wait till the
tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar
like an anchor, to hold the side of it sast to the more,
near a slat piece of ground which I expected the water
would slow over; and so it did. As soon as I found
water enough (sor my raft drew about a foot of water)
I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there sas-
tened or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars
into the ground; one on one side, near one end, anil one
en the other side near the other end; and thus I lay till
the water ebbed away, and lest my raft and all my cargo
safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek apro-
per place for my habitation, and where to stow my
goods, to secure them from whatever might happen.
Where I was I yet knew not ; whether on the continent
or on an island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited;
whether in danger oi wild beasts, or not. There was a
Mil not above a mile srom me, which rose up very steep
<=r.d high, 7-iid which seemed to over-top some other hills
that lay as in a ridge from it northward: I took out one
cf tlie fowling-pieces, and one ot the pistols, and a horn
of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery
up to the top of that hill, where, after I had with great
labour and difficulty got up, I immediately saw my sate
to my great affliction; viz. that I was in an island en-
vironed every way with the sea, no hnd to be seen except
some rocks which lay a great way off, and two. islands
Jess tiian this, which lay about three leagues to the
weft.
I sound also that the island I was in was barren, and,
ii3 I had rar.Icn *o relieve, uninhahited, except by wild
beasts, ofwhicb,however, I saw none; but I discovered
abundance of fowls, though I bio no* their kinds;
neither, when I killed them, co:du I tell what was sit
*'<". food, ar,d what noi. On i..y reiuni I shot at a great
bird
bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a large
wood: I believe it was the sirst gun that had been sired
there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
sired, but from all parts of the wood there arose an ex-
traordinary number of fowls of many sorts, making a
consused screaming and crying, every one according to
his usual note; but not one of them of any kind that I
knew; as for that creature I killed, I took it to be a
kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it
had no talons or claws more than common; its flesh was
carrion and sit fer nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and began working to bring my cargo on shore, which
took me up the rest of the day: what to do with myself
at night, I knew not, nor indeed where to rest; for I
was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but
some wild beast might devour me, though I afterwards
found there was really no need for those sears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought on
shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's lodging:
as for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself,
except that I had observed two or three creatures like
hares nan out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great
many things out of the ship which would be useful to
me, and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and
iiich other things as might come to hand; and I
resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if
possible; and as I knew the sirst storm that blew must
necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all
other things apart till I got every thing out of the ship I
could. I then called a council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether or not I should take back the raft;
but this appeared impracticable; io I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down ;' and I did so, only
that I stripped besore I went from my hut, having no-
thing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I £Ot
I got on board the ship as-before: and prepared a se-
cond raft; and having had experience from the sirst, I
neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard;
but vet I brought away several things very usesul to me:
as,- sirst in the carpenter's store I found two or three
bags sull of nails and spikes, a great lcrew jack, a dozen
or two of hatchets, and above all, that most usesul thing
called a grind-stone: all these I secured, together with
several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two
or three iron-crows, and two barrels of musket bullets,
seven muikets, and another fowling-piece, with some
small quantity of powder more; a large bag sull of
small shot, and a great roll of meet lead; but this last
was so .heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the
ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's cloaths that
I could sind, and a spare fore-top sail, hammock, and
some bedding; and with this I loaded my second rait,
and brought them also all iafe on shore, to my very
great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be de-
voured on shore; but when I came back, I found no
fign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a wild cat
upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it,
ran away to a little distance, and then stood still; she sat
very composed and unconcerned, and looked sull in my
sace, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I
presented my gun at her, but she did not understand it,
me was persectly unconcerned at it, nor did she osfer to
stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit,
though by the way I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I say, and
stie went to it, smelled of it, and eat it, and looked (as if
pleased) for more; but as I could spare no more, she
marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, (though I was
obliged to open the barrels of powder, and bring them
by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks)
I went
I went to work to make a little tent with the sail, and
some poles which I cut for that purpose; and , into this
tent I brought every thing that I knew would spoil,
either with rain or liin; I piled all the empty chests and
caiks up in a circle round the tent, to fortisy it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest let
up ail end without; and spreading one of the beds upon
the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and
my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the sirst:
time, and flept very quietly all night: I was very weary
and heavy; for the night besore I had slept little, and
had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch those
things srom the ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the largest magazine of all kinds now that ever
was laid up, I believe for one man ; but I was not sa-
tissied still; for while the stup was in an upwright pos-
ture, I thought I ought to get every thing out cf her I
could; so every day at low water I went on board, and
brought away something or other; but particularly the
third time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine
I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was
to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet
fun-powder; in a word, I brought away all the sails
rst and last, only that I was obliged to cut them ill
pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for
they were no more usesul to me for sails, but as mere
canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that at
last of all, after I had made sive or six such voyages as
these, and thought I had nothing more to expect from
the ship, that was worth meddling with; I say, alter
all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large
rundlets of rum or spirits, a box of sire sugar, and a
barrel of sine flour; this was surprizing to me, becaule
I had given over expecting any mere provisions, except
what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hog-
shead
fcead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcelj
in pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word,
I got all this safe on shore also, though at several
times.
The next day I made another voyage; and now hav-
ing plundered the ship of what was portable, and sit to
hand out, I began with the cables ; and cutting the
great cable into pieces, such as I could move, 1 got
two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron work
1 could get; and having cut down the sprit-sail-yard and
the mizen yard, and every thing I could to make a large
rast, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came
away: but my good luck began to leave me; for this
was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I had en-
tered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
gcods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into
the water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I
was near the more; but as to my cargo, it was great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me; however, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore,
and some of the iron, though with insinite labour, for
I was obliged to dip for it into the water, a work which
satigued me very much; after this, I went every day on
board, and brought away what I could get,
I had been thirteen days on shore, and eleven times on
board the ship; in which time I had brought away all
that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable
to briifg; though I believe verily, had the calm wea-
ther held, I should have Drought away the whole ship,
piece by piece : but preparing for the twelsth time to go
on board, I found the wind began to rise; however, at
low water, I went on board; and though I thought I
had rummaged the cabin so esfectually as that nothing
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three ra-
zors, and one pair of large sciffars, with ten or a dozen
good knives and forks; in another, I found aboujt
thirty-six
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin,
some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some
silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this monev. 'O'
* drug!' said I aloud, what art thou good for? Thou
* art of no worth to me, no, not the taking osf the
'groundt. one of those knives is worth all this heap;
* I have no manner of use for thee ; even remain where
'thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose
* life is not worth saving!' However, uprn second
thoughts, I took it away, and,wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft; but while I was preparing this, I sound the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter
os an hour it blew a fresh gale from the mere; it pre-
sently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a raft, with the wind osf more, and that it was
my business to be gone besore the tide of flood began,
otherwise I might not be able to reach the more at'all:
accordingly, I let myself down into the water; and
swam across the channel, which lav between t«e ship
and the sand, and even that with great dissiculty, partlv
with the weight of the things I had about me, and
partly the rougnese of the water; for the wind role
very hastily, and besore it was quite high water, it blew
a storm.
But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay
with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew hard
all that night; and in the morning, when I looked out, 
behold, no more ship was to be seen. I was a little
surprized; but recovered myself with this satissactory
reflection; viz. that I had lost no time, nor abated any
diligence, to get every thing out of her that could be
usesul to me ; and that indeed there was little lest in her
that I was able to bring away, if I had more time. I
now gave over any more thought of the ship, or of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from
iards
My

her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterward
did; but those things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about se-
curing myself against either savages, if any mould appeai-,
qr wild beasts,.if any were in the island, and I had many
thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind
of dwelling to make; whether I should make me a cave
in the earth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short,
I resolved upon both: the manner and descrption
of which it may not be improper to give an ac-
count.
I soon found the place I was in would not do for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moenOi ground near the sea, and I believed would not
be wholesome, and more particularly, because there
was no water near it; so I resolved to sind a more
healthy and more convenient spot of ground.
. I consulted several things in my situation, which I
found would be proper for me; sirst, health and fresh
water; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun;
thirdlv, security from ravenous creatures, whether man
or beast; fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent
?ny ship insight, I might not lose any advantage of my
deliverance, for which I was not willing to bannish my
expectation.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose form towards
this little plain was as steep as an house side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top: on
the side ot this reck there was an hollow place, worn a
littie way in, like the entrance or door of a cave, hut
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just besore this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above
an hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and
lay like a green besore the door, and at the end of it
descended irregularly every way down into the low-
grounds by the lea-side. It was on the N. N,. W. side
of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the heat every
day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
vvhkh in those countrses is near the setting.
G Previous
Previous to setting up my tent, I drew an half cir-
cle besore the hcllow place, which took in about ten
yards in it's iemi-diameter from the rock, and twenty
yards in its diameter from it's beginning and ending.
In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very sirm
like piles ; the biggest end being out of the ground
above rive feet and an half, and sharpened on the top:
the two rows did not stand above six inches from one
another.
I then took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the
ship, and laid them in rows upon one another, within
the circle, between those two rows of stakes, up to the
top; placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against
them, about two feet and a half high, like a ipur to a.
post; and this fence was so strong, that neither man
nor beast could get into it, or over it. This cost me a
great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles
in the wood, bring them to their places, and drive them
into the earth.
I made the entrance into this place not by a dcor,
but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder,
when I was in, I lifted over after me; and so I was
completely fenced in, and fortisied, as I thought, from
all the world, and consequently slept secure in the night,
which otherwise I could not have done: though, as it
appeared asterwards, there was no need of ail this caution
against enemies from whom I had apprehended danger.
Into this sence, or fortress, with insinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores; and I made me a large tent also, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there. I made it double, viz. one smaller
tent within, and one larger tent above it; and covered
the uppermost part with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a time in the bed which
I had brought on shore, but in an hammock, which was
indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of
the ship. * Into
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everv
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus in-
closed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till
now I had left open, and so pasted and repassed, as I
laid, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way into
the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug
down, and through my tent, I laid them up within my
fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it railed the
ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made
a cave just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar
.to my house.
. It cost me much labour, and many days, before all
these things were brought to persection. At the same
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for setting
up the tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain
salling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash os light-
ning happened, which was succeeded by a violent clap
of thunder. I was not so much iurprized with the
lightning, as I was with the thought which darted into
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63
der!' My very heart funk within me, when I thought,
that at one blast all my powder might be destroyed; on
which, not my desence only, but the providingmy food,
as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so
anxious about my own danger; though, had the powder
took sire, I should have never known who had hurt
me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my work, my building
and fortifying, and applied myiclf to make bags and
boxes to separate my powder, and to keep it a little and
little in parcels, in hopes, that whatever might come, it
might not all take sire at once, and to keep so apart,
that it should not be possible to make one part sire ano-
ther. I sinished this work in about a fortnight: and I
think my powder, which in all was about 140 pounds
weight, was divided into no less than an hundred parcels.
-As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend
G 1 any
any danger from that, so I placed a part of it in my new
cave, which I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid ujJ
and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very caresully where I
laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out at least once every day with my gun, as well to divert-
myself, as to fee it I could kill any thing sit for food,
and as near as I could to acquaint myself with what the
Island produced. The sirst time I went out, I soon dis-
covered that there were goats in the Island, which w3s a
great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this misfortune, viz. that they were so shy, so subile,
and so swift of soot, that it was the most difsicult thing
in the world to come at them; but I was not discou-
raged at this, not doubting but I might now and then
sooot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found
their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them.
I observed, if they law me in the vallies, thiaigh they
vere upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terri-
lvle sright; but if they were seedingin the vallies, and I
was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that by the position ot their optics,
their sight was so directed downward, that they did not
readily fee objects that were above them. In consequence
or tins observation, I took the sollowing method: I al-
ways climbed the rocks sirst, to get above them, and
then bad frequently a sair mark. The sirst shot I nvde
among the:e creatures I killed a she-goat which hid a lit-
tle kid by her, to whom she gave luck, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid stood
stock-still by her till I came and took h. r up; nrA r.ot
cnly so, but when I carried the old one with me upon
my moulders, the kid sallowed me quite to mv inclosure;
upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in
my arms, and carried it over mv pale in hopes to have
bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was sorced
to kill it, and eat it myself; these two hipplied me with
flesii a great while, tor I eat sparingly, and saved
my
my provisions (my bread especially) as much as I pos-
sibly could.
Having now sixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a sire in, and suel
to burn; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged
my cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a
sull account of in it's place: but I must sirst give some
little account of myselt, and os my thoughts about liv-
ing, which it may well be supposed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I
was not cast away upon that Island without being driven,
as is said by a violent storm quite out of the courie of
our intended voyage, and a great way, viz. some hun-
dreds of leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade
of mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a deter-
mination of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in
this desolate manner, I should end my lise; the tears
would run plentisully down my sace when I made these
reflections: and sometimes I expostulated with myself,
why Providence should thus compleatly ruin it's crea-
tures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so aban-
doned without help, and so entirely depressed, that it
could hardly be rational to be thanksul for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particu-
larly one day walking with my gun in mv hand by the .
fea side, I wa's very pensive upon the subject of my pre-
sent condition, when reason, ns it were, put in, expostulat-
ing with me the other way, thus; ' Well, you are in a
 desolate condition, 'tis true; but, pray, remember,
'where are the rest of you! Did not you come eleven of
'you into the boat? Where are the ten? Why are
'not they saved, and you lost? Why are you singled
'out? It is better to be here or there?' And then I
pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with
the gcod that is in them, aud with what worse attended
them.
It then occurred to me agnin,' how well I was sur-
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been my
G 3 case,
rase, if it had not happened, -which ivaj an hundred
thousand to one, tliat the ship floated irom the place
where sirst sae struck, and wa> driven lo near to the shore
that I had time togu ail these things out other. What
would have been my cafe, is I had been to have lived in
the condition in winch I at sirst came on shore, without
necessaries of lise, or any means to lupply and procure
them?  Particularly,' said I aloud, (though to my-
sels) 'what could I have done without a gun; without
'ammunition; without any tools to make any thing,
* or to work with? without cloaths, bedding, a tent,
* or any manner os coverings,?' And that now I had
asl these to a sussicient quantity, and was in a sair wav
to provide myself in juch a manner, as to live without
my gun when my ammunition was spent, so that I had
a tolerable view os subsisting without any want as long
as I lived: for I considered from the beginning how
I sli.:uld provide sir the accidents that might happen,
and for the time that was to come, even not only aster
my ammunition should be ipent, but even alter my health
or strength should decay.
I consess I had not then entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean, my
powder being blown up by lightning; and this made
the thoughts of it surprizing to me, when it thundered
and lightened.
And now, being to enter into a melanc'.'-oly relation
of a scene of silent Hie, such perhaps as was never
heard of in the world besore, I shall take it srom its be-
ginning, and continue it in it's order. It was, by my
account, the 30th ot September, when, in the manner
a.* before observed, I sirst set foot upon this horrid
Island, when the sun, being to us in it's autumnal equi-
nox, was almost just over my head; for I reckoned my-
self, by observation, to be in the latitude ol oo-grees 1%
minutes south of the line.
After I had been there about sen or twelve days, it
came in;o my thoughts chat I should lose my reckoning
of tune for want os books, and pen and snk, ana should
even
even forget the Sabbath-days from the working-davs;
but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large
post, in capital letters; and making it into a great cross,
I set it up on the shore where I sirst landed, viz. ' I came
'onshore here the 30th of September, 1659.' Upon
the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh day a notch as long again
as the rest, and every sirst of the month as long again as
that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly,
monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place, we are to observe, that among the
many things which I brought from the ship in several
voyages, which (as besore-mentioned) I made to it, I
got several things of less value,but not at all less usesul
to me, which I omitted setting down besore; as in par-
ticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the cap-
tain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three
or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspectives, charts, and books of navigation, all which
I huddled together, whether I might want them or no;
also I found three very good bibles, which came to me
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things: some Portugueze books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and se-
veral other books, all which I caretully secured. And I
must not forget that we had in the ship a dog ?.r.A two
cats, of whose eminent history I must have occasion to
say something in it's place; for I carried both the cats
with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship,
and swam to me the day aster I went on shore with my
sirst cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years;
I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any com-
pany that he could make up to me; I only wanted to
have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I
observ d besore, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I hus-
banded them to the utmost; and while my ink lasted,
I kept things very exact, but after that was gone, I
could not; tor I could not make ink, by any means I
could devsse.
And
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all I had amassed together; and
or these, this of ink was one; as a Ho a spade, pick-axe,
and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,
and thread. As for linen, I loon learned to want that
without much dissiculty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on hea-
vily, and as it was near a whole year besore I had en-
tirely sinished my little pale, or surrounded habitation;
the piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well
lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the
woods, and more by sar in bringing home; so that I
spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the
ground; for which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood
at sirst, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows, which however, though I found, it yet made driv-
ing those posts or piles very laborious and tedious
work.
But what need I have been concerned at the tedious-
ness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough
to do it in1. Nor had I any other employment, if that
had been over, at least that I could foresee, except rang-
ing the Island, to seek for food, which I did more or less
everyday.
I now began seriously to consider my condition, and
the circumstances I was reduced to, and I drew up the
slate of my affairs in writing: not so much to leave them
to any that were to come aster me, (for I %vas like to have
but few heirs) as to del ver my thoughts from daily pour-
ing upon them, and afflicting my mind; aud as my rea-
son began now to master my despondency, I comforted
myself as well as I could, and so set the good against the
evil, that 1 might have something to distinguish my case
from a worse; and I Hated it very impartially, like
debtor and creditor, (the comfort I enjoyed, against the
miseries I suffered) thus
EVIL.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce any condition in the world so mi-
serable, but there was something; negative, or something
positive, to be thanksul in it; and let this stand as a di-
rection from the experience of the most miserable of ail
conditions in this world, that we may always sind in it
fomething to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the
description of good and evil, on the credit side of the ac-
count.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and given over locking out to sen, in hopes
of observing a ship; I say, giving over these things I
began to apply myself to accommodate mv way of liv-
ing, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong
pale ot posts and cables', but I might now rather call it
a wall; for I railed a kind of wa'l up against it of turfs,
about two feet thick on the outside; and after some
time, (I think it was a year and an half) I niled rafters
from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered
it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get
to
to keep out the; rain, which I found at some times ofthe
year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods
into this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind
ine; but I must observe too, that, at sirst, this was a con-
sused heap ot goods, which, as they lay in no order, so
they took up all my place; I had no room to turn my-
sels, and theresore set about enlarging my cave, by work-
ing sarther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock,
which yieldedeasdy to the labour I bestowed on it.
When I found myself pretty safe as to beasts of prey,
I worked side-ways to the right-hand into the rock; and
then turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made my door to come out to the out-side of my pale or
fortisication.
This gave me not only to egress and regress, as it
was a back-way to my tent, and to my store-house, but
also ruom to stow my goods.
And now I begun to apply myself to make such neces-
sary things as I found I most wanted, particularly a
chair and a table; for, without these, I was not able to
enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not
write or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure,
without a table.
Accordingly I went to work; and here I must observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathe-
matics, so, by stating and squaring every thing by rea-
fon, and by making the most rational judgment of things,
every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic
art. I had never handled a tool in my life, and yet in
time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I found
at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it,
especially if I had had tools; however, I made abun-
dance of things even without tools, and some with no
more tools than an adze and an hatchet, which perhaps
were never made that way besore, and that with insi-
nite l.ibour. For example; if I wanted a board, I had
no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge
besore
oesore me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe,
till I.had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then
dub- it smooth with my adze; it is true, by this method
I could make but one board out ot a whole tree; but this
I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had
for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took
me up to make a plank or board; but my time or labour
was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way
as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served besore, in the sirst place, and this I did out of the
short pieces of boards I brought on my raft from the
sliip; but when I had wrought out some boards, I made
large shelves of the breadth of a foot nr.d au half, one
over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay my
tools, nails, and iron-work on; and, in a word, to sepa-
rate every thing at large in their places, that I might ea-
sily come at them: also I drove pieces into the rock, to'
hang my guns, and all things that would hang up.
'By these means my envt looked like a general maga-
zine of all necessary articles; and I had everything lo
ready at hand, that it v.-is a great pleasure to me to see

stock of all necessaries :o great.
And now it was when I began to keep a iournal of
every day's employment; for, indeed, at sirst I was in
too much hurry, and not only an hurry at to l ibour, but
in too much discomposure os mind, ind my j urnal would
have been sull of many dull things. For example; I
must have said thus: 'September the 30th, alter I got
* to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being
'thanktul to God for my deliverance, having at sirst vo-
'mited a great quantity of salt-water, which was
* gotten into my stomach, and recoveri-.r; mysels a little,
'I ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beat-
'ing my head and sace, exclaiming at my misery, and
* crying out, I was undone, undone! till, tired and
'saint, I was forced to he down en the ground to re-
'pose, but durst not lltcp for sear of being devoured.
'Some
'Some days after this, and after I had been onboard
* the ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet I
* could not forbear getting up to the top of a little moun-
* tain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship;
'then sancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, pleated my-
* self with the hopes of it, and then after looking stea-
'dily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down
'and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by
'my folly.'
But having got over these things in some measure,
and having settled my houshold surniture and habita-
tion, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about me as I could, I began, I say, to keep my journal,
of which I shall here give you the copy (though in it
will be told all these particulars over again) as long as
it lasted: for at length having no more ink, I was
forced to leave it off.
JOURNAL.'
CEPTEMBER 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Ro-
binson Crusoe, being shipwiecked during a dread-
ful storm in the osfing, came on shore in this dismal,
unsortunate island, which I call, The island of Despair:
all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and
myself almost dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in asflicting myself at
the dismal circumstances I was brought to; viz. I had
neither food, house, cloaths, weapon, or place to fly to:
and, in despair of any relies, saw nothing but death be-
fore me; either that I should be devoured by wild-beasfs,
murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of
food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree for
fear of wild-creatures, but slept icunuly, though it rained
all night.
October 1. In the morning, I saw, to my great sur-
prize, the ship had floated with the high tide, and W3S
driven on shore again much nearer the island; which, as
it was seme comlort on the one hand, (for seeing her si-
upright
tlpright, and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind
abated, I might get on board, and get some food and ne-
cessaries out of her for my relies;) so, on the other
hand, it renewed my gries at the lois of my comrades,
who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board, mio-ht
have saved the ship, or at least that they would not have
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might, perhaps, have built us a boat out
of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some
other part of the world. I spent great part of this
day, in perplexing myself on these things; but at length,
seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near
as I could, and then swam on board. This day also
continued raining, though with no wind at all.
From the ist of October to the z4th. All these days
entirely spent in different voyages to get all I could
out of the ship: which I brought on sliore every tide of
flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in these days, though
with some intervals of fair weather; but, it seems, this
was the rainy season.
October 14. I overset my raft, and alTthe goods I had
got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide
was out.
October 15. It rained all night and all day, with,
some gusts of wind; during which time the (hip broke
in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder than before,
and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,
and that only at low water. I spent this day in cover-
ing and securing the goods, which I had saved, that the
rain might not spoil them.
October a 6. I walked about the sliore almost all day,
to sind out a place to six my habitation; greatly con?
cerned to secure myseli irom any attack in the night, ei-
therfrom wild beasts or men. Towanlsnight I sixed upoa
a proper place under a rock, and marked out a semicircle
for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen
with a work, wall, or fortisication, made of double
piles, lined within with cable, and without with turf.
H From
From the z6th to the 30th, I worked very hard <*
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island
with my gun to fee for some food, and discover the
country; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed
me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it would
not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the sirst night, making it as large as I could,
with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.
November z. I set up all my chests and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my raft, and with them
formed a fence round me, a little within the place I had
marked out for my fortisication.
November 3. I went out with my gun, and killed
two fowls like ducks, which were very good food. la
the afternoon, went to work to make me a table.
November 4. This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep,
^nd time of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain;
then employed myself at work till about eleven o'clock;
then eat what I had to live on; and from twelve till
two I lay down to steep, the weather being excessive hot;
JUid then in the evening to work again: the working
part of this day and the next were wholly employed in
making this table, for I was yet but a very sorry work-
man, though time and necessity made me a compleat na-
tural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any
©ne else.
November $. This day I went abroad with my gu«
.and my dog, and killed a wild-cat; her skin was pretty
soft, but her stem good for nothing: every creature I
:killed I took osf the skins and preserved them. Com-
ing back by the sea-shore, I few many sorts os sea-fowls
with which I was unacquainted; but was surprized, and
almost frighted, with two or three seals, which, while I
was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got
m» the sea, and escaped me for that tsme. is ».
November 6. After my morning walk, I went t»
work with my table again, and sinished it, though not
to my liking: nor was it long besore I learned to
mend it.
November 7. Now it began to be settled sair wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the iith,
(for the nth was Sunday, according to my reckoning)
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with somedif-
siculty brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please
me; and even in the making I pulled it to pieces several
times. Note. I soon neglected keeping Sundays; for
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which
was which.
November 13. This day it rained, which resreshed
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was ac-
companied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frightened me dreadsully for fear of my powder. As
foon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of
powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it
might not be in danger.
November 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests, or boxes, which might hold
about a pound, or two pounds at most, of powder; and
fo putting the powder in, I stowed it in places, as secure
and remote from one another as possible. On one of
these three days I killed a large bird that was good to
eat, but I knew not what to call it.
November 17. This day I began to dig behind my
tent into the rock, to make room for my sarther conve-
niency. Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for
this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow
or basket: so I desisted from my work, and began to con-
sider how to supply that want, and make me some tools.
As for the pick-axe, I made use of the iron-crows,
which were proper enough, though heavy; but the rtext
thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely ne-
cessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually
without it; but what kind of one to make, I knew not.
November 11. The next day, in searching the woods,
Ha I found
I found a tree of that wood, ov like it, which in the Bra-
zils they call the iron-tree, for it's exceeding hardness s
of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe,
I cut a piece, and brought it home with great disficulty,
for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no
other way, made me a long while upon this machine;
for I worked it effectually, by little and little, into the
form of a shovel or spade, the handles exactly shaped like
ours in England, only that the broad part, having no
iron mod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long;
however, it served well enough for the uses which I had
occasion to put it to: but never was a shovel, I believe,
made after that sashion, or so long making.
I was still desicient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-
barrow; a balket I could not make by any means, hav-
ing no such things as twigs that would bend to make
wicker-ware, at least none yet found out; and, as to
the wheelbarrow, I sancied I could make all b\it the
wheel; but that I had no notion of, neither did I know
how to go about it; besides, I had no possible way to
make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel
to run in; so I gave it over; and, for carrying away the
earth which I dug out of the cave, T made me a conveni-
ence like an hod, which the labourers carry mortar in
when they serve the bricklayers.
This was not so dissicult to me as making the shovel;
and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I
made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less
than four days; I mean always, excepting my morn-
ing's walk with my gun, which I seldom sailed; and
very seldom sailed also of bringing home something six
to eat.
November z3. My other work having stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were si-
nished I went on; and working every day as my strength
and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in
widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my
goods commodiousty.
N,°te.
Note. During all this time I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a
warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar; as for a lodging, I kept to the tent, except
that sometimes in the wet season of the year, it rained io
hard, that I could not keep myself dry; which caused
me afterwards to cover all my place withinmy pale with
long poles in the form of rafters, leaning against tlve rock,
and loading them with flags, and large leaves of trees,
like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault sinished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it
too large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the
top and one side; so much, that in short it frightened
me, and not without reason too; for is I had been
under it, I had never wanted agrave-digger; upon this
disaster I had a great deal os work to do over again;
for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was
of more importance, I had the cieling to prop up,
fo that I might be sure no more would come down.
December 11. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shoars or posts, pitched up-
right to the top, with two pieces of board across over
each post: this I sinished the next day; and setting more
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the
roof secured, and the posts, standing in rows, ierved me
for partitions to part oft* my house.
December 17. From this day to the z0th, I placed
shelves, and knocked up nails in the posts, to hang every
thing up that could be hungup; and now I began to be
in some order within doors.
December jo. Now I curried every thing into the
cave, and began to surnish my house, and set up some
pieces os board like a dresser, to order my victuals upon;
but board began to be very scarce with me: also I made
me another table.
December z4. Much rain all night and all day; no
ftjrringout.
December z5. Rain all day.
H j December
December 16. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than besore, andpleasanter.
December 17. Killed a young goat, and lamed ano»
ther, so that I catched it, and led it home in a string;
when I had it home, I bound and splintered up it's leg,
which was broke.N. B. I took such care of it, that it
lived, and the leg grew well, and as strong as ever; but
by nursing it so long, it grew tame, and sed upon the lit-
tle green at my door, and would not go away. This,
was the sirst time that I entertained a thought of breed-
ing up feme tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot was all spent.
December z8, 19, 30. Great heats, and no breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the even-
ing for food. This time I spent in putting all my
things in order within doors.
January 1, 1660. Very hot still; but I went abroad
early and late, with my gun, and lay still in the middle
of the day: this evening, going sarther into the vallies
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found there
was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to
come at; however, I resolved to try it I could not bring
ray dog to hunt them down.
January z. Accordingly, the next day I went out
with my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was
mistaken, for they all saced about upon the dog, and he
knew his danger toowell,for he would not come near them.
Januarys. I began my fence or wall; which, he-
ir.g still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N. B. This wall being described besore, I purposely
omit what was said in the Journal: it is sussicient to
observe, that I was no less time than srom the 3d
of January to the 14-th of April, working, sinishing,
and persecting this wall, though it was no more than
about twenty-four yards in length, being an half cir-
cle from one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it; the door of the cave being sn the
Centre behind it.
AU
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering
me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together: but I
thought I mould never be persectly secure till this wal}
was sinished: aud it is scarce credible what inexpressible
labour every thing was done with, especially the bring-
ing piles out of the wood, and driving them into the
ground; for I made them much bigger than I needed to
have done.
When this wall was sinished, and the outside double
fenced with a turs-wall, raised up close to it, I persuaded
myself, that is any people were to come ashore there,
they would not perceive any thirg like an habitation:
and it is very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter
upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I went into the woods for
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and made
frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other
to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild
pigeons, which build not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons in the holes of the rocks; and
taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them
up tame, and did so; but when they grew older, they
flew all awav, which perhaps was at sirst for want of
feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; however,
I srequently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which were good to eat.
And now, in the management of my houshold affairs,
I found mysels wanting in many things, which I thought
at sirst it was impossible for me to make, and indeed so it
was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be
hooped; I had a small rundlet or two, as I observed be-
fore, but I could never arrive to the capacity os making
one of I hem, though I spent many weeks about it; I
could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true
to one another, as to make them hold water; so I gave
that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles 5
so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by
seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed, I rememT
bered
bered the lump of bees-wax with which I made candle*
in my African adventure; but I had none of that now.
The only remedy I had was, that when I killed a goat,
I made tallow of the sat, and with a little dim made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick
of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this surnished
me with light, though not a clear steady light like a
candle.
In the midst of my labours it happened, that, rum-
maging my things, I found a little bag, which, as I
hinted before, had been silled with corn for feeding poul-
try, not for this voyage, but besore, as I suppose, when
the ship came from Lisbon; what little remainder of com
had been in the bag was ail devoured by the rat's, and I
law nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use, (I think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the
lightning, or some such use) I shook the husks of corn
out of it on one side of my fortisication under the
rock.
It was a little besore the great rains just nowmentioned,
that I threw this lkiff away, taking no notice of any
thing, and not so much as remembering that I had
thrown any thing there; when about a month after, or
thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green
shooting upon the ground, which I fancied might be
some plant I had not seen; but I was surprized, and
persectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I
siw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were per-
fect green barley, of the same kind as cur European,
nav, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and consu-
sion of my thoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto
acted upon no religious foundation at all; indeed I had
very few notions of religion in my head, nor had enter-
tained any fense of any thing that had besallen me, other-
wise than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God; without so much as enquiring into the end of
providence in these things, or hss ordering and govem.r
iiig
ing all events in tlte world: but after I law barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for
corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there,
it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God
had miraculously caused this grain to giow without any
help of seed sown, and that it was so directed, purely for
my sustenance in that wild and miserable place.
This reflection so asfected me, that it brought tears
from my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a
prodigy of Nature mould happen upon my account;
and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near
it still, all along by the side of the rock, some other
straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and
which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa
when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of Pro-
vidence for my support; but, not doubting that there
was no more in the place, I went all over that part of
the Island where I had been besore, looking in every cor -
ner, and under every rock, to fee for more of it, but I
could not sind any: at last it occurred to my thoughts,
that I had shaken the bag of chickens meat out in that
place, and the wonder began to cease; and I must con-
fels, my religious thanksulness to God's providence be-
gan to abate too, upon discovering that all this was no-
thing but what was common; though I ought to have
been as thanksul for so strange aud unsoreseen an inci-
dent as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the
work vf Providence, as to me, that should order or ap-
point, that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain
unspoiled, (when the rats had destroyed all the rest :) as if
it had been dropped from Heaven: as also that I should
throw it out into that paiticular place, where, being in
the shade of an high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas, iiad I thrown it any where else at that time, it
might have been burnt and destroyed.
I caresully saved the ears ct this corn, you may be
Hire, in their season, which was about the end ot June:
and, laying them up caresully, I resolved to sow then]
Si LIFE AND ADVENTURES OT
sussicient quantity to supply me with bread: but it was
not till the fourth year that I would allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but spar-
ingly. I lost all that I sowed the sirst season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it just besore the
dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not
as it would have done had I not made this unsortunate
mistake.
Besides this barley, there were twenty or thirty stalks
ef rice, which I preserved with the same care, and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the lame purpose,
viz. to make me bread, or rather food; for I found
ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that
also after some time. But to return to my Journal.
I worked excessive hard three or four months, to get
my wall done; and the i+th of April I closed it up,
contriving to get within, not by a door, but by a ladder,
that there might be no sign en the outside of my
habitation.
April 16. I sinistted the ladder; so I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and
let it down on the inside: this was a compleat inclosure
to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could
come at me from without, unless it could sirst mount
my wall.
The very next day after this wall was sinished, I had
almost had all my labour overtlu own at once, and my-
self killed. The case was thus: as I was busy behind
my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightened with a most dreadsul surprizing thing indeed!
for all on a sudden I found the earth came tumbling
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill over my head; and two of the posts I had set
up in the cave cracked in a tremendous manner: I was
heartily frightened, but formed no judgment of what
really was the cause; only thinking that the top of my
cave was salling in, as some.of it had done besore; and
for fear I should bs buried in it, I ran forwards to my
ladder)
ladder; and, not thinking myself safe there neither, I
got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which
I expected might roll down upon me. I no sooner set
mv feet on the ground, than I plainly saw it was a ter-
rible earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three
times, at about eight minutes distance, with three such
shocks as would have overturned the strongest building
that could be supposed to have stood upon the earth;
and a great piece os the top of the rock, which stood about
half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with such
a terrible noise, as I never heard in all my life; I per-
ceived also the sea was put into violent motion by it;
and I believe the (hocks were stronger under the water
than on the Island.
I was so amazed at this phenomenon, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that
I was like one dead or stupisied; and the motion of the
earth made me exceeding lick, but the noise of the sal-
ling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and rouzing
me from the stupisied condition I was in, silled me with
horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill
falling upon my tent and all my houshold goods, and bu-
rying all at once; and this sunk my very soul within me
a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I had
not heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear of
being buried alive: but still sat upon the ground, greatly
cast down, and disconsolate, not knowing what to do.
All this while I had not the least serious religious
thought, nothing but the common' Lord have mercy
 upon me!' and when was it over, that went
away too.
While I sat thus, I found the atmosphere overcast,
and it grew cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less
than half an hour, it blew a most dreadsul huricane of
wind; the sea was all on a sudden covered with foam
and froth, the shore with the breach of the water, and the
trees were taruuo by the roots. This continued about
three
three hours, when it began to abate; and in two hour»
more it was calm, with a heavy sall of rain.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much ter-
risied and dejected, when on a Hidden it occurred to my
mind that these winds and rains being the consequence
of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and
over, and I might venture into my cave again. With
this thought my spirits began to revive, and the rain
helping alio to periiiademe, I went in and sat inedown
in lr.y tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent
was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was farced
to go into my cave, though very much afraid and un-
easy for fear it mould sall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortisication, like a sink, to
let off the water. After I had been in my cave, I found
still more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to
be more composed; and, to support my spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small quantity of rum, which I did then and
at other times when I thought it essentially necessary,
knowing I could have no more after that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part of
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but my
mind being more composed, I began to consider what I
had best to do; thinking, that if the istand was sub-
ject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me lonie
little hut in an open place, which I might surround with
a wall, as I had done here, and thereby make myself
secure from wild beasts or men; concluding, if I staid
where I was, I shotild certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive.
In consequence of these thoughts, I resolved to move
my tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent. And 1 spent the two next days, being the 19th
and z0th of April, in contriving where, and how to re-
move my habitation. The
Thc sear of bcirg swallowed up alive greatly dis-
turbed ir.y mind, so that I had very little resreshment
srom deep; the apprehensions of lying abroad without
any fence were almost equal to it; but still, when I
looked about, and saw how every thing was put in order,
hew well concealed I was, and hew sase from danger, it
made me unwilling to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would re-
quire a vast deal of time to do this, and that I must be
contented to run the hazard where I was, till I had
formed a camp for myself, and had secured it
so as to remove to it. With this resolution I composed
myself for a time, and then resolved to go to work with
all speed to bu.ld me a wall with piles, cables, &c.
in a circle, as besore, and set my tent up in it when it
was sinistied; but that I would venture to stay where I
was, till it was smished and sit to remove to. This
was the z1st.
April zz. The next morning 1 began to consider of
means to put this resolve into execution: but I was at
a great loss about my tools: I had three large axes,
and abundance of hatchets, (for we carried the hatchets
for traffic with the Indians ;) but with much chopping
and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all sull of
notches, and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I
could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me
as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life
ar.d death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel
with a string to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty. Note, I had not seen any
such thing in England, or at least to take notice how it
was done: though since, I have observed it was veiy
common there; besides that, my grindstone was very
large and heavy. This machine cost me a sull week's
work to bring it to persection.
April z8, z9. These two whole days I took up in
gr'nding my tools, my machine for turning my grind-
stone persorming very well.

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been low
a great while, I now took aiurvey of it, and reduced my-
self to one biscuit-cake a-day.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-side,
86 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
ger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask. When I
came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces
.of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by
the late huricane; and looking towards the wreck it-
self, I thought it seemed to lie higher out ot the water
than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was
driven on shore, and found it was a barrel of gun-pow-
der, but it had taken water, and the powder was caked
as hard as a stone : however, I rolled it sarther on the
more for the present, and went upon the sands, as near
as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.«
When I came to the ship, I found it strangely re-
moved. The fore-castle, which lay besore buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six seet; and the stern,
which was broken to pieces, and parted from the rest
by the force of the sea, soon alter I had left rum-
maging of her, was tossed as it were up, and cast on
one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that
side next the stern, that though there was a great
place of water besore, so that I could not come within
a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I
could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out!
I was surprized with this at sirst, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence
the ship was more broken open than formerly, so manv
things came daily on shore which the sea had loosened,
and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to
the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design os
removing my habitation; and I busied myself that day
especially, in searching whether I could make any wav
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind, sor that all the inside of the ship was choaked
up with land; however, as I had learned not to despair
of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to pieces
that I could of the ship, concluding, that whatever
I could get from her would be of some use or other
to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held some of the upper
part, or quarter-deck together; and when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could,
from the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in,
I was obliged to give over for that time.
May 4. I went a sishing, but caught not one sish that
I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when,
just going to leave csf, I caught a young dolphin. I
had made me a long line os some rope-yarn, but I had
110 hcoks: yet I frequently caught sish enough, as much
as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and
cat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great planks osf from the
decks, which I tied together, and made swim on shore
when the tide os flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts
out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very
hard, came home much tired, and had thoughts of
giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again,- with an intent
not to work; but sound the weight of the wreck had
broken itsels down, the beams being cut,' that several
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside ot
the hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but it was
almost sull of water and sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and earned an iron-crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear ot the
water or sand; I wrenched open two planks, and brought
thtm on shore also with the tide. I lest the iron-crow
ill the wreck for the next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made .way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loolened them with the crow, but could not
I a break
break them up; I Celt also a roll of English lead, aiv.l
could stir it, but it was too heavv to move.
May 10, ii, 1z, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber and
boards, or planks, and two or three hundred weight
of'iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge
of one hatchet against the lead, and driving with the
other; butas it layabout afootand an half inthe water,
I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the lorce ot the water;
but "I staid so long in the woods to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me going to ciie wreck that
day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
more at a great distance, two miles off, and resolved to
fee what they were, but found it was a piece of the head,
and too heavy for me to bring away.
May z4. prom the 17th to this day, I worked on
the wreck, and with bard labour loosened some things
so much with the crow, that on the sirst flowing tide
several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests;
but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to
land that day except some pieces of timber, aud an hog-
shead which had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water
and the sand.had spoiled rt.
I continued this work every day from the z4th of
May to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to
get food, which I always appointed, during this part
of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that
I might be ready when it was ebbed out to attend the
wreck. By this time I had gotten timber and plank,
and iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if I
had known how; as also at different times, and in
several pieces, near a hundred weigiit of the sheet
lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side I foun "1 a large
'tortoil*
tortoise or turtle; this was the sirst I had seen ; which,
it seen s, was only my misfortune, not any desect of the
place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other
Side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them
every day, as I afterwards found, though perhaps I might
have paid dear for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle: I found in
her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that
time, the most savourv and pleasant I ever tasted ip my
life, having had noflcsh, but of goats and fowls, since I
landed in this horrible place.
June 18, Raining all the day, I staid within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was some-
thing chilly, which I knew was not usual in that
latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
June z0. No rest all night; violent pains in my head,
and feverish.
June z1. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the
apprehensions of my sad condition, in being sick, and
having no help: prayed to God, for the sirst time since
the storm oss Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why;
my thoughts being all consused.
June zz. A little better, but under dreadsul appre-
hensions.
June z 3. Very bad again ; cold and shivering, attended
with a violent head-ach.
June z4.. Much better.
June z5. An ague very violent; the sit held me se-
veral hours, cold sit and hot, with saint sweats
after it.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89
took my gun, but found mylelf very weak ; however, I
killed a she goat,, and with much difficulty got it home,
broiled some of it, and eat; I would sain have stewed
it, and made seme broth, but had no convenience for that
purpose.
lune 27. The a<?ue returned again so violent, that \
I j Jay
lay in bed all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready
to perish with thirst, and so weak, I had not strength to
stand up, or get myself any water to drink; prayed, to
God again, but was light headed ; and when I was not
I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say ; onlv T lay
and cried' Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord
* have mercy upon me V I suppose I did nothing the
for two or three hours, till the sit wearing off, I sell asleep,
and did not awake till the night was sar advanced.
When I awoke, I found myself much refreslu-d.. but weak
and exceeding thinty; however, as I had no water in my
whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and
went to sleep again; in this second sleep, I had the sol-
lowing terrible dream.
I thought I was sitting on the ground, on the outside
of my wall, at the samu spot where I sat when the stcrm
blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a black cloud, in a bright flume of sire, and
light upon the ground: he was all over as bright as a
flame, Co that I could but just bear to look towards
him; his countenance was too dreadsul tor words to
describe. When he stepped on the ground, I thought
the earth trembled, just as it had done besore in the
earthquake; and the atmosphere looked, to my appre-
hension, as if it had been silled with flashes of sire. ,
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved
towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand
as if designing to kill me; when he came to a rising
ground, at some distance, he spoke ro me, or I heard
a voice so terrible, that it is impossihle to express the
terror of it: all that I can say I understood was this
'Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repen-
'tance, now thou shalt die.' At which words I
thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to
kill me. t
No one that shall ever read this account will exre't
I should be able to describe the horrors of my foul
at this terrible vision; I mean, that even while it was a
urcam, I even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any
more
more possible to describe the impression that remained
upon my mind, when 1 awaked and found it was but a
dream.
I had, alas ! no divine knowledge ; what I had received
by the goed instruction ot my sather was then worn out
by anuninterrupted series, for tight years, of sea-saring
wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but
such ns were, like rryseif, wicked and prophane to the
last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that
time, one thought that so much as tended either to look-
ing upwards towards God, or inwards towards a reflec-
tion upon my own ways : but a certain stupidity of foul,
without desire of gcod, or conscience os evil, had en-
tirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most har-
dened, unthinking, wicked creature, among our com-
mon sailors, can be supposed to be; and having the least
sense of the fear of Gcd in dangers, or of thanksulness
to God in deliverances.
In the relation of what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I add,
that through all the variety of miseries that had to this
day besallen me, I never had so much as one thought
of it's being; the hand os God, or that it was a just pu-
nishment sur my sins: my rebellious behaviour against
my saiher, or my present sins, which were great; or
so much as a punishment for the general course of my
wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition
en the desart mores of Africa, I never had so much as
ore thought of what would become os me, or one wish
to Gcd to direct me whither I mould go, or to keep me
srem the danger which apparently surrounded me,
es well from veracious creatures, as cruel savages : but
I was merely thoughtless of Gcd, or a Providence ; I
af<il like a mere brute, from the principles of nature,
and by the dictates ot common fense only; and, indeed,
hardly that.
Wlml was delivered and taken up at sea by the Por-
tvealfaptain, well used, ams dealt justly and honour-
ably with, as well as charitably, I had not the least).
thanksulness
thanksulness in my thoughts: when again I was ship-
wrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on this
island, I was as !ar from remorse, or looking on it as a
judgment; I only said to myself often, that I was
an unsortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.
It is true, when I got en shore sirst here, and found all
my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was sur-
prized with a kind of extaiy, and some transports of
foul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have
come up to true thanksulness ; but it ended where it
began, in a mere common slight of joy ; or, as I may lay,
being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon
the distinguishing goodness of the hand which had pre-
served me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when
all the rest were destroyed; or an enquiry why Pro-
vidence had been thus mercisul to me: even just the same
common fort of joy which seamen generally have, after
they have got late ashore from ihipwreck, all which
they drown in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost
as soon as it is over; aud all the rest of my life was
likeit.
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, in what manner I was
cast on this dreadsul place, out of the reach of human
kind, out of all hope ot relief or prospect of redemption,
as soon as I saw a probability os living, and that I should
not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my
asfliction wore eff, and I began to be very easy, api
plied myself to the works proper for my preservation
and supply, and was sar enough from being afflicted at
my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as thi
hand of God against me: these were thoughts which Very
seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as hath been observed in
my journal, had at sirst some little influence upon me,;
and began to asfect me with seriousness, as long as I
thought it had something miraculous in it; but a* soon
n i that part of the thought was removed, all the im- .
preffion which was -rassed from it entirely wore off.
Even
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more
terrible in it's nature, or more immediately directing to
the invisible Power which alone produces snch things .$
yet no sooner was the sirst fright over, but the impression
it had made went oft'also. I had no more fense of God,
or his judgment, much less of the present affliction of my
circumstances being from his hand, than if I had been
in the most prosperous condition of my life.
But now, when I began to be sick, and a cool and
deliberate view ot the miseries of death came to place it-
self besore me ; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted
with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had
slept so long, began to awake, and I cculd not avoid
reproaching myself with my past life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and
to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or
third day of my distemper, and in a violence, as well of
the fever as of the dreadsul reproaches of my conscience,
extorted seme words srom me, like praying to God,
though I cannot lay they were either a prayer attended
with desires, or with hopes: it was rather the voice
of mere fright and distress ; my thoughts were consused,
the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of
dying in such a miserable condition, railed vapours
into my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in
these hurries of my foul, I knew not what my tongue
might express; but it was rather exclamation, such
as' Lord! what a miserable creature am I! If I
'siiould be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help,
* and what will become of me!' Then the tears burst
from my eyes, and I could say no more for feme
time.
In this interval, the good advice of my sather came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which Imcn-
tioneu in the beginning ot this story; viz. that is I did
Jake this loolish step, God would not bless me, and I
would
should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neg-
lected his counsel, when there might be none to assist me
in my recovery. 'Now,' said I, aloud, ' my dear
 sather's words are come to pass: God's justice has
1 overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me.
 I rejected the voice of Providence which had merci-
'sully put me in a posture or state of life wherein I
'might have been happy or easy; but I would neither
 see it myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it
 from my parents; I lest them to mourn over my fol-
 ly, and now I am left to mourn under the conse-
'quences of it. I resused their help and assistance, who
'would have introduced me into the world, and would
'have made every thing easy to me; and now I have
'dissiculties to struggle with, too great for even na-
 ture itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
'no comfort, no advice!' Then I cried out' Lord,
 be my help, for I am in great distress!"
This was the sirst prayer, if I may call it so,
I had made for many years. But to return to my
journal.
June z8. Having been somewhat resreshed by the
sleep I had had, and the sit being entirely off, I got up,
and though the fright and terror of my dream still hung
heavy on my mind, yet I considered that the sit of the
ague would return again the next day, and now was roy
time to get something to resresh and support myself when
I should be ill. The sirst thing I did was to sill a large
iquare cafe bottle with water, and set it upon my table,
in reach of my be;; and to take off the chill or aguish
disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together; I then got a
piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals,
but could eat very little; I walked about, but was very
weak, and withal very heavy hearted trom a sense of my
miserable condition, dreading the return of my distem-
per the next day; at night I made my supper of three
of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and
eat as we call it in the shell; and this was the sirst kind
of
of food I ever asked God's blessing to, even (as I could
remember) in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun, (for I
never went out without that;) so I went but a lit-
tle way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out to
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
linooth. As I lat here, some thoughts, such as the fol-
lowing, occurred to my mind.
'What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so
'much? Whence produced? And what am I, and all
 the other creatures, wild and tame, human and bru-
'tal; whence are we?
'Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
 formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
1 is that?
'It then followed most naturally' It is God that
'has made them all!'' Well, but,' then it came on
strongly; ' if God has made all these things, he
 guides and governs them all, and all things that
 concern them; fcr the Being that could make all
'things must certainly have power to guide and direct
 them.
'If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
'his works, either without his knowledge or appoint-
 ment.
'And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
'knows that I am here, and am in a dreadsul condition;
 and if nothing happens without his appointment, he
'has appointed all this to besal me.'
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me
with the greater sorce, that it must needs be, that God
had appointed all this to besal me; that I was brought
to this miserable situation by his direction; he having
tht sole power, not of me only, but os every thing that
happened in the world. Immediately it followed
'Why has God done this to me? What have I done
 to be thus used?'
My
My conscience preiently checked me in that enquiry,
as it" I had blasphemed; and methought it t'polce to me
fike a voice' Wretch! dost thou ask what thou halt
'done? Look back upon a dreadsul mispent life, and
'ask thyself what thou hast no; done? Ask, why is it
'that thou wert not loni; ago destroyed? Why wert
 thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the
9« LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
'war? devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of
 Africa? or drowned here, when all the crew perished
 but thyself? Dost thou all; what have I done?'
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one nsto-
niflied, and had not a word to lay ; no, not to answer to
myself: but rose up, pensive and sad, walked back to
my retreat, and went up over my wall, as is I had been
going-to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed,
and I had no inclination to steep, so I fat down in my
chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark.
Now as the apprehensions of the return of my distemper
terrisied me very much, it occurred to my thought, that
the Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco, tor al
ni^st all distempers; aud I had a piece of a roll of to-
bacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and
some alio that was grewn, and not then sit sor use.
To this chest I repaired, in which I sound a cure both
for foul and body; I opened the chest, and immediatelv
met with what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as
the few books I had saved lay there too, I tock out one
of the bibles which I mentioned besore, and which, to
this time I had not found either leisure or inclination to
look into; I say, I took it out, and brought both that
and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but
I tried several experiments with it, as if I was reiolveU
it should hit one way cr other: I sirst took a piece of
a leas, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed ahno.t
ftupisied me, the tobacco being strong, and I not ac-
customed to its use. 1 then took some, and steeped it
an
an hour or two in rum, resolving to take a dose of it
when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan
of coals, and held my nose close over the imoak as long
as I could bear it, as well for the heat, as to receive be-
nesicial virtues from the plant.
After this operation I took up the bible, and began
to read: but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time: only
having opened the book casoally, tha sirst words that
occurred to me were these' Call on me in the day of
'trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify
'me.'
The words were very apt to my situation, and made
fome impression upon my thoughts at the time of read-
ing them, though not so much as they did afterwards;
for, as for being delivered, the word had no assinity, as
I may say, to me; it was so remote, so impossible, in
my n.ppvehension of things, that I said as the children of
Ifrael did when they were promised flesh to eat' Can
* God spread a table in the wilderness ?'' Can God
'himself deliver me from this place?' And as it was
not for many years that any hope appeared, this pre-
vailed very often upon my thoughts: but, however, the
words made a very great impression upon me, and I
mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and
the tobacco had, as I said, affected my head so much,
that I was inclined to steep; accordingly I left my lamp
burning in the cave, lest I "mould want any thing in
the night, and went to bed; but besore I lay down, I
did what I never had done in all my life, I kneeled down
and prayed to God to sulsil the promise to me, that if
I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would de-
liver me. After my broken and impersect prayer was
over, I drank the rum wherein I had steeped the to-
bacco, which was so strong and rank of the weed, that
indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately on this
I went to bed, and soon found it flew up into my head
violently; but I self into a sound sleep, and waked no
more till, by die sun, it must have been near three
K o'Clock
o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nav, to this
hour I am partly of the opinion that I slept all the next
day and night, and till about three the day after; for
otherwise I knew not how I mould lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing
and re-crcssing the line, I should have lost more than a
day; but in my account it was lost, and I never knew
which way.
Be that, however, one way or other, when I awaked
I found myself exceedingly resreshed, and my spirits
lively and cheerful. When I got up I was stronger
. than I was the day besore, and my stomach better; for
I was hungry; and, in short, I had no sit the next day,
but continued much altered for the better. This was
the z9th.
The 30th was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too sar.
I killed a sea-sowl or two, something like a brand-
goose, and brought them home, but was not very sor-
ward to eat them; so I eat some more of the turtle's
eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed
the medicine which I had supposed did me good the
day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum; only I
did not take so much as besore, nor did I chew any of
the leas, or hold my head over the sinoak; however,
I was not so well the next day, which was the sirst of
July, as I hoped I should have been, for I had a return
os the cold sit, but it was not much.
July a. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at sirst, doubling the quantity
which I drank.
July 3. I missed the sit for. good and all, though I
did not recover my sull strength for some weeks after.
,S LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
exceedingly upon these words in the Scripture,  I will
'deliver thee;' and the impossibility of my deliverance
lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting
it: but as I was discouraging myself wsth such thought's
it
it occurred to my mind, that I dwelt so much upon my
deliverance from the main affliction, that I difregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were,
made to ask myself such questions as theie; viz. ' Have
 I not been delivered, and wondersully too, from sick-
 ness? From the most distressed condition that could
'be, and that was so frightsul to me? And what no-
'tice had I taken of it? Had I done my part? God
 had delivered me: but I had not glorisied him.' That
is to say, I had not owned and been thanksul for that
as a deliverance, and how could I expect greater de-
liverance!
These reflections greatly affected me, and I imme-
diately kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud for
my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the bible: and opening
it where the New Testament commences, I began
feriously to read it, and laid a restraint upon myself to
read some every morning and every night, not consining
myself to the number of chapters, but to read as long
as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long
after when I set seriously to this work, but I sound my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wick-
edness of my past life; the impression os my dream re-
vived, and the words' All these things have not
'brought thee to repentance,' ran seriously in my
thoughts: I was earnestly begging of God to give me
repentance, when it happened providentially the very day,
that, reading the^Scripture, I came to these words
'He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repen-
 tance, and to give remission:' I threw down the book
and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to
heaven, in a kind of extacy of joy, I cried out aloud
 Jesus, thou son of David! Jeliis, thou exalted Prince
'and Saviour, give me repentance!'
This was the sirst time I could say, in the time fense
of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I
prayed with a fense of my condition, and with a true
scripture view of hope, founded on the encourage-
K. 2 meat
ment of the word God;' and srom this tsme,
I may say, I began to have hope that God would
hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above
' Call on me, and I will deliver thee,' in a disferent
sense from what I had ever done besore; for then I had
no notion of anything being called deliverance, but my
being delivered from the captivity I was in; for though
I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was
certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst: sense of
the word; but now I learned to take it in another
sense. Now I looked back upon my past life wiih such
horror, and my sins appearing lo dreadsul, my
foul sought nothing of God but del verance from the
.cad os guilt that b re down all my comfort. As for
my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much
as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was
all of no consideration in comparison of this; and I
added this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it,
that whenever they come to a true sense of things,
they will sind deliverance from sin a much greater bless-
ing than deliverance from affliction.
But leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less miser-
able as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind;
and my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading
the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher
nature, I had a great deal of comsort withm, which till
now I knew nothing of; also, as my health and strength
returned, I determined to surnish myself with every
thing I wanted, and make my way of living as regular
anJ comfortable as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-
ployed in walking about with my gun in my hand,
though I could proceed no great distance without inter-
vals of rest, being fromillncis lo weakened, that I had
very little strength lest: indeed it is hardly to be ima-
gined how low I was, and to what an impersect state I
wai. reduced. The application which I made use of,
was
was persectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an
ague besore; neither can I recommend it to any one to
practice, by this experiment: and though it did cany ost
the sit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for I had
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs tor some time.
I learned from it, also, this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing
to my health that could be, especially in those rains that
came attended with storms and huricanes of wind; foras
the rain which came in a dry season was always most ac-
companied with such storms, so I found this rain was
much more dangerous than the rain which fell in Septem-
ber and October.
I had been now in the island above ten months; and
all possibility of deliverance from mv condition seemed
to be entirely taken from me; I sirmly believed, that no
human being had ever set soot upon the place. Having
now secured my habitation, as I thought, sully to my
mind, I had a great desire to make a more persect disco-
very of the Island, and to see what other productions I
might sind os which I was at present unacquainted.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself; I went up the
creek fust, where, as hinted, I brought my rafts on
sliore. I found, after I came about two miles up, that
the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no
more than a little brook of running water, and very fresh
and good; but this being the dry season, there was
hardly any water in seme parts"of it. at least not enough
to run into any stream, so as it could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and on the rising parts of them next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be sup-
posed, never overflowed, I found a great deal os tobacco,
green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk;
there were various other plants with which I was unac-
quainted, and which might probably have some efficaci-
ous virtues, though to me unknown.
K3 I
I searched for die cassava root, of which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread, but I could sind
none. I s.tw large plants of aloes, but did not then

and, for want of cultivation, impersect. I contented
myself with these discoveries for this time, and came
back muling with myself what course I might take to
know the virtue and goodness of anv of the fruits or
plants whsch I mould discover, but could bring it to no
conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little ob-
servation while I was in the Brazils, that I was unac-
quainted with the plants os the sield; at least I knew
very little that might lerve me to any purpose at this time
of my distress.
The next day, the i6th,I went the same way again;
and, after going something sarther than I had done the
day besore, I found the brook and the savannahs began
to cease, and the country became more woodv than be-
fore. In this part I found different fruits, and particu-
larly melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees; the Tines had spread indeed over
the trees, and the clustersof grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich., This was a surprizing disr
covery, and I was exceeding glad of them, bu! was
warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, re-
membering, that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eat-
ing of grapes killed several of our Englishmen who were
{laves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers;
but I found an excellent uie for these grapes, and that
was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would
be, as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable
to eat, when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, which was the sirst time
I had lain srom home. When night came, I got up
into a tree, where I slent well, and the next morning pro-
ceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles,
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping l1.11
due north, with a lidge of hills on the south and north
side of me. ^
At the end of this journey I came to an opening where
the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little
spring of fresh water which issued out of the side of the
hiil by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every
th ng being in a state of beautisul verdure, that it looked
like a planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of the valley, survey-
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure to think this was all
my own; that I was king and lord of all this country
indeseasibly, and had a right of possession; anc/, if I
could convey it, I might have it in inheritance, as com-
pleatly as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron-trees;
but all wild, and few bearing any fruit; at least, not
then; however, the green limes that I gathered were
not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome: and I

it very wholesome, and very cool and resreshing drink.
I sound now I had business enough to gather and cany
home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well of grape*
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet sea-
fon, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me, I tra-
velled homeward, and resolved to come again, and brine
a hag or sack, or what I could mike, to carry the
rest home.
Accordingly; having spent three days in this journey,
I came home, (to Imuft now call my tent, and my cave:)
but, besore I got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the
richness of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having
broken them, and bruised them, they were good for Jitr
tie or nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I
could bring but few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest:
but I was surprized, when corning to my heap of grapes,
whish
which were so rich and sine when I gathered them, I
found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces, and drag-
ged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten
and devoured. By this I concluded, there were some
wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them upon
Iieaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that
one way they would be destroyed, and the other they
would be crushed with their own weight, I took another
course; I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes
and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated with great pleasure on the fruitsulness os that val-
ley, and the pleasantness os the situation, the security
from storms on that side of the water, and the wood; and
concluded that I had pitched upon a place to six my
abode, which was by sar the worst part of the country.
Upon the whole, I began to think of removing my habi-
tation, and to lookout for a place equally sate, as where
I now was situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitsul
part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceed-
ing fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the
place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view
of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea-side,
where it was at least possible that something might hap-
pen to my advantage, and that the same ill-fate that
brought me hither might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce
probable, that any such thing should ever happen, yet to
inclose mysels among the hills and woods, in the centre
of the island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to
render such an affair not only improbable, but impossi-
ble; and that theresore I Qiight not by any means
to remove.
However,
However, I was Co pleased with this place, that I
spent much of my time there for the whole remaining
part of the month of July: and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove; yet I
built me a little kind of bower, and surrounded it at a
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ioj
as high as I could reach, well staked and silled between
with brush-wood: and here I lay very secure, sometimes
two or tluee nights together, always going over it with a
ladder as besore; so that I sancied now I had my coun-
try-house, and my sea coast house. And this work
took me up the beginning of August.
I had but newly sinished my fence, and began to enjoy
my labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick
close to my sirst habitation; for though I had made me
a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread
it very well, yet I had not the shelter of an hill to keep me
from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when
the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
sinished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
third of August I sound the grapes I had hung up
were persectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down,
irom the trets, and it was very happy that I did so; for
the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I
had lost the best part of my winter-food; for I had
above two hundred large.bunches ot them. No sooner
had I taken them ail down, and carried most of them
home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from thence,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ioj
every day, till the middle os October; and sometimes so
violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for se-
veral days.
At this time I was much surprized with the increase
of my samily: I had been concerned for the loss of one
of my cats, which ran away from me, and, as I thought,
had been dead, and I heard no tale or tidings of her, till,
to my astonishment, she came home about the end of Au-
gust,
gust, with three kittens. This was the more strange,
because, though I had killed a wild-cat, as I called it,
with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a disferent kind
from our European cats; but I found the kittens -were
the same kind of house-breed like the old one; and both
my cats being females, T thought it very strange. But
from these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered
with them, that I was forced to kill them like vermin,
or wild-beasts, and to drive them srom my house as much
as possible.
From the 14th of August to the z6th it rained inces-
santly, so that I could not stir out. In this state of con-
sinement I began to be straitened for food; but ventur-
ing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me. And my food was regulated thus:
I eat a bunch of raisins for my breaksast; a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled, (for,
to my great misfortune I had no vessel to boil or stew
any thing;) and two or three of the turtle's eggs
for supper.
During this consinement by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave; and, by
degrees, worked it on towards, one side, till I came to
the outside of the hill, and made a door or way cut,
which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in
and out this way. But I was not persectly easy at ly-
ing so open; for as I had managed myself besore, I wat
in a persect inclosure, whereas, now I thought I lay ex-
posed; and yet'I could not perceive, that there was any
living thing to fear, the largest animal I had yet seen
upon the island being a goat.
September 30. I was now come to the unhappy an-
niveriary of my landing; I cast up the notches on my
post, and sound I had been on shore three hundied and
sixty-sive days. I kept this day as a solemn sast, setting
it apart to religious exercise, prostrating myself to the
ground with the most serious humiliation, consessing my-
sell to God, acknowledging his righteous judgment
upon
upon mt, and praying to him to have mercy on me,
through Jesus Christ; arid having not tasted the least
refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down of
the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes,
and went to bed, sinishing the day as I began it.
I had all this time observed no sabbath-day; for as at
sirst I had no fense of religion upon my mind, I had
after some time omitted todistinguish the weeks, by mak-
ing a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-day,
and so did not really know what any of the days were;
but now having cast up the days above, I found I had
been there a year; so I divided it into weeks, ar.d let
apart every seventh day for a sabbath; though I found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two of my
reckoning.
A little after this, my ink began to sail me, in conse-
quence of which I used it mere sparingly, and wrote
down only the most remarkable events or my life, with-
out continuing adaily memorandum of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so ?.s
to provide accordingly. But I bought all my experi-
ence besore I had it; and what I am going to relate
was one of the most discouraging experiments I had
made. It has been observed, that I had laved the few
ears of barley and rice which I had so surprizingly found
spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe
there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty
of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it
after the rains, the sun being in it's southern position
going from me.
Accordingly I dug upapieceof grcjrd, as well as I
could, with my wooden lpade, and dividing it into two
parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it ca-
sually occurred to my thoughts, that I would not sow
it all at sirst, because I did not know wlwn was the pro-,
per time for it; ib I lowed about two-thirds of the seeds,
leaving the remainder sor a suture time.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so
4 » for
for not one grain os that I sowed at this time came to
anything: for the dry months following, the earth hav-
ing had no rain after the feed was sown, it had no mois-
ture to assist it's growth, and never came up at all, till
the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been newly sewn.
Finding my sirst seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug up
a piece near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my
feed in February, a little besore the vernal equinox;
and this, having the rainy months of March and April
to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a vei y
good crop; but having part of the seed lest only, and
not daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but a small
quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above
half a peck of each kind.
But by this experience I was made master of my bu-
siness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to
fow; and that I might expect two seed-times, arid two
harvests, every year.
"While this com was growing, I made a little disco-
very, which was of use to me asterwards. As soon as
the rains were over, and the weather began to settle,
which was about the month of November, I made a vi-
sit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not
been some months, yet I found all things just as I lest
them. The circle, or double hedge that I had made,
was not only sum and entire, but the stakes which I had
cut off some trees that grew thereabouts, were all
shot out, and grown with long branches, as much
as a willow-tree usually shoots the sirst year after lop-
ping it's head. I could not tell what tree to call it, that
these stakes were cut from. I was sitrprizul, and yet
very well pleased, to set the young trees grow; and T
prune i them, and led them up to grow as much alike as.
I'cov.ld; and it is scarce credible, how beautisul a sigure
thev grew into in three years; so that though the hedge
made a circle of about twenty-sive yards sn diameter, by-
the
tlie trees, For such I might now call them, soon covered it;
and it was a compleat made, sussicient to lodge under all
the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and
make me an hedge like this in a semi-circle round my
wall, (I mean, that of my sirst dwelling) which I did;
and, placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at above
eight yards distance from my sirst fence, they grew pre-
sently, and were at sirst a sine cover to my habitation,
and afterwards served for a desence also, as I shall ob-
serve in it's order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might gene-
rally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Eu-
rope; but into the rainy seasons, and the dry seasons,
which were generally thus.

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, a*
the winds happened to blow; but this was the general
observation I made. After I had sound, by experience,
the ill-consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to suinjsh myself with provisions besorehand, that
Vol. I. L I might
I might not be obliged to go out; and I lat within-door9
as much as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment, (and very suit-
able also to the time) for I law great occasion of many
things which I had no way to surnish myself with, but
by hard labour and constant application; particularly,
I tried many ways to make mylelf a basket; but all the
twigs I could get for the purpose were so brittle, that
they would not answer the purpose. It proved of excel .
lent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I
used to take great delight in standing at a basket-mak-
er's in the town where my father lived, to fee them make
their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very
ssicious to help, and a great observer of the manner how
they worked those things, and sometimes lent an hand, I
ha<! by this means such fnll knowledge of the methods
of it, thai I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
tame into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as
tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers, in Eng-
land; and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day I went to my country-
house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could
desire; whereupon, I came the next time prepared with
an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I loon found,
for there was a great plenty of them; these I set up to
dry within my circle or hedges; and when they were sit
for use, I carried them to my cave; and here, during the
next season, I employed myself in making (as well as I
eouM) a great many baskets, both to carry earth, and to
i ca rry or lay up any thing, as I had occasion: and though
I did not sinish them very handsomely, yet I made them
sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus after-
wards I took care never to be without them; and as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially, I made
-strong deep baskets to place my com in, instead of sacks,
when I should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this dissiculty, and employed much
3 time
tsme about it, I exerted myself to see, if possible, how
to supply two wants. I had no vessels to hold any
thing that was liquid, except two rundlets, which were
almost sull of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the
common size, and others which were cafe-bottles, iquare,
for holding waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a
pot to boil any thing in, except a great kettle which I
raved out of the ship, and which was too big for such
uses as I wanted, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I would willingly have
had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to
make one; however, I found a contrivance lor that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum-
mer, or dry season; when another business took me up
morethne than it could be imagined I could spare.
I mentioned besore, that I had a great mini to see the
whole ifland, and that I had travelled up the brook, and
&> on to where I built my bower, and where I had an
opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island.
I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-more on
that side: so taking my gun and hatchet, and my dog,
and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual,
with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in
my pouch, formy store, I beganrr y journey. When I
had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I
came within view of the sea to the west; and it being a
very clear day, I sairly descried land, whether an ifland
or continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the W. to the W. S. W. at a very great
distance: by my guess it could not be less than fisteen or
twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America:
and, as I concluded by all my cblervations, must be near
the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by
savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a
^vcrle condition than I was now; and, therefore, I ac-
L 2 quitltcd
<juiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which I beg**
now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing for the
best; I say, I contented myself with this, and lest disturb-
ing my mind with fruitless wishes of sarther discoveries.
Besides, after some pause upon this assair, I considered,
that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly,
one time or other, see some vessels pass or repass one way
or other; but if not, then it was the savage coast be-
tween the Spanish country and Brazil, which were, in-
deed, inhabited by the worst of savages; for they are
cannibals, cr men-eaters, and sail not to murder and
devour all the human bodies that sall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely for-
ward. I found that side of the island where I now was
much pleasanter than mine, the open or savannah sields
sweet, adorned with flowers and grafs, and sull of very
sine woods. I law abundance of parrots, and willingly
would I have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to
be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after
some pains catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home,
but it was some years besore I could make him speak.
However, at last I taught him to call me by my name
very samiliarly: but the accident that followed, though
a trifle, will be very diverting in it's place.
I was exceedingly amused with this journey; I found
in the low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and
foxes, but they differed greatly from all the other kinds
I had met with; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them,
though I killed several: but I had no need to be ventur-
ous; for I was not in want of food, and of that which
was very good too; especially these three sorts, viz.
goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to
my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have surnished
a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and
though my cafe was deplorable enough, yet I had great
cause of thanksulness, that I was not driven to any ex-
tremities for food; but had rather plenty, even to
dainties.  I never
I never travelled in this journey above two miles out-
light in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns
and returns, to fee what discoveries I could make, that
I came weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit
down for all night; and then either reposed myself in a
tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes let up-
right in the ground, either from one tree to another, or
so as no wild creature could come at me without wak-
ing me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprized to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the
island; for here indeed the more was covered with innu-
merable turtles, whereas, on the other side, I had found
but three in a year and a half. Here was also an insinite
number of fowls of many kinds, some of which I had -
not seen besore, and many of them very good to eat:
but foch as I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins,.
'I could have killed as many as I pleased, but was very
sparing of my powder and shot; and theresore was more
inclined to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could
better feed on; and thcugh there were many goats here
more than on the other side of the island, yet it was with
much more dissiculty I could come near them; the coun-
try being flat and even, they saw me much sooner than
when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plcasanter
than mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to re-
move: for as I was sixed in my habitation, it became
natural tome, and J itemed, all the while I was here, to
be, as it were, u.pon a journey, and srom home; however,
I travelled along the shoie of the sea towards the east, I
suppose, about twelve miles; and then setting up a great
pole upon the shere for a mark, I concluded I would
go home a;.-ain; and the next journey I took should be
on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round till I came to my post again; of which in
it's place.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
X- 3 u thinking
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in my
view, that I could not miss sinding my sirst dwelling by
viewing the country ;but I soon discovered my mistake; for
being come about two or three miles, I found myself de-
scended into a very large valley; but so surrounded with
hills, and those hills covered with woods, that I could
not fee which was my way by any direction but that of
the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the posi-
tion of the sun at that time of the day.
It happened, to my sarther misfortune, that the wea-
ther proved hazy for three or four days, while I was in
this valley; and not being able to fee the sun, I wan-
dered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged
to sind out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back
the same way I went; and then, by easy journevs, I
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot;
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things,
very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprized a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog; I had a great
mind to bring it home, if I could; for I had often been
musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or
two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might sup.,
ply me when my powder and shot should be spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string
formed of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about
me, I led him along, though with some dissiculty, till I
came to my bower, and there I inclosed him and lest him;
for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I
had been absent above a month.
I cannot express what satissaction it gave me, to
come into my old habitation, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed: this little wandering journey, without a let-
tied place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that
my own house, as I called it to myself, was a persect
settlement compared to that; and it rendered every
thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I would
never go a great way srom it again, while it mould be
my lot to stay on the island. I rcpcled
I reposed myself here p week to rest and regale myself
after my long journey; during which, most of the time
was taken up in the weig! *y affair of* making a cage for
my Pol, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to be
mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to
think of the poor kid, which I had pent in within my lit-
tle circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give
it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where
I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food; I went and cut boughs of trees,
and branches of such shrubs as I could sind, and threw
it over, and having fed it, I tied it, as before, to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had
no need to have tied it; for it followed me like a dog 5
and, as I continually fed it, the creature grew so lovr
ing> so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me af-
terwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same for
lemn manner as besore, being the anniversary- of my
landing on the island, having now been there two years,
and no more prospect of being delivered than the sirst
day I came there. I spent the whole, day in humble
and thanksul acknowledgments of the many wondersul
mercies which my solitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been insinitely more
miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God
had been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary conditions
than I should have been in the liberty of society, and in all
the pleasures of the' world: that he could sully make
up to me the desiciencies of my solitary state, and the
want of human society, by his presence, and the com-
munication of his grace to my foul, supporting, com-
forting, and encouraging me to depend upon his Pro-
vidence here, and hope ior his eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to seel how much
more happy the life I now led was, with all it's misera-
ble
blc circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable
lite I led all the past part of my days; and now having
changed both my sorrows and my joys, my very desires
altered, my asfections changed their gust, and my delights
were persectly new, from what they were at sirst coming,
or indeed for the two years past.
Besore, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or
for viewing the country, the anguish of my foul at my
condition would break out upon me on a sudden, and my
very heart would die within me, to think of the woods,
the mountains, the desarts I was in; and that I was a
prisoner locked up, with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemp-
tion. In the midst of the greatest composures of my
mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work, and
I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon
the ground for an hour or two together, and this was
still worse to me; for if I cpuld burst out into tears, or
vent myself by words, it would go off, and the gries would
naturally abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts;
I dailv read the word of God, and applied all the com-
forts of it to my present state. One morning, beine
very iad, I opened the bible upon these words" I will
never, never leave thee, nor sorsake thee!" Immediately
it occurred, that these words were to me; why else
should they bedirected in such a manner, just at the mo-
ment whtii 1 was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man? "Well, then," said I,
"if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
"can it be, or what matters it, though the world should
"all forsake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had
"all the world, and should lose the savour and blessing
"of God, there would be no comparison in the lols?"
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind,
that it was possible for me to be more happy in this for-
saken, solitary condition, than it was probable I ihould
have
have ever been in any other particular state in the world;
and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God
for bringing me to this place.
I know not what it was, but something mocked my
mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.
"How canst thou be such an hypocrite," said I, even
audibly, " to pretend to be thanksul for a condition,
"which, however thou mayest endeavour to be con-
"tented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be
"delivered from?" So I stopped there; but though I
could not say, I thanked God for being there, yet I sin-
cerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by
whatever asflicting providences, to fee the former condi-
tion of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and
repent. I never opened the bible, or shut it, but my
very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up
among my goods; and for assisting me afterwards to-
save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader the
trouble of so particular an account of my works this
year as the sirst; yet in general, it maybe observed,
that I was very seldom idle; having regularly divided
rhy time, according to the several daily employments
that, were besore me; such as, First, My duty to God,
and reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart
fome time for, thrice every day. Secondly, The going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours every morning when it did not rain.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing, what I had kslled or catched for my supply. These
took up great part of the day; also it is tobe considered,
that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the
zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out;
so that about four hours in the evening was all the time
I could be sopposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad
with my gun in the afternoon. To
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
be added the exceeding laborioushess of my work; the
many hours, which, for want of tools, want of help,
and want of skill, every thing that I did took up out
of my time: for example, I was sull two and forty days
making me a board for a long shels, which I wanted in
in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and
saw-pit, would have cut six of them, out of the same
tree, in half a day.
My case was this: It was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be abroad
one. The tree I was three days cutting down, and
two more cutting osf the boughs, and reducing it to a
log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking
and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips,
till it began to be light enough to move; then I turned
it, and made one side smooth and flat as a board, from
end to end; then turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may
judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work;
but labour and patience carried me through that and
many other things; I only observe this in particular, to
fliew the reason v/hy so much of my time went away
with so little work, viz. that what might be a little to
be done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and re-
quired a prodigious time, to do alone and without such
assistance.
But, notwithstanding this, with patience and labour
I went through many things, and indeed every thing
my circumstances made necessary for me to do, as will
appear by what follows.
It was now the month of November when I expected
my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had ma-
nured, or dug up for them, was not great; for, as I
observed, my feed of each was not above the quantity
of half a peck; for I had lost one whole crop by sow-
ing in the dry season: but now my crop promised very
veil, when, on a Hidden, I found I was in danger of
losing
losing it all again by enemies of several sorts which it
was scarce poflible to keep srom it; as sirst the goats,
and wild creatures which I called hares, who tasting the
sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon
as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get no
time to shoot up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclo-
sure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal
of toil; and the more, because it required expedition,
the creatures daily spoiling my corn. However, as my
arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it
totally well fenced in about three weeks; and shooting
some of the creatures in the day-time, set my dog to
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate,
where he would stand and bark all night long; so, in a
little time, the enemies forsook the place, and the coru
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me besore, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; for, going along by the place
to fe"e how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded
with fowls of I know not how many forts, which stood a$
it were watching till I should be gone. I immediately let
fly among them (for I had always my gun with me.) I had
no sooner mot, but there arose up a little cloud offowls,
which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a
few days they would devour all my hopes, that I should
be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all; and
what to do I could not tell: however, I resolved not to
lose my corn, if poflible, though I should watch it
night and day. In the sirst place, I went among it, to
see what damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as is was yet too
green for them, the loss was not so great, but the re-
mainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away,
I could easily see the thieves sitting upon Vll the trees
about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away,
and
8nJ the event proved it to be so; for. as I walked off,
as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight,
but they dropped down one by one into the corn again.
I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to stay
till more came down, knowing that every grain they eat
now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the
consequence; but coming np to the hedge, I sired again,
and killed three of them. TJ^s was what I wished for;
so I took them up, and served them as we serve notori-
ous thieves in England, viz. hanged them in chains, for
no LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
that this should have such an efFect as it had; for the
fowls would not only not come to the corn, but in short
they forsook all that part of the island, and I could
never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows
hung there.
This I was very glad of, you maybe sure; and about
the latter end of December, which was my second har-
vest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it
down, and all I could do was to make one as well as I
could out of one of the broad swords or cutlasses, which
I had saved among the arms out of the ship. However,
as my crop was but small, I had no great dissiculty to
cut it down; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut no-
thing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great bas-
ket which I had made, and so nibbed it out with my
hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found,
that out of my half-peck of feed, I had near two bu-
shels of rice, and above two bushels and an half of bar-
ley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure
at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw, that in time it would please God to sup-
ply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed again,
for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my
corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made
into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how to make
it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things be-
ing
ing added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not
to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season, and in the mean time to employ
all my study and hours of working to accomplish this
great work of providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly laid, that now I worked for my
bread. It is a little wondersul, and what I believe few
people have thought much upon, viz. the strange mul-
titude of little things necessary in the providing, produc-
ing, curing, dressing, making, and sinishing, this one
article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made more
and more sensible of it every hour, even alter I got the
sirst handsul of seed corn, which, as I have said, came
up unexpectedly, and indeed to my surprize.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, nor spade or
shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a
wooden spade, as I observed besore; but this did my
work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a
great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not
only wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder
and much worse done.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work
it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the
persormance. When the corn was sowed, I had no har-
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a
great heavy bough cf a tree over it, to scratch the earth,
as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.'
When it was growing, or grown, I have observed al-
ready how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it,
mew or reap it, cure or carry it hon e, thresh, part it
from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to
frind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into
read, and an oven to bake it in; and all these things I
did without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was
an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too; but
all this, as I said, made every thing laborious and tedi-
Vol. I. M eu»
dious to me, but that there was no help tor; neither was
my time so much loss to me, because I had divided it:
a certain part of it was every day appointed to these
works; and as I resolved to use none ot the corn for
bread, till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the n?xt
six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and in-
vention, to surnish myself with utensils, proper for per-
forming all the operations necessary for making the corn,
when I had it, sit for use. .
But, sirst, I was to prepare more land, for I had now
feed enough to low above an acre of ground. Besore I
did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a
spade, which, when it was done, was a very poor one
indeed, and being heavy, required double labour to
work with it; however, I went through that, and lowed
my feeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my
house as I could sind them to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedge, the stakes ot which were all cut
off that wood I had let besore, which I knew would
grow, so that in one year's time I was sure I should have
a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair.
This work was not so trifling but that it took me up
at least three months, because great part of that time
was of the wet s'aliin, when I could not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could not
go out, I found employment on the following occasion,
always observing, that all the while I. was at work, I
diverted myself with talkingto my parrot, and teachsng
him to speak; and I quickly learned him to know his
own name; at last, to speak it out pretty loud, POL;
which was the sirst word I ever heard spoken in the
island by any mouth but my own. This, theresore was
not my work, but an assistant to my work: for now, as
I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, which
was as follows: I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself lome earthen vessels, which in-
deed, I greatly wanted, but knew not how to come at
them: however, considering the heat of the.climate, I
did not doubt but, if I could tied out any such clay, I
msght botch up some such pot, as might, being dried
bv the run, be hard enough, and strong enough to bear
handling, and tohold anything that was dry, and required
to be kept so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c. which was thelhingl was upon, I resolved to
make iome as large as I could, and lit only to stand like
jars to hold what should be put into them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at
me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise
this paste, what odd, mishapen ugly things I made, how
many os them tell in, and how many sell out, the clay
not being stiff enough to be?r its own weight; how
many cracked by the over-violent heat of the ran, being
set out too hastily; and how many fell to pieces, with
only removing, as well besore as alter they were dried;
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to sind
the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and
work it, I could notmaKe above two large earthen ugly-
things, I cannot call them jars, in about two months
labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I liittd them gently up, and set them down again
in two gieat wicker baskets, which I had made on pur-
pose sor them, that they might not break; and as, be-
tween the pot and the basket, there wns a little room to
spare, I Untied it lull o. the rice and barley straw, and
these two being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my corn, and perhaps the meal when the corn
was bruised.
fiiougii I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better suc-
cess; such as little round pots, flat dimes, pitchers, and
pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to; and the
heat of the lun baked tlicm exceeding hard.
But all this would not answer my end; which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear
tiie sire, which none of these could do. It happened,
alter .ome time, n.akn ga pretty large sire sor cooking
my meat, when I went to put it out, aiter I had done
M a with
«+ LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
ware vessels in the sire, burnt as hard as a stone and
red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it,
and said to myself, that certainly they might be made
to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my sire, so as t»
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln
such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with
lead, though I had some lead to do it with: but I
placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a
pile, one upon another, and placed my sire-wood all
round it, with a great heap of embers under them: I
plied the sire with fresh suel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in
that heat about sive or six hours, till I found one of
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay, melted by the
violence of the heat, and would have nan into glass, if
I had gone on; so I flacked my sire gradually, till the
pots began to abate of the red colour; and watching
them all night, that I might not let the sire abate too
sast, in the morning I had three very good, I will not
say handsome pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as
hard burnt as could be desired; and one of them per-
fectly glazed with the running of the sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I wanted
no fort of earthen-ware for my use; but I must observe
as to the shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as
any one may suppose, when I had no way of making
them, but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman
would make pies that never learned to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal
to mine, when I sound I had made an earthen pot that
would bear the sire; and I had hardly patience to stay
till they were cold, besore I set one upon the sire again,
with some water in it, to boil some meat, which I did
admirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some
very
very good broth, thouoh I wanted oatmeal, and several
other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would
have had it.
My next concern was, to gei me a {tone mortar, to
stamp or belt some corn in: fer as to the mill, there was
no thought of arriving to that persection cf art with
one pair of hands. To Ripply this want, I was at a
great loss; for, os all trades in the world, I was as per-
fectly unqualisied for a stone-cutter, as for any whatso-
ever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I
spent many a day to sind cut a great stone big enough
to cut hollow, and make si for a mortar, and could sind
ROBTNSON CRUSOE nj
I had no wry to c! ig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks
in the island of hardness sussicient, but were ail of a san-
dvcrumbling stone, which would neither bear the weight
ot an heavy peftie, ncr wcuid it break the corn without
filling it with sand: so, after a great deal of time lost
in searching for a stone, 1 gave it over, and resolved to
lock out a great block of hard woed, which I found
indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it en the out-
side with my ax and hatchet; and then with the help of
sire., and insinite labour, made an hollow place in it, as
the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this,
I made a great heavy pestle or beater, of the wood cal-
led the iren-wood, and this I prepared and laid by against
I had try r.cxt crop of coin, when I proposed to myself
to grind, or rather pound, my corn or ir.cal to make
rr.y bread.
My next dissiculty was to make a sieve or sierce, to
dress my meal, and part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not fee it possible I could have any
bread. This was a most disssicult thing, so much as
but tothir.k on; sor to he sure I had nothing like the
r.eceflarv things to make it with: I mean, sine thin
canvas, or stusf to sierce the irtal through. And here
I wr.s at a sull stop for many months; nor did I really
know what to do; linen I had none lest, but what were
M 3 mere
mere rags; I had goats hair, but neither knew I how
to weave or lj>in it; and had I known how, here were
no tools to work it with: all the remedy 1 found for
this was, that at last I did remember I had among the
stamens cloathes which were saved out of the ship, some
neckcloths of cidlico or muslin; and with some pieces of
these I made three small sic-ves, but proper enough for
the work; and thus I made a shift for some years; how
I did afterwards, I shall shew in its place.
Thebakhig part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I mould make bread when I came to have corn;
for, sirst, I had no yeast: as to that part, as there was
no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself
much about it. But, for an oven, I was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that also, which was this; I made some earthen vessels
very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two
feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I
burnt in the sire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great sire
upon the hearth, which I had paved with some square
tiles of my own making and burning also: but I sltould
not call them square.
When the sire-wood was burnt pretty much into cm-
bers or live coals, I drew them forward upoii this hearth,
so as to cover it all over; and there I let them lie till
the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away all the
embers, I put down my loaf or loaves: and whelming
down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all
round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the
heat; and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world,
I baked my barley-loaves, and became in a liitle tims
a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made my-
self ieveral cakes cf the rice, and puddings ; indeed I
made no pics, neither had I anv thing to put into them,
supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or
goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all tin fe things took
me up most pait of the third year of my abode here;
for st is to ba observed, that in the intervals of theft
things I had my new harvest and husbandry to ma-
nage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it
home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my
large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for 1 had
no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn encreasing, I
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place
to lay it up in; for the increase of the com now yielded
me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty
bushels, and os the rice as much, or more; insomuch,
that I now resolved to begin to use it freely, for my
bread had been quite gene a great while; also I re-
folved to see what quantity would be sussicient for me a
whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could consume
. in a year; so I resolved to low just the lame quantity
every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would sully provide me with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of
land, which 1 had seen from the other side of the island;
and I was rtot without secret wishes, that I was on
shore there, sancying that seeing the main land, and an
inhabited countrv, I might sind some way or other to
convey myself sarther, and perhaps, at last, sind some
means ot escape.
slut all this while I made no allowance for the dan-
gers of inch a condition, and how I might sall into the
hards of savages, and perhaps ir.ch as I might have
reason to think sar worse than the lions and tygers cf
Africa: that if I once came into their power, I should
run a hazard, more than a thousand to or.e, of being
killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard
that the people os the Caribean coasts were cannibals,
or men eaters; aiid I knew by the latitude, that I could
not be sar off from that shore: that, suppose they were
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many Europe-
ans,
ans who had sallen into their hands had been served,
even when they had been ten or twenty together; much
more I, that was but one, and could make little or no
desence. All these things, I say, which I ought to have
considered well of, and which engaged my thoughts af-
terwards, took up none of my apprehensions at tint;
and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting
over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xtiry, and the long-boat
with the moulder of mutton sail, with which I "Vailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but this
was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look on our
ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon
the more a great way in the storm, when we were sirst
cast away. She lay almost where she did at sirst, but not
quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and
winds, almost bottom upwards, against the high ridge
of beachy, rough sand, but no water about her as
before.
. If I had had hands to have resitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat woold have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the
Brazils with her easy enough; but I might have easily
foreseen, that I could no more turn her, and set her up-
right upon her bottom, than I could remove the island.
However, I went to the wood, and cut levers and rol-
lers, and brought them to the boat, resolvin°- to try
what I could do: suggesting to myself that if I could
but turn her down, I might easily repair the damage
she had received, and that me would be a very good
boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared nopains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless
toil, and I spent, I think, three or four weeks -.bout it;
at last, sinding it impossible to heave it up with my little
strength, I sell to digging away the sand to undermine
it; and to to make it sell down, setting pieces of wood
to thrust and guide it right in the sall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it ui>
again, or to get under it, much les* to move it forwards
towards
fowards the water; so I was forced to give it up i
and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my
desire to venture across the main increased, rather
than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking, whether it was
not possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such
as the natives of thole climates make, even without
tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz. of the
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possi-
ble, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with the
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians;
but not at all considering the particular inccnveniencies
which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want
of hands to move it into the water when it was made;
a dissiculty much harder for me to surmount, than all
the consequences that want of tools could be to them;
for what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast
tree in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it
down, if after I might be able with my tools to hew and
dub the outside into a proper shape of a boat, and burn
or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a
boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it just where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind frcm this circumstance,
while I was making this boat, but I mould have imme-
diately thought how I should get it into the sea; but
my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the
sea in it, that I never once considered how I mould get
it off the land; and it was really in its own nature
more easy lor me to guide it over forty-sive miles of
fea, than about forty-sive sathom of land, where it lay,
to let it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did, who had any of his fenses awake. I
pleased myself with the design, without determining
whether or not I was able to undertake it; not but that
the dissiculty of launching my boat came often into my
head;
head ;"but I put a stop to my own enquiries into st, by
this foolish answer which I gave myself' Letme sirst
'make it, I'll warrant I'll sind some way or other to
'get it along when it is done.'
This was a most preposterous idea, but the eagerness
of my sancy prevailed, to work I went, and selled a
cedar tree: I question much whether Solomon ever had
inch an one for the building the temple at Jerusalem;
it was sive seet ten inches diameter at the lower part next
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the
end of twenty-two feet, alter which it lessened gradually
and then parted into branches; it, was not without in-
sinite labour that I Idled this tree: I was twenty days
hacking and hewing it at the bottom: I was fourteen
more getting the branches and limbs, and the vast
spreading head of it cut off; which I hacked and hewed
through with my ax and hatchet. Alter this it cost me
a month to shape it, to bring it to a proportion, and
to something like the bottom of a boat, that it might
swim upright as it ought ta"do. It cost me near three
months more to clear the inside, and work it cut, ib as to
make an exact boat of it: this I did, indeed, without si/e,
by mere mallet and chissel, and by the dmt of hard la-
bour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome peria-
gua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men,
and consequently big enough to have carried me and all
my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was extreme-
ly delighted with it: the boat was really much bigger
than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of
one tree in my life; and many a weary stroke it had cost
me, you may be lure. There remained nothing but to
get it into the water, which had I been able to effect, I
make no doubt but I mould have begun the maddest
voyage, and the most unlikely to be persormed, that
ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water sailed me,
though they cost insinite labour too; it lay about one
hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the
sirst
first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek*
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to
dig into the sursace of the earth, and so make a decli-
vity; this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of
pains: but who will grudge pains, that have their de-
liverance in view? But when this was worked through,
and this dissiculty removed, it was still much the same;
for I could no more stir the canoe, than I could the other
boat.
I then measured the distance of ground, and resolved
to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the ca-
noe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the wa-
ter. Well, I began this work, and when I entered into
it,anJ calculated how deep it was to be dug, how broad,
how the stusf to be thrown out, I found, that by the
number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must
have been ten or twelve years besore I should have gone
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that, at the
upper end, it must have been at least twenty feet deep.
In consequence of these dissiculties, I gave up all thoughts
of getting my vessel into the water.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late, the folly of beginning a work besore we count the
cost, and before we judge rightly cf our own strength to
go through with it.
While prosecuting this work I sinished my fourth year
in this istand, and kept my anniversary with the same
devotion, and with as much comfort as ever besore; for
by a constant study, and serious application of the word
of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a
different knowledge from what I had besore; I enter-
tained disferent notions of things; I looked now upon
the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires about.
In a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever
like to have; so I thought it looked, as we perhaps may
look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived in,
but was come out of; and well might I say, as Father
Abraham f id to Dives' Between me and thee thera
 is a great gulph sixed*' la
In the sirst place I was removed from all the wicked-
ness of the world here: I had neither the * Lust of the
'flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life:' I had
nothing to covet, for I had all I was now capable of en-
joying: I was lord of the whole manor, or, if I pleased,
I might call myself king, or emperor over the whole
country which I had possession of: there were no rivals.
I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com-
mand with me. I might have raised ship-loadings of
corn, but I had no use for it: so I let as little grow as
I thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoises or
turtles enough; but now and then one was as much as I
could put to any use. I had timber enough to have
built a fleet of ships; I had grapes enough to have made
wine, or have cured into raisins, to have loaded that
fleet when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was what was valuable.
I had enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what
was all the rest tome? if I killed more flesh tiian I
could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin; if I sowed
more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled: the tree*
that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground, I could
make no more use of them than for suel; and that I had
no occasion for, but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated
to me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of
this world are no sarther good to us, than they are for
our use; and that whatever we may heap up, indeed, to
give others, we enjoy as much as we can use, and no
more. The most covetous griping miser in the world
would have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he
had been in my case; for I possessed insinitely more than
I knew what to do with; I had no room for desire, ex-
cept it was of things which I had not, and they were but
trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as I
hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling: alas! there the nasty,
. sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of use for it;
ajid I often thought with myself, that I would havogiven
a
a handsul of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or a hand-
mill to grind my corn .. nay, I would have given it all
for six-penny-worth of turnep and carrot feed out os
England, or for a handsul of peas and beans, and a bot-
tle of ink. As it was, I had not the lead advantage by.
it, or benesit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and
grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in the wet
season; and if I had had the drawer foil of diamonds,
it had been the s.line cafe; and they had been of no value
to me, becaule of no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much easier
in itself than it was at sirst, and much easier to my mind
, as well as to my body. I frequently sat-down to my
meat with thanksulness, and admired the hand of Gods
providence, which had thus spread my table in the wil-
derness: I learned to look more upon the bright side of
my condition, and less upon the dark-side; and to consi-
der what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted: and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot
express them; and which I take notice of here, to put
those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy
comfortably what God hath given them, because they
see and covet something that he has not given them.
All our discontents about what we want appear to me
to spring from the want of thanksulness for what we
have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubt-
less would be so to any one that mould sall into such dis-
tress as mine was; and this was to compare my present
condition with what I at sirst expected it mould be;
nay, with what'it would certainly have been, if the good
Providence of God had not wondersully ordered theship
to be cast up nearer to the more, where I not only could,
come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to
the shore for my relies and comfort; without which I
had wanted tools to work, weapons for desence, or gun-
powder and mot for getting my food. ,
1 spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in repre-
Vot. I. N . senting
/enting to mysels in the most lively colours, how I mud
have acted, if I had got nothing out of the ship; I re^
flected that I could not have so much as got any food,
except sish and turtles; and that, as it was long besore
I found anv of them, I must have perished sirst: that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere
savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any
contrivance, I had noway to flea or open them, or part
the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up;
but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
claws, like a beast.
These reslections made me very sensible of the good-
ness of Providence, and very thanksul for my present
condition, with all its hardships and misfortunes: and
this part also I cannot but recommend to the reflection
of those who are apt in their misery to say' Is any
'assiicf ion like mine?' Let them consider how much
worse the cases of some people are, and what their case
might have been, if it had been the will of Provi-
dence.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to com-
fort my mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my
present condition with what I had deserved, and had
theresore reason to expect from the hand of Providence;
I had lived a deadsul life, persectly destitute of the
knowledge and fear of God; I had been well instructed
by sather and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavours to insuse a religious awe of
God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the
nature and end of my being required of me: but, alas!
salling early into the sea-saring life, which of all others
makes men the most destitute of the iear of God, though
his terrors are always besore them; I say, sal-
ling early into the sea-taring life, and into sea-saring
company, all that little sense of religion, which I had
entertained, was laughed out of me by my messmates }
by an hardened despising of dangers, and the views of
death which grew habitual to me; by mv long absence
from all manner of opportunities to converse with any
thing
firing but what was like myself, or to hear any thing oi
what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the
least fense of what I was, or was to be, that in the:
greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape from
Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master oi
the ship, my being planted so well in Brazil, my receiv-
ing the cargo srom England, and the like, I never once
had the words ' Thank God,' so much as on my mind,
or in my mouth: nor in the greatest distress had I so
much thought as to pray to him, nor so much as to say,
'Lord have mercy upon me!' No, not to mention the
name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme
it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed,on account of my
wicked and hardened past lise; and when I looked about
me, and considered what particular providences h^d at*
tended me, since my coming into this place, and that
God had dealt bountisully with me; had not only pu-
nished me less than my iniquity deserved, but had so
plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hopes,
that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
mercies in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God in the present dis-
position of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thanksulness of my condition; and that I, who was yet
a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not
the due punishment os my sins; that I enjoyed so many
mercies, which I had no reason to have expected in that
place; that I ought never more to repine at my condi-
tion, but to rejoice and give daily thanks, for that daily
bread, which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have
"brought: that I ought to consider I had been fed, even
by a miracle, as great as that of feeding Elijah by
ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; and that J
could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part
of tl;e world( where I could have been cast more to my
Ji % advantage;
advantage: a place where, as I had no society, which
was my asfliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous
beasts, no surious wolves or tygers, to threaten my life;
no venomous or poisonous creatures which I might
have fed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and de-
vour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so
> it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to
make it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my
fense of God's goodness to me, and care over me in this
condition, be my daily consolation; and after I made a
. just improvement of these things, Iwent-away, and was
no more dejected.
I had now been here so song, that many things which
I brought on shore for my help, were either quite gone,
or verv much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time,
all but a very little, which I ceked out with water a
little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce lest any ap-
pearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted
I made use of it to minute down the days of the month
on which any remarkable thing happened to me; and
sirst, by casting up times past, I remember, that there
was a strange concurrence of days, in the various provi-
dences which besel me, and which, if I had been iuper-
stitioufly inclined to observe days as satal or fortunate,
I might have had reason to have looked upon with a
great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day I broke away
from my sather and my friends, and ran away to Hull,
in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was
taken by the Sallee man of war, and made aflave.
The same day ofthe year that I escaped out of thewreck
«f that ship in Yarmouth-Roads,that same day of the year
afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
Thesnmeday ofthe year on which I was born, viz.
the z0th of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I was
cast on shore in this island: so that my wicked life, and
solitary life, both began on a day. The
The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of
my bread; I mean, the biscuit which I brought out of
the ship. This I had husbanded to the last degree, al-
lowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a
year; and yet I was quite without bread for a year, be-
fore I got any corn of my own; and great reason I had
to be thanksul that I had any at all, t'ne getting it being,
as has been already observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay: as to linen, I had
been without it some time, except some checked shirts
which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and
which I caresully preserved, because many times I could
wear no other cloathson but a shirt; and it was a great
help to me, that I had, among all the mens deaths of
the ship, almost: three dozen of shirts. There were also
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which were lest
behind, but they were too hot to wear; and though it is
true the weather was so violent hot that there was no
need os cloaths, yet I could not go quite naked; no,
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor
could bear the thoughts or it, though I was all alone.
One reason why I did not choose to go quite naked
was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked, as with some cloaths on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, wjth a shirt
on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling un-
der the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it: no
mere could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat
of the sun without a cap or an hat; the heat of the sun
beating with such violence as it does in that place, would
give me the head-ach presently, by darting so directly
en my head, that I could not bear it; whereas, is I put
en my hat, it would soon g» away.
From these reasons I was induced, accordingly, to
consider about putting the few rags I had, which I
called cloaths, into some order; I had worn out all the
waistcoats, and my business was now to try if I could
not make jackets out os the great watch-coats, and with
such other materials as I had. I set to work tayloriiig,
N 3 er
or rather, indeed botching: for I made most piteous
work of it. However, I contrived to make two or three
waistcoats, which 1 hoped would serve me a great while;
as for breeches, or drawers, I made a very poor esfort,
indeed.
I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the
creatures I killed, I mean four-sooted ones; and I hnd
hung them up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by
which means some of them were so dry and hard, that
they were of little use; but others were very serviceable.
The sirst thing I made of these was a great cap for my
head, with the hair on the outside to shoot osf the rain;
and this I persormed so well, that 1 afterwards made a
suit of cloaths wholly of those skins; that is to say, a
waistcoat and breeches open at the knees, and both
loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me cool,
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge,
that they were wretchedly made; for, if I was a bad
carpenter, 1 was a worse taylor; however, they were
such as I snade a very good shift with; and when I was
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat
and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella, of which, indeed, I was in great want.
I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are
very usetul in the great heats of that part of the world;
and I selt theheats every jot as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to
be much abroad, it was a most usesul thing to me, as well
for the rains as the heats. I took great pains at it, and
was a long while before I could make any thing likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I
spoiled two or three besore I made one to my mind;
but, at last, I made one that answered indisferently well;
the main dissiculty I found was to make it let down. I
could make it to spread; but if it did not let down too,
and draw in, it would not be portable for me any way,
buL just over my head, which would not do: however,
*t last, as I said, I made one to answer; I covered it-
wst!}
with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain
like a pent-house, and kept off thesun so effectually, that
1 could walk out in the hottest or the weather, with
greater advantage than I could besore in the coolest; and
when I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it
under my arm.
Thus <I lived very comfortably, my mind being en-
tirely composed by resigning myself to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his
providence; this made my life be:ter than sociable; for,
when I began to regret the want of conversation, I
would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, Imay ay, with
even my Maker, by ejaculations andQpetitions, was not
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in
the world.
I cannot say, that after this, for sive years, any extra-
ordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on in-
the same course, in the same state and place, just as be-
fore; the chies thing I was employed in, besides my
yearly labour of planting my bailey and rice, and cur-
ing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just
enough to have sussicient stock os the year's provisions
besorehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my
daily labour of going out with my gun, I had a labo-
rious talk to make me a canoe, which at last I sinished;
fo that by digging a canal to it six feet wide and four
feet deep, I brought it into the creek almost half 3 mile.
As for the sirst, it was by far too large, having made it
without considering besorehand, as I ought to have done,
how I mould be able to launch it; in consequence of
which, not being able to bring it to the water, or the
water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a
memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time. In-
deed, the next time, though I could not get a tree pro-
per for it, and was in a place where I could not get
the water to it, at any less distance than, as I have said,
of near half a mile; yet, as I saw it was practicable I
juver gave it over till I had accomplished it; and though
\ was
I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my
labour, in hopes of having a boat with which I might
proceed to sea.
However, though my little periagua was sinished,
yet the size of it was not at all aniwerable to the design
which I had in view when I made the sirst; I mean, of
venturing over to the terra fima, where it was above
forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my
boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I
thought no more of it; but, as I had a boat, my next
design was to make a tour round the island; for, as I
had been on the other side, in one place, crofling, as I
have already described it, over the land: so the discove-
ries I made in thaC journey made me very eager to lee
the other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, J
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with
discretion and consideration, I sitted up a little mast to
my beat, and made me a sail to it out os some ot the
pieces of the ship's sails, which by in store, and os which
I had a great quantity by me.
Having sitted my mast aud sail, and tried the boat, I
found she would sail very well: I then made little lock-
ers and boxes at either end of my boat, to put provisions,
necessaries, ammunition, &c. into, to be kept dry, ei-
ther from rain, or the spray of the sea; and I cut in
the inside of the boat, alittle, long, hollow place, where
I could by my gun, making a flap to hang down over it
to keep t dry.
I sixed my umbrella also in a step ?.t the stern, like a
mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the
sun off me like an awning; and thus I every now and
then took a small voyage upon the sea, but never went
far from the creek. At last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour, and accordingly victualled my ship for the voyage;
putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rathe r
call them) of barley-bread; an earthen pot sull of
parched rice, (a food of which I eat a great deal) a small
bottle
bottle of rum: half a goat, and powder with shot for
killing more: and two large watch coats, of those which,
as I mentioned besore, I had saved out of the seamen*
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to
cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I set out
on the voyage; and I found it much longer than I ex-
pected; for though the island itself was not very large,
yet, when I came to the east-side of it, I found a great
ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea,
some above water, some under it; and beyond this, a
stioal of sand, lying dry half a league more; so that
I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to dou-
ble that point.
When I sirst discovered them, I was going to give over
my enterprize, and come back again, not knowing how
sar it might oblige me to go out to sea; and, above all,
doubting how I mould get back again; so I came to an
anchor, for I had made me a kind of anchor with a piece
of broken grappling which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went
n more, climbing up an hill, which seemed to overlook
that point, where I saw the sull extent of it, and resolved
to venture.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 14.1
ceived a strong, and indeed a most surious current, which
ran to the east, and even came close to the point; and I
took the more notice of it, because I saw there might be
some danger, that when I came into it, I might be car-
ried out to sea by its strength, and not be able to make
the island again; and, indeed, had I not gotten sirst upon
this hill, I believe it would have been so; for there was
the same current on the other side of the island, only that
it set off at a sarther distance; and I saw there was a
Jtrong eddy under the shore; so I had notMng to do but
to get out of the sirst current, and I should presently be
w an eddy.
I lay here, however, two day s; because the wind blow-
ing
ing pretty fresh (E. atS. E. and. that being just contrary
to the said current) made a great breach of the sea upon
the point; so that it was not safe for me to keep too
close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far osf
iecause of the stream.
The third day, in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the lea was calm, and I ventured;
but no sooner did I reach the point, when even I was
not my boat's length from the shore, than I found my-
self in a great depth of water, and a current like a sluice
of a mill; it carried my boat along with it with such
violence, that all I could do could not keep her so much
as on the edge ot it; but I found it hurried me sarther
and sarther out from the eddy, which was on the lest-
hand. There was no wind stiring to help me, and all I
could do with my paddle signisied nothing; and now I
began to give myself over for test; for, as the current
was on both sides the, island, I knew in a few leagues
distance they must join again, and then 1 was irrecover-
ably gone; nor did I see any possibility os avoiding it;
so that I had no prospect besore me but of perishing; not
by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shole, as
big almost as I could lift, and had tolled it into the boat;
and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say,
one of my earthen pots; but what was all this to being
driven into the vast occean, where, to be sure, there wan
no shore, no main land or ifland, for a thousand league*
at least.
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of
<5od to make the most miserable condition that mankind
could be in, worse. Now I looked back upon my deso-
late solitary island, as the most pleasant place in the world,
and all the happiness my heart could wish for, was to
be there again. I stretched out my hands to it with
eager wishes: ' O happy deiart!' laid I, I shall never
* see thee more! O miserable creature!' said I, ' whi.
'ther am I going!' Then I reproached myself with
my unthanksul temper, and how I had repined at my
solitary
solitary condition; and now what would I give to be
on shore there again! Thus we never fee the true state
of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its con-
traries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by
the want of it: it is scarce possible to imagine the con-,
sternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide
ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and kept my
boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the
side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I
could; when, about noon, as the sun passed the meri-
dian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my sace,
s'pririging up from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart
a little, arid especially when, in about half an hour
more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale: by this time
I was gotten at a frightsul distance from the island;
and, had the'least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another way too; for I had no compass
on board, and should never have known how to have
steered towards the island if I had once lost sight of it;
but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get
up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to
the north, as much as possible, to get out of the cur-
rent.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat be-
gan to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness of tha
water, some alteration of the current was near; for
where the current was so strong, the water was foul; but
perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate;
and presently I discovered to the east, at about half a
mile, a breach of the sea upon lome rocks; these rocks
I found caused the current to part again; and as the
main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the N. E. so the other returned by the repulse
of the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again to the N. W. with a very ssiarp stream.
Those who know what it is to have a reprieve brought
tihqp
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves
just going to murder them, or who have been in such
like extremities, may guess what my present surprize
of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the
stream of this eddy; and the wind also freshening,
how gladly I spread my sail to it, running chear-
ftilly besore the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy-
under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back,
again, directly towards the island, but about two
leagues more towards the northward than the current
lay, which carried me away at sirst; so that when I
came near the island, I found myself open to the
northern shore of it, that is to lay, the other end of
the island, opposite to that which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league of
way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it'
was spent, and assisted me no sarther. However, be-
ing between the two great currents, viz,, that on the
fouth-side, which had hurried me away, and that on
the north, which lay about two leagues on the other side;
I say, between these two, in the west of the island, I
found the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind sair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making such
fresh way as I did besore.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the point
of the rocks which occasioned this distance stretching-
out, as is described besore, to the southward, and,
casting off the current more southerly, had, of course,
made another eddy to the north, and this I found very
strong, but not directly setting the way my course lav,
which was due west, but almost sull north. However,
having a fresii gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
north-west, and in about an hour came within about a
mile os the shore, where, it being smooth water, I foon
got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
4 God
Cod thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and resresh-
ing myself with such things as I had, I brought my
boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied
under some trees, and laid me down to steep, be-
ing quite spent with the labour and satigue of th«
vovage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew
too much the case to think of attempting it by the way
I went out; and what might be at the other side (I
mean, the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind
to run any more ventures; so, I only resolved in the
morning to make my way westward along the shore,
and to lee if there was no creek where I might lay up
my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I wanted
her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting
the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a
mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient harbour
for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a
little dock made on purpose for her; here I put in, and
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to
look about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been besore, when I travelled on foot to
that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat, but my
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I be-
gan to march: the way was comfortable enough, after
liich a voyage as I had been; and I reached my o>.l
bower in the evening, where I found ever}' thing stand-
ing as I lest it; for I always kept it in good order, be-
ing, as I said besore, my country house.
I got over the sence, and laid me down in the made
to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell afleep:
but judge if you can, you, that read my story, what a
surprize I must have been in, when I was awaked out of
nvyfleep by a voice callingmebymv nameleveral times,
* Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe-! pocr Robin Crusoe?
Vol. I. 0 'Where
'Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you"?
'Where have you been?*
I was so sast asleep at sirst, being satigued with row-
ing, or paddling, as it is called, the sirst part of the day,
and walking the latter part, that I did not awake tho-
roughly; and dozing between steeping and waking;,
thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me: but as
the voice continued to repeat, 'Robin Crusoe! Robin
Crusoe!' at last I began to awake more persectly, and
was at sirst dreadsully frighted, and started up in theut-
jnost consternation* but no sooner were my eyes open,
than I saw my Pol sitting on the top of the hedge, and
immediately knew that this was he that spoke to me;
for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk
to him, and teach him; and he had learned it so per-
fectly, that he would sit upon my singer, and lay his
bill close to my sace, and cry' Poor Robin Crusoe,
 where are you! where have you been! hbw came you
'here!' and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while
besore I could compose myself. First, I was amazed
how the creature got thither, and then how he should
just keep about the place, and no where else: but as I
was well satissied it could be nobody but honest Pol, I
cot it over; and holding out my hand, and calling him-
by his name, Pol, the sociable, came to me, and sat
upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talk-
ing to me, 'Poor Robin Crusoe;' and how did I come
here; and, where I had been; just as if he had been
overjoyed to fee me again.
I had now enough of rambling to sea, and continued
for some days in a very quiet state, reflecting on the dan-
ger I had been in: I would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island, but I knew not.
how it was practicable to get it about; as to the east-
fide of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well
enouph there was no venturing that way; my very
fcean would shrink, and my very blood run chill, to
think
think of it; and to the other side of the island, I did
not know how it might be there ; but supposing the cur-
rent ran with the same force against the shore at the
cast, as it passed by it on the other, I might run the
fame risque of being driven down the stream, and car-
ried by the island, as I had been besore of being car-
ried away from it; so, with these thoughts, I contented
myself to be without any boat, though it had been the
product of so many months labour to make it, and of
fo many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near a
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1+7
siippose; and my thoughts, being much composed as to
my condition, and sully comforted in resigning myself
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived
very happily in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself, in this time, in all the mecha-
nic exercises which my necessities put me upon apply-
ing myself to; and, I believe, could, upon occasion,
have made a very good carpenter, especially considering
how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected persection in
my earthen-ware, and contrived to make them with a
wheel, which I found insinitely easier and better; be-
cause I made things round and shapeable, which besore
were very aukward and rough in their form. But I
think I never was more vain of my own persormance,
or more joysul for any thing I found out, than my
being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was
a very ugly clumsy thing when done, and only burnt
red like other earthen-ware, yet, as it was hard and sirm,
and would draw the linoak, I was exceedingly comforted
with it: for I had been always used to smoak, and
there were pipes in the ship; but I forgot them at sirst,
not knowing there was tobacco in the island; and after-
wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not come
at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made
abundance of necessary haikets, <u well as my invention
O * suggested;
suggested; though they were not very handsome, yet
they were convenient for my laying things up in, or
fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a
goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a
basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take
out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
.enough for me, and bring them home in a basket, and
leave the rest behind me: also hrge deep baskets were
. my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out
as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it in great
baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated consider-:
ably: and this was an article which it was impossible
fpr me to supply; I therefore began seriously to consider
what I must do when I should have no more powder;
that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I
had, as I observed in the third year of my being here,
kept a young kid, and bred her up tame; I was in
hopes of getting an he-kid, but I could not by any
means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat;
and I could never sind in my heart to kill her, till she
died at last of mere age.
But being now in the eleventh year of my residence;
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I iet
myself to study some art to trap and share the goats, to
fee whether I could not catch some of them alive; and
par! icularly I wanted a slie-goat great with young.
For this purpose I made shares to hamper them; and
I believe they were more than once taken in them; but
my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and always
found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-sall; so I dug seve-
ral large pits in the earth, in places where I had ob-
served the geats used to feed, and over these pits I
placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and ieveral times I put ears of bar-
ley and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I could
easily perceive, that the goats had gone in and eaten
up
tip the corn. At length, I set three traps in one night,
and going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was very discou-
raging; however, I altered my traps; and, going one
morning to fee my traps, I found, in one ot them, a
large old he-goat; and, in one of the others, three kids, a
male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him;
he was so sierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that
is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which
was what I wanted; I could have killed him, but that
was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I
e'en let him out, and he ran away greatly frightened;
but I did not then know what I atterwaixls learned, that
liunger would tame a lion: if I had let him stay there
three or four days without food, and then have carried
him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he
would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they
are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are well used.
However, for the present, I let him go, knowing: no
better at that time; I then went to the three kids; and tak-
ing them one by one, I tied them with strings together,
and with some dissiculty brought them all home.
It was some time besore they would feed, but throw-
ing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they
began to be tame; and now I sound, that if I expected
to supply myself with goats-flesh, when I had no pow-
der or shot lest, breeding some up tame was my only
.way, when perhaps I might have them about my house
like a flock of sheep.
But then it occurred to me, that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild
when they grew up; and the only way for this was to
have some inclosed piece of ground well fenced, either
with hedge or pale, to keep them up so esfectually,
that those within might not break out, or those without
break in.
o 3 Ti>:»
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I saw there was an absolute ne:e0ity of doing it,
my sirst piece of work was to sind out a proper piece of
ground, viz. where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to
keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such inclosures will think I
had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon^s
place so very extensive, it being a plain open piece
of meadow-land, or savannah, (as our people call it in
the western colonies) which had two or three little drills
of fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I
fay, they will smile at my forecast, when I sViall tell
them I began my inclosing of this piece of ground in
fiich a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been
at least two miles about; nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles about,
I was like to have time enough to do it in; but I did
not consider, that my goats would be as wild in so much
compass, as if they had had the whole island; and I
should have so much room to chafe them in, that I
Jhould never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about
sifty yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I
stopped short, and resolved to incloie a piece of about
one hundred and sifty yards in length, and one hundred
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many
as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my
stock increased, I could add more ground to my in-
closure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to
work with courage; I was abcut three months hedging
in the sirst piece; and, till I had done it, I tethered
the three kids in the best part os it, and used them to
feed asnea'"me as possible, to make them samiliar; and
very often I would go and cany them some ears of bar-
ley, or an handsul of rice, and feed them out of my
hand; so that alter my inclosure was sinished, and I let

them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleat-
ing after me for an handsul of corn.
This answered my end, and in dbout a year and a
half, I had a flock of about twelve gcass, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three and forty, besides se-
veral I kiiled for food. Being thus successsul, I in-
closed sive several pieces of ground to feed them in,
with little pens to drive them into, to take them as I
had occasion; and gates out os one piece of ground into
another.
But this was not all; for now I not only hud goats
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk likewise;
which, indeed, was an article I had not thought of, and
which, when it came into my thoughts, was realiy an
agreeable surprize; for now I set up my dairy, and had
fometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And, as
nature, who gives supplies or sood to every creature,
dictates even naturally how to make use of it; so I,
that never milked a cow, much less a geat, or saw but-
"ROBINSON CRUSOK. 151
after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me
both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it
asterwards.
How mercisully can our great Creator treat hss crea-
tures, even in thole conditions in which they seemed to
be overwhelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten
the bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise
him for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here
spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing at
sirst but to perish for hunger!
It would have made a stoick smile, to have seen me
and my little samily sit down to dinner: there was n:y
majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island; I had
the lives of all iny subjects at absolute command; I
could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and
no rebess among all my subjects.
The:1, to fee how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants! Pol, as if he had been my
savourite, was the only creature that could talk to me;
"ROBINSON CRUSOK. 151
my dog, which was now grown very old and crazy,
and found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat al-
ways at my right-hand; and two cats, one on each side of
the table, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,
as a mark of special savour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought on
shore at sirst; for they were both dead, and had been
interred near my habitation by my own hands; and one
of them having multiplied by I know not what kind of
creature, these were two which I preserved tame, whereas
the rest ran wild into the woods, and became indeed
troublesome to me at last; for they would often come
into my house, and plunder me, till at last I was obliged
to flicot them; at length they left me with this atten-
dance, and in this plentisul manner I lived; neither
could I be said to want any thing but society, and of
that, in some time after this, I was like to have too
much.
'I was something impatient, as I have observed, to
have the use of my boat, though very loth to run any
more hazard: and theresore, sometimes, I sat contriv-
ing ways to get her about the island, and at other times
I sat myself down contented enough without her. But
I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to
the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my
last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the more lay,
and how the current set, that I might see what I had to
do: this inclination increased upon me every day, and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land; and fol-
lowing the edge of the shore, I did so; but had any one
in England been to meet such a man as I was, it must
either have frighted him, or raised a great deal of
laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at my-
self, I could not but smile at the notion of my travel-
ing through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in
such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my sigure,
as follows
I had a great high, shapelese cap, made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep
the
the sun from me, as to shoot the rain osf from running*
into my neck; nothing being; so hurtsul in these cli-
mates as the rain upon the flesh under the cloaths.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of
open-kneed breeches of the same: the breeches were
made of the skin of an old lie goat, whose hair hung
down such a length on each side, that, like Pantaloon's
it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and
slioes I had none; but I had made me a pair of some-
thing, I scarce knew what to call them, like buskins,
to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat-
terdashes, but of a most barbarous shape: as indeed
were all the rest of my cloaths.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead of
buckles, and, in a kind of a frog on either siJe of this, in-
stead of a sword and dagger, hung a little law and an
hatchet, one on one side, and one on the other: I had
another belt, not so broad, and sastened in the same
manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end
of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made
ot goat's skin; in one ot which hung my powder, in
the other my shot: at my back I carried my basket,
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great,
clumsy, ugly goat-skin umbrella, but which, after all,
was the moI!: necessary thing I had about me, next to
my gun: as for my sace, the colour of it was really not
so Mulatto-like, as one might expect from a man not
at all caresul of it, and living within nine or ten de-
grees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to
grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long: but as
I had heth scissars and razor.; sussicieni, I had cut it
pretty short, except what grew on my upper-lip, which
I had trimmed intu a large pair of Mahometan whis-
kers, such as I had observed worn by some Turks,
whom I saw at Sallee; for the Mcors did not wear such
though the Turks did: of these musiachios, or whiskers,
J. wsll not lay they were long enough to hang my hat
i . - upon
upon them; but they were of length and shape monffrom
enough, and such as in England would have passed for
frightsul.
But all this is by the bye: for as to my sigure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner of
consequence; so I say no more to that part. In this kind
of sigure I went my new journey, and was out sive or
six days. I travelled sirst along the sea shore, directly
to the place where 1 sirst brought my boat to an anchor
to get up upon the rocks; and, having no boat now to
take care ot, I went over the land a nearer way, to the
same height that I was upon besore; when, looking for-
ward to the point of the rock which lay out, and which
I was to double with my boat, I was surprized to sind
the sea all smooth and quiet; no ripling, no motion, no
current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in endeavouring to discover if
nothing from the lets of the tide had occasioned it: but
I was icon convinced how it was, viz. that the tide of
ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current
of waters from some great river on the shore, must be
the occasion of this current; and that according as the
wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the north
this current came near, or went sarther from the shore;
for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I
plainly saw the current again as besore, only that it
ran farther osf, being near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my cafe, it set close upon the more, and
hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at another
time it would not have done.
This observation convinced me 1 had nothing to do
but to obsei ve the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and I
might very easily bring my boat about the island: but
when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
such a terror upon my spirits, at the remembrance of
the danger I had been in, that X could not think of it
again with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took
*p another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or
rather make me another periagua, or canoe; and so
have one tor one side of the island,. and one for the
other.
You are to understand, that I now had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little for-
tisication or tent, with the wall about it, under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I
had enlarged into several apartments, one within another.
One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had
a door out beyond my wall or fortisication, that is to
fay, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was
rilled up with the largest earthern pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fourteen or sisteen great
baskets, which would hold sive or six bushels each, where
I laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn;
fome in the ear, cut osf short from the straw, and the
other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes or
piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by thin
time become so large, and spread so very much, that
there was not the least appearance, to any one's view,
of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling, but a little sarther within the land,
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-
ground; which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and
which regularly yielded me their harvest in its season ,
and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more
land adjoining, the soil of which was equally well cal- ,
culated sor cultivation.
Besides this, there was my country-seat, I had now a
tolerable plantation also; for sirst, I had riy littlebowes
as I called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I
kept the hedge which circled it in constantly sitted up
to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the
inside; I kept the trees, which at sirst were no more
than my stakes, but were now grown very sirm and
tall, always so cut, that they might spread, jjrow thick,
z and
and make the more agreeable shade, which they did ef-
fectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my
tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread ov^-r
poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I made me
a squab or couch, with the steins of the creatures I had
killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid
on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I
had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me; and
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my
chies seat, I took up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cat-
tle; that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an
inconceivable deal of pains to fence and inclose this
ground, I was so uneasy to see it not kept entire, lest
the goats shouid break through, that I never lest ctf,
till with inssinite labour I had struck the outside of the
hedge so sull of small stakes, and so near to one ano-
ther, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there
was scarce room to put a hand through between them;
which, asterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all
did in the next rainy season, made the inclosure strong,
like a wall; indeed, stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap-
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I con-
sidered the keeping up a breed os tame creatures thus
at my hand, would be a living magazine of stem, milk,
butter, and cheese, for me, as long as I lived in the
place, is'it were to be forty years; and that keeping
them in my reach, depended entirely upon my persect-
ing my inclosures to such a degree, that I might be sure
of keeping them together; which by this method, in-
deed, I so esfectually secured, that when these littie
stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick
I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I
principally depended on for my winter store of raisins,
and which I never failed to preserve very care full v, as
'tke
cookk's aam or select jstrrjri.a.

the test and nuit agreeable dainty of my whole diet;
and irdeed they were not agreeable only, but physical,
wholesome, nourishing, and resreshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally staid and lay here in my way thither; for I
II led frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order; some-
times I went out in her to divert myself, but no more
hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a
stone's cast or two slum the shore, I was so apprehen-
sive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the
currents or winds, or any other accident. But now I
come to a new scene of my life.
It happened one day, about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprized with the print of a
man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen in the sand: I stood like one thunderstruck,
or as if I had seen an apparition; I listened, I looked
round me; I could hear nothing, nor see any thing; I
went up to a rising ground to look sarther; I went
up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all
ojie, I could fee no other impression but that one. I
went to it again to see if there were any more, and to
observe if it might not be my sancy; but there was no
room for that, tor there was exactly the very print of a
soot, tots, heel, and every part of a foot; how it came
thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine.
But, aster innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man
persectly contused and distracted, I came home to
.my iortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I
went on, but terrisied to the last degree, looking be-
hnid me at every two or three ste;:s, mistaking every
bush or tree, and sancying every stump at a distance to
he a man; nor is it possible to describe how many vari-
ous shapes an affrighted imagination represented things
to me ill; how many wild ideas were formed every mo-
ll, ent in my iancy, and what strange unaccountable
tl oughts'cae into my mind by tl;e wav.
Vol. I. P 'Whea (
When I came to my castle, for so I think. I called it
ever aster this, I fled into it like one pursued; whether
I went over by the ladder, as sirst contrived, or went
in at the hole in the rock, which I called a door, I can-
rot remember; for never frighted hare fled to cover, or
fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this
retreat.
I had no sleep that night; the sarther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions
were; which is something contrary to the nature of
such things, and especially to the usual practice of all
creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with my
own frightsul ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing
but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was
now a great way off it. Sometimes I sancied it must
be the devil; and reason joined in with me upon this sup-
position: for how should any other thing in human
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel that
brought them? What marks were there of any other
footsteps? And how was it possible a man mould come
there? But then to think that Satan should take human
shape upon him in such a place, where there could he
bo manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too,
(for he could not be sure I should see it;) this was an
amazement the other way. I considered that the devil
might have found out abundance of other ways to have
terrissied me, than this of the single print of a foot;
that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he
would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a
place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should
ever see it or not; and in the sand too, which the sirst
surge os the lea upon an high wind would have desaced
entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing
itself, and with all notions we usually entertain of the,
subtlety of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil: and
I presently concluded then, that it muit be some more
dangerous
dangerous creature, viz. that it must be some of the
savages of the main land ovtr-against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their rar.oes; and, either driven
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the
island; and had been en siiore, but were gone away
again to sea, h«ing as loth, perhaps, to have staid in
this desolate island, as I would have been to have had
them.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155
I was very thanksul in my thought, that I was so happy
as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did
not lee my boat, by which they would hare concluded,
that some inhabitants had been in the place, and, per-
haps, have searched sarther scr me. Then terrible
thoughts racked my imaginations about their having
found mv boat, anc! that there were people here; and
that if so, I should certainly have them come again in
greater numbers, and devour me; that if it mould hap-
yen so that they should not sind me, yet they would
sind my inclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away all
my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for
mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all.
that former considence in God, which was founded
.upon such wondersul experience, as I had met with
os his goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto could r.ot preserve by his power
the provision which he had made sor me by his good-
ness. I reproached myself for my folly in not sowing
more cern one year than would jiist serve me till the
next season, as if no accident could intervene to pre-
vent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground;
and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for
the suture to have two or three years corn besore-hand,
so that whatever might come, I might not perish for
want of bread.
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the
life of man! and by what secret disfering springs are the
affections hurried about, as disfering circumstances pre-
Pa sent!
sent! To-day we love what to-morrow we Ii^te; to-
day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire
what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the appre-
hensions of. This was exemplisied in me at this time
in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whole only
affliction was, that I seemed banished from human so-
ciety, that I was alone circumscribed by the boundless
ocean, cut osf from mankind, and condemned to what I
call a lilent life: that I was as one whom Heaven thought
not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to ap-
yiear among the rest of his creatures; that to have seen
one of my own species would have seemed to me a rais-
ing me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,
could bestow; I say, that I mould now tremble at the
Very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to
sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appear-
ance of a waifs having set his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state os human life; and it af-
forded me a great many curious speculations afterwards,
when I had a little recovered my sirst surprize; I consi-
dered that this was the station of life the insinitely wile
and good providence of God had determined for me;
that as I could not foresee what the ends of Divine Wis-
dom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his so-
vereignty,who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted
right by creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely
as he thought sit; and who, as I was a creature who had
osfended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn
me to what punishment he thought sit; and that it was
my part to submit to bear his indignation, because I
had sinned against him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only righte-
ous, but omnipotent, as he had thought sit thus to pu-
nish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; tiiat if
he did not think sit to do it, it was my unquestioned,
duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will;
and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in
him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and
directions of his daily providence. These
These thoughts took me up many hours, davs, nay,
I may soy, weeks and months; and one particular esiect
of my cogitations on this occasion, I cannot omit; viz.
one morning early, lying in my bed, and silled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearance os savages,
I found it discomposed me very much: upon which
those words of the Scripture came into my thoughts
"Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
"thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising chearsully out of my bed, my heart
was not only comforted, but I was guided and encou-
raged to pray earnesHy to God for deliveran:e. When
I had done praying, I took up my bible, and opening it
to read, the sirst words that presented themselves to me
were;' Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
"he shail strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the
"Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort this
gave me; and, in return, I thankfully laid down
the book, and was no more sad; at least, not en
that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that
all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that
this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I
came on fliore from my boat. This cheared me up a
little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a
delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot;
and why might net I come that way from the boat, as
well as I w:-.s going that way to the boat? Again, I
considered also, that I could by no means tell sor cer-
tain where I had trod, cm ! where I had not; and that
if at lr-st this was only the print os my own foot, I had
played the part of thoie fools, who strive to make stories
of spares and apparitions, and then are themselves
frighted at them more than any body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for three
days and nights, so that I began to seem siiort of pro-
vssion; for I had lsttle or nothing within doors, but
p 3 some
some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion: and the poor creatures were in great
pain and inconvenience tor want of it; and indeed it al-
mostspoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself theresore with the belies that this
was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, (and
so I might be truly said to start at my own shadow) I
began to go abroad again, and went to my country-
house to milk my flock; but to lee with what fear I
went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I
was readv, every now and then, to lay down my basket
and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that
J had been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed
I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three days, and
having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to
think there was really nothing in it but my own imagi-
nation; but I could not periuade myself sully of this,
till I should go down to the shore again, and see this
print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and fee if
there was any similitude or sitness, that I might be as-
sured it was my own foot: but when I came to the place
sirst, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where I here-
abouts. Secondly, when I came to measure the mark
with my own foot, I found my foot' not so large by a
great deal. Both these things silled my head with new
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the
highest degree; so that I shook with cold, like one in an
ague, and went home again, silled with the belies, that
some man or men had been on more there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprized
betore I was aware; and what course to take for my se-
curity I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when posses-
sed with fear! It deprives them of the use of those
means which reason offers for their relies. The sirst
thing
thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my in-
closures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods,
that the enemy might not sind them, and then frequent the
island in prospect of the same or the like booty; then
to the sirrple thing of digging up my two corn-sields,
that they might not sind such a grain there, and (till be
prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish my
bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of
my habitation, and he prompted to look sarther, in or-
der to sind out the persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the siist night's cogitation,
after I was come home again, while the apprehensions
.which had so over-run my mind were fresh upon me,
and mv head was sull of vapours, as above. Thus,
fear of dr.nger is ten thousand times more terrifying than
danger itself when apparent to the eyes; and we sind the
burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the evil
which we are anxious about; but, which was worse
than all this, I had not ttat relies in this trouble for
the resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have,
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who comphined not only
that the Philistines were upon him, but that God had
forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways to com,-
pose my mind, by crying to God in mv distress, and
resting upon his providence, as I had done besore, for my
desence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had,
at least, been more chearsnlly supported under this new
surprize, and perhaps carried through it with more
resolution.
This consusion of my thoughts kept me awake all
night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and having, by
the employment of my nrnd, been, as it were, tired, and
my spirits .exhausted, I slept very soundly, and awaked
rmicn better composed than I had ever been besore: and
now I b^gan to think sedately; and, upon the utmost de-
bate with myself, I concluded, that this island, which
was so exceeding pleasant, sruitsul, and no sarther from
the masn land than as I had sci-n, was not lo entirely
abandoned as-I might imagine; that, although there
were
were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that
there might sometimes come boats osf srom the shore:
who, either with design, or perhaps never hut when they
were driven by cross winds, might come to this place.
That I had lived hire sisteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow cr sigure os any people besore;
and that if at any time they should be driven here, it was
probable they went awiy again as soon as they could,
seeing they had never thought sit to six there upon any
occasion to this time.
That the molt I could suggest danger from was, any
casual landingos straggling people srom the main; who,
as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their will; so that they made no stay but went
off again with all possible speed, seldom remaining one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the
tides and day-light back again; and that theresore I had
nothing to do but to consider of some sase retreat, incale
I should see any savages land upon the spot.
Now I began to repent, that I had dug my cave so
large, as to bring adoor through again, which door, as I
said, came out beyond where my fortisication joined to
the rock. Upon maturely considering this, theresore, I
resolved to draw me a second fortisication, in the same
manner of a semi-circle, at a distance from my wall, just
where I had planted a double row of trees, about twelve
years besore, of which I made mention. These trees
having been planted so thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they might
be thicker and stronger, and my wail soon sinished.
I had ndw a double wall, and my cuter wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every
thing I could think of to make it strong; having in it
seven holes, each large enough to put my arm through.
In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten
feet, continually bringing earth cut of my cave, and lay-
ing it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the r.:us-
quets, of which I took notice, that I got seven on shore
out
<mt of the ship; these, I lay, I planted like my cannon,
and sitted them into frames that held them like a carriage,
fo that I could sire all the seven guns in two minutes
time. This wall I was many a weary month in sinishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great distance every way, as sull with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165
"believe I might set m near twenty thousand, leaving a
pretty large lpace between them and my wall, that I
might have room to see an enemy, and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap-
proach my outer wall.
Thus, in two years I had a thick grove; and in sive
or six years a wood besore my dwelling, grown so mon-
strous thick and strong, that it was indeed persectly im-
passable; and no man would ever imagine there was any
thing behind it, much less an habitation. As for the
way I proposed myself to go in and out, (for I lest no
avenue) it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in, and lest room
to place another ladder upon that; so when the two lad-
ders were taken down, no man living could come down
without injuring himself; and if they had come down,
they were still on the out-side of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my preservation; and it will be seen at length,
they were not altogether without just reason; though I
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165
suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me
fer my little herd of goats; they were not only a pre-
fent supply to me upon every occasion, and began to be
sussicient to me, without the expence of powder and shot,
but also abated the satigue of my hunting after the wild
ones; and I was unwilling to lose the advantage of them,
Mid to have them all to nurse up again.
To
To this purpose, aster long consideration, I could
think of but two ways to preserve them; one was, to
sind another convenient place to dig a cave under-ground,
and to drive them into it every night; and the other
was, to inclose two or three little bits of land, remote
from one another, and as much concealed as I could,
where I night keep about half a dozen young goats
in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the
flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with
li'tle trouble an 1 time; and this, though it would require
a great deal of time and labour, I thought was the most
rational design.
Accordingly, I spent some time to sind out the most
retired parts ot the island; and pitched upon one, which
was as private indeed as my heart could wish; for it
was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost
lost myself once besore, endeavouring to come back that
way from the eastern part ot the island. Here I found
a clenr piece of land near three acres, so surrounded with
woods, that it was almost an inclosure by nature; at
least, it si id not want near so much labour to make it so,
as the ether pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of ground,
and in less than a month, I had so fenced it round, that
my flock or herd, call it which you please, which were
riot so wild now as at sirst they might be supposed to be,
were well enough secured in it. So, without any sar-
ther delay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to
this piece; and when they were there, I continued
to persect the fence, till I had made it as secure
as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and
it took me up more time by a great deal.
I was at the expence of all this labour from my appre-
hensions on account of the print of a man's foot which I
had leen; for, as yet I never saw any human creature
come near the island. I had now livLtltwo years under
theie diiagreeabie apprehensions, which, indeed, made
my life much less comfortable than it was besore; ac
may
may be imagined, by any who know what it is to live in
the constant share of the fear of man; and this I must
obierve with gries too, that the discomposure os my
mind had too greatimpresssions also upon the religious
part of my thoughts, for the dread and terror of salling
into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so much
Upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due
temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was
accustomed to do. I rather pvayed to God as under
great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with
danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered
and devoured besore morning; and I must testify from
my experience, that a temper of peace, thanksulness,
love, and aftection, is much tile more proper frame for
prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that
Under the dread of milchies impending, a man is no
more sit for a comforting persormance of the duty os
praying to Gcd, than he is tor repentance on a sick-bed;
for these discomposures affect the mind as the others do
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must ne-
cessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and
much greater; praying to God being pioperly an act of
the mind, not of the body.
But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place to make such another
deposit; when wandering more to the west point of the
island than I had ever dene yet, and looking out to, sea,
I thought I saw a boat upen the sea, at a great distance.
I had sound a perspective-glass or two, in one ol the sea-
men's chests, which I saved out of our ship; but I had it
not about me, and this was so remote, that I could not
tell what to make of it, though I looked,at it till my
eyes were not able to look any longer: whether it was
a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I descended from
the hill, I could see no more or it, so I gave it over;
only resolved to go no more without a perspective-glass
in my pocket.
When
When I was come down the hill to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been besore, I was foon
convinced, that seeing the print of a man's foot was
not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined;
and, but that it was a special providence that I was cast
upon the side of the island, where the savages never came,
I mould easily have known, that nothing was more fre-
quent than for the canoes from the main, when they hap-
pened to be a little too sar out at sea, to shoot over to that
iide of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often
met, and fought in their canoes, the victors, having
taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this
shore, where, according to their dreadsul customs, being
all canibals, they would kill and eat them. Of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, being
the S. W. point of the island, I was persectly con-
founded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express
the horror of my mind, at seeing the shorc spread with,
ikulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;
and, particularly, I observed a place where there had
been a sire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a
cock-pit, where it is to be supposed the savage wretches
had sat down to their inhuman feaitings upon the bodies
of their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to mylelf
from it fora long while; all my apprehensions were bu-
ried in the thoughts of riich a pitch of inhuman brutality,
and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature;
which, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so
near a view of besore; in short, I turned away my
sace from the horrid spectacle; I grew sick, aud wa*
just at the point of sainting, when nature discharged the
disorder from my stomach; and, having vomited with
an uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could
not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the
hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on to-
wards my own habitation.
When
When I came a little out of that part of the island, I
Itood ssill some time amazed; and then recovering my-
self, I looked up with the utmost-asfection of my soul,
and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks,
that had cast my sirst lot in a part of the world, where
I was distinguished from siich dreadsul creatures as
these; and that though I had esteemed my present con-
dition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts
in it, that I had still more to give thanks for, than to
complain of; and this above all, that I had, even in this
miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself, and the hope of His blessising, which wj.s
a felicity more than sussiciently equivalent to all the
misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thanksulness I went home to my cas-
tle, and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of
my circumstances, than ever I was before; for I ob-
served, that these wretches never came to this island in
search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not
wanting, or not expecting any thing here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody part of
it, without sinding any thing to their purpose. I knew
I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never
saw the least footsteps of a human creature there besore;
and might be here eighteen more as entirely concealed
as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them,
which I had no manner of occasion to do, it being my
only business to keep myself en:irely concealed where
I was, unless I found a better fort of creatures than
canibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches. I have been speaking of, and of the inhu-
man custom of their devouring and eating one another
up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close
within my own circle for almost two years after this.
When I say my own circle, I mean by it, my three plan-
tations; viz. my castle, my country-seat, which I called
my bower, and my inclosure inthe woods; nor did I
look after this for any other use, than as an inclosure for
Vol. I. Q^ my
my goa;s; for the aversion which nature gave me to
these horrid wretches was such, that I was as fearful of
seeing them, as of ieeing the devil himself; nor did I so
much as go to look after my boat in all this time, but
be^an rather to consider of making me another; for I
could not think of ever making any more attempts to
bring the other boat round the island, lest I mould meet
with some of thole creatures at sea, in which, if I hap-
pened to sall into their hands, I knew what would have
been my lot.
Time, however, and the satissaction I had, that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people,
foon wore off my uneasiness about them; and I began
to live just in the same composed manner as besore; only
with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept
my eyes more about me than I did besore, lest I should
happen to be seen by any of them; and, particularly, I
was more cautious ot siring my gun, lest any of them
on the island should happen to hear it; and it was there-
fore a very good providence to me, that I had surnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I had no need
to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them;
and if I did catch any more of them after this, it was
by traps andihares, as I had done besore; so that for
two years after this, I believe, I did not sire my gun off
once, theugh I never went out without it; and, which
wss more, as I had laved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or, at least, two cf
them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise
surnished op one of the great cutlafles that I had cut of
the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also; so that 1
was now a most formidable sellow to look at, when I
went abroad, if you add to the former description of
myself, the particular of two pistols and.a great bread
sword hanging at my side in a bell", but without a
scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm ledate way of living; all these things
lending
tending to mew me more and more how sar my condi-
tion was from being miserable, compared to some others;
nay, to many other particulars of life, which it might
have pleased God to have made my lot. It piit me
upon reflecting, how little repining there would be
among mankind, at any condition of life, if people
would rather compare their condition with those that
are worse, in order to be thanksul, than be always com-
paring them with those which are better, to assist their
murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, 1 thought that the
frights I had been in about these savage wretches, and
the concern I felt for my own preseivation, had taken
off the edge of my invention for my own convenience,
and I had dropt a gooa design, which I had once, bent
lYiy thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I could not
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer: this was really a whimsical
thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity
of it; for I presently saw there would be the want of se-
veral things necessary for making my beer, that it would
be impossible for me to supply; as sirst, casks to pre-
ferve it in, which was a thing that I could never accom-
plish, though I spent not only many days, but weeks,
ray, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In
the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeail
to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil;
and yet, had not all' these things intervened, 1 mean the
srights and terrors I was in about the savages, I had
undertaken it, and perhaps, brought it to pals too;
for I seldom gave any thing ever without accomplish-
ing it, when once I had it in my mind to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
bloody entertainment; and, is possible, save the victim
they mould bring hither to destroy. It would take up
a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be,
Qj, to
to set down all the contrivances I invented for destroy-
ing these creatures, or at least frightening them, so as
to prevent their coming hither any more: but all was
abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, un-
less I was to be there to do it myself; and what could
one man do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or
their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as
true to a mark as I could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their sire, and put in siveor six pounds of
17* LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
consequently communicate and blow up all that was near
it: but, as in the sirst place I mould be very loth to waste
so much powder upon them, my store being now within
the quantity of a barrel; so neither could I be sure of
its going eff at any certain time, when it might sur-
prize them; and, at best, that it would do little more
than just blow the sire about their ears, and fright them,
but not sussicient to make them forsake the place; so I
laid it aside; and then proposed, that I would six
myself in ambush, in some convenient place, with my
three guns all double loaded, and, in the middle of their
bloodv ceremony, let fly at them, when I should be
sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
lhot; and then salling in upon them with my three pil-
tols, and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there
were twenty, I should kill them all: this sancy pleased
my thoughts for some weeks; and I was so sull of it,
that I osten dreamed of it; and sometimes, that I was
just going to let fly at them in my sleep.
I went so sar with it in my imagination, that I em-
ployed mylelf several days, to sind cut proper places to
put myself in ambuscade, to watch sor them; and I
went srequently to the place itself, which was now
grown more samiliar to me; and elpecially while mv
mind was thus silled with thoughts of revenge, and ef
a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword,
17* LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
at
at the signals of the barbarous wn.tcb.es devouring one
another, abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill, where I was satissied I might securely wait till I
saw any of the boats coming; and might then, even
besore they would be ready to come on fliore, convey
myself unieen into the thickets of trees, in one oi which
there was an hollow large enough to conceal me entirely;
and where I might sit and observe all their bloody do-
ings, and take my sull aim at their heads, when they
were so close together as that it would be next to im-
possible that I should miss my shoot, or that I could sail
wounding three or four of them at the sirst shoot.
In this place, then, I resolved to six my design; and
accordingly I prepared two musquets, and my ordinary
fowling-piece. The two musquets I loaded with a
brace of slugs each, and four or sive smaller bullets, about
the size of pistol-bullets; and the fowling-piece I lea led
with near an handful of swan-shot, of the largest size;
I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each 5
and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and,
in my imagination, put it in practice, I continually
made my tour every morning up to the top of the hill,
which was from my calile, as I called it, about three
miles, or more, to fee if I could observe any boats upon
the lea, coming near the island, or standing over to-
wards it; but I began to be tired of this hard duty,
after I had for two or three months constantlv kept my
watch; but came always back without any discovery,
there having not, in all that time, been the least ap-
pearance, not only on or near the shore, but not on the
whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way.
As long as I kept up my da;ly tour to the hill, to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour os my de-
sign, aud my lbuits seemed to be all the tsme sn a fuit-
Q""3 - able

twenty or thirty naked savages, for an osfence which I
had not at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts,
any sarther than my passions were at sirst sired by the
horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the peo-
ple of that country, who, it seems, had been susfered
by Providence, in His wife disposition ot the world, to
have ho other guide than that of their own abominable
and vitiated passions; and, consequently, were lest, and
perhaps had been sor some ages, to act liich horrid
tiiings, and receive such dreadtul customs, as nothing
but nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actu-
ated by hellish degeneracy, could have run them into:
but now, when, as I have said, I began to be weaiy
of the fruitless excursions which I had made so long,
and so sar, every morning, in vain; so my opinion of
the action itself began to alter; and, with cooler
and calmer thoughts, I considered what it was I was go-
ing to engage hl; what authority or call I had, to pre-
tend to be judge and executioner upon these men as cri-
minals, whom Heavei had thought sit, for so many
ages, to luffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it
were, the executioners of His judgments upen one ano-
ther; also hew sar these people were offenders against
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood, which they had shed promiscuously one upon
another. I debated this very olten with mylelf thus
'How do l know what God himself judges in this par-
 ticular ca!e? It is certain these people do not commit
'this as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
 reproving, or their light reproaching them. They
* do not know it to be an osfence, and then commit it
* in desiance of Divine Justice, as we do in almost all
'the sins we commit. They think it no more a crime
'to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an
'ox; nor to eat human flcsh, than we do to eat mut-
'ton.'
When I had considered this a little, it followed ne-
cessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong; that these
people
yeople were net murderers in the fense that I had before
condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those
Christians were murderers, who often put to death the
prisoners taken in battle, or mere srequently, upon
many occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword,
without giving quarter, though they threw down their
arras and submitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was nothing tome : these people had done
me no injury; that if they attempted to injure me, or I
saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to sall
upon them, something might be iaid fork; but that I
was yet out of their power, and they had really no know-
ledge of n:e, and coniequently no design upon me; and
theresore it cculd not be just tor me to sall upon them:
that this would justisy the conduct of the Spaniards, in
all their barbrriiies practised in America, where they
destroyed millions of these people; who, however they
were idolaters and barbarians, anil had several bloody
and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrissicing
human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spa-
niards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them
out os the country is ipoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and detestation, even bv the Spaniaids themselves,
at this time, and by ail ether Christian nations of Eu-
rope, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece
of cruelty, unjustisiable either to God or man; and
foch as sor which the very name of a Spaniard is rec-
koned to be frighttul and terrible to all people of huma-
nity, o^ os Christian compassion, as is the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent lor the product of a
tace of men, who were without principles of tender-
ness, or the common bowels oi pity to the miserable,
which is reckoned to be a mark ot a generous temper in
the mind.
These consideratievs really put me to a pause, and to
a kmti of sull stop; and I began by little and little to
he off of my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong
measures
measures in my resolutions to attack the savages; that
it was not my business to meddle with them, unless
they sirst attacked me, and this it was my business, if
possible, to prevent; but that, if I were dil'covered and
attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirelv
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill
every one that not only should be on shore at that time,
but should ever come on shore afterwards; if but one
of them escaped to tell their country-people what had
happened, they would come over again by thousands to
revenge the death of their fellows; and I mould only
bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at pre-
sent I had no manner of occasion tor. ,
Upon the whole, I concluded, that, neither in prin-
ciples nor in policy, I ought one way or other to con-
cern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all
possible means, to conceal mysels from them, and not
to leave the least signaj to them to guess by, that there
were anv living creatures upon the island; I mean, of
human shape.
Religion joined in with these thoughts, and I was con-
vinced now, many ways, that I was persectly out of
my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes for
the destruction of innocent creatures; I mean, innocent
as to me; as to the crimes they were guilty of towards
one another, I had nothing to do with them; there
were national punishments to make a just retribution for
national osfences; and to bring public judgments upon,
thole who offend in a public manner, by such ways as
best please God.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was
a orcater satissaction io me, than that I had not been
176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
to believe would have been no less a sin, than that of
wilsul murder, if I had committed-it; and I gave moll
humble thanks on my knees ta God, who had thiu de-
176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
grant
grant me the protection os his providence, that I might
not sall into the hands of barbarians; or that I might
not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more
clear call from Heaven to do it, in desence of my
own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year; and
fo sar was I from desiring an occasion for salling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went
up the hill to fee whether there were any of them in
sight, or to know whether any of them had been on more
there or not; that I might not be tempted to renew any
of my contrivances against them, or be provoked by any
advantage which might present itsels, to sall upon them:
only this I did; I went and removed my boat, which I
had on the other side the island, and cairied it down to
the east-end of the whole island, where I ran it into a
little cove which I found under some high locks, and
. where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages
durst not, at least would not, come with their boats,
upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away every thing I had lest
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither; viz. a mast and sail, which I had made
for her, and a thing like an anchor, but, indeed, which
could not be called either anchor or grappling; however,
it was the best I could make of its kind. All these I
removed, that there might not be the least shadow of
3ny discovery, or appearance of boat, or of any
habitation, upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employment,viz. to milk my she-goats,
and manage my little flock in the wood; which being
on the other part of the island, was quite out of danger:
for certain it is, that thele savage people, who lome-
times haunted this island, never came with thoughts of
finding any thing here, and consequently never wan-
dered off srom the coast;-and I doubt not, but they
jnight have been several times on shore, after my ap-
prehensions
prehensions ot them had made me cautious, as well as
besore; and, indeed, I looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts or what my condition would have
been, is I had chopped upon them, and been discovered ,
besore that, when naked and unarmed, except with one.
gun, and that loaded often only with small shot. I
walked every where, peeping about the island, to see
what I could get: what a surprize should I have been
in, if when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I
had instead of that, seen sifteen or twenty savages, and
found them pursuing me; and, by the swiftness of their
running, no possibility of my escaping them!
The thoughts of this sometimes iunk my very foul
178 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
cculd not soon recover it; to think wh3t I should have
done, and that I not only should have been able to resist
them, but even should not have had presence of mind
enough to do what I might have done; much less, what
now, after so much consideration and preparation, I
might be able to do. Indeed, after seriously thinking
of these things, I frequently became melancholy, and
foretimes it would last a great while; but at length,
on due reflection, I changed my melancholy into thank-
fviness to that Providence who had delivered me from
fo many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those
mischiess which I could no way have been the agent in
delivering myself from; because I had not the least no-
tion of any such thing depending, or the least supposi-
tion of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation, which often had come
to my thoughts at former times, when sirst I began to fee
the mercisul dispositions of heaven in the darge.s we meet
with in this life; how wondersully we are delivered when
we know nothing of it: that when we are in a quandary,
(as we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this
way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this wav,
when we intended to go that; nay, when fense, our
own inclination, and perhaps business has called to go
tlie other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind,
from
 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179
this way; and it shail afterwards appear, that had we
gone that way which we would have gone, and even to
our imagination ought to have gone, we should have
been ruined and lost; upon these, and many like re-
flections, I asterwards made it a certain rule, that when-
ever I found those secret hints, or pressings of my mind,
to do or not do any thing that presented, or to go this
way or that way, I never sailed to obey the secret dic-
tate; though I knew no other reason for it, than that
iuch a pressure, or such an hint, hung upon my mind.
I could give many examples of the success of this con-
duct in the course of my life; hut more especially in the
latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; be-
sides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of, if I had seen with the lame eyes then
that I saw with now: but it is never too late to be wise;
and I cannot but recommend to all considering men, whose
lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as
mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight
such secret intimations of Providence, let them come
from what invisible intelligence they may; that I shall
not discuss, aud perhaps cannot account for; but cer-
tainly they are proof of the converse of spirits, and a
secret communication between those embodied and those
tmembodied; and such a proof as cannot be withstood; ot
which I shall have occasion to give some very remarka-
ble instances in the remainder of my solitary residence
in this dismal place.
I believe the reader will not think it strange, if I
consess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I
lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put
an end to all invention, and to all contrivances, that I
had laid for my suture accommodations and conveni-
ences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my
hands than that os my food. I was unwilling even to
drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood, for fear the noise
I should make might be heard; much less would I sire
a gun, for the feme reason; and, above all, I was very
uneasy
uneasy at making any sire, lest the smoke, which is vi-
sible at a great distance in the day, mould betray me;
and lor this reason I removed that part of my business
which required sire, such as burning of pots and pipes,
&c. into my new apartment in the wood; where, after
I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable con-
solation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went
in a vast wav, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to ven-
ture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe re-
treat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident, (I would say,
it I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such
things now to Providence) I was cutting down some
thick brandies of trees to make charcoal. This was
a very essential article, and the method I took to make
it was as follows:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation
and yet I could not live there without baking my bread,
cooking my meat, &c. sol contrived to bum some wood
'as I had seen done in England under turs, till it became
chark, or dry coal; and then "jfttfiting the sire out, I
preserved the coal to carry home, fend perform the other
services, which sire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smoke.
But this by thebye. While I was cutting dewnsome
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch
of low brush-wood, or under-wood, there was a kind
of hollow place: I was curious to look into it;
and getting, with dissiculty, into the mouth of it, I
found it was pretty large, that is to say, sussicient for
me to stand upright in, and perhaps another with me;
but I must consess to you, I made more haste out than
I did in; when looking sarther into the place, which
was persectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of
some creature, whether devil or man, I knew not,
which twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the.
3 cave's
cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the re-
flection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and
thought that he who was afraid to see the devil was not
sit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and that I
dare believe, there was nothing in this cave more fright-
ful than myseli; upon this, assuming courage, I took
up a large sirebrand, and in I rushed again, with the
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three steps
in, but I was almost as much srightened as I was be-
fore; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in
fome pain; and it was followed by a broken noise, at
if of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again.
I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a sur-
prize, that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had
a hat on my head, 1 will not answer for it, that my hair
might not have listed it off. But still plucking up my
spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a lit-
tle, with considering that the power and presence os God
was every where, and was able to protect me: upon this
I stepped forward again, and by the light of a sirebrand,
holding it up a little over my head, I Taw lving on the
ground a most monstrous frightsul old he-goat, just mak-
ing his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying indeed
of mere old age.
I stirred him a little, to fee if I could get him out;
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise him-
felf: and I thought with myself, he might e'en lie there;
for if he had frightened me so, he would certainly fright
any os the savages, if any of them mould be so hardy
as to come in there while he had any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprize, and began to
look round, when I found the cave was but very small;
that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in
no manner ot shape, either round or square, no hands
having ever been employed in making.it but thole cf
mere nature. I observed also, tliat there was a place en
one side of it that went in further, but so low, that it re-
quired me to creep upon my hands and knees to get into
Vol. 1. R it;
it; and whither it went I knew not; so having no can-
dle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-
box, which I had made of the lock os one ot the mus-
quets, with some wild-sire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day I went provided with six
large candles ofmy own making, for I made very good
candles now of goats tallow; and, going into this low
place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have
said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought
was a venture bold enough, considering, that 1 knew not
how sar it might go, or what was beyond it: when I
was got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher
up; I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to
look round the sides and roof os this vault or cave; the
walls reflected an hundred thousand lights to me from
my two candles; what it was in the rock, whether dia-
monds, or any other precious stones, or gold, which I
rather supposed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was in a most delightsul cavity or
grotto of it's kind, as could be expected, though per-
fectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a fort
of small loose gravel upon it; so that there was no nau-
seous creature to be seen; neither was there any damp
or wet on the sides of the roof; the only dissiculty in it
was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place of
security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at
the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things which I was moss anxious about,
to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my
magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two
fowling-pieces, (for I iiad three in all) and three muf-
quets, (for of them I had eight in all;) so I kept at my
castle only sive, which stood ready mounted, like pieces
os cannon, on my outer fence; and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I was
obliged
obliged to open the barrel of powder which I took up
out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I found
that the water had penetrated about three or four inches
into the powder on every side, which, caking and grow-
ing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell;
fo that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in
the centre os the cask; and this was an agreeable dis-
covery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder
with me in my castle, for for of a surprize of any
kind. I also carried thither all the lead I had lest for
bullets.
I sancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded myself
while I was here, if sive hundred savages were to hunt
me, they could never sind me out, or if they did, they would
not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mcuth of the cave, the next day after I made this disco-
very; and I found it much easier to dig a great hole
there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than
to drag him cut; so I interred him there, to prevent of-
fence to my nose.
I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and to
the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the
certainty that no savages would come to the place to dis-
turb me, I could have been content to have capitu-
lated for spending the reft of my time there, even to the
last moment, till I had laid me down and died like the
old goat in the cave: I had also arrived to some little
diversions and amusements, which made the time pass
more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before;
as, sirst, I had taught my Pol, as I noted besore, to
speak: and he did it so samiliarly, and talked so articu-
lately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and
he lived with me no less than six and twenty years;
haw long he might live afterwards, I knew not; though
E: I know
I know they have a notion in the Brazils, that they live
an hundred years; perhaps some of my Pols may be
alive there still, calling aster " Poor Robinson Crusoe,'"
to this day; I wish no Englishman the ill-luck to come
there and hear them; but is he did, he would certainly
believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant
and loviiig companion to me ser no less than sixleen
years of my time, and then died os mere eld age; as
tor my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that
decree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at
sirst, to keep them from devouring me and all I had;
but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving them
irom me, and letting them have no piovision with me,
they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three sa-
vourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when
they had anv, I alvays drowned; and these were part
of my samily. Besi.les these, I always kept two or
three houshoid kids about me, which I taught to feed out
of my hand; and I had also more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all call "Robin
Crusoe," but none like my sirst; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him: I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose
names I knew not, which I caught upon the shore,
and cut their wings; and the little stakes, which I had
planted besore my castle-wall, being now grown up to a
good thick grove, these fowls all lived among thele low
trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me;
so that I began to be very well contented with the life I
led, if it might but have been secured from the dread
os savages.
But it was otherwise directed: and it may not be
amiss for all people who read my story, to make
this just observation from it; viz. how frequently, in the
course of our lives, the evil, which in itself we ieek most
to flrun, and which, when we are sallen into, is the most
dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our
deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from
the
trie afsliction we are sallen into. I could give manv ex-
amples os ih s in the course of my life; but in nothing
was it more particularly remarkable, than in the cir-
cumstances os my last years of solitary residence in
this island.
It was now the month of December, in my twenty-
third year; and this being; the southern solstice, tor winter
I cannot call it, was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being prettv much abroad in the sields.
Going out one morning pretty early, even besore it was
thorough day-light, I was surprized with seeing a light
of some sire upon the shore, at a distance from me of
about two miles, towards the end of the island, where I
had ohserved some savages had been, as besore; though
not on the other iide; but, to my great asfliction, it was
on my side of the island.
I was, indeed, terribly affrighted at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprized; and yet I had no more peace
within, from the apprehensions I had, that if these sa-
vages, in rambling over the island, shoukl sind my corn
standing, or cut, or any of my works and improvements,'
they would immediately conclude that there were people
in the place, and would then never give over till they
found me out. In this extremity I went backdirectly to
my castle, and pulled up the ladder aster me, having made
all things without look as wild and natural as I could.
I then made preparations for putting myself in a pos-
ture of desence; I loaded all my cannon, as I called
them, that is to say, my musquets, which were mounted
upon mv new fortisication, and all my pistols, and resolved
to desend myselt to the last effort; not forgetting seri-
ously to recommend myself to the Divine Protection,
and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the
hands of the Barbarians: and in this posture I conti-
nued about two hours, when I began to be impa-
tient for intelligence abroad, but I had no spies to
(end out.
After sitting some time longer, and musing what
R 3 I should
I should do in this cafe, I was not able to bear sit-
ting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, and then
pulling the ladder up after me, I let it up again, and
m unted to the top of the hill; and pulling out my per-
spective-glais, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me
down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to look
for the place: I presently found there were no less than
nine naked savages sitting round a small sire they had
made; not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the weather being extreme hot; but, as I suppose, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which
they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I
could not tell.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled upon the shore; and, as it was then tide of ebb,
they seemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go
away again. It is not easy to imagine what consusion
this sight put me into, especially ieeing them come on
my side the island, and so near me too; but when I
observed their coming must be always with the current
of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my
mind, being satissied that I might go abroad with safety,
nil the time of tide os flood, if they were not on shore be-
fore; and having made this observation, I went abroad
about my harvest-work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and
row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I should have
observed, that for an hour and more before their departure
they went to (lancing, and I could easily discern their
postures and gestures by my glasses: I could not perceive,
by my nicest observations, but that they were stark-
naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but
whether they were men or women, that I could not dis-
tinguish.
As soon as I sew them shipped and gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle,
and my great sword by my' side without a scaobard ; and
iU LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
with all the speed I wa6 able to make, I went away to
the hill, where I had discovered the sirst appearance of
all. As scon as I got thither, which was not less than
two hours, (for I could not to sast, be»ng so loaded
with arms as I was) I perceived there had been three ca-
noes more of savages on that place; and looking out
farther, I saw they were all at.sea together, making over
for the main.
This was a dreadsul sight to me, especially when, go-
ing down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror
which the diimal work they had been about had left be-
hind: viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the siefli
of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches
with merriment and sport. I was so siiled with indig-
nation at the sight, that I began nowto premeditate the
destruction os the next I should see there, let them be
who cr how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for it
was above sifteen months before any more of them were
on siioie there again; that is to say, I never saw them,
or any iootfteps or signals of them, in all that time:
for as to the rainy seasons, they are then sure not to
come abroad, at least not so sar; yet, all this while I
lived uncomfortably, by reas.n of the constant appre-
hensions I was in of their coming upon me by surprize:
from whence I observe, that the expectation os evil is
more bitter than the suffering, especially it there is no
room to shake off that expectation or those appre-
hensions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in contriving how to cir-
cumvent and sail upon them the very next time I should
see them; especially if they stiould be divided, as they
were the last time, into two pirtics; nor did 1 consider
at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen,
I WiS still the nsst day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and ib another, even ad uifinitum, till I should
be
he at length no less a murderer than they were in being
men-eaters, and perhaps much mere so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety
of mind, expecting I mould, one day or other, sall
into the hands of these merciless creatures; if I did at
any time venture abroad, it was not without looking
round me with the greatest care and caution imagina-
ble; and now I found, to my great comfort, how happy
it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of
goats; for I durst not, upon any account, sire my gun,
especially near that side of the island where they usually
came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled srom me now, I was sure to have them come back
again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them in a few days, and then I knew what to ex-

However, I wore out a year and three months more,
besore I law any more of the savages, and then I found
them again, as I mail loon observe. It is true, they
might have been there once or twice; but either they
n~.ade no stav, or at least I did not hear them; but in
the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in
my four and twentieth year, I had a very strange en-
counter with them, oi which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during the last sifteen or
sixteen months interval, was very great: I flept un-
quiet, dreamed always frightsul dreams, and often
started out of my sleep in the night; in the day great
trouble., overwhelmed my mind; in the night I dreamed
often of killing the savages, and the reasons why I
might justify such conduct. But to wave all this for
a time, it was in the midddle of May, on the 16th day,
I think, as well as my poor wooden calender would
reckon; for I marked all upon the post still; I sav, it
was on the 16th ot May, that it blew a violent storm
of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and
thunder, and the whole of the night was truly dismal
indeed. I know not what was the particular occasion
#1 it, but as I was reading in the bible, and taken up,
\vitl<
with serious thoughts about my present condition, I
was surprized with the noise of a gun, as I thought,
sired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprize of a quite disferent
nature from any I had met with besore; for the notions
this put into my thoughts were quite os another kind.
I started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and in a
trice clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the
rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the se-
cond time, got to the top of the bill; that very mo-
ment a flash of sire made me listen for a second gun,
which, accordingly, in about hals a moment, I heard,
and by the sound knew it was from that part of
the sea where I was driven out with the current in my
boat.
I immediatelv considered, that this must be some ship
in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some
other ship in company, and sired these guns sor signals
of distress, and to obtain help. I had, however, such
presence os mind at that minute, as to think, that
though I could not help their., it might be they could
help me; so I brought together all the dry woed I could

on sire upon the hill; the wood was dry, and blazed
freely; and though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burnt sairly out, so that I was certain, if there was any
such 'thing as a ship, they must needs ice it, and no
doubt they did; for as soon as ever my sire blazed up,
I heard another gun, and after that several others, all
from the same quarter. I plied my sire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at
sea, suil east of the island, whether a sail, or an hull, I
could not distinguish, no not with my glasses, the dis-
tance was so great, and the weather still something hazy
also: at least it was so out at sea.
I looked srequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move; so I presently concluded,
that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may
be
be lure, to be satissied, I took my gun in my hand, and
ran towards the south-east side of the island, to the
rocks, where I had Leen formerly carried away with
the current; and getting up there, the weather by this
time being persectly clear, I could plainly fee, to my
great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was
out in my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the
violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream
or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from
the molr desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had
been in all my life.
Thus, what is one man's sase'y, is another man's
destruction; for it seems, these men, whoever they were,
being o\it os their knowledge,, and the rocks being
wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the
night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E. Had
they seen the island, as I nereffaiily suppose they did
not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have
saved themselves on shore by the help ot their boat; but
their siring of their guns for help, especially when they*
saw, as I imagined, my sire, silled me with many
thoughts. First, I imagined, that, upon seeing my
light, they would have got into th.ir boat, and have
endeavoured to make the more; but that the sea run-
ning very high, they mig'it have been cast away; I
then thought, that they might have lost their boat be-
fore, as might be the cafe many ways; as particularly
by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many
times obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat,
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own
hands: other times I imagined, they had some other
ship or mips in company, who, upon the signals of dis-
tress they had made, had taken them up, and carried
them off: at other times, I sancied they were all gone
off to sea in their Iwat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were carried out
into the great ocean, where there was nothing but mi-
sery and the prospect of death; and that perhaps they
* might
might by this time think of starving, and of being in a
condition to eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the
condition 1 was in, I could do no more than look upon
the misery of the poor men, and pity them; which had
still this good effect on my side, that it gave me more
and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so
happily and comfortably provided for me in my deso-
late condition; and that of two ships companies who
were now cast away upon this part of the world, not
one life should be spared but mine. I learned here
again to observe, that it is very rare the providence of
God casts us into any condition of life, so low, or any
misery so great, but we may see something or other to be
thanksul for, and may sind others in worse circumstances
than ourselves.
Such certainly was the case with these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of them
were saved; nothing could make it reasonable so much
as to expect that they did not all perish there, except
the possibility only of their being taken up by another
(hip in company: and this was but mere possibility in-
deed; for I saw not the least signal or appearance of
any such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
what a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I felt in
my sold upon this sight; breaking out sometimes thus,
'O that there had been but one or two, nay, or but
'one soul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to me,
* that I might but have had one companion, one fel-
'low-creature, to have spoken to me, and to have enn-
'versed with!* In all the time of my solitary life, I
never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society
ot my sellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want
efit.
There are some secret moving springs in the asfections,

dered present to the mind by the power of imagination,
that
that motion carries out the soul by its impetuosity to
such violent, eager embracings of the object, that the
ablerjce of it is in:upportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, that but one man
had been saved !" O that it had been but onet." I be-
lieve I repeated the words, "O that it-had been but
one!" a thousand times; and my desires were so moved
*9* LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
'clench together, and my singers press the palms of my
hands, thatif I had had any soft thing in my hand, it
would have crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in
my head would, strike together, and set against one
another so strong, that fcr some time 1 could not part
them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the rea-
son and manner of them: all I can say is, to delcribe
the sact, which was ever surprizing to me when I found
it, though I knew not from what it should proceed; it
was doubtless the esfects os ardent wimes, and ot strong
ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which
the conversation of one of my fellow-christians would
have been to me.
But it was not to be: either their sate or mine, or
both, forbade it; for till the last year of my being on
this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of
that shin or no; and had only the affliction, seme days
after, to see the cerpie of a drowned boy come on stlore,
at the end of the istr.nd, which was next the shipwreck.
He had on no clothes, but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen sturt;
but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation
he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces
of eight, and a tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten
times more value than the sirst.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
. out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might
sind something on board, that might be uleful to me;
but that did not altogether press me so much, as the pos-
sibility there might be yet some living creature on board,
whole
whose life I might not only save, but by saving that life,
comfort mv o n to the last degree. And this thought
so impressed my heart, that I could not be quiet, night
or day, but I must venture out in my beat on beard
this wreck; and committing the rest to God's provi-
dence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my
mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
fome invisible direction, and that I mould be wanting to
myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back
to my castle, prepared every thing sor my voyage, took
a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a com-
pais to steer by, a bottle of rum, (for I had still a great
deal of that lest) a basket sull of raisins; and thus load-
ing myself with every thing necessary, 1 went down to
my boat, took the water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more; my second cargo was a great bag sull of rice,
the umbrella to let up over my head for shade, another
large pot sull of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a
bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese ; all which, with great
labour aud sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying to
God to direct my voyage, Ip:ltout, and rowing or pad-
dling the canoe along the shore, I came at last to the ut-
most point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture ornv/t to venture; I looked on the rapid currents
, which ran constantly on both fries of the island, at a dis-
tance, and winch were very terrible to me, from the re-
membrance of the hazard I had been in besore, and my
heart began to sail me; for I foresaw, that if I was
driven into either of those currents, I should be carried
a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or
sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was
but small, is any little gale of wind should rise, 1 snould
be inevitably lost.
These ti.oughts so oppressed my mind, that I berran
to ^>ve ever my enterprize, and having hauled my boat
Vol. I. S snto
into a little acek on the shoie, I Hepped out, and fet
me down u; on a little spot of rising ground, very pensive
and anxious, between fear and desire about my voyage;
when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide
was turned, and the flood came on, upon which my go-
ing was for so many hours impracticable: upon this it
presently occurred to me, that I mould go up to the
highest piece ot ground I could sind, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the
fluod came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven
one way out, I might not expect to be driven another
way home, with the same rapidity of the currents.
This thought was no sooner in my head, than I cast my
eye upon a little hill which ftissiciently overlooked the
sea both ways, and whence I had a clear view of the cur-
rents, orsers of the tide, and which way I was to guide
myself in my return. Here I found, that as the cur-
rent cf the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by the skorc
of the north-side; and that I had nothing to do but to
keep to the north of the island in my return, and I should
do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the sirst of the tide; and repos-
ing mysels for that night in the canoe, under the great
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out: I made sirst a
little out to sea sull north, till I began to feel the benesit
ot the current, which let eastward, and which carried me
at a great rate, and yet did not lo hurry me as the south-
ern side of the current had done besore, and so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at a great rate,
directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came
up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at; the mip, which by
it's building was Spanish, stuck sast, jammed inbetw.vn
two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her was bea en
to pieces with the sea; and as her forecastle, which
struck on the rocks, had run on with great violence, the
4 m-c-
main-mall: and fore-mast were brought by the beard, that
is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound,
and the head and bow appeared sirm; when I came close
to her, a dog appeared upon her; which, leeing me com-
ing, yelped and cried, and as soon a* I cailed him,
jumped into the sea, to come to me; and I took him
into the boat, but found him almost dead from hunger
and thirst: I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat
like a ravenous wolf, that had been starving a fortnight
in the show; I then gave the poor creature some fresh
water, with which, if I would have let him, he would
liave burst himself.
After this I went on board : the sirst fight I met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle
of the ship, with their arms sast about one another. I
concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship
struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so
continually over her, that the men were not able to bear
it, and were strangled with the constant rustiing in of the
water, as much as if they had been under water; beside*
the dog, there was nothing lest in the ship that had life,
nor any goods tiiat I could see, but what were spoiled by
the water: there were some casks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and
which, the water being ebbed out, I could fee; but they
were too large to meddle with. I saw several chests,
which I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I
got two of them into the boat, without examining what
was in them.
Had the stem of the ship been sixed, and the fore-part
broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good
voyage; for by what I found in these two chests, I had
room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on
board; and if I may guess by the course she steered,
she must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the
Rio de la Plata, in tne south part of America, beyond
the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the Gulph of Mexico,
and so perhaps to Spain: she had, no doubt, a great
treasure sn her, but of no use at that time to any body;
Si. anil
and what became of the rest of her people I then
knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask sull of li-
quor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much dissiculty: there were several muiquets
in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it; as for the mufquets, I had no
occasion for them, so I lest them, but took the powder-
horn. I took a sirCrshovel and tongs, which I wanted
extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper-pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this car-
go, and the dog, 1 came away, the tide beginning to
make home aga n; and the same evening, about an hour
within night, I reached the island again, weary and sa-
tigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I
resolved to harbour what I had gotten in n>y new cave,
not to carry it heme to my castle: after resreshing my-
self, I got all my cargo en shore, and benan to examine
the particulars: the cask of liquor I found to be a kind
196 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
a word, not at all good; but when I crnie to open tire
chests, I found several things which I wanted: for ex-
ample, I found in one a sine cafe of bottles of an extra-
ordinary kind, anJ silled with cordial waters, sine, and
very good; the bottles held about three pints each, aud
were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very g^cd
succades, or sweat meats, so sastened also on tsle top,
that the salt-water had not hurt thsm: and two mere
of the same, which the water had spoiled. I found some
good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and half of white linen handkerclutfs and co-
loured neckcloths; the former were abb very welcome,
being exceeding resreshing to wipe my sace in a hot day;
besides this, when I came to the till in the chests, I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held
about eleven hundred pieces in all; and'in one of them,
wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some
small bars or wedges of gold } I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound. * .yhe
Tlie other chest I sound had some clothes in it, but of
little value; but by the circumstances it must have be-
longed to the gunner's mate i though there was no
powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder
in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their
fowling-pieces on occasion: upon the whole, I got very
littli; by this voyage, that was of much use to me: for,
as to the money, I had no manner of occasion sor it; it
wis to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have
given it all for three or four pair of English shoes or
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had
not had on my feet now for manyyears. I had, indeed,
gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took otF the feet
os the two drowned men, whom I saw in the wreck; and
I found two pairmoie in one of the chests, which were
very welcome to me, but they were not like our English
slices, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes: I found in this seaman's chest
about sifty pieces os eight in royals, but no gold. I sup-
pose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which
feemed to belong to feme ossicer.
[;. Well, however, I lugged.this money homejo my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that besore, which I
br."u»h* srom our own ship; ,but it was a great pity, as
I saui, that the other part of the ship had net come to
myshaie; for I am satissied I might have loaded my ca-
noe iewral times over with money, which, it I had ever
escaped to England, would have Iain here safe enough
till I lr ight have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and se-
cured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where I
laid her up, and made the best of my way to my eld habi-
tation, where I found every thing safe and quiet; so I
began to repose myself, live after my old sashion, and
take care ot my samily assairs; and, for a while, Hived
easy enough; only that I was more vigilant than I used
to be, looked ou' ottener, and did not go abroad so much;
and if at ar.y time I did stir with any freedom, it was al-
3 S ways
ways to the east part of the island, where I was pretty
well satissied the savages never came, and where I could
go without so many precautions, and such a load of arms
and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went
the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more, during
which time my head was silled with projects and designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this
island; sometimes I was for making another voyage to
the wreck, though my reason told me there was nothing
left worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes sora
ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe ve-
rily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I
(hould have ventured to sea, bound any where, 1 knew
not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to
those who are touched with that general plague of man-
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their mise-
ries flow; I mean, that of not being satissied with the sta-
tion wherein God and nature hath placed them: for, not
to look back upon my primitive condition, and the ex-
cellent advice ot my sather, the opposition to which was,
as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes
of the same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which
so happily had seated me at the Brazils, as a planter,
blessed me with reasonable desires, and could I have been
contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been
by this time, I mean in the time of my being on this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the Bra-
zils; nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvements I
had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase
I should probably have made, if I had stayed, I might
have been worth an hundred thousand moidores; and
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, well stocked
plantation, improving and increasing, to turn supercargo
to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patience and time
would have so increased our stock at home, that we
*ould have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose
whose business it was to setch them? And though it
had cost us something more, yet the difference of that
price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate ot young heads, so
reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exer-
cise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of
time; and,fo it was with me now; and yet so deep had
the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not
satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring
upon the means and possibility of my escape from this
place; and that I may, with the greater pleasure to the
reader, bring en the remaining part os my story, it
may not be improper to give some account of my sirst
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme tor my
escape, and how and upon what foundation! acted.

IF ever the story of any private man's ad ventures in the
world were worth making public, and were accepta-
ble when published, the Editor of this account thinks
this will be lo.
The wonders of this man's life exceeded all that (he
thinks) is to be found extant; the lsfe of one man being
scarcely capable of a greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with serioushess, and
with a religious application of events to the uses to
which wife men always apply them, viz. to the instruc-
tion of others by their example, and to justify and ho-
nour the wisdom os Providence in all the variety of our
circumstances, let them happen how they will.
The Editor believes the thing to be a just history of
facts; neither is there any appearance of siction in it;
and whoever thinks, because all suel) things are dispatch-
ed, that the improvement of it, as well to the diversion
as instruction of the reader, will be the same; and
as such, he thinks, without sarther compliment to the
world, he does them a great service in the publica-

ROBINSON* CRUSOE.
VOLUME THE FIRST,
I WAS born in the year 163z, in the city of York,
of a good samily, though not of that country, my
sather being a foreigner os Bremen, who fettled sirst at
Hull: he got a good estate by merchandize, and leav-
ing off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence
he had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good samily in that country, and from
whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by usual
corruption of words in England, we are now called, nay,
we call ourselves, and write our name Cfufoe; and so
my companions always called me,
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was a lieute.
nant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders,
formerly commanded by the samous Colonel Lockhart,
and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk, against the
Spaniards .. what became of my second brother I never
knew, any more than my sather or mother did know
what was become of me,.
Being the third son of the samily, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be silled very early with ram-
bling thoughts: my sather, who was very ancient, had
given me a competent share of learning, as sar as house-
education and a country free-school generally go, and
designed me for the law; but I would be satissied with
nothing but going to sea: and my inclination to this
led me so strongly against the will, nay the commands,
of my sather, and a gainst all the entreaties and persua-
sions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed
to be fomething satal in that propension of nature,
tending directly to the life os misery which was to be-
fal me. »
My father, a wife and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my
B 3 A&gn
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was consined by the gout, and expostulated
very warmly with me upon this liibject; he asked me
what reasons, more than a mere Wandering inclination,
I had for leaving my sather's house and my native coun-
try, where I might be well introduced, and had a pro-
spect of raising my sortune by application and industry,
with a life of ease and pleasure: he told me, it was men
of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior
fortunes on the other, and who went abroad upon ad-
ventures, to rife by enterprize, and make themselves sa-
mous in undertakings os a nature out of the common
ffi LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
Or too sar below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what might be called the upper station of low lise,
which he had found, by long experience, was the best
state in the world, the most suited to human h*ppinels,
not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour
and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not
embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge
of the happiness of this stale, by this one thing, viz.
that this was the state of life which all other people en-
vied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable
consequences of being born to great things, and wished
they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the great; that the wile man gave
his testimony to this, as the just standard of true felicity,
when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I mould always sind,
that the calamities of life-were shared among the upper
and lower part of mankind; but that the middle station
had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many
vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind;
nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and
uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were, who,
by vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean
or insussicient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers
a "upon
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their
way of living; that the middle station of lire was cal-
culated for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjov-
ments; that Peace and Plenty were the handmaids of a
middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness,
health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all dessrable
pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle sta-
tion of life; that this way men went silently and smooth-
ly through the world, and comfortably out of it; not
embarrassed with the labours of the hands, or of the head;
not sold to a lite of slavery for daily bread, or harrassed
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul ot peace,
and the body of rest; ndt enraged with the passion of
envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but in easy circumstances, sliding gently through
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter; seeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day's experience to know it more
sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
asfectionate manner, not to play the young man, or to
piecipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my
bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour
to enter me sairly into the station of life which he had
been just recommending to me; and that it I was not
very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere
fate or sault that must hinder it; and that he should have
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty,
in warning me against measures which he knew would be
to my hurt: in a word, that as he would do very kind
things for me, if I would stay and settle at home, as he
directed; so he would not have so, much hand in my
mistwrtunes, as to give me any encouragement to go
aw^y: and to close all, he told me, I had my elder brother
for an example, to whom he had used the time earnest;
persuasions, to keep him from going into the Low Coun-
try wars, but could not prevail, his young desires
prompting
prompting him to run into the army, where he was
killed; and though, he said, he would not cease to pray
for me, vet he would venture to say -to me, that if I did
take this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I would
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his
counsel, when there might be none toaslistin my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not
know it to be so himself; I say I observed the tears run
down his sace very plentisully, especially when he spoke
of my brother who was killed; and that when he spoke
of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he
was so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and told me
his heart was so sull he could fay no more to me.
I was sincerely afflicted with this discourse, as indeed
who could be otherwise; and I resolved not to think
ef going abroad any more, but to settle at home, ac-
cording to my sather's desire: but, alas! a few days
wore it all eff; and, in short, to prevent anv of my fa-
ther's sarther importunities, in a few weeks after, I re-.
solved to run quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily neither, as the sirst heat of my resolu-
tion prompted; but I took my mother at a time when
I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary; and told
her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world, that I should never settle to any thing with resolu-
tion enough to go through with it; and my sather had
better give me his consent, than force me to go without
it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney;
that I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my
time, but I should certainly run away from my master
besore my time was out, and go to lea; and is she would
speak to my sather to let me go one voyage abroad,
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go
no more, and I would promise, by a double diligencSj
to recover the time I hail lost.
This put my mother into a great paflson: she told
pie, she knew it would be to no purpose to ljpeak to my
father
sather upon any such subject; that he knew too well
what was my interest, to give his conient to any thing
so much for my bur*; and that she wondered how I
could think of any such thing, after the discourse I had
had with my sather, and such kind and tender expres-
sions as she knew my sather had used to me: and that,
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for
me; but I might depend I mould never have their con-
sent to it; that, for her part, she would not have so
much hand in my destruction; and I should never have
it to say, that my mother was willing, when my sa-
ther was not.
Though my mother resused to move it to my sather,
yet I heard afterwards, that slie reported all the discourse
to him: and that my sather, after shewing a great con-
cern at it, said to her, with a sigh' That boy might
'be happy, if he would stay at home; but if he goes
'abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever
* was born! I can give no conient to it.'
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obstinately
deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and fre-
quently expostulated with my sather and mother, about
their being so positively determined against what they
knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one
day at Hull,whither I went casually, and without anv pur-
pose of making an elopement at that time; I say being
there, and one of my companions being going by sea to
.London, in his sather's ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common allurement of a seasaring
man, that it should costme nothing for my passage ; Icon-
suited neither sather or mother any-more, nor so much as
sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they
might, without asking God's blessing or my sather's, with-
out any consideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill-hour, (God knows) on the sirst of Sep-
tember, 1651, I went on board a stiip bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,
began sooner, or continued longer, than mine: the ship
was
was no sooner got out of the Humber, but the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightsul man-
ner; and as I had never been at 'sea besore, I was most
inexpressibly lick in body, and terrisied in mind. I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done,
and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Hea-
ven, for so my wickedly leaving my sather's house, and
abandoning my duty; ail the good counsel of my pa-
rents, my sather's tuars, and my mother's entreaties,
came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to
which it has been since, repreached me with the con-
tempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and
my sather.
All this while the storm encreafed, and the sea ran
very high, though nothing like what I have leen many
times since; no, nor what I saw a few (lays after; but
it was enough to asfect me then, who was but a young
sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I
expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and
that every time the siiip fell down, as I thought it did,
in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise
more. In this agony of mind I made many vows and
resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my life
in this one voyage, if ever I ijot once my foot upon dry
land again, I would go directly home to my sather, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would
takehis advice, and never runmyfelt into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of
his observations about the middle station of life, how
easy, how comfortable he had lived all his days, and never
had been exposed to tempests at sea, or trouble on
ftore; and, in short, I resolved that s would, like a
true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wile and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but
the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer,
and I began to be a little inured to it. However, I was
yery grave for all that day, being also a littie, fea-tsick-
still;
still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the
wind was quite over, and a charming sine evening fol-
lowed; the sun wet. down persectly clear, and role s6
the next morning , aud having little or no wind, and a
smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightsul I ever saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheersul; looking with wonder upon
the sea, that was so rough and terrible the day besore,
and could be so calm, and so pleasant, in so little a time
after: and now, lest my good resolutions should conti-
nue, my companion, who had, indeed, enticed me away,
came to me' Well, Bob,' says he,' clapping me
upon the moulder, ' how do you do aster it? I warrant
'you were frighted, were not you last night, when it
'blew but a cap sull of wind ?'' A cap sull d'ye call
'it!' said I, it was a terrible storm.'' A storm, you
* fool, you!' replies he, ' do you call that a storm?
'Why, it was nothing at all. Give us but a good ship,
* and sea room, and we think nothing of such a squall
'of wind as that; but, your but a fresh-water sailor,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. it
'forget all that. D'ye fee what charming weather 'tis
'now?' To make short this sad part of my story, we
went the way of all lailors; the punch was made, and I
was made half drunk with it, and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflec-
tions on my past conduct, and all my resolutions for the
suture. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of sursace, and settled calmness, by the
abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea, being forgotten, and the current
of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the
vows and promises I made in my distress. I
fuund, indeed, some intervals of reflection, and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again
fometimes; but I mook them off, and rouzed myself
lrom them, as it were from a distemper; and applying
myl'elt
myself todrinkingand company, soonmasteredtheresuin
of thole sits, (for sb I called them;) and I had, in sive or
six days, got as complete z victory over my conscience,
as any you:lg fellow that resolved not to be troubled with
it could desire: But I was to have another trial for it
still; and Providence, as in such cases generally happens,
resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I
would not take this for. a deliverance, the next was to be
such a one, as the worst and most hardened wretch among
us would consess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yar-
mouth roads; the wind having been contrary, and the
weather calm, we had made but little way since the
storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor,
and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, v\z. at
S. W. for seven or eight days; during which time,
a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same
roads; as the common harbour where the ships might
Wait for a wind for the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long but we should
have tided it up the river, had not the wind blew too
fresh; and, after we had lain four or sive days, blew
very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good
as an harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger; but spent the
time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but
the eighth day in the morning, the wind increased, and
we had all hands to work to strike our top-masts, and
make every thing shug and close, that the ship might
ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea ran very high
indeed, and our ship rid forecastle-in, shipped several
seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home: upon which our master ordered out the sheet
anchor; so that we rode with two anchors a-head, and
the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now
I began to fee terror and amazement in the saces even of
the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant
in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went nj
and out ot' his cabin by me, 1 could hear him, softly to
himself, say several times' Lord be merciful to us!
'we shall be all lost, we mall be all undone!' and the
like. During these sirst hurries I was stupid, lying still
in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot de-
scribe my temper. I could ill resume the sirst penitence
which I had so apparently trampled upon, run! hardened
myself against: I thought the bitterness of death had
been passed; and that this would be nothing, too, like;
the sirst. But when the master himself came by me, as
I laid just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and
looked cut: but such a dilmal sight I never law; the
lea went mountains high, and broke upon us every three
or four minutes. When I could look about, I could
fee nothing but distress round us: two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their malts by the beard,
being deep laden; and our men cried cut, that a ship
winch rid about a mile a-head of us was foundered.
Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were
run out ot the roans to tea, at all adventures, and that
not with a mast standing. The light thips sared the
best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or
three of them drove, and came clole by us, running
away with only their sprit-sail out besore the wind.
Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain begged
the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-
malt, which he was very unwilling to do: but t lie boat-
swain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship
would founder, he consented; and when they had cut
away the foremast, the main-mast stood so loose, and
shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her
away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at
all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been
in iuch a fright besore at but a little. But is I can
express at this dittance the thoughts I had about me at
that tune, I was in ten-fold more horror of mind upon
C account
account of my sormer convictions, and the having re-
turned siom them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken
it sirst, than I was at death itlelf; and these, added to
the terror of the storm, put me into sihch a condition,
that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was
not come yet; the storm continued with such sury, that
the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
seen a worse. We had a good ship, but slie was deep
laden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every
now and then cried out me would sounder. It was my
advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they
meant by founder, till I enquired. However, the
ftorm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen,
the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible
than the rest, at their prayers, and exacting every mo-
ment the ship would go to the bottom. In the mid-
dle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses,
one of the men that had been down on purpose to see,
cried out we had sprung aleak; another laid, there wu
four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called
to the pump. At that very word my heart, as t
thought, died within me; and I sell backwards upon
the side os my bed where I fat, into the cabin. However,
the men rouzed me, ,ind told me, that I that was able
to do nothing besore, was as well able to pump as ai»-
ther; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump, and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, themustcr
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip and ran away to the
fea, and would come near us, ordered to sire a gun as a
signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they
meant, was so surprized, that I thought the soip had
broke, or some dreadsul thing happened; in a word,
I was fo surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when every body had his own life to think
os, noboJy minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and, thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had beeddead;
and it was a great whsle besore I came to mviclf.
We
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold,
it was apparent that the ship would founder; and though
the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not polh-
ble she could swim till we might run into any port, so
the master continued siring guns for help; and a light
ship, who had rid it out just a head of us, ventured a
boat cut to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the
beat came near us; but it was impossible sor us to get
on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till
at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the
stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great
length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took
hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and
got ail into their boat. It was to no purpose for them
or us, aster we were in the boat, to think, ot reaching to
their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only
to puil her in towards shore as much as we could; and
cur master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon more, he would make it good to their master:
so partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, siepirg towards the shore,
almost as sar as Wintertonnesse.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
cut of cur lhip, but we saw her sink; and then I
understood, for the sirst time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up, when the seamen told
me she was Iinking; for, from that moment they ra-
ther put me into the boat, than that I might be said
to go in, my heart was as it were dead witlun me;
paitly with fright, partly with honor of mind, and
the thoughts os what was yet besore me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bcui bag at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could fee (when our boat mounting the waves,
we were able to fee the shore) a great many people
running along the strand to assist us when we should
semi' ntai: but we made but How way towards the
C z shere;
shore: nor were we able to reach the shore, till be-
ing past the light-house at Winterton, the shere salls
osf to the westward towards Croiner; and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in, and though not without much disssiculty, got
all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth; where, as unsortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sussicient to carry us either to London, or
back to Hull, as we thought sit.
Had I now had the fense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my sather, an emblem of our Blessed Saviour's pa-
rable, had even killed the satted calf forme; for, hear-
ing the ship I went away in, was cast away in Yarmouth
Road, it was a great while besore he had any assurances
that I was not drowned.
But my ill-sate pushed me on now, with an obstinacy
that nothing could resist; and though I had several times
loud calls from my reason and my more composed judg-
ment, to g6 Lome, yet I had no power to do it; I know
not what to call this; nor will I urge, that it is a se-
cret-over-ruling decree that hurries us on to be the in-
struments of our own destruction, even though it be be-
fore us, and that we push upon it with our eyes open.
Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable
misery attending, and which it was impossible for me
to escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I
had met with in my sirst attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me besore,
and who was the master's so:i, was now less forward than
I. The sirst time he spoke to me after we were at Yar-
mouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were
separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the
sirst time he law me, it appeared his tone was alterc.l;
aiid,
and, looking very melancholv, and shaking bis head,
asked me how I did; and telling his sather who I wns,
and. hew I had come this voyage only for a trial, in Oider
to go sarther abroad; his sather turning to me with a
very grave and concerned tone, "Young man," savs
he, "vou ought never to go to lea any more; you ought
"to take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
"not to be a seasaring man."" Why, Sir," said I;
"will you go to sea no more?"" That is another
"cafe," said he; "it is my calling, and theresore my
"duty; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you
"fee what a taste Heaven has given you of what you
"are to expect, if you persist; perhaps all this has be .
"sallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of
"Tarshirh. Pray," continues he, what are you? and
*' on what account did you go to sea?" Upon that I
told him seme of my story; at the end of which, he burst:
out with a strange kind of pasiion. "What had I
"done," savs he, " that such an unhappy wretch
"should come into my ship! I would not set my foot
"in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds."
This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits,
which were yet agitated by the fense os his loss, and
was sarther than he could have authority to go: how-
ever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhort-
ing me to go back to mv sather, and not tempt Provi-
ridence to my ruin; told me I might fee a visible hav.d
of Heaven against me: "And young man," said lit?,
"depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you
"go, you will meet with nothing but disasters ..nd
"disappointments, till your sather's words are sul-
"silled upon you."
We parted seen after; for T made him little answer,
and 1 iaw him no more; which way he went, I know
not. As sor me, having some money in my pocket, I tra-
velled to London, bv land; and there, as well as on the
read, had mznv struggles with mysels, what course os
lisp 1 should take, and whether I should go home, or go
to sea.
C 3 As
As to going home, shame opposed the beit motions
that osfered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how 1 should be laughed at among the neigh-
bours, and should be ashamed to see, not mv father and
mother only, but even every body else. From whence I
have since often observed how incongruous and irrational
the common temper of mankind is, especially ot youth, to
that reason that ought to guide them in such cases ; viz.
that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to
repent; not ashamed of the action, for which they ought
juiHy to be esteemed fools: but are ashamed of the
returning, which only can make them esteemed wife men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some time,
uncertain what measures to take, and what course of life
to lead. An irresistable reluctance continued to going
home; and as I staid awhile, the remembrance of the
distress I had been in, wore off; and as that abated,
the little motion I had in my desires to return, wore off
with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it,
and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me sirst away from
my sather's house, which hurried me into the wild and
indigested notion of raising my fortune, and that im-
pressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me
deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties, and even
tiie commands of my sather; I say, the same influence,
whatever it was, presented the most unsortunate of all
enterprizes to my view; and I went on board a vessel
bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vul-
garly call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that in all these adven-
tures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though
I might indeed have worked a little harder thai ordi-
nary, yet, at the same time, I had learned the duty and
ossice of a fere-mast-man; and in time might have quali-
sied myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master.
But as it was always my sate to chuse for the worst, so
I did here; for having money in my pocket, and good
cloaths on my back, I would always go on board in the
h-bit
habit os a gentleman; and so I neither had any busi-
ness in the ship, nor learned to do any.
It was my lot sirst of all to sall into pretty good com-
pany m London, which dees not always happen to such
loose and unguided young idlows as I then was; the
devil generally rot omitting to lay some share for them
very early ; bat it was not so with me. I sirst became ac-
quainted with the matter of a ship who had been on the
Coast of Guintia, and who, having had very good suc-
cess there, was resolved to go again: this captain, tak-
ing a sancy to my conversation, whichwas not disagree-
able at that tiire, and hearing me say I had a mind to
see the world, Sold me, it I would go the voyage with
him, I should he at no expence; I should be his mess-
mate, ;rd his companion; and if I could carry any
thing with me, I should have all the advantage of it
that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet
with some encouragement.
I embraced tht: offer; and entering into a strict friend-
ship with this captain, who was an honest plain-dealing
man, went the voyage with him, and carried a small ad-
venture with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of
my friend the ciptain, I increased very considerably;
for I carried about 40/. in such toys and trifles as the
captain directed me to buy. This 40/. I had mustered
together, by the assistance of some of my relations whom
I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my sather,
or at least my mother, to contribute so much as that to
my sirst adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was suc-
cesssul in all my adventures, and which I owe to the in-
tegrity and honesty of my friend the captain; under
whom I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics,
and the rules of navigation: learned how to keep an ac-
count of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in
short, to understand somethings that were needsul to be
understood by a sailor: for, as he took delight'to intro-
duce me, I took delight to learn: and, in a word, this
vovage made me bodi a sailor and a merchant; for I
brought
brought home sive hundred pounds nine ounces of goH-
dust sor my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my
return, almost 300/. ar.d this silled me with those aspiring
thoughts which have since so complcated my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had misfortunes too; par-
ticularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into
a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate;
our principal trading being upon the coast, from the lat.
.of 15 deg. N. even to the line itsels.
I was now let up for a Guinea trader; and my frsend,
.to my great misfortune, dying soon aster his arrival, 1
.resolved to go the same voyage again; and I embarked
in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the for-
mer voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.
This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made;
for though I did not carry quite 100/. of my new-gained
wealth, so that I had zoo/, lest, and which I lodged with
my friend's widow, who was very lust to me, yet I fell
into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the sirst
was this: viz. our ship making her course towards the
Canary Islands, or rather between those Islands and the
African shore, was surprized in the grey of the meaning
by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave chace to us with
all the sail she could make. We crouded also as much
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts cany,
to have got clear; but sinding the pirate gained upon,
us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours,
we prepared to sight; our ship having twelve guns, and
the rover eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and, bringing to, by mistake, just ath-
wart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he in-
tended, we brought eight of our guns to. bear on that
side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made
him sheer off again, aster returning our sire, and
pouring in also his small shot from near z00 men which
lie had on board. However, we had not a man touched,
all' our men keeping close. He prepared to attack us
again, and we to desend ourselves; but laying us on
board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered
ninety
ninety men upon our decks, who immediately fell t<?
cutting and hacking the decks and rigging. We plied
them with small-shot, hals-pikes, powder-chests, and
such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How-
ever, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadsul as at sirst I
apprehended; nor was I carried up the country, to the
emperor's court, as the rest of our men were, but was
kept by the captain of the rover, as his proper prize, and
made his slave, being young and nimble, and sit for his
business. At this surprising change os my circumstances,
from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was persectly
overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my sather's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable,
and have none to relieve me; which I thought was now
so esFectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I
was undone without redemption. But, alas! this was
but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will
appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes, that he would take me
with him when he went to lea again, believing that it
would be some time or other his sate to be taken by a
Spanish or Portugal man os war; and that then I should
be set at libtrty. Bui this hope os mine was loon taken
.away: for when he went to sea, he lest me on shore to
look aster his little garden, and do the drudgery of,
slaves about his house; and when he came home again
s coin his cruize, he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look
aster theship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to esfect it; but found no way that
had the least probabilitv in it: nothing presented to
make the supposition of st rational; furl had nobody to
commu-
communicate it to, that would emhark with me; no fel-
low-stave, no Englishman, Irishman or Scotchman
there, but mysels; so that lor two years, though I often
pleased mysels with tie imagination, yet I never hal
the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two yea: s, an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the old thoughts of making some at-
tempt for my libertv again in my head; mv patron ly-
ing at home longer than usual, without sitting out his
ihip, which, as I heard, was tor want of money, he
. used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener,
if the weather was sair, to take the ship's pinnace,
.and go out into the road a sishing; and as he always
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat,
.we made him very merry, and I p;:oved very dexterous
in catching sishi insomuch, that sometimes he wjuld
fend me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth
the Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dilh of sish,
for him.
It happened one time, that goinga sishing with him in
a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we
were not half a league irom the shore, we loft sight of it;
and, rowing we knew not whither, or which way, we la-
boured all day, and all the next night; and when the
morning came, we found we had pulled .osf to sea, in-
stead os pulling in sor the sii.ire, and that we were al leair.
two leagues srom the land; however, we got well in
again, though vr.th a great deal of labour, and some
danger, for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the
.morning; but, particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this dilaler, resolved tQ
take more care oi himsels for the suture; ajid having ly
ing by him the long-boat of our English ship which he
.had taken, he resolved he would not go a rishing any
more without a compass and some provision; io he
ordered the carpenter of his ship, who was also an English,
slave, to build a little state-room,or cabin in the middle
of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to
iUnd behind it ,t,o steer, and haul home the main sheet;
and
and rccm besore sor an hand or two to stand and work.
the lads. She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-
mutton sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the
cabm, which lay very shug and lew, and had in it room
for him to lie, with a stave or two, and a table to eat
on, with feme in all lockers to put in some bottles of
luch liquor as he thought sit to drink; particularly his
bread, rice, and coffee.
We went frequently out with this boat a sishing; and
as I was most dexterous to catch nsh sor him, he never
went without me. It happened one day, that he had
appointed to go out in tins boat, either for pleasure or
for sish, with two or three Moors of some distinction,
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily; and had
theresore lent en board the beat over night a larger store
of provisions than usual; and had ordered me to get
ready three susils with powder and shot, which were on
beard his ship; for that they designed some sport of
fowling, as well as fuliing.
I gotail thingsrtady, as he had directed; and waited
the next morning with the beat washed clear;, her anci-
ent ami pendants on, and every thing to accommodate his
guests, when by and by my patron came on board alone,
and told me his guests had put off going, upon some bu-
siness that sell out ; and ordered me, with the man and bov,
as usual, to go out with the boat, and catch them some sish,
for that his friends were to sup at his house; he com-
manded me too, that as soon as I had got some sish, I
should bring it home to his hcule; all which I prepared
to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts; for now I found I was likely to have
a little ship at my command; and my master being gone,
I prepared to suinish myself, not for sishing business,
but sor a voyage; though I knew not, neitlier did I ill
much as consider,whither I would steer; for any where
to get cut of that place was my way.
My sirst contrivance was to make a pretence to speak
to this Moor, to get something for cur subsistence on
Doaiu;
board; for I told him we must not presume to eat of our
patron's bread; he {aid, that was true; so he brought
a large baiket of rusk,or biscuit of their kind, and three
jars with fresh water, into the boat: I knew where my
patron's cafe of bottles stood, which it was evident by
the make, were taken out of some English prize, and I
conveyed them into the boat, while the Moor was oil
shore, as if they had been there besore for our master:
I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat,
which weighed about half an hundred weight, with a
parcel of twine or thread, an hatchet, a saw, and an
hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards,
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I
tried upon him, which he innocently came into also; his
name was Iirruiel, whom they call Muley, or Moloy;
so I called to him. "Moloy," said I, "our patron's
"guns are all on board the boat: can you not get a lit-
"tie powder and shot? It may he we may kill some
"aleamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves; for
"I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."
"Yes," says he, "I'll bring some." Accordingly,
he brought a great leather pouch, which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and ano-
ther with shot, that had sive or six pounds, with some
bullets, and put all into the boat: at the same time I
had found some powder of my master's, in the great ca-
bin, with which I silled one of the large bottles in the
cafe, which was almost empty; pouring what was in
it into another; and thus surnished with every thing

which was at the entrance of the port, knew who we
were, and took no notice ot us; and we were not above
a mile out of the port, belore we hauled in our sail, and
sat us down to sish. The wind blew from the N. N. E.
which was contrary to my desire; for h::d it blown
southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain,
and at least reached to the Bay of Cadiz; but my reso-
lutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone
from that horrid place where I was, and leave the ret
to sate. After
Aster we had sished some time, and catched nothing,
(for when I had sish on my hook, I would not pull them
up, that he might not see them) I said to the Moor
"This will not do; our master will not be thus served;
' we must stand sarther osf." He, thinking no harm,
agreed; and being in the head of the boat, set the sails;
and as I had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league
sarther, and then brought her to, as if I would sish;
wheii, giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to
whei e the Moor was; and, making as if I stooped for
fomething behind him, I took him by surprize with my
arm under his twist, and tossed him clear over-board into
the sea: he rose immediately, for he swam like a cork,
and called to me, begging to be taken in, and told me
he would go all over the world with me: he swam so
strong after the boat, that he would have readied me
very quickly, there being but little wind: upon which I
stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-
pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had done
him no hurt, and, if he would be quiet, I would do him
none: "But," said I, " you swim well enough to reach
"the shore, and the sea is calm: make the best of your
"way to the shore, and I will do you no harm: but if
"vou come near the boat, I will moot you through the
"head: for I am resolved to have my liberty." So he
turned himself about, and swam for the shore: and I
make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was
an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy ; but there was no
venturing to trust him : when he was gone, I turned to
the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him
* Xury, if you will be saithsul to me, I will make you
'a great man; but if you will not stroke your sace to be
* true to me, that is, swear by Mahomet and his sather's
'beard, I must throw you into the sea too.' The boy-
smiled in my sace, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him ; and swore to be saithsul to me, and go
all ever the world with me.
P While
"While I was in the view ot the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea, with the boat rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me gone
to.wards the Streights Mouth, (as indeed any one that
had been in their wits must have been suppoied to do :)
for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the
southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole
nations ot Negroes were sure to surround us with their
canoes, and destroy us ; where we could never once go on
shore, but we mould be devoured by savage beasts, or
more merciless savages of human kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I changed
my course, and steered directly S. and by E. bending
my course a little towards the E. that I might keep in
with the more: and having a sair fresh gale of wind, and
a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe by
the next clay at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I
sirst made the land, I could not be less than 150 miles
south of Sallee, quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for
we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadsul apprehensions I had of salling into
their hands, that I would not stop or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, (the wind continuing sair) till I had
sailed in that manner sive days; and then the wind
shifting to the southward, I concluded also, that if any
ot our vessels were in chafe of me, they also would now
give over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river. I knew not
what or where; neither what latitude, what country,
what nation, or what river ; I neither saw, or dessred to
see, any people; the principal thing I wanted was fresh
water. We came into this creek in the evening, resolv-
ing to swim on shoreas soon as it was dark, and discover
the country; but as soon as it was quite dark., we heard
luch dreadsul noises ot the barking, roaring, and howling
of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me
3 not
not to go on shore till day. 'Well, Xury,' said I,
* then I won't; but it may be we may see men by day,
* who will be as bad to us as those lions.'' Then we
* may give them the moot gun,' says Xury, laughing,
'make them run way;' inch English Xury spoke by
conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad to
fee the boy so chearsul, and I gave him a dram out of
our patron's case or bottles, to chear him up: after all,
Xury's advice was good, and I took it; we dropped
our little anchor, and lay still all night; I fty, lay still,
for we flept none: for in two or three hours we law vast
great creatures, we knew not what to call them, of many
iiirts, come to the sea more, and run into the water,
wallowing and washing themselves,for the pleasure of
cooling themselves; and they made fiich hideous bowl-
ings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadsully frighted, and indeed so was I
too: but we were both worse srighted when we heard
one mighty creature come swimming towards our boat;
we could not fee him, but we might hear him by his
blowing, to be a monstrous, huge, and surious beatt.
Xury laid it was a lion, and it might be for ought I
know: poor Xury cried out to me to weigh the anchor,
and row away. 'No,' says I, ' Xury, we can slip our
* cable with a buoy to it, and go to lea: they cannot
'follow us far.' I had no sooner said so, but I perceived
the creature (whatever it was) within two oars length,
which something surprised me; however, I immediately
stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun sired
at him; upon which he immediately turned abou&s and
/"wam towards the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrid noises,
anc! hideous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well
upon the edge of the shore, as higher withinthe country,
i! pon the noise or report ot a gun, a thing I have some reason
to believe those creatures had never heard besore. This
convinced me, that there was no going on shore for us
in the night upon that coast; and how to venture on
jhorc jn the day was another question too } for, to kave
P * ialk4
sallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as
bad as to have sallen into the paws of lions and tygers;
at least, we were equally apprehensive of the danger of
it.
jBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on more
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
lest in the boat; when or where to get to it was the
point: Xury said, if.I would let him go on shore with
one of the jars, he would sind if there was any water,
and bring some to me. I asked him, why he would go;
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The
boy answered with so much asfection, that he made me
love him ever aster: says he, ' If wild mans come,
* they eat me, you go away,'' Well, Xury,' said I;
* We will both go, and if the wild mans come, we will
* kill them; they shall eat neither of us.' So I gave
Xury a piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of
our patron's cafe of bottles, which I mentioned besore,
and we hauled the boat in as near shore as we thought
was proper, and waded on shore, carrying nothing but
our arms and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing
the coming of the canoes with savages down the river:
but the boy seeing a low place, about a mile up the
country, rambled to it, and by and by I saw him come
running towards me: I thought he was pursued by
some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I ran
forwards, towards him, to help him: but when I
came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a
hare, but different in colour, and longer legs ; however,
we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell
me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards, that we need not take such
pains for water; for a little higher up the creek where
.we were, we found the water fresh when the tide was
out, which slows but a little way up; so we silled our
jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared
to
to go 011 our way, having seen no footsteps of any human
creature in that part of the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew
Very well, that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape
tie Verd islands also, lay not sar off from the coast: but
as I had no instruments to take an observation, to know
what latitude we were in, and did not exactlv know, or
at least remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand osf to sea towards
them, otherwise I might now easily have found lome of
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along
this coast till I came to that part where the English,
traded, I should sind some of their vessels upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the place where I now
was must be that country, which, lying between the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies
waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the ne-
groes having abandoned it, and gone sarther south for
fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth
inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness; and, indeed,
both forsaking it, because of the prodigious number of
tygers, lions, leopards, and other Jurious creatures which
harbour there; so that the Moors use it for their hunt-
ing only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time: and, indeed, for near an hun-
dred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but
a waste uninhabited ccuntry by day, and heard nothing
but bowlings and roarings of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice, in the day time, I thought I saw the
Pico os Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain
Teneriffe, in the Canaries; and had a great mind to
venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds,
the sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I re-
lblved to pursue my sirst design, and keep along the
sliore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fre/h-water,
after we had lest thss place; and once in particular, being
P 3 *»%
early in the morning, we came to an anchor under a lit-
tle point os land, which was pretty high; and the tide
beginning to fl< w, we lay still to go sarther in. Xury,
whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were,
calls iestiy to me, and tells me, that we had best go sar-
ther osf the more; ' For,' says he, ' look! yonder lies
'a dreadsul monster on the side os that hillock, sast asleep.*
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadsul monster
indeed! for it was a terrible great lion, that lay on the
side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill,
that hung as it were a little over him. 'Xury,' said I,
"you shall go on shore and kill him.' Xury looked
frighted, and said' Me kill! he eat me at one mouth ;*
one mouthsul, he meant: however, I said no more to the
boy, but bade him be still, and took our biggest gun,
which was almost musquet bore, and loaded it with a
good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it
down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets, and
the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with sive
smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the
50 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
with his leg railed a little above his nose, that the slug
hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He
started up, growling at sirst; but sinding his leg broke,
fell down again, and then got upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar I ever heard. I was a
little surprised that I had not hit him on the head;
however, I took up the second piece immediately, and,
though he began to move off, sired again, and shot him
in the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop; and,
making but little noise, he lay struggling tor life.
Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go
en shore. 'Well, go,' said I. So the boy jumped
into the water, and taking the little gun in one hand,
swam to the shore with the other hand; and coming
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his
ear, and shot him in the head again, which dispatched
him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food j
and
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to
us. However, Xury said, he would have some of him;
fo he comes on. board, and asked me to give him the
hatchet. 'For what, Xury?' laid I. 'Me cut osf
 his head,' said he. However, Xury could not cut off
his head; but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him
and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself, howtver, that perhaps the skin
of him might, one way or other, be of lome value to us,
and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So Xury
and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us (both) the whole day; but at last we
got osf the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of
our cabin, the sun esfectually dried it in two days time,
and it afterwards lerved me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward conti-
nually for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on
our provisions, which began to abate very much; and
going no oftener in to the more than we were obliged to
for fresh water. My design in this was, to make the
river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any where
about the Cipede Verd, where I was in hopes to meet
with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not
what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or
perish there among the negroes. I knew that all the
ships from Europe, which sailed either to the roast of
Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East-Indies, made
this cape, or thi le istands; and, m a word, I put the
whole of my fortune upon this singL point, either that
I must meet with some ship. or mull perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I said, I began to see that the land was in-
habited , and in ;>u<:> or three places, is we saiied by,
we saw people sland upon the shore to Icok at us: we
could also perceive they were quite black, and stark-
naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore
'to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and laid
to
Si LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
the shore, that I might talk to them, and I found they
ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed they
had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a
lbno- slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that
they would throw them a great way with good aim;
so I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs
as well as I could, and particularly made signs for
something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my
boat, and they would fetch me seme meat. Upon this
I lowered the top of my sail; and lay by; and two of
them ran up into the country, and in less than half an
hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh, and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country: but we neither knew what the one or the
other was; however, we were willing to accept it,
But how to come at it was our next dispute; for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as
much afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us all,
for they brought it to the more, and laid it down, and
went and stood a great way osf, till we setched it on
board, and then came cloie to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had no-
thing to make them amends: but an opportunity offer-
ed that very instant to oblige them wondersully; for
"while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty
creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with
great sury, from the mountains towards the sea: -whe-
ther it was the male pursuing the female, or whether
they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any
more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange;
hut I believe it was the latter; because, in the sirst
place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the
night; and, in the second place, we found the people
terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that
had the lance or dart, did not sly from them, but the rest
did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into
the water, they did not seem to osfer to sall upon the
negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swara
about
about as if they had come for their diversion : at last one
of them began to come nearer our boat than at sirst I
expected; but I lay ready for him; for I had loaded my
gun with all possible expedition, and bid Xury load
both the others. As soon as he came sairly within my
reach, I sired and shot him directly in the head:
immediately he "sunk down into the water, but rose in-
stantly, and plunged up and down as if he was struggling
for life: and so indeed he was. He immediately made
to the shore; but between the wound, which was his
mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
besore he reached the more.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and sire of my gun; some of
them were ready even to die for fear, and fell down as
dead with the very terror: but when they saw the crea-
ture dead, and sunk into the water, and that I made signs
to them to come to the shore, they took heart, and came
to the shore, and began to search for the creature. I
found him by his blood staining tha. water, and by the
help of a rope which I slung round him, and gave the
negroes to haul, they dragged him on more, and found
- it was a most curious leopard, spotted and sine to an ad-
mirable degree; and the negroes held up their hands
with admiration, to think what it was I killed him
with.
The other creature, frighted With the flam of sire, and
the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran up di-
rectly to the mountains, from which they came, nor
could I at that distance know what it was. I sound
quickly the negroes were for eating the flew of this crea-
ture; so I was willing to have them take it as a savour
from me, which, when I made signs to them t&at they
might take it, they were very thanksul for. Immediately
they fell to work with him; and though they had no
knife, yet, with a sharpened piece os wood, they took
off his skin as readilv, nay much more readily than we
Would have done with a knife; they offered me some ot
the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give
it
st them: but made signs for the skin, which they gave
me very freely> and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which though I did not understand, yet
I accepted. Then I made signs to them for some wa-
ter, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it's
bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, and that I
wanted to have it silled: they called immediately to
some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I
suppose, in the sun; this they sctdown for me, as besore,
and I lent Xury on more with my jars, and silled
them all three. The women were as stark naked as
the men.
I was now surnished with roots and corn, such as it
was, and water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I
made forward for about eleven days more, without of-
fering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a
great length into the sea, at about the distance of
four or sive leagues besore me: and the sea being
very calm, I kept a large ossing to make this
point: at length, doubling the point at about two
leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on the other
side to lea-ward: then I concluded,as it was most cer-
tain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the Islands called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could not
tell what I had best to do: for if I should be taken
with a fresh gale of wind, Imight neither reach one or other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped,
into the cabin, and let me down, Xury having the helm:
when on a sudden the boy cried out* Master, master, a
'ship was a sail!' and the foolish boy was sighted out
ot his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's
sliips sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten
sar enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the ca-
bin, and immediately saw not only the ship, but what she
was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.
J3ut when 1 observed, the course site steered, I was soor
convsnced,
Convinced they were bound some other way, and did
not design to go any nearer the more; upon which I
stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak
with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not
be able to come in their way, but that they would be
gone by besore I could make any signal to them: but-

glasses, and that it was some European boat, which they
supposed must belong to some ship that was lost: io they
shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged by
this: and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I
made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and
fired a gun, both which they saw: for they told me
they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun:
upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay
by for me, and in about three hours Icameupwiththem.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanilh, and in French, but I understood none of them;
but at last a, Scots sailor, who was on board, called to
me, and I aniv.-ered him, and told him I was an En-
glishman, that had made my escape out of slavery from
the Moors at Sallee; then they bid me come on board,
and very kindly took me in, and all ray goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, any one would be-
lieve, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
itich a miserable and almost hopeless condition as I was
in: I immediately offered all I had to the Captain of the
ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me, he would lake nothing from me, but that all I
had mould be delivered safe to me, when I came to the
Brazils. * For,' says he, I have saved your life on no
'other terms than as I would be glad to be saved my-
'self; and it may one time or other be my lot to betaken
* up in the same condition : besides,' says he, 'when
'I cany you to the Brazils, so great a way from your
* own country, if I should take from you, what little
* you have, you will be starved there, and then I only
'take
* take away that life I have given. No, no,' fays he,
'Signior Inglisc, (Mr. Englishman,) I would cany
'you thither in charity; and these things will help you
* to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
'again.'
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in:
the persormance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen,
that none should offer to touch any thing J had; then he
took every thing into his own possession, and gave me
back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them
again, even so much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat it was a very good one, and that he
saw; and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I told him
he had been so generous to me in every thing, that I
could not offer to make any price of the boat, but lest it
entirely to him; upon which he told me he would give
me a note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight
for it at Brazil: and when it came there, if any one
offered to give more, he would make it up: he offered
me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury,
which I was loth to take; not that I was not willing
to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to fell
thepoor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so saithsully in
procuring my own. However, when I let him know
my reasons, he owned it to be just, and offered me this
medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to
set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon
this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let
the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and ar-
rived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or Saint's Bay,
in about twenty two days after. And now I was once
more delivered from the most miserable os all conditions
of life; and what to do next with myself I was to
consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me I can
never enough remember; he would take nothing of me for
my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
. skin,
flcin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in the
boat; and caused every thing I had in the ship to be
punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing to
iell, he bought; such as the cafe of bottles, two os my
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had
made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about 1z0
pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I
went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended to
the house of a good honest man like himself, who had
an Izgexio, as they call it, that is, a plantation, and a
sugar-house, I liv'd with him some time; and acquaint-
ed myselt, by that means, with the manner of their
planting, and making of iugar; and seeing how well
the planters lived, and how they grew rich iuddenly, I
resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I would
turn planter among- them; resolving, in the mean time,
to sind out some way to get my money which I had lest
in London, remitted to me. T this purpose, getting
a letter of naturalization, I purchaled as much land
as my money would reach; and such an one as
might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my-
selt to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born
of English Parents, whose name was Wells, and in
much such circumstances as I was: I call him neigh-
bour, because his plantation lay next to mine; and we
went on very sociably together; my stock was but low,
as well as his, and we rather planted for food, than any
thing else, for about two years. However, we began
to increase, and our land began to come in order; so
that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made
each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the year to come; but we both wanted help;
and now I found more than besore, I had done wrong
in parting with my boy Xury.
But, aias! for me to do wrong, that never did right,
was no great wonde I had no remedy but to go on.
I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my
E genius,
genius, anc! directly contrary to the life I delighted in,
and for which I forsook my sather's house, and broke
through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into the
very middle station, or upper degree os low life, which
my sather advised me to besore, and which, if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, and
ntver satigued my!ili in the world, as I had done; and
I used osten to say to mysels' I could have done this
'as well in England among my sriends, as have gone
* sive thousand miles osf to do it among strangers and
'savages in a wilderness, and at such a distance, as ne-
'ver to hear from any part of the world that had the
'least knowledge of me.'
In this manner I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with but
now and then this 'neighbour; no work to be done but
by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived
just Lkt a man cast away upon some desolate island, that
. had nobody there but himsels. But how just has it been,
and how mould all men reflect, that when they compare
their present condition with others that are worse, Hea-
ven may oblige them to makethe exchange, and be con-
vinced of their former felicity, by their experience! I
say, how just it has been, that the truly solitary life I
reflected on in an island, or mere desolation, should be
my lot, who had so osten unjustly compared it with the
life I then led, in which had I continued, I had,
in all probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich!
I was in some degree fettled in my measures for car-
rving en the plantation, besore my kind sriend, the cap-
tain of the ship, that took me up at sea, went back;
for the ship remained there in providing her loading,
and preparing for her voyage, near three months; when
telling him what little stock I had lest behind me in
London, he gave me this sriendly and sincere advice
'Signior Ingleie,' lays he, for so he always called me,
'if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in
'form to me, with orders to the person who has your
 money in London, to fend your esfects to Lisbon, to
'such
'such persons as I sha!l direct, and in such goods as are
* proper for this country, I will bring you the produce
'of them, (God willing) at my return; but sirce human
* assairs ave all subject to changes and disasters, I would
'have you give orders but sor iool. sterling, which you
'say is hals your stock, and let the hazard be run for
'the sirst; so that if it comes safe, you may order the
'rest the same way; and if it miscarries, you mav have
* the other half to have recourse to for your supply.'
This was such wholesome advice, and looked so friend-
ly, that I could not but be convinced it was the test
course I could take; so I accordingly prepared letters
to the gentlewoman with whom I had lest my money,
and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a sull account of
all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had
met with the Portuguese cr.ptain at sea, the humanity
os his behaviour, and what condition I whs now in, with
all other necessary directions for my supply; and when
this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means,
by some of the English merchants there, to fend over
not the order only, but a full account of my story to a
merchant in London, who presented it effectually to her;
whereupon sile not only delivered the money, but out
of her own pocket sent the Portuguese captain a very
handsome present for his humanity and charity tome.
The merchant in London vested this iool. in English
goods, such as the captain had written for; sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe
me to the Brazils; among which, without my direc-
tion, (for I was too young 111 my business to think of
them) he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-
work, and utensils necessary for my plantation, and which
were os great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprized with the joy os it; and my
good steward the captain had laid out the el. which
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to pur-
E a chase
chase and bring me over a sen-ant under bond for six
years service; and would not accept os any considera-
tion, except a little tobacco, which I would have him ac-
cept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all English
manusactures, such as clot\ stuff, baize, and things
particularly valuable and desirable in the country, I found
means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that
I may lay, I had more than four times the value of
my sirst cargo, and was now insinitely beyond my poor
neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation;
for the'sirst thing I did, I bought me a negro stave, and
an European servant also; I mean, another besides that
which the captain brought me from Lishon.
But as ?bused prosperity is oftentimes made the very
means or our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I
went on the nexr year with great success in my planta-
tion; I raised sisty great rolls or" tobacco, on my own
ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries
among my neighbours; and these sitly rolls being each
of a'iove one hundred pounds weight, were well cured and
laid by, against the return of the fleet from Li (ban. And
now, increasing in business and wealth, my head began to
be sull of projects andundertakings beyond my reach ; such
as are incited often the ruin ot the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet besallen me,
for which my sather so earnesly recommended a quiet
retired lite, and which he had so sensibly described the
middle station of life to be sull of; but other things at-
tended me, and I was still to be the wilsul agent of all
my own miseries: and particularly to encreaie my sault
and double the leflections upon myself which in my su-
ture sorrows I should have leisure to make; all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate
adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad,
and pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to
the clearest views of doing myself good in a sair and
plain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of
life,
life, which Nature and Providence concurred to present
me with, and to make my duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of rising saster than the na-
ture of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down
again into the deepest gulph ot human misery that ever
man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life
and a state of health in the world.
To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story; you may suppose, that having
now lived almost sour years in the Brazils, and begin-
ning to thrive and prosper very well upon my planta-
tion, I had not only learned the language, but had con-

planters, as well as among the merchants at St. Salva-
dore, which was our port; and that, in my discourse
among them, I had frequently given them an account of
my two voyages to the coast ot Guinea, the manner of
trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it was to
purchase upon the coast, for trifles, (such as beads, toys,
knives, kistars, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like) not
only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants teeth, &c.
but Negroes for the service of the Brazils in great
numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related
to the buying negroes, which was a trade at that time
not only not sar entered into, but, as sar as it was, had
been carried on by the Assientos, (or permission of the
King of Spain and Portugal) and engrossed in the public
stock; so that few Negroes were bought, and those ex-
cessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of thole things very earnestly, three of them came to me
the next morning, and told me they had been musing
E 3 very
very much upon what I had discoursed of with them the
last night; and they came to make a secret proposal to
me; and after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that
thev had a -nind to sit out a ship to go to Guinea; tl\at
they had ail plantations as well as I, and were straitened
for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade
that could not publicly fell the Negroes when they came
home, so. they desired to make but one voyage, to bring
the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them among
their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was
whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to ma-
nage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and
they offered me, that I should have my equal share of
the Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a sair proposal, it must be consessed, had it
been made to any one that had not had a settlement and1
plantation of his own to look after, which was in a sair
way of coming to be very considerable, and, with a good
stick upon it: but with me that was thus established,
and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
Jiree or four years more, and to have sent for the other
iool. from England, and who in that time, and with that
little addition, could scarce have tailed of being worth
3 or 400CI. sterling, and that increasing too: for me to
think of such a voyage, was the most preposteious.
thing that ever man in such circumstances could be
guilty of.
But 1, who was bom to be my own destroyer, could
no more resist the offer than I could restrain my sirst
rambling designs, when my sather's good counsel was
lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go
with all my heart, if they would undertake to look
after mv plantation in my absence, and would dispose
of it to fiich as I should direct, if I miscarried. This
they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or co-
venants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing;
of my plantation and effects, in cafe of my death, mak-
ing the captain olthe ship who had saved my life, as be-
fore, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of
my

produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my esfects, and to keep up my plantation. Had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own in-
terest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to
have done, and not to have dene, I had certainly never
gone away from so prosperous an undertaking; leav-
ing all the probable views of a thriving circumstance,
and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its
common hazards; to say nothing of the reasons I had
to expect particular misfortunes to mylelf.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dic-
tates of my sancy, rather than my reason; and accord-
ingly, the ship being sitted out, and the cargo sinished,
and all things done as by agreement by my partners in
the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour again, the
ist of September 1659, being the lame day eight years"
that I w»nt from my sather and mother at Hull, in or-
der to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my
own interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons
burden, carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the
master, his bov, and myself: we had on board no large
cargo of goods, except of such toys as were sit for our
fade with the Negroes; such as bends, bits of glass,
shdls, and odd trines; especially little looking-glasses,
knives, scislars, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, standing
away to the northward upon our own coasts, with de-
sign to stretch over for the African coast, when we came
into about ten or twelve degrees of 1101 them latitude;
which, it seems, was the manner of their course in
those days: we had very good weather, only excessive
hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came tothn
height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping
sarther oft'at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as
if we were bound for the Isle remand de Noronba,
liulding ,
holding our course N. E. byN. and leaving those isles
on the east. In this courie we passed the line in about
twelve days time, and were by our last observation in
7 degrees zz minutes northern latitude, when a violent
tornado or hurricane, took us quite cut os our know-
ledge. It began from the S. E. came about to the N.
W. then fettled in the N. E. from whence it blew in
such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together,
we could do nothing but drive; and scudding away be-
fore it, let it carry us wherever Fate and the sury of
the winds directed; and during these twelve days I
need not say, that I expected every day to be swallowed
up, nor did any in the ship expect otherwise.
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of a storm,
one of our men die of the calenture, and a man and a
boy wamed over board. About the twelfth day, the
weather abating a little, the master made an observa-
tion as well as he could, and found that he was in about
11 degrees of north latitude, but that he was z2 degrees
*^>f longitude difference west from Cape St. Auguslino,
so that he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guia-
na, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Ama-
zones, towards that ot the river Oroonoque, commonly
called the Great River; and now he began to consult
with me what courie he mould take; for the ship was
leaky, and very much disabled; and he was forgoing
directly back to the coast of Brazil.
I was positively against that; and, looking over the
charts of the sea coast of America with him, we con-
cluded there was no inhabited country for us to have re-
course to, till we came within the circle of the Caribbee
Islands; and theresore resolved to stand away for Bar-
badoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the in-
draught of the bay cr gulph of Mexico, we might easily
persorm, as we hoped, in about sisteen days sail; whereas
we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast
os Africa without, some assistance both to our ship and
to ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, ind steered
2 away
k
away N. W. by W. in older to reach some of our
English islands, where I hoped sor relies: but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for being in ihe la-
titude of u degrees 18 minutes, a second storm came
upon us, which carried us away with the same impetuo-
sity westward, and drove vis so out ot the way of all hu-
man commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to
the sea, we were rather in danger os being devoured by
savages, than ever returning to our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one
of our men, early one morning, cried out' Land !*
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to lookout,
in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, but
the ship struck upon.a sand, and in a moment, her mo-
tion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a
manner, that we expected we should all have perished im-
mediately; and we were even driven into our close
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of
the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the con^rrnation
of men in such circumstances; we knew nothing where
we were, or upon what land it was we were driven,
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not
inhabited: and, as the rage of the wind was still great
though rather less than at sirst, we could not so much as
hope to have the ship hold many minutes without break-
ing in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle,
stiould turn immediately about. In a word, we sat
looking upon one another, and expecting death every
moment, and every man acting accordingly, as prepar-
ing for another world; for there was little or nothing
more for us to.do in this: that which was our present
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that contrary
to our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that
the master said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too sast for us to expect her getting off, we
V/ere in a dreadsul condition indeed, and had nothing to
do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could.
We had a boat at our stern, just besore the storm; but
she was sirst staved by dashing against the ship's rudder,
and in the next place she broke away, and was either
sunk, or driven off to sea; so there was no hope srom
her: we had another boat on board, but how to get her
off into the sea was a doubtful tiiing; however, there
was no room to debate; for we fancied the ship would
break in pieces every minute; and some told us slie was
actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they
got her stung over the ship's side, and getting all into
her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God's mercy, and the wide sea; for though
the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea went
dreadsully high upon the shore, and might well be
called den 'wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all
saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat
could not escape, and that we should be inevitably drown-
ed. As to making sail we had none; nor, if we had,
could we have done any thing with it; so we worked at
the oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like
men going to execution; for we all knew, that when the
boat came near shore, she would be broke in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we com-
mitted our souls to God in the most earnest manner, and
the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened our
destruction with our hands, pulling, as well as we could,
towards the land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was,
if we might happen into some bay or gulps1, or the mouth
of some river, whereby great chance we might have run
our boat in, or got under the lee of the land; and per-
haps made smooth water. But there was nothing of
this
th;s appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
shore, the land looked more frightsul than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and an half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mauntain like, came rolling a-stern of us, and plainly-
bid us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it took 113
with inch a sury, that it overset the boat at once, and
separating us, as well srom the boat as from one ano-
ther, gave us not time hardly to say, ' O God V for
we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the contusion os thought which
I selt when I sunk into the water: for though I swam
very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves
ib as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me
or rather carried me a vast way on towards the shore, and
having spent itself, went back, and lest me upon the
land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took
in: I had so much presence os mind, as well as breath
lest, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got upon my seet, and endeavoured to make
on towards the land, as sast as I could, besore another
wave should return, and take me up again. But I
foon sound it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the
sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as surious
as an enemy which I had no means or strength to con-
tend with; my business was to hold my breath, and
raise myself upon the water, if I could, and so by iwim-
ing to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards
the shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being,
that the wave, as it would cany me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back
again with it, when it gave back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet in its own body ; and I could
feel myself carried with a mighty force and swistness
towards the shore, a very great way; but I held my
breath, and assisted myself to swim still sorward with all
my might. I was ready to burst with holding my
breath, when, as I found myself rssing up, sa, to my
immediate
immediate rel.es, I found my head and hands shoot oirt
above the l'urlace ot the water; and though it was not
two seconds of time that I coi.ld keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage.
I v/as covered again with water a good while, but not
fo long bu* I held it out; and sinding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I struck, forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again
with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover
breath, and till the waters went from me, and then I
took to my heels, and ran with what strength I had sar-
ther towards the shore. Eut neither would this deliver
me from the sury of the sea, which came pouring aster
me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the waves,
and carried forwards as besore, the shore being very
siat.
The last time of these two had well near been satal
to me; for the sea, having hurried me along as besore,
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece os a
rock, and that with such sorce, as it lest me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the
blew taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it"
were, quite out of my body; and had i: returned again
immediately, I must have been strangled in the water;
but I recovered a little besore the return of the waves;
and seeing I sltoul.l be covered again with the water, I
resolved to hold sast by a piece of the rock, and fo to
4? LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
New as the waves were not so high as at sirst, being
near land, I held my hold till the wave abated; and
then fetched another run,' which brought me so near
the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me,
yet did not swallow me up so as to carry me away; and
the next run I took, I got to the main land, where, to
my great comfort, I clambered up the cliftsof the shore
and iat me down upon the grafs, free from danger, and
quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
lookup and tliank God that my life was saved, in a case
whevtin
wherein there was, some minutes besore, scarce any
.room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express to
the lite, what the ecstacies and transports of the fowl
are, when it is so savtd, a6 I may say, out of the very
grave; and I do not wonder now at that custom, viz.
that when a malesactor, who has the halter about his
neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and
has a reprieve brought him; I say, I do not wonder
that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that
very moment they tell him of it, that the surprize may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and over-
whelm him.
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at sirst.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands;
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions, which I cannot describe, reflecting
upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that
there should not be one soul saved but myself; for as
for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of
them, except ^hree of their hats, one cap, and two shoes
that were not sellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach,
and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it,
it lay so sar off; and considered, ' Lord! how was it
'possible I could get on shore!'
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to see
what kind of place I was in, and what was next to
be done; and I soon sound my comforts abate, and that,
in a word, I had a dreadsul deliverance; for I was wet,
had no clothes to shist me, nor any thing either to eat
or drink, to comfort me; neither did I lee any pro-
spect besore me, but that of perishing with hunger, or
being devoured by wild beasts; and that which was
partici'larly affecting to me was, that I had no wea-
pon either to hunt or kill any creature for my suste-
V nance,
nance, or to desend myself against any other creature*
that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about me but a knise, a tobacco-pipe, and
a little tobacco in a box ; this was all my provision; and
this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, so that for
a while I ran about like a mad man. Night coming upon
me, I began, with an heavy heart, to consider what
would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts in
that country, feeing at night they always come abroad
for their prey.
All the remedy that osfered to my thoughts at that
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a sir,
but thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved
to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I
should die; for, as yet, I saw no prospect of life. I
walked about a surlong from the shcre, to see if I could
sind any fresli water to drink, which I did to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my
mouth, to prevent hunger, I went to the tree; and,
getting up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as
that, if I mould sleep, I might not fall; and, having
cut me a ftiort stick like a truncheon, for my desence,'I
took up my lodgings; and having been excessively sa-
tsgued, I sell sast asleep, and slept as comfortably as I
believe any person could have done in my situation.
When I awoke it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated ; I was greatly surprised so sind the
ship bad been lifted off in the night, from the sand
where me lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was
driven up almost as sar as the rock which I sirst men-
tioned, and where I had been so bruised by being
dashed against it: this being within about a mile srom
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
up still, I wished myself on board, that at least, I might
save some necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree,
I looked ahout me again; and the sirst thing I found
was the boas, which l?.y as the wind and sea had tossed.
her upon the land, aboui two miles to my right hand. I
walked
Walked as sar as I could upon the shore to get at her;
but sound a neck or inlet of water between me and the
boat, which was about half a mile broad; so I came
back for the present, being more intent upon getting
to'the ship, where I hoped to sind something for my pre-
fent subsidence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the
tide ebbed so sar out, that I could come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the rh p: and here I found a fresh re-
newing of my gries; for I saw evidently that if we had
kept on board, we had been all safe; that is to say we
had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so misera-
ble as to be lest entirely destitute of all comfort and
company, as I now was: this forced tears from my
eyes again; but as there was little relies in that, I re-
folved if possible to get to the ship; so I pulled osf my
cloathes and took to the water; but when I came to the
ship, my dissiculty was still greater to know how to get
on board: as she lay a-ground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of: I swam round her twice, and the second time I
espied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not
see at sirst, hang down by the fore-chains, so low, as
with great dissiculty I got hold of it, and by the help of
that rope, got up into the fore-castle of the ship. Here
1 found that she was bulged, and. a great deal of water
in the hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard
sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up on the
bank, and consequently her head low t"d the water: by this
means all her quarter was free, arid all that was in that
dry; for you may be sure my work was to search, and part
to see what was spoiled and what was not: and sirst I

touched by the water; and being very well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread-room, and silled my pockets
with biscuit, and eat as I went about other things, for I
had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had,
indeed, need enough of, to raise my drooping spirits.
F 2 No\t
Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to surnish myself
with many things which I foresaw would be very ne-
cessary.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to
behad; and this extremity rouzed my application. We
had several spare yards, and two or three large spars of
wood, and a spare top-maft or two in the ship; I re-
solved to go to work with these, and threw as many of
them over-board as I could manage for their weight,
tying every one with a rope, that they might not drive
away; when this was done, I went down the ship's side,
and drawing them to me, I tied four of them sast toge-
ther at both ends as well as I could, in the form of a
raft; and, laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it
very well, but that it was not able to bear any great
weight, the pieces being too light. To remove this
inconvenience, with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-
mast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with
a great deal of labour and pains; but the hope ct sur-
nishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to go be-
yond what I should have been able to have done upon
another occasion.
My raft being now strong enough to bear any rea-
fonable weight, my next care was what to load it with,
and how to preserve what was on it from the surs of the
sea; but I was not long considering this: I sirst laid
all the planks or boards upon it that I could get; and
having considered well what I most wanted, I got three
of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the sirst
of these I silled with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, sive pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we
lived much upon, and a little remainder of European
corn, which had been laid by for some fowls we brought
to sea with us, but the fowls were killed; there had
been some barley and wheat together; but to my great
disappointment, I found afterwards, that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several
caies
tales of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters, and in all abcut live or six gallons
os arrack; these I stowed by themselves, there being no
need to put them into the chest, nor indeed any room for
them. While I was doing this, I found the tide began
to flow, though very calm, and I had the mortisication
to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on
fliore upon the sand, go away; as for my breeches,
which were only linen, and open at the knees, I swam
on board in them and my stockings: however, this put
me upon rummaging sor cloaths, of which I found
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present
use, for I had other things which my eye was more
upon; as, sirst, tools to work with on shore, and it was
aster lor.r; searching that I found out the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very usesul prize to me, and
much more valuable than a ship-loading of gold
would have been at that time. I got it down to my
rast, even whole as it was, without losing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was tor some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured with some pow-
der horns, a small bag of shot, and two eld rusty swords:
I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship,
but could not tell where the gunner had stowed them;
but with much search I found them: two were dry and
good, but the third had taken water; the two that were
good I got to my raft with the arms. And now I
thought mylelf prettv well freighted, and began to think
how I should get tc shore with them, having neither sail,
oar, or rudder, and the least cap-lull ot wind would have
overset all my navigation.
- 1 had three encouragements: i. A smooth and calm
sea. z. The tide rising and setting in to the shore.
3. What little wind there was blew me towards the
l3nd. And thus, having feund two or three broken
oars belonsin;" to the bet, besides the tools which were
in the chest, two sews, an axe ,and a hammer, with this
F 3 cargo
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my
raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before; bjr
which I perceived there was some indraught of the wa-
ter, and consequently I hoped to sind some creek of the
river there, which I might make use of as a port to get to
land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared besore me
a little opening of the land. I found a strong current
of the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as
I could to keep in the middle of the stream: but here I
had like to have susfered a second shipwreck, which, if
I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for,
knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run aground at
one end upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other,
all my cargo had nearly slipped off towards that end
which was a-float, and so sallen into the water: I did
my utmost to prevent this, by setting my back against
the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust osf the raft with all my strength; neither durst I
stir from the posture I was in, but supporting the chests
with all my might, stood in that manner near half an
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me
a little more upon a level; and soon aster, the water itill
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with
the oar I had into the channel; and then driving up
higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little
river, with land on both sides, and a strong current of
tide running up. I looked on both sides for a proper
place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high uptheriver, hoping in time to let- some ship at
sea, and theresore resolved to place myself as near
the coast as I could.
At length I espied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to which, with great pains and dissiculty, I
guided my raft; and at last got so near, that, reaching
ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in; but
here I had like to have dipped all my cargo in the sea
again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to sav,
'sloping

slopsng, there was no place to land, but where one em*
os the float, if it ran on shore, would be so high, and the
otiier sink lower, as besore, that it would endanger my
cargo again: all that I could do, was to wait till the
tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar
like an anchor, to hold the side of it sast to the more,
near a slat piece of ground which I expected the water
would slow over; and so it did. As soon as I found
water enough (sor my raft drew about a foot of water)
I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there sas-
tened or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars
into the ground; one on one side, near one end, anil one
en the other side near the other end; and thus I lay till
the water ebbed away, and lest my raft and all my cargo
safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek apro-
per place for my habitation, and where to stow my
goods, to secure them from whatever might happen.
Where I was I yet knew not ; whether on the continent
or on an island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited;
whether in danger oi wild beasts, or not. There was a
Mil not above a mile srom me, which rose up very steep
<=r.d high, 7-iid which seemed to over-top some other hills
that lay as in a ridge from it northward: I took out one
cf tlie fowling-pieces, and one ot the pistols, and a horn
of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery
up to the top of that hill, where, after I had with great
labour and difficulty got up, I immediately saw my sate
to my great affliction; viz. that I was in an island en-
vironed every way with the sea, no hnd to be seen except
some rocks which lay a great way off, and two. islands
Jess tiian this, which lay about three leagues to the
weft.
I sound also that the island I was in was barren, and,
ii3 I had rar.Icn *o relieve, uninhahited, except by wild
beasts, ofwhicb,however, I saw none; but I discovered
abundance of fowls, though I bio no* their kinds;
neither, when I killed them, co:du I tell what was sit
*'<". food, ar,d what noi. On i..y reiuni I shot at a great
bird
bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a large
wood: I believe it was the sirst gun that had been sired
there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
sired, but from all parts of the wood there arose an ex-
traordinary number of fowls of many sorts, making a
consused screaming and crying, every one according to
his usual note; but not one of them of any kind that I
knew; as for that creature I killed, I took it to be a
kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it
had no talons or claws more than common; its flesh was
carrion and sit fer nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and began working to bring my cargo on shore, which
took me up the rest of the day: what to do with myself
at night, I knew not, nor indeed where to rest; for I
was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but
some wild beast might devour me, though I afterwards
found there was really no need for those sears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought on
shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's lodging:
as for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself,
except that I had observed two or three creatures like
hares nan out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great
many things out of the ship which would be useful to
me, and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and
iiich other things as might come to hand; and I
resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if
possible; and as I knew the sirst storm that blew must
necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all
other things apart till I got every thing out of the ship I
could. I then called a council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether or not I should take back the raft;
but this appeared impracticable; io I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down ;' and I did so, only
that I stripped besore I went from my hut, having no-
thing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I £Ot
I got on board the ship as-before: and prepared a se-
cond raft; and having had experience from the sirst, I
neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard;
but vet I brought away several things very usesul to me:
as,- sirst in the carpenter's store I found two or three
bags sull of nails and spikes, a great lcrew jack, a dozen
or two of hatchets, and above all, that most usesul thing
called a grind-stone: all these I secured, together with
several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two
or three iron-crows, and two barrels of musket bullets,
seven muikets, and another fowling-piece, with some
small quantity of powder more; a large bag sull of
small shot, and a great roll of meet lead; but this last
was so .heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the
ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's cloaths that
I could sind, and a spare fore-top sail, hammock, and
some bedding; and with this I loaded my second rait,
and brought them also all iafe on shore, to my very
great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be de-
voured on shore; but when I came back, I found no
fign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a wild cat
upon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it,
ran away to a little distance, and then stood still; she sat
very composed and unconcerned, and looked sull in my
sace, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I
presented my gun at her, but she did not understand it,
me was persectly unconcerned at it, nor did she osfer to
stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit,
though by the way I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I say, and
stie went to it, smelled of it, and eat it, and looked (as if
pleased) for more; but as I could spare no more, she
marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, (though I was
obliged to open the barrels of powder, and bring them
by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks)
I went
I went to work to make a little tent with the sail, and
some poles which I cut for that purpose; and , into this
tent I brought every thing that I knew would spoil,
either with rain or liin; I piled all the empty chests and
caiks up in a circle round the tent, to fortisy it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest let
up ail end without; and spreading one of the beds upon
the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and
my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the sirst:
time, and flept very quietly all night: I was very weary
and heavy; for the night besore I had slept little, and
had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch those
things srom the ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the largest magazine of all kinds now that ever
was laid up, I believe for one man ; but I was not sa-
tissied still; for while the stup was in an upwright pos-
ture, I thought I ought to get every thing out cf her I
could; so every day at low water I went on board, and
brought away something or other; but particularly the
third time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine
I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was
to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet
fun-powder; in a word, I brought away all the sails
rst and last, only that I was obliged to cut them ill
pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for
they were no more usesul to me for sails, but as mere
canvas only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that at
last of all, after I had made sive or six such voyages as
these, and thought I had nothing more to expect from
the ship, that was worth meddling with; I say, alter
all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large
rundlets of rum or spirits, a box of sire sugar, and a
barrel of sine flour; this was surprizing to me, becaule
I had given over expecting any mere provisions, except
what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hog-
shead
fcead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcelj
in pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word,
I got all this safe on shore also, though at several
times.
The next day I made another voyage; and now hav-
ing plundered the ship of what was portable, and sit to
hand out, I began with the cables ; and cutting the
great cable into pieces, such as I could move, 1 got
two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron work
1 could get; and having cut down the sprit-sail-yard and
the mizen yard, and every thing I could to make a large
rast, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came
away: but my good luck began to leave me; for this
was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I had en-
tered the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my
gcods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the
other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into
the water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I
was near the more; but as to my cargo, it was great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me; however, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore,
and some of the iron, though with insinite labour, for
I was obliged to dip for it into the water, a work which
satigued me very much; after this, I went every day on
board, and brought away what I could get,
I had been thirteen days on shore, and eleven times on
board the ship; in which time I had brought away all
that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable
to briifg; though I believe verily, had the calm wea-
ther held, I should have Drought away the whole ship,
piece by piece : but preparing for the twelsth time to go
on board, I found the wind began to rise; however, at
low water, I went on board; and though I thought I
had rummaged the cabin so esfectually as that nothing
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three ra-
zors, and one pair of large sciffars, with ten or a dozen
good knives and forks; in another, I found aboujt
thirty-six
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin,
some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some
silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this monev. 'O'
* drug!' said I aloud, what art thou good for? Thou
* art of no worth to me, no, not the taking osf the
'groundt. one of those knives is worth all this heap;
* I have no manner of use for thee ; even remain where
'thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose
* life is not worth saving!' However, uprn second
thoughts, I took it away, and,wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft; but while I was preparing this, I sound the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter
os an hour it blew a fresh gale from the mere; it pre-
sently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a raft, with the wind osf more, and that it was
my business to be gone besore the tide of flood began,
otherwise I might not be able to reach the more at'all:
accordingly, I let myself down into the water; and
swam across the channel, which lav between t«e ship
and the sand, and even that with great dissiculty, partlv
with the weight of the things I had about me, and
partly the rougnese of the water; for the wind role
very hastily, and besore it was quite high water, it blew
a storm.
But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay
with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew hard
all that night; and in the morning, when I looked out, 
behold, no more ship was to be seen. I was a little
surprized; but recovered myself with this satissactory
reflection; viz. that I had lost no time, nor abated any
diligence, to get every thing out of her that could be
usesul to me ; and that indeed there was little lest in her
that I was able to bring away, if I had more time. I
now gave over any more thought of the ship, or of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from
iards
My
_j _- ? j._ ..4.,.,. ,u.^ut Mi 1 >v v"ii lj.ijit liui:
her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterward
did; but those things were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about se-
curing myself against either savages, if any mould appeai-,
qr wild beasts,.if any were in the island, and I had many
thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind
of dwelling to make; whether I should make me a cave
in the earth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short,
I resolved upon both: the manner and descrption
of which it may not be improper to give an ac-
count.
I soon found the place I was in would not do for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moenOi ground near the sea, and I believed would not
be wholesome, and more particularly, because there
was no water near it; so I resolved to sind a more
healthy and more convenient spot of ground.
. I consulted several things in my situation, which I
found would be proper for me; sirst, health and fresh
water; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun;
thirdlv, security from ravenous creatures, whether man
or beast; fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent
?ny ship insight, I might not lose any advantage of my
deliverance, for which I was not willing to bannish my
expectation.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose form towards
this little plain was as steep as an house side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top: on
the side ot this reck there was an hollow place, worn a
littie way in, like the entrance or door of a cave, hut
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just besore this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above
an hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and
lay like a green besore the door, and at the end of it
descended irregularly every way down into the low-
grounds by the lea-side. It was on the N. N,. W. side
of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the heat every
day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
vvhkh in those countrses is near the setting.
G Previous
Previous to setting up my tent, I drew an half cir-
cle besore the hcllow place, which took in about ten
yards in it's iemi-diameter from the rock, and twenty
yards in its diameter from it's beginning and ending.
In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very sirm
like piles ; the biggest end being out of the ground
above rive feet and an half, and sharpened on the top:
the two rows did not stand above six inches from one
another.
I then took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the
ship, and laid them in rows upon one another, within
the circle, between those two rows of stakes, up to the
top; placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against
them, about two feet and a half high, like a ipur to a.
post; and this fence was so strong, that neither man
nor beast could get into it, or over it. This cost me a
great deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles
in the wood, bring them to their places, and drive them
into the earth.
I made the entrance into this place not by a dcor,
but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder,
when I was in, I lifted over after me; and so I was
completely fenced in, and fortisied, as I thought, from
all the world, and consequently slept secure in the night,
which otherwise I could not have done: though, as it
appeared asterwards, there was no need of ail this caution
against enemies from whom I had apprehended danger.
Into this sence, or fortress, with insinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores; and I made me a large tent also, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there. I made it double, viz. one smaller
tent within, and one larger tent above it; and covered
the uppermost part with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a time in the bed which
I had brought on shore, but in an hammock, which was
indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of
the ship. * Into
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everv
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus in-
closed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till
now I had left open, and so pasted and repassed, as I
laid, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way into
the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug
down, and through my tent, I laid them up within my
fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it railed the
ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made
a cave just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar
.to my house.
. It cost me much labour, and many days, before all
these things were brought to persection. At the same
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for setting
up the tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain
salling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash os light-
ning happened, which was succeeded by a violent clap
of thunder. I was not so much iurprized with the
lightning, as I was with the thought which darted into
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 63
der!' My very heart funk within me, when I thought,
that at one blast all my powder might be destroyed; on
which, not my desence only, but the providingmy food,
as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing near so
anxious about my own danger; though, had the powder
took sire, I should have never known who had hurt
me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over, I laid aside all my work, my building
and fortifying, and applied myiclf to make bags and
boxes to separate my powder, and to keep it a little and
little in parcels, in hopes, that whatever might come, it
might not all take sire at once, and to keep so apart,
that it should not be possible to make one part sire ano-
ther. I sinished this work in about a fortnight: and I
think my powder, which in all was about 140 pounds
weight, was divided into no less than an hundred parcels.
-As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend
G 1 any
any danger from that, so I placed a part of it in my new
cave, which I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid ujJ
and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very caresully where I
laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out at least once every day with my gun, as well to divert-
myself, as to fee it I could kill any thing sit for food,
and as near as I could to acquaint myself with what the
Island produced. The sirst time I went out, I soon dis-
covered that there were goats in the Island, which w3s a
great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this misfortune, viz. that they were so shy, so subile,
and so swift of soot, that it was the most difsicult thing
in the world to come at them; but I was not discou-
raged at this, not doubting but I might now and then
sooot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found
their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them.
I observed, if they law me in the vallies, thiaigh they
vere upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terri-
lvle sright; but if they were seedingin the vallies, and I
was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that by the position ot their optics,
their sight was so directed downward, that they did not
readily fee objects that were above them. In consequence
or tins observation, I took the sollowing method: I al-
ways climbed the rocks sirst, to get above them, and
then bad frequently a sair mark. The sirst shot I nvde
among the:e creatures I killed a she-goat which hid a lit-
tle kid by her, to whom she gave luck, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid stood
stock-still by her till I came and took h. r up; nrA r.ot
cnly so, but when I carried the old one with me upon
my moulders, the kid sallowed me quite to mv inclosure;
upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in
my arms, and carried it over mv pale in hopes to have
bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was sorced
to kill it, and eat it myself; these two hipplied me with
flesii a great while, tor I eat sparingly, and saved
my
my provisions (my bread especially) as much as I pos-
sibly could.
Having now sixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a sire in, and suel
to burn; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarged
my cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a
sull account of in it's place: but I must sirst give some
little account of myselt, and os my thoughts about liv-
ing, which it may well be supposed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I
was not cast away upon that Island without being driven,
as is said by a violent storm quite out of the courie of
our intended voyage, and a great way, viz. some hun-
dreds of leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade
of mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a deter-
mination of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in
this desolate manner, I should end my lise; the tears
would run plentisully down my sace when I made these
reflections: and sometimes I expostulated with myself,
why Providence should thus compleatly ruin it's crea-
tures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so aban-
doned without help, and so entirely depressed, that it
could hardly be rational to be thanksul for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particu-
larly one day walking with my gun in mv hand by the .
fea side, I wa's very pensive upon the subject of my pre-
sent condition, when reason, ns it were, put in, expostulat-
ing with me the other way, thus; ' Well, you are in a
 desolate condition, 'tis true; but, pray, remember,
'where are the rest of you! Did not you come eleven of
'you into the boat? Where are the ten? Why are
'not they saved, and you lost? Why are you singled
'out? It is better to be here or there?' And then I
pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with
the gcod that is in them, aud with what worse attended
them.
It then occurred to me agnin,' how well I was sur-
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been my
G 3 case,
rase, if it had not happened, -which ivaj an hundred
thousand to one, tliat the ship floated irom the place
where sirst sae struck, and wa> driven lo near to the shore
that I had time togu ail these things out other. What
would have been my cafe, is I had been to have lived in
the condition in winch I at sirst came on shore, without
necessaries of lise, or any means to lupply and procure
them?  Particularly,' said I aloud, (though to my-
sels) 'what could I have done without a gun; without
'ammunition; without any tools to make any thing,
* or to work with? without cloaths, bedding, a tent,
* or any manner os coverings,?' And that now I had
asl these to a sussicient quantity, and was in a sair wav
to provide myself in juch a manner, as to live without
my gun when my ammunition was spent, so that I had
a tolerable view os subsisting without any want as long
as I lived: for I considered from the beginning how
I sli.:uld provide sir the accidents that might happen,
and for the time that was to come, even not only aster
my ammunition should be ipent, but even alter my health
or strength should decay.
I consess I had not then entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean, my
powder being blown up by lightning; and this made
the thoughts of it surprizing to me, when it thundered
and lightened.
And now, being to enter into a melanc'.'-oly relation
of a scene of silent Hie, such perhaps as was never
heard of in the world besore, I shall take it srom its be-
ginning, and continue it in it's order. It was, by my
account, the 30th ot September, when, in the manner
a.* before observed, I sirst set foot upon this horrid
Island, when the sun, being to us in it's autumnal equi-
nox, was almost just over my head; for I reckoned my-
self, by observation, to be in the latitude ol oo-grees 1%
minutes south of the line.
After I had been there about sen or twelve days, it
came in;o my thoughts chat I should lose my reckoning
of tune for want os books, and pen and snk, ana should
even
even forget the Sabbath-days from the working-davs;
but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large
post, in capital letters; and making it into a great cross,
I set it up on the shore where I sirst landed, viz. ' I came
'onshore here the 30th of September, 1659.' Upon
the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh day a notch as long again
as the rest, and every sirst of the month as long again as
that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly,
monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place, we are to observe, that among the
many things which I brought from the ship in several
voyages, which (as besore-mentioned) I made to it, I
got several things of less value,but not at all less usesul
to me, which I omitted setting down besore; as in par-
ticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the cap-
tain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three
or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspectives, charts, and books of navigation, all which
I huddled together, whether I might want them or no;
also I found three very good bibles, which came to me
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things: some Portugueze books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and se-
veral other books, all which I caretully secured. And I
must not forget that we had in the ship a dog ?.r.A two
cats, of whose eminent history I must have occasion to
say something in it's place; for I carried both the cats
with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship,
and swam to me the day aster I went on shore with my
sirst cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years;
I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any com-
pany that he could make up to me; I only wanted to
have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I
observ d besore, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I hus-
banded them to the utmost; and while my ink lasted,
I kept things very exact, but after that was gone, I
could not; tor I could not make ink, by any means I
could devsse.
And
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all I had amassed together; and
or these, this of ink was one; as a Ho a spade, pick-axe,
and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,
and thread. As for linen, I loon learned to want that
without much dissiculty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on hea-
vily, and as it was near a whole year besore I had en-
tirely sinished my little pale, or surrounded habitation;
the piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well
lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the
woods, and more by sar in bringing home; so that I
spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the
ground; for which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood
at sirst, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows, which however, though I found, it yet made driv-
ing those posts or piles very laborious and tedious
work.
But what need I have been concerned at the tedious-
ness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough
to do it in1. Nor had I any other employment, if that
had been over, at least that I could foresee, except rang-
ing the Island, to seek for food, which I did more or less
everyday.
I now began seriously to consider my condition, and
the circumstances I was reduced to, and I drew up the
slate of my affairs in writing: not so much to leave them
to any that were to come aster me, (for I %vas like to have
but few heirs) as to del ver my thoughts from daily pour-
ing upon them, and afflicting my mind; aud as my rea-
son began now to master my despondency, I comforted
myself as well as I could, and so set the good against the
evil, that 1 might have something to distinguish my case
from a worse; and I Hated it very impartially, like
debtor and creditor, (the comfort I enjoyed, against the
miseries I suffered) thus
EVIL.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce any condition in the world so mi-
serable, but there was something; negative, or something
positive, to be thanksul in it; and let this stand as a di-
rection from the experience of the most miserable of ail
conditions in this world, that we may always sind in it
fomething to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the
description of good and evil, on the credit side of the ac-
count.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and given over locking out to sen, in hopes
of observing a ship; I say, giving over these things I
began to apply myself to accommodate mv way of liv-
ing, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong
pale ot posts and cables', but I might now rather call it
a wall; for I railed a kind of wa'l up against it of turfs,
about two feet thick on the outside; and after some
time, (I think it was a year and an half) I niled rafters
from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered
it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get
to
to keep out the; rain, which I found at some times ofthe
year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods
into this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind
ine; but I must observe too, that, at sirst, this was a con-
sused heap ot goods, which, as they lay in no order, so
they took up all my place; I had no room to turn my-
sels, and theresore set about enlarging my cave, by work-
ing sarther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock,
which yieldedeasdy to the labour I bestowed on it.
When I found myself pretty safe as to beasts of prey,
I worked side-ways to the right-hand into the rock; and
then turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made my door to come out to the out-side of my pale or
fortisication.
This gave me not only to egress and regress, as it
was a back-way to my tent, and to my store-house, but
also ruom to stow my goods.
And now I begun to apply myself to make such neces-
sary things as I found I most wanted, particularly a
chair and a table; for, without these, I was not able to
enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not
write or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure,
without a table.
Accordingly I went to work; and here I must observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathe-
matics, so, by stating and squaring every thing by rea-
fon, and by making the most rational judgment of things,
every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic
art. I had never handled a tool in my life, and yet in
time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I found
at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it,
especially if I had had tools; however, I made abun-
dance of things even without tools, and some with no
more tools than an adze and an hatchet, which perhaps
were never made that way besore, and that with insi-
nite l.ibour. For example; if I wanted a board, I had
no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge
besore
oesore me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe,
till I.had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then
dub- it smooth with my adze; it is true, by this method
I could make but one board out ot a whole tree; but this
I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had
for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took
me up to make a plank or board; but my time or labour
was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way
as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served besore, in the sirst place, and this I did out of the
short pieces of boards I brought on my raft from the
sliip; but when I had wrought out some boards, I made
large shelves of the breadth of a foot nr.d au half, one
over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay my
tools, nails, and iron-work on; and, in a word, to sepa-
rate every thing at large in their places, that I might ea-
sily come at them: also I drove pieces into the rock, to'
hang my guns, and all things that would hang up.
'By these means my envt looked like a general maga-
zine of all necessary articles; and I had everything lo
ready at hand, that it v.-is a great pleasure to me to see
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 71
stock of all necessaries :o great.
And now it was when I began to keep a iournal of
every day's employment; for, indeed, at sirst I was in
too much hurry, and not only an hurry at to l ibour, but
in too much discomposure os mind, ind my j urnal would
have been sull of many dull things. For example; I
must have said thus: 'September the 30th, alter I got
* to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being
'thanktul to God for my deliverance, having at sirst vo-
'mited a great quantity of salt-water, which was
* gotten into my stomach, and recoveri-.r; mysels a little,
'I ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beat-
'ing my head and sace, exclaiming at my misery, and
* crying out, I was undone, undone! till, tired and
'saint, I was forced to he down en the ground to re-
'pose, but durst not lltcp for sear of being devoured.
'Some
'Some days after this, and after I had been onboard
* the ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet I
* could not forbear getting up to the top of a little moun-
* tain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship;
'then sancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, pleated my-
* self with the hopes of it, and then after looking stea-
'dily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down
'and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by
'my folly.'
But having got over these things in some measure,
and having settled my houshold surniture and habita-
tion, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about me as I could, I began, I say, to keep my journal,
of which I shall here give you the copy (though in it
will be told all these particulars over again) as long as
it lasted: for at length having no more ink, I was
forced to leave it off.
JOURNAL.'
CEPTEMBER 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Ro-
binson Crusoe, being shipwiecked during a dread-
ful storm in the osfing, came on shore in this dismal,
unsortunate island, which I call, The island of Despair:
all the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and
myself almost dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in asflicting myself at
the dismal circumstances I was brought to; viz. I had
neither food, house, cloaths, weapon, or place to fly to:
and, in despair of any relies, saw nothing but death be-
fore me; either that I should be devoured by wild-beasfs,
murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of
food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree for
fear of wild-creatures, but slept icunuly, though it rained
all night.
October 1. In the morning, I saw, to my great sur-
prize, the ship had floated with the high tide, and W3S
driven on shore again much nearer the island; which, as
it was seme comlort on the one hand, (for seeing her si-
upright
tlpright, and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind
abated, I might get on board, and get some food and ne-
cessaries out of her for my relies;) so, on the other
hand, it renewed my gries at the lois of my comrades,
who, I imagined, if we had all staid on board, mio-ht
have saved the ship, or at least that they would not have
been all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might, perhaps, have built us a boat out
of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some
other part of the world. I spent great part of this
day, in perplexing myself on these things; but at length,
seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near
as I could, and then swam on board. This day also
continued raining, though with no wind at all.
From the ist of October to the z4th. All these days
entirely spent in different voyages to get all I could
out of the ship: which I brought on sliore every tide of
flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in these days, though
with some intervals of fair weather; but, it seems, this
was the rainy season.
October 14. I overset my raft, and alTthe goods I had
got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide
was out.
October 15. It rained all night and all day, with,
some gusts of wind; during which time the (hip broke
in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder than before,
and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,
and that only at low water. I spent this day in cover-
ing and securing the goods, which I had saved, that the
rain might not spoil them.
October a 6. I walked about the sliore almost all day,
to sind out a place to six my habitation; greatly con?
cerned to secure myseli irom any attack in the night, ei-
therfrom wild beasts or men. Towanlsnight I sixed upoa
a proper place under a rock, and marked out a semicircle
for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen
with a work, wall, or fortisication, made of double
piles, lined within with cable, and without with turf.
H From
From the z6th to the 30th, I worked very hard <*
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island
with my gun to fee for some food, and discover the
country; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed
me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it would
not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the sirst night, making it as large as I could,
with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.
November z. I set up all my chests and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my raft, and with them
formed a fence round me, a little within the place I had
marked out for my fortisication.
November 3. I went out with my gun, and killed
two fowls like ducks, which were very good food. la
the afternoon, went to work to make me a table.
November 4. This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep,
^nd time of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain;
then employed myself at work till about eleven o'clock;
then eat what I had to live on; and from twelve till
two I lay down to steep, the weather being excessive hot;
JUid then in the evening to work again: the working
part of this day and the next were wholly employed in
making this table, for I was yet but a very sorry work-
man, though time and necessity made me a compleat na-
tural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do any
©ne else.
November $. This day I went abroad with my gu«
.and my dog, and killed a wild-cat; her skin was pretty
soft, but her stem good for nothing: every creature I
:killed I took osf the skins and preserved them. Com-
ing back by the sea-shore, I few many sorts os sea-fowls
with which I was unacquainted; but was surprized, and
almost frighted, with two or three seals, which, while I
was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got
m» the sea, and escaped me for that tsme. is ».
November 6. After my morning walk, I went t»
work with my table again, and sinished it, though not
to my liking: nor was it long besore I learned to
mend it.
November 7. Now it began to be settled sair wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the iith,
(for the nth was Sunday, according to my reckoning)
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with somedif-
siculty brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please
me; and even in the making I pulled it to pieces several
times. Note. I soon neglected keeping Sundays; for
omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot which
was which.
November 13. This day it rained, which resreshed
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was ac-
companied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frightened me dreadsully for fear of my powder. As
foon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of
powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it
might not be in danger.
November 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests, or boxes, which might hold
about a pound, or two pounds at most, of powder; and
fo putting the powder in, I stowed it in places, as secure
and remote from one another as possible. On one of
these three days I killed a large bird that was good to
eat, but I knew not what to call it.
November 17. This day I began to dig behind my
tent into the rock, to make room for my sarther conve-
niency. Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for
this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow
or basket: so I desisted from my work, and began to con-
sider how to supply that want, and make me some tools.
As for the pick-axe, I made use of the iron-crows,
which were proper enough, though heavy; but the rtext
thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely ne-
cessary, that indeed I could do nothing effectually
without it; but what kind of one to make, I knew not.
November 11. The next day, in searching the woods,
Ha I found
I found a tree of that wood, ov like it, which in the Bra-
zils they call the iron-tree, for it's exceeding hardness s
of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe,
I cut a piece, and brought it home with great disficulty,
for it was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no
other way, made me a long while upon this machine;
for I worked it effectually, by little and little, into the
form of a shovel or spade, the handles exactly shaped like
ours in England, only that the broad part, having no
iron mod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long;
however, it served well enough for the uses which I had
occasion to put it to: but never was a shovel, I believe,
made after that sashion, or so long making.
I was still desicient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-
barrow; a balket I could not make by any means, hav-
ing no such things as twigs that would bend to make
wicker-ware, at least none yet found out; and, as to
the wheelbarrow, I sancied I could make all b\it the
wheel; but that I had no notion of, neither did I know
how to go about it; besides, I had no possible way to
make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel
to run in; so I gave it over; and, for carrying away the
earth which I dug out of the cave, T made me a conveni-
ence like an hod, which the labourers carry mortar in
when they serve the bricklayers.
This was not so dissicult to me as making the shovel;
and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I
made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less
than four days; I mean always, excepting my morn-
ing's walk with my gun, which I seldom sailed; and
very seldom sailed also of bringing home something six
to eat.
November z3. My other work having stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were si-
nished I went on; and working every day as my strength
and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in
widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my
goods commodiousty.
N,°te.
Note. During all this time I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a
warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar; as for a lodging, I kept to the tent, except
that sometimes in the wet season of the year, it rained io
hard, that I could not keep myself dry; which caused
me afterwards to cover all my place withinmy pale with
long poles in the form of rafters, leaning against tlve rock,
and loading them with flags, and large leaves of trees,
like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault sinished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made it
too large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the
top and one side; so much, that in short it frightened
me, and not without reason too; for is I had been
under it, I had never wanted agrave-digger; upon this
disaster I had a great deal os work to do over again;
for I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was
of more importance, I had the cieling to prop up,
fo that I might be sure no more would come down.
December 11. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shoars or posts, pitched up-
right to the top, with two pieces of board across over
each post: this I sinished the next day; and setting more
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the
roof secured, and the posts, standing in rows, ierved me
for partitions to part oft* my house.
December 17. From this day to the z0th, I placed
shelves, and knocked up nails in the posts, to hang every
thing up that could be hungup; and now I began to be
in some order within doors.
December jo. Now I curried every thing into the
cave, and began to surnish my house, and set up some
pieces os board like a dresser, to order my victuals upon;
but board began to be very scarce with me: also I made
me another table.
December z4. Much rain all night and all day; no
ftjrringout.
December z5. Rain all day.
H j December
December 16. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than besore, andpleasanter.
December 17. Killed a young goat, and lamed ano»
ther, so that I catched it, and led it home in a string;
when I had it home, I bound and splintered up it's leg,
which was broke.N. B. I took such care of it, that it
lived, and the leg grew well, and as strong as ever; but
by nursing it so long, it grew tame, and sed upon the lit-
tle green at my door, and would not go away. This,
was the sirst time that I entertained a thought of breed-
ing up feme tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot was all spent.
December z8, 19, 30. Great heats, and no breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the even-
ing for food. This time I spent in putting all my
things in order within doors.
January 1, 1660. Very hot still; but I went abroad
early and late, with my gun, and lay still in the middle
of the day: this evening, going sarther into the vallies
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found there
was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to
come at; however, I resolved to try it I could not bring
ray dog to hunt them down.
January z. Accordingly, the next day I went out
with my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was
mistaken, for they all saced about upon the dog, and he
knew his danger toowell,for he would not come near them.
Januarys. I began my fence or wall; which, he-
ir.g still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N. B. This wall being described besore, I purposely
omit what was said in the Journal: it is sussicient to
observe, that I was no less time than srom the 3d
of January to the 14-th of April, working, sinishing,
and persecting this wall, though it was no more than
about twenty-four yards in length, being an half cir-
cle from one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it; the door of the cave being sn the
Centre behind it.
AU
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering
me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together: but I
thought I mould never be persectly secure till this wal}
was sinished: aud it is scarce credible what inexpressible
labour every thing was done with, especially the bring-
ing piles out of the wood, and driving them into the
ground; for I made them much bigger than I needed to
have done.
When this wall was sinished, and the outside double
fenced with a turs-wall, raised up close to it, I persuaded
myself, that is any people were to come ashore there,
they would not perceive any thirg like an habitation:
and it is very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter
upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time, I went into the woods for
game every day, when the rain permitted me, and made
frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other
to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild
pigeons, which build not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons in the holes of the rocks; and
taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them
up tame, and did so; but when they grew older, they
flew all awav, which perhaps was at sirst for want of
feeding them, for I had nothing to give them; however,
I srequently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which were good to eat.
And now, in the management of my houshold affairs,
I found mysels wanting in many things, which I thought
at sirst it was impossible for me to make, and indeed so it
was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be
hooped; I had a small rundlet or two, as I observed be-
fore, but I could never arrive to the capacity os making
one of I hem, though I spent many weeks about it; I
could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so true
to one another, as to make them hold water; so I gave
that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles 5
so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by
seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed, I rememT
bered
bered the lump of bees-wax with which I made candle*
in my African adventure; but I had none of that now.
The only remedy I had was, that when I killed a goat,
I made tallow of the sat, and with a little dim made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick
of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this surnished
me with light, though not a clear steady light like a
candle.
In the midst of my labours it happened, that, rum-
maging my things, I found a little bag, which, as I
hinted before, had been silled with corn for feeding poul-
try, not for this voyage, but besore, as I suppose, when
the ship came from Lisbon; what little remainder of com
had been in the bag was ail devoured by the rat's, and I
law nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use, (I think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the
lightning, or some such use) I shook the husks of corn
out of it on one side of my fortisication under the
rock.
It was a little besore the great rains just nowmentioned,
that I threw this lkiff away, taking no notice of any
thing, and not so much as remembering that I had
thrown any thing there; when about a month after, or
thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green
shooting upon the ground, which I fancied might be
some plant I had not seen; but I was surprized, and
persectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I
siw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were per-
fect green barley, of the same kind as cur European,
nav, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and consu-
sion of my thoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto
acted upon no religious foundation at all; indeed I had
very few notions of religion in my head, nor had enter-
tained any fense of any thing that had besallen me, other-
wise than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God; without so much as enquiring into the end of
providence in these things, or hss ordering and govem.r
iiig
ing all events in tlte world: but after I law barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for
corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there,
it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest that God
had miraculously caused this grain to giow without any
help of seed sown, and that it was so directed, purely for
my sustenance in that wild and miserable place.
This reflection so asfected me, that it brought tears
from my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a
prodigy of Nature mould happen upon my account;
and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near
it still, all along by the side of the rock, some other
straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and
which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa
when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions of Pro-
vidence for my support; but, not doubting that there
was no more in the place, I went all over that part of
the Island where I had been besore, looking in every cor -
ner, and under every rock, to fee for more of it, but I
could not sind any: at last it occurred to my thoughts,
that I had shaken the bag of chickens meat out in that
place, and the wonder began to cease; and I must con-
fels, my religious thanksulness to God's providence be-
gan to abate too, upon discovering that all this was no-
thing but what was common; though I ought to have
been as thanksul for so strange aud unsoreseen an inci-
dent as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the
work vf Providence, as to me, that should order or ap-
point, that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain
unspoiled, (when the rats had destroyed all the rest :) as if
it had been dropped from Heaven: as also that I should
throw it out into that paiticular place, where, being in
the shade of an high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas, iiad I thrown it any where else at that time, it
might have been burnt and destroyed.
I caresully saved the ears ct this corn, you may be
Hire, in their season, which was about the end ot June:
and, laying them up caresully, I resolved to sow then]
Si LIFE AND ADVENTURES OT
sussicient quantity to supply me with bread: but it was
not till the fourth year that I would allow myself the
least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but spar-
ingly. I lost all that I sowed the sirst season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it just besore the
dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not
as it would have done had I not made this unsortunate
mistake.
Besides this barley, there were twenty or thirty stalks
ef rice, which I preserved with the same care, and
whose use was of the same kind, or to the lame purpose,
viz. to make me bread, or rather food; for I found
ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that
also after some time. But to return to my Journal.
I worked excessive hard three or four months, to get
my wall done; and the i+th of April I closed it up,
contriving to get within, not by a door, but by a ladder,
that there might be no sign en the outside of my
habitation.
April 16. I sinistted the ladder; so I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and
let it down on the inside: this was a compleat inclosure
to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could
come at me from without, unless it could sirst mount
my wall.
The very next day after this wall was sinished, I had
almost had all my labour overtlu own at once, and my-
self killed. The case was thus: as I was busy behind
my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightened with a most dreadsul surprizing thing indeed!
for all on a sudden I found the earth came tumbling
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill over my head; and two of the posts I had set
up in the cave cracked in a tremendous manner: I was
heartily frightened, but formed no judgment of what
really was the cause; only thinking that the top of my
cave was salling in, as some.of it had done besore; and
for fear I should bs buried in it, I ran forwards to my
ladder)
ladder; and, not thinking myself safe there neither, I
got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which
I expected might roll down upon me. I no sooner set
mv feet on the ground, than I plainly saw it was a ter-
rible earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three
times, at about eight minutes distance, with three such
shocks as would have overturned the strongest building
that could be supposed to have stood upon the earth;
and a great piece os the top of the rock, which stood about
half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with such
a terrible noise, as I never heard in all my life; I per-
ceived also the sea was put into violent motion by it;
and I believe the (hocks were stronger under the water
than on the Island.
I was so amazed at this phenomenon, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that
I was like one dead or stupisied; and the motion of the
earth made me exceeding lick, but the noise of the sal-
ling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and rouzing
me from the stupisied condition I was in, silled me with
horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill
falling upon my tent and all my houshold goods, and bu-
rying all at once; and this sunk my very soul within me
a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I had
not heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear of
being buried alive: but still sat upon the ground, greatly
cast down, and disconsolate, not knowing what to do.
All this while I had not the least serious religious
thought, nothing but the common' Lord have mercy
 upon me!' and when was it over, that went
away too.
While I sat thus, I found the atmosphere overcast,
and it grew cloudy, as if it would rain; and, in less
than half an hour, it blew a most dreadsul huricane of
wind; the sea was all on a sudden covered with foam
and froth, the shore with the breach of the water, and the
trees were taruuo by the roots. This continued about
three
three hours, when it began to abate; and in two hour»
more it was calm, with a heavy sall of rain.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much ter-
risied and dejected, when on a Hidden it occurred to my
mind that these winds and rains being the consequence
of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and
over, and I might venture into my cave again. With
this thought my spirits began to revive, and the rain
helping alio to periiiademe, I went in and sat inedown
in lr.y tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent
was ready to be beaten down with it, and I was farced
to go into my cave, though very much afraid and un-
easy for fear it mould sall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortisication, like a sink, to
let off the water. After I had been in my cave, I found
still more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to
be more composed; and, to support my spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small quantity of rum, which I did then and
at other times when I thought it essentially necessary,
knowing I could have no more after that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part of
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but my
mind being more composed, I began to consider what I
had best to do; thinking, that if the istand was sub-
ject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me lonie
little hut in an open place, which I might surround with
a wall, as I had done here, and thereby make myself
secure from wild beasts or men; concluding, if I staid
where I was, I shotild certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive.
In consequence of these thoughts, I resolved to move
my tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent. And 1 spent the two next days, being the 19th
and z0th of April, in contriving where, and how to re-
move my habitation. The
Thc sear of bcirg swallowed up alive greatly dis-
turbed ir.y mind, so that I had very little resreshment
srom deep; the apprehensions of lying abroad without
any fence were almost equal to it; but still, when I
looked about, and saw how every thing was put in order,
hew well concealed I was, and hew sase from danger, it
made me unwilling to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would re-
quire a vast deal of time to do this, and that I must be
contented to run the hazard where I was, till I had
formed a camp for myself, and had secured it
so as to remove to it. With this resolution I composed
myself for a time, and then resolved to go to work with
all speed to bu.ld me a wall with piles, cables, &c.
in a circle, as besore, and set my tent up in it when it
was sinistied; but that I would venture to stay where I
was, till it was smished and sit to remove to. This
was the z1st.
April zz. The next morning 1 began to consider of
means to put this resolve into execution: but I was at
a great loss about my tools: I had three large axes,
and abundance of hatchets, (for we carried the hatchets
for traffic with the Indians ;) but with much chopping
and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all sull of
notches, and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I
could not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me
as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life
ar.d death of a man. At length I contrived a wheel
with a string to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty. Note, I had not seen any
such thing in England, or at least to take notice how it
was done: though since, I have observed it was veiy
common there; besides that, my grindstone was very
large and heavy. This machine cost me a sull week's
work to bring it to persection.
April z8, z9. These two whole days I took up in
gr'nding my tools, my machine for turning my grind-
stone persorming very well.

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been low
a great while, I now took aiurvey of it, and reduced my-
self to one biscuit-cake a-day.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-side,
86 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
ger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask. When I
came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces
.of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by
the late huricane; and looking towards the wreck it-
self, I thought it seemed to lie higher out ot the water
than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was
driven on shore, and found it was a barrel of gun-pow-
der, but it had taken water, and the powder was caked
as hard as a stone : however, I rolled it sarther on the
more for the present, and went upon the sands, as near
as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.«
When I came to the ship, I found it strangely re-
moved. The fore-castle, which lay besore buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six seet; and the stern,
which was broken to pieces, and parted from the rest
by the force of the sea, soon alter I had left rum-
maging of her, was tossed as it were up, and cast on
one side; and the sand was thrown so high on that
side next the stern, that though there was a great
place of water besore, so that I could not come within
a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I
could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out!
I was surprized with this at sirst, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence
the ship was more broken open than formerly, so manv
things came daily on shore which the sea had loosened,
and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to
the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design os
removing my habitation; and I busied myself that day
especially, in searching whether I could make any wav
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind, sor that all the inside of the ship was choaked
up with land; however, as I had learned not to despair
of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to pieces
that I could of the ship, concluding, that whatever
I could get from her would be of some use or other
to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held some of the upper
part, or quarter-deck together; and when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could,
from the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in,
I was obliged to give over for that time.
May 4. I went a sishing, but caught not one sish that
I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when,
just going to leave csf, I caught a young dolphin. I
had made me a long line os some rope-yarn, but I had
110 hcoks: yet I frequently caught sish enough, as much
as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and
cat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great planks osf from the
decks, which I tied together, and made swim on shore
when the tide os flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts
out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very
hard, came home much tired, and had thoughts of
giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again,- with an intent
not to work; but sound the weight of the wreck had
broken itsels down, the beams being cut,' that several
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside ot
the hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but it was
almost sull of water and sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and earned an iron-crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear ot the
water or sand; I wrenched open two planks, and brought
thtm on shore also with the tide. I lest the iron-crow
ill the wreck for the next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made .way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loolened them with the crow, but could not
I a break
break them up; I Celt also a roll of English lead, aiv.l
could stir it, but it was too heavv to move.
May 10, ii, 1z, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber and
boards, or planks, and two or three hundred weight
of'iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge
of one hatchet against the lead, and driving with the
other; butas it layabout afootand an half inthe water,
I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the lorce ot the water;
but "I staid so long in the woods to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me going to ciie wreck that
day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
more at a great distance, two miles off, and resolved to
fee what they were, but found it was a piece of the head,
and too heavy for me to bring away.
May z4. prom the 17th to this day, I worked on
the wreck, and with bard labour loosened some things
so much with the crow, that on the sirst flowing tide
several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests;
but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to
land that day except some pieces of timber, aud an hog-
shead which had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water
and the sand.had spoiled rt.
I continued this work every day from the z4th of
May to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to
get food, which I always appointed, during this part
of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that
I might be ready when it was ebbed out to attend the
wreck. By this time I had gotten timber and plank,
and iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if I
had known how; as also at different times, and in
several pieces, near a hundred weigiit of the sheet
lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side I foun "1 a large
'tortoil*
tortoise or turtle; this was the sirst I had seen ; which,
it seen s, was only my misfortune, not any desect of the
place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other
Side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them
every day, as I afterwards found, though perhaps I might
have paid dear for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle: I found in
her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that
time, the most savourv and pleasant I ever tasted ip my
life, having had noflcsh, but of goats and fowls, since I
landed in this horrible place.
June 18, Raining all the day, I staid within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was some-
thing chilly, which I knew was not usual in that
latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
June z0. No rest all night; violent pains in my head,
and feverish.
June z1. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the
apprehensions of my sad condition, in being sick, and
having no help: prayed to God, for the sirst time since
the storm oss Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why;
my thoughts being all consused.
June zz. A little better, but under dreadsul appre-
hensions.
June z 3. Very bad again ; cold and shivering, attended
with a violent head-ach.
June z4.. Much better.
June z5. An ague very violent; the sit held me se-
veral hours, cold sit and hot, with saint sweats
after it.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89
took my gun, but found mylelf very weak ; however, I
killed a she goat,, and with much difficulty got it home,
broiled some of it, and eat; I would sain have stewed
it, and made seme broth, but had no convenience for that
purpose.
lune 27. The a<?ue returned again so violent, that \
I j Jay
lay in bed all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready
to perish with thirst, and so weak, I had not strength to
stand up, or get myself any water to drink; prayed, to
God again, but was light headed ; and when I was not
I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say ; onlv T lay
and cried' Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord
* have mercy upon me V I suppose I did nothing the
for two or three hours, till the sit wearing off, I sell asleep,
and did not awake till the night was sar advanced.
When I awoke, I found myself much refreslu-d.. but weak
and exceeding thinty; however, as I had no water in my
whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and
went to sleep again; in this second sleep, I had the sol-
lowing terrible dream.
I thought I was sitting on the ground, on the outside
of my wall, at the samu spot where I sat when the stcrm
blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a black cloud, in a bright flume of sire, and
light upon the ground: he was all over as bright as a
flame, Co that I could but just bear to look towards
him; his countenance was too dreadsul tor words to
describe. When he stepped on the ground, I thought
the earth trembled, just as it had done besore in the
earthquake; and the atmosphere looked, to my appre-
hension, as if it had been silled with flashes of sire. ,
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved
towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand
as if designing to kill me; when he came to a rising
ground, at some distance, he spoke ro me, or I heard
a voice so terrible, that it is impossihle to express the
terror of it: all that I can say I understood was this
'Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repen-
'tance, now thou shalt die.' At which words I
thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to
kill me. t
No one that shall ever read this account will exre't
I should be able to describe the horrors of my foul
at this terrible vision; I mean, that even while it was a
urcam, I even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any
more
more possible to describe the impression that remained
upon my mind, when 1 awaked and found it was but a
dream.
I had, alas ! no divine knowledge ; what I had received
by the goed instruction ot my sather was then worn out
by anuninterrupted series, for tight years, of sea-saring
wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but
such ns were, like rryseif, wicked and prophane to the
last degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that
time, one thought that so much as tended either to look-
ing upwards towards God, or inwards towards a reflec-
tion upon my own ways : but a certain stupidity of foul,
without desire of gcod, or conscience os evil, had en-
tirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most har-
dened, unthinking, wicked creature, among our com-
mon sailors, can be supposed to be; and having the least
sense of the fear of Gcd in dangers, or of thanksulness
to God in deliverances.
In the relation of what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I add,
that through all the variety of miseries that had to this
day besallen me, I never had so much as one thought
of it's being; the hand os God, or that it was a just pu-
nishment sur my sins: my rebellious behaviour against
my saiher, or my present sins, which were great; or
so much as a punishment for the general course of my
wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition
en the desart mores of Africa, I never had so much as
ore thought of what would become os me, or one wish
to Gcd to direct me whither I mould go, or to keep me
srem the danger which apparently surrounded me,
es well from veracious creatures, as cruel savages : but
I was merely thoughtless of Gcd, or a Providence ; I
af<il like a mere brute, from the principles of nature,
and by the dictates ot common fense only; and, indeed,
hardly that.

thanksulness in my thoughts: when again I was ship-
wrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning on this
island, I was as !ar from remorse, or looking on it as a
judgment; I only said to myself often, that I was
an unsortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.
It is true, when I got en shore sirst here, and found all
my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was sur-
prized with a kind of extaiy, and some transports of
foul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have
come up to true thanksulness ; but it ended where it
began, in a mere common slight of joy ; or, as I may lay,
being glad I was alive, without the least reflection upon
the distinguishing goodness of the hand which had pre-
served me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when
all the rest were destroyed; or an enquiry why Pro-
vidence had been thus mercisul to me: even just the same
common fort of joy which seamen generally have, after
they have got late ashore from ihipwreck, all which
they drown in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost
as soon as it is over; aud all the rest of my life was
likeit.
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, in what manner I was
cast on this dreadsul place, out of the reach of human
kind, out of all hope ot relief or prospect of redemption,
as soon as I saw a probability os living, and that I should
not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my
asfliction wore eff, and I began to be very easy, api
plied myself to the works proper for my preservation
and supply, and was sar enough from being afflicted at
my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as thi
hand of God against me: these were thoughts which Very
seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as hath been observed in
my journal, had at sirst some little influence upon me,;
and began to asfect me with seriousness, as long as I
thought it had something miraculous in it; but a* soon
n i that part of the thought was removed, all the im- .
preffion which was -rassed from it entirely wore off.
Even
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more
terrible in it's nature, or more immediately directing to
the invisible Power which alone produces snch things .$
yet no sooner was the sirst fright over, but the impression
it had made went oft'also. I had no more fense of God,
or his judgment, much less of the present affliction of my
circumstances being from his hand, than if I had been
in the most prosperous condition of my life.
But now, when I began to be sick, and a cool and
deliberate view ot the miseries of death came to place it-
self besore me ; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted
with the violence of the fever; conscience, that had
slept so long, began to awake, and I cculd not avoid
reproaching myself with my past life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the
justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and
to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.
These reflections oppressed me from the second or
third day of my distemper, and in a violence, as well of
the fever as of the dreadsul reproaches of my conscience,
extorted seme words srom me, like praying to God,
though I cannot lay they were either a prayer attended
with desires, or with hopes: it was rather the voice
of mere fright and distress ; my thoughts were consused,
the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of
dying in such a miserable condition, railed vapours
into my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in
these hurries of my foul, I knew not what my tongue
might express; but it was rather exclamation, such
as' Lord! what a miserable creature am I! If I
'siiould be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help,
* and what will become of me!' Then the tears burst
from my eyes, and I could say no more for feme
time.
In this interval, the good advice of my sather came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which Imcn-
tioneu in the beginning ot this story; viz. that is I did
Jake this loolish step, God would not bless me, and I
would
should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neg-
lected his counsel, when there might be none to assist me
in my recovery. 'Now,' said I, aloud, ' my dear
 sather's words are come to pass: God's justice has
1 overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me.
 I rejected the voice of Providence which had merci-
'sully put me in a posture or state of life wherein I
'might have been happy or easy; but I would neither
 see it myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it
 from my parents; I lest them to mourn over my fol-
 ly, and now I am left to mourn under the conse-
'quences of it. I resused their help and assistance, who
'would have introduced me into the world, and would
'have made every thing easy to me; and now I have
'dissiculties to struggle with, too great for even na-
 ture itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
'no comfort, no advice!' Then I cried out' Lord,
 be my help, for I am in great distress!"
This was the sirst prayer, if I may call it so,
I had made for many years. But to return to my
journal.
June z8. Having been somewhat resreshed by the
sleep I had had, and the sit being entirely off, I got up,
and though the fright and terror of my dream still hung
heavy on my mind, yet I considered that the sit of the
ague would return again the next day, and now was roy
time to get something to resresh and support myself when
I should be ill. The sirst thing I did was to sill a large
iquare cafe bottle with water, and set it upon my table,
in reach of my be;; and to take off the chill or aguish
disposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together; I then got a
piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals,
but could eat very little; I walked about, but was very
weak, and withal very heavy hearted trom a sense of my
miserable condition, dreading the return of my distem-
per the next day; at night I made my supper of three
of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and
eat as we call it in the shell; and this was the sirst kind
of
of food I ever asked God's blessing to, even (as I could
remember) in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun, (for I
never went out without that;) so I went but a lit-
tle way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out to
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
linooth. As I lat here, some thoughts, such as the fol-
lowing, occurred to my mind.
'What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so
'much? Whence produced? And what am I, and all
 the other creatures, wild and tame, human and bru-
'tal; whence are we?
'Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
 formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
1 is that?
'It then followed most naturally' It is God that
'has made them all!'' Well, but,' then it came on
strongly; ' if God has made all these things, he
 guides and governs them all, and all things that
 concern them; fcr the Being that could make all
'things must certainly have power to guide and direct
 them.
'If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
'his works, either without his knowledge or appoint-
 ment.
'And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
'knows that I am here, and am in a dreadsul condition;
 and if nothing happens without his appointment, he
'has appointed all this to besal me.'
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me
with the greater sorce, that it must needs be, that God
had appointed all this to besal me; that I was brought
to this miserable situation by his direction; he having
tht sole power, not of me only, but os every thing that
happened in the world. Immediately it followed
'Why has God done this to me? What have I done
 to be thus used?'
My
My conscience preiently checked me in that enquiry,
as it" I had blasphemed; and methought it t'polce to me
fike a voice' Wretch! dost thou ask what thou halt
'done? Look back upon a dreadsul mispent life, and
'ask thyself what thou hast no; done? Ask, why is it
'that thou wert not loni; ago destroyed? Why wert
 thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the
9« LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
'war? devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of
 Africa? or drowned here, when all the crew perished
 but thyself? Dost thou all; what have I done?'
I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one nsto-
niflied, and had not a word to lay ; no, not to answer to
myself: but rose up, pensive and sad, walked back to
my retreat, and went up over my wall, as is I had been
going-to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed,
and I had no inclination to steep, so I fat down in my
chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark.
Now as the apprehensions of the return of my distemper
terrisied me very much, it occurred to my thought, that
the Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco, tor al
ni^st all distempers; aud I had a piece of a roll of to-
bacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and
some alio that was grewn, and not then sit sor use.
To this chest I repaired, in which I sound a cure both
for foul and body; I opened the chest, and immediatelv
met with what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as
the few books I had saved lay there too, I tock out one
of the bibles which I mentioned besore, and which, to
this time I had not found either leisure or inclination to
look into; I say, I took it out, and brought both that
and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but
I tried several experiments with it, as if I was reiolveU
it should hit one way cr other: I sirst took a piece of
a leas, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed ahno.t
ftupisied me, the tobacco being strong, and I not ac-
customed to its use. 1 then took some, and steeped it
an
an hour or two in rum, resolving to take a dose of it
when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan
of coals, and held my nose close over the imoak as long
as I could bear it, as well for the heat, as to receive be-
nesicial virtues from the plant.
After this operation I took up the bible, and began
to read: but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time: only
having opened the book casoally, tha sirst words that
occurred to me were these' Call on me in the day of
'trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify
'me.'
The words were very apt to my situation, and made
fome impression upon my thoughts at the time of read-
ing them, though not so much as they did afterwards;
for, as for being delivered, the word had no assinity, as
I may say, to me; it was so remote, so impossible, in
my n.ppvehension of things, that I said as the children of
Ifrael did when they were promised flesh to eat' Can
* God spread a table in the wilderness ?'' Can God
'himself deliver me from this place?' And as it was
not for many years that any hope appeared, this pre-
vailed very often upon my thoughts: but, however, the
words made a very great impression upon me, and I
mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and
the tobacco had, as I said, affected my head so much,
that I was inclined to steep; accordingly I left my lamp
burning in the cave, lest I "mould want any thing in
the night, and went to bed; but besore I lay down, I
did what I never had done in all my life, I kneeled down
and prayed to God to sulsil the promise to me, that if
I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would de-
liver me. After my broken and impersect prayer was
over, I drank the rum wherein I had steeped the to-
bacco, which was so strong and rank of the weed, that
indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately on this
I went to bed, and soon found it flew up into my head
violently; but I self into a sound sleep, and waked no
more till, by die sun, it must have been near three
K o'Clock
o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nav, to this
hour I am partly of the opinion that I slept all the next
day and night, and till about three the day after; for
otherwise I knew not how I mould lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing
and re-crcssing the line, I should have lost more than a
day; but in my account it was lost, and I never knew
which way.
Be that, however, one way or other, when I awaked
I found myself exceedingly resreshed, and my spirits
lively and cheerful. When I got up I was stronger
. than I was the day besore, and my stomach better; for
I was hungry; and, in short, I had no sit the next day,
but continued much altered for the better. This was
the z9th.
The 30th was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too sar.
I killed a sea-sowl or two, something like a brand-
goose, and brought them home, but was not very sor-
ward to eat them; so I eat some more of the turtle's
eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed
the medicine which I had supposed did me good the
day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum; only I
did not take so much as besore, nor did I chew any of
the leas, or hold my head over the sinoak; however,
I was not so well the next day, which was the sirst of
July, as I hoped I should have been, for I had a return
os the cold sit, but it was not much.
July a. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at sirst, doubling the quantity
which I drank.
July 3. I missed the sit for. good and all, though I
did not recover my sull strength for some weeks after.
,S LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
exceedingly upon these words in the Scripture,  I will
'deliver thee;' and the impossibility of my deliverance
lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting
it: but as I was discouraging myself wsth such thought's
it
it occurred to my mind, that I dwelt so much upon my
deliverance from the main affliction, that I difregarded
the deliverance I had received; and I was, as it were,
made to ask myself such questions as theie; viz. ' Have
 I not been delivered, and wondersully too, from sick-
 ness? From the most distressed condition that could
'be, and that was so frightsul to me? And what no-
'tice had I taken of it? Had I done my part? God
 had delivered me: but I had not glorisied him.' That
is to say, I had not owned and been thanksul for that
as a deliverance, and how could I expect greater de-
liverance!
These reflections greatly affected me, and I imme-
diately kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud for
my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the bible: and opening
it where the New Testament commences, I began
feriously to read it, and laid a restraint upon myself to
read some every morning and every night, not consining
myself to the number of chapters, but to read as long
as my thoughts should engage me. It was not long
after when I set seriously to this work, but I sound my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wick-
edness of my past life; the impression os my dream re-
vived, and the words' All these things have not
'brought thee to repentance,' ran seriously in my
thoughts: I was earnestly begging of God to give me
repentance, when it happened providentially the very day,
that, reading the^Scripture, I came to these words
'He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repen-
 tance, and to give remission:' I threw down the book
and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to
heaven, in a kind of extacy of joy, I cried out aloud
 Jesus, thou son of David! Jeliis, thou exalted Prince
'and Saviour, give me repentance!'
This was the sirst time I could say, in the time fense
of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I
prayed with a fense of my condition, and with a true
scripture view of hope, founded on the encourage-
K. 2 meat
ment of the word God;' and srom this tsme,
I may say, I began to have hope that God would
hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned above
' Call on me, and I will deliver thee,' in a disferent
sense from what I had ever done besore; for then I had
no notion of anything being called deliverance, but my
being delivered from the captivity I was in; for though
I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was
certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst: sense of
the word; but now I learned to take it in another
sense. Now I looked back upon my past life wiih such
horror, and my sins appearing lo dreadsul, my
foul sought nothing of God but del verance from the
.cad os guilt that b re down all my comfort. As for
my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much
as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was
all of no consideration in comparison of this; and I
added this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it,
that whenever they come to a true sense of things,
they will sind deliverance from sin a much greater bless-
ing than deliverance from affliction.
But leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less miser-
able as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind;
and my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading
the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher
nature, I had a great deal of comsort withm, which till
now I knew nothing of; also, as my health and strength
returned, I determined to surnish myself with every
thing I wanted, and make my way of living as regular
anJ comfortable as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-
ployed in walking about with my gun in my hand,
though I could proceed no great distance without inter-
vals of rest, being fromillncis lo weakened, that I had
very little strength lest: indeed it is hardly to be ima-
gined how low I was, and to what an impersect state I
wai. reduced. The application which I made use of,
was
was persectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an
ague besore; neither can I recommend it to any one to
practice, by this experiment: and though it did cany ost
the sit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for I had
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs tor some time.
I learned from it, also, this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing
to my health that could be, especially in those rains that
came attended with storms and huricanes of wind; foras
the rain which came in a dry season was always most ac-
companied with such storms, so I found this rain was
much more dangerous than the rain which fell in Septem-
ber and October.
I had been now in the island above ten months; and
all possibility of deliverance from mv condition seemed
to be entirely taken from me; I sirmly believed, that no
human being had ever set soot upon the place. Having
now secured my habitation, as I thought, sully to my
mind, I had a great desire to make a more persect disco-
very of the Island, and to see what other productions I
might sind os which I was at present unacquainted.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself; I went up the
creek fust, where, as hinted, I brought my rafts on
sliore. I found, after I came about two miles up, that
the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no
more than a little brook of running water, and very fresh
and good; but this being the dry season, there was
hardly any water in seme parts"of it. at least not enough
to run into any stream, so as it could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and on the rising parts of them next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be sup-
posed, never overflowed, I found a great deal os tobacco,
green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk;
there were various other plants with which I was unac-
quainted, and which might probably have some efficaci-
ous virtues, though to me unknown.
K3 I
I searched for die cassava root, of which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread, but I could sind
none. I s.tw large plants of aloes, but did not then

and, for want of cultivation, impersect. I contented
myself with these discoveries for this time, and came
back muling with myself what course I might take to
know the virtue and goodness of anv of the fruits or
plants whsch I mould discover, but could bring it to no
conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little ob-
servation while I was in the Brazils, that I was unac-
quainted with the plants os the sield; at least I knew
very little that might lerve me to any purpose at this time
of my distress.
The next day, the i6th,I went the same way again;
and, after going something sarther than I had done the
day besore, I found the brook and the savannahs began
to cease, and the country became more woodv than be-
fore. In this part I found different fruits, and particu-
larly melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees; the Tines had spread indeed over
the trees, and the clustersof grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich., This was a surprizing disr
covery, and I was exceeding glad of them, bu! was
warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, re-
membering, that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eat-
ing of grapes killed several of our Englishmen who were
{laves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers;
but I found an excellent uie for these grapes, and that
was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would
be, as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable
to eat, when no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, which was the sirst time
I had lain srom home. When night came, I got up
into a tree, where I slent well, and the next morning pro-
ceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles,
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping l1.11
due north, with a lidge of hills on the south and north
side of me. ^
At the end of this journey I came to an opening where
the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little
spring of fresh water which issued out of the side of the
hiil by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every
th ng being in a state of beautisul verdure, that it looked
like a planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of the valley, survey-
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure to think this was all
my own; that I was king and lord of all this country
indeseasibly, and had a right of possession; anc/, if I
could convey it, I might have it in inheritance, as com-
pleatly as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron-trees;
but all wild, and few bearing any fruit; at least, not
then; however, the green limes that I gathered were
not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome: and I

it very wholesome, and very cool and resreshing drink.
I sound now I had business enough to gather and cany
home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well of grape*
as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet sea-
fon, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me, I tra-
velled homeward, and resolved to come again, and brine
a hag or sack, or what I could mike, to carry the
rest home.
Accordingly; having spent three days in this journey,
I came home, (to Imuft now call my tent, and my cave:)
but, besore I got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the
richness of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having
broken them, and bruised them, they were good for Jitr
tie or nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I
could bring but few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest:
but I was surprized, when corning to my heap of grapes,
whish
which were so rich and sine when I gathered them, I
found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces, and drag-
ged about, some here, some there, and abundance eaten
and devoured. By this I concluded, there were some
wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them upon
Iieaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that
one way they would be destroyed, and the other they
would be crushed with their own weight, I took another
course; I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes
and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated with great pleasure on the fruitsulness os that val-
ley, and the pleasantness os the situation, the security
from storms on that side of the water, and the wood; and
concluded that I had pitched upon a place to six my
abode, which was by sar the worst part of the country.
Upon the whole, I began to think of removing my habi-
tation, and to lookout for a place equally sate, as where
I now was situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitsul
part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceed-
ing fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the
place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view
of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea-side,
where it was at least possible that something might hap-
pen to my advantage, and that the same ill-fate that
brought me hither might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce
probable, that any such thing should ever happen, yet to
inclose mysels among the hills and woods, in the centre
of the island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to
render such an affair not only improbable, but impossi-
ble; and that theresore I Qiight not by any means
to remove.
However,
However, I was Co pleased with this place, that I
spent much of my time there for the whole remaining
part of the month of July: and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove; yet I
built me a little kind of bower, and surrounded it at a
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ioj
as high as I could reach, well staked and silled between
with brush-wood: and here I lay very secure, sometimes
two or tluee nights together, always going over it with a
ladder as besore; so that I sancied now I had my coun-
try-house, and my sea coast house. And this work
took me up the beginning of August.
I had but newly sinished my fence, and began to enjoy
my labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick
close to my sirst habitation; for though I had made me
a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread
it very well, yet I had not the shelter of an hill to keep me
from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when
the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
sinished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
third of August I sound the grapes I had hung up
were persectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down,
irom the trets, and it was very happy that I did so; for
the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I
had lost the best part of my winter-food; for I had
above two hundred large.bunches ot them. No sooner
had I taken them ail down, and carried most of them
home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from thence,
ROBINSON CRUSOE. ioj
every day, till the middle os October; and sometimes so
violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for se-
veral days.
At this time I was much surprized with the increase
of my samily: I had been concerned for the loss of one
of my cats, which ran away from me, and, as I thought,
had been dead, and I heard no tale or tidings of her, till,
to my astonishment, she came home about the end of Au-
gust,
gust, with three kittens. This was the more strange,
because, though I had killed a wild-cat, as I called it,
with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a disferent kind
from our European cats; but I found the kittens -were
the same kind of house-breed like the old one; and both
my cats being females, T thought it very strange. But
from these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered
with them, that I was forced to kill them like vermin,
or wild-beasts, and to drive them srom my house as much
as possible.
From the 14th of August to the z6th it rained inces-
santly, so that I could not stir out. In this state of con-
sinement I began to be straitened for food; but ventur-
ing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me. And my food was regulated thus:
I eat a bunch of raisins for my breaksast; a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled, (for,
to my great misfortune I had no vessel to boil or stew
any thing;) and two or three of the turtle's eggs
for supper.
During this consinement by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave; and, by
degrees, worked it on towards, one side, till I came to
the outside of the hill, and made a door or way cut,
which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in
and out this way. But I was not persectly easy at ly-
ing so open; for as I had managed myself besore, I wat
in a persect inclosure, whereas, now I thought I lay ex-
posed; and yet'I could not perceive, that there was any
living thing to fear, the largest animal I had yet seen
upon the island being a goat.
September 30. I was now come to the unhappy an-
niveriary of my landing; I cast up the notches on my
post, and sound I had been on shore three hundied and
sixty-sive days. I kept this day as a solemn sast, setting
it apart to religious exercise, prostrating myself to the
ground with the most serious humiliation, consessing my-
sell to God, acknowledging his righteous judgment
upon
upon mt, and praying to him to have mercy on me,
through Jesus Christ; arid having not tasted the least
refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down of
the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes,
and went to bed, sinishing the day as I began it.
I had all this time observed no sabbath-day; for as at
sirst I had no fense of religion upon my mind, I had
after some time omitted todistinguish the weeks, by mak-
ing a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-day,
and so did not really know what any of the days were;
but now having cast up the days above, I found I had
been there a year; so I divided it into weeks, ar.d let
apart every seventh day for a sabbath; though I found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two of my
reckoning.
A little after this, my ink began to sail me, in conse-
quence of which I used it mere sparingly, and wrote
down only the most remarkable events or my life, with-
out continuing adaily memorandum of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to
appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so ?.s
to provide accordingly. But I bought all my experi-
ence besore I had it; and what I am going to relate
was one of the most discouraging experiments I had
made. It has been observed, that I had laved the few
ears of barley and rice which I had so surprizingly found
spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe
there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty
of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it
after the rains, the sun being in it's southern position
going from me.
Accordingly I dug upapieceof grcjrd, as well as I
could, with my wooden lpade, and dividing it into two
parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it ca-
sually occurred to my thoughts, that I would not sow
it all at sirst, because I did not know wlwn was the pro-,
per time for it; ib I lowed about two-thirds of the seeds,
leaving the remainder sor a suture time.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so
4 » for
for not one grain os that I sowed at this time came to
anything: for the dry months following, the earth hav-
ing had no rain after the feed was sown, it had no mois-
ture to assist it's growth, and never came up at all, till
the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been newly sewn.
Finding my sirst seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug up
a piece near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my
feed in February, a little besore the vernal equinox;
and this, having the rainy months of March and April
to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a vei y
good crop; but having part of the seed lest only, and
not daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but a small
quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above
half a peck of each kind.
But by this experience I was made master of my bu-
siness, and knew exactly when the proper season was to
fow; and that I might expect two seed-times, arid two
harvests, every year.
"While this com was growing, I made a little disco-
very, which was of use to me asterwards. As soon as
the rains were over, and the weather began to settle,
which was about the month of November, I made a vi-
sit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not
been some months, yet I found all things just as I lest
them. The circle, or double hedge that I had made,
was not only sum and entire, but the stakes which I had
cut off some trees that grew thereabouts, were all
shot out, and grown with long branches, as much
as a willow-tree usually shoots the sirst year after lop-
ping it's head. I could not tell what tree to call it, that
these stakes were cut from. I was sitrprizul, and yet
very well pleased, to set the young trees grow; and T
prune i them, and led them up to grow as much alike as.
I'cov.ld; and it is scarce credible, how beautisul a sigure
thev grew into in three years; so that though the hedge
made a circle of about twenty-sive yards sn diameter, by-
the
tlie trees, For such I might now call them, soon covered it;
and it was a compleat made, sussicient to lodge under all
the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and
make me an hedge like this in a semi-circle round my
wall, (I mean, that of my sirst dwelling) which I did;
and, placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at above
eight yards distance from my sirst fence, they grew pre-
sently, and were at sirst a sine cover to my habitation,
and afterwards served for a desence also, as I shall ob-
serve in it's order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might gene-
rally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in Eu-
rope; but into the rainy seasons, and the dry seasons,
which were generally thus.

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, a*
the winds happened to blow; but this was the general
observation I made. After I had sound, by experience,
the ill-consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to suinjsh myself with provisions besorehand, that
Vol. I. L I might
I might not be obliged to go out; and I lat within-door9
as much as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment, (and very suit-
able also to the time) for I law great occasion of many
things which I had no way to surnish myself with, but
by hard labour and constant application; particularly,
I tried many ways to make mylelf a basket; but all the
twigs I could get for the purpose were so brittle, that
they would not answer the purpose. It proved of excel .
lent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I
used to take great delight in standing at a basket-mak-
er's in the town where my father lived, to fee them make
their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very
ssicious to help, and a great observer of the manner how
they worked those things, and sometimes lent an hand, I
ha<! by this means such fnll knowledge of the methods
of it, thai I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
tame into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as
tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers, in Eng-
land; and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day I went to my country-
house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could
desire; whereupon, I came the next time prepared with
an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I loon found,
for there was a great plenty of them; these I set up to
dry within my circle or hedges; and when they were sit
for use, I carried them to my cave; and here, during the
next season, I employed myself in making (as well as I
eouM) a great many baskets, both to carry earth, and to
i ca rry or lay up any thing, as I had occasion: and though
I did not sinish them very handsomely, yet I made them
sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus after-
wards I took care never to be without them; and as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially, I made
-strong deep baskets to place my com in, instead of sacks,
when I should come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered this dissiculty, and employed much
3 time
tsme about it, I exerted myself to see, if possible, how
to supply two wants. I had no vessels to hold any
thing that was liquid, except two rundlets, which were
almost sull of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the
common size, and others which were cafe-bottles, iquare,
for holding waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a
pot to boil any thing in, except a great kettle which I
raved out of the ship, and which was too big for such
uses as I wanted, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I would willingly have
had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to
make one; however, I found a contrivance lor that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum-
mer, or dry season; when another business took me up
morethne than it could be imagined I could spare.
I mentioned besore, that I had a great mini to see the
whole ifland, and that I had travelled up the brook, and
&> on to where I built my bower, and where I had an
opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island.
I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-more on
that side: so taking my gun and hatchet, and my dog,
and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual,
with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in
my pouch, formy store, I beganrr y journey. When I
had passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I
came within view of the sea to the west; and it being a
very clear day, I sairly descried land, whether an ifland
or continent I could not tell; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the W. to the W. S. W. at a very great
distance: by my guess it could not be less than fisteen or
twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America:
and, as I concluded by all my cblervations, must be near
the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by
savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a
^vcrle condition than I was now; and, therefore, I ac-
L 2 quitltcd
<juiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which I beg**
now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing for the
best; I say, I contented myself with this, and lest disturb-
ing my mind with fruitless wishes of sarther discoveries.
Besides, after some pause upon this assair, I considered,
that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly,
one time or other, see some vessels pass or repass one way
or other; but if not, then it was the savage coast be-
tween the Spanish country and Brazil, which were, in-
deed, inhabited by the worst of savages; for they are
cannibals, cr men-eaters, and sail not to murder and
devour all the human bodies that sall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely for-
ward. I found that side of the island where I now was
much pleasanter than mine, the open or savannah sields
sweet, adorned with flowers and grafs, and sull of very
sine woods. I law abundance of parrots, and willingly
would I have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to
be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after
some pains catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home,
but it was some years besore I could make him speak.
However, at last I taught him to call me by my name
very samiliarly: but the accident that followed, though
a trifle, will be very diverting in it's place.
I was exceedingly amused with this journey; I found
in the low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and
foxes, but they differed greatly from all the other kinds
I had met with; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them,
though I killed several: but I had no need to be ventur-
ous; for I was not in want of food, and of that which
was very good too; especially these three sorts, viz.
goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to
my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have surnished
a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and
though my cafe was deplorable enough, yet I had great
cause of thanksulness, that I was not driven to any ex-
tremities for food; but had rather plenty, even to
dainties.  I never
I never travelled in this journey above two miles out-
light in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns
and returns, to fee what discoveries I could make, that
I came weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit
down for all night; and then either reposed myself in a
tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes let up-
right in the ground, either from one tree to another, or
so as no wild creature could come at me without wak-
ing me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprized to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the
island; for here indeed the more was covered with innu-
merable turtles, whereas, on the other side, I had found
but three in a year and a half. Here was also an insinite
number of fowls of many kinds, some of which I had -
not seen besore, and many of them very good to eat:
but foch as I knew not the names of, except those called
penguins,.
'I could have killed as many as I pleased, but was very
sparing of my powder and shot; and theresore was more
inclined to kill a she-goat, if I could, which I could
better feed on; and thcugh there were many goats here
more than on the other side of the island, yet it was with
much more dissiculty I could come near them; the coun-
try being flat and even, they saw me much sooner than
when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plcasanter
than mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to re-
move: for as I was sixed in my habitation, it became
natural tome, and J itemed, all the while I was here, to
be, as it were, u.pon a journey, and srom home; however,
I travelled along the shoie of the sea towards the east, I
suppose, about twelve miles; and then setting up a great
pole upon the shere for a mark, I concluded I would
go home a;.-ain; and the next journey I took should be
on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round till I came to my post again; of which in
it's place.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
X- 3 u thinking
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in my
view, that I could not miss sinding my sirst dwelling by
viewing the country ;but I soon discovered my mistake; for
being come about two or three miles, I found myself de-
scended into a very large valley; but so surrounded with
hills, and those hills covered with woods, that I could
not fee which was my way by any direction but that of
the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the posi-
tion of the sun at that time of the day.
It happened, to my sarther misfortune, that the wea-
ther proved hazy for three or four days, while I was in
this valley; and not being able to fee the sun, I wan-
dered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged
to sind out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back
the same way I went; and then, by easy journevs, I
turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot;
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things,
very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprized a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog; I had a great
mind to bring it home, if I could; for I had often been
musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or
two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might sup.,
ply me when my powder and shot should be spent.
I made a collar to this little creature, and with a string
formed of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about
me, I led him along, though with some dissiculty, till I
came to my bower, and there I inclosed him and lest him;
for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I
had been absent above a month.
I cannot express what satissaction it gave me, to
come into my old habitation, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed: this little wandering journey, without a let-
tied place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that
my own house, as I called it to myself, was a persect
settlement compared to that; and it rendered every
thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I would
never go a great way srom it again, while it mould be
my lot to stay on the island. I rcpcled
I reposed myself here p week to rest and regale myself
after my long journey; during which, most of the time
was taken up in the weig! *y affair of* making a cage for
my Pol, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to be
mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to
think of the poor kid, which I had pent in within my lit-
tle circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give
it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where
I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food; I went and cut boughs of trees,
and branches of such shrubs as I could sind, and threw
it over, and having fed it, I tied it, as before, to lead it
away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had
no need to have tied it; for it followed me like a dog 5
and, as I continually fed it, the creature grew so lovr
ing> so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me af-
terwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same for
lemn manner as besore, being the anniversary- of my
landing on the island, having now been there two years,
and no more prospect of being delivered than the sirst
day I came there. I spent the whole, day in humble
and thanksul acknowledgments of the many wondersul
mercies which my solitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been insinitely more
miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God
had been pleased to discover to me, even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary conditions
than I should have been in the liberty of society, and in all
the pleasures of the' world: that he could sully make
up to me the desiciencies of my solitary state, and the
want of human society, by his presence, and the com-
munication of his grace to my foul, supporting, com-
forting, and encouraging me to depend upon his Pro-
vidence here, and hope ior his eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to seel how much
more happy the life I now led was, with all it's misera-
ble
blc circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable
lite I led all the past part of my days; and now having
changed both my sorrows and my joys, my very desires
altered, my asfections changed their gust, and my delights
were persectly new, from what they were at sirst coming,
or indeed for the two years past.
Besore, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or
for viewing the country, the anguish of my foul at my
condition would break out upon me on a sudden, and my
very heart would die within me, to think of the woods,
the mountains, the desarts I was in; and that I was a
prisoner locked up, with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemp-
tion. In the midst of the greatest composures of my
mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work, and
I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon
the ground for an hour or two together, and this was
still worse to me; for if I cpuld burst out into tears, or
vent myself by words, it would go off, and the gries would
naturally abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts;
I dailv read the word of God, and applied all the com-
forts of it to my present state. One morning, beine
very iad, I opened the bible upon these words" I will
never, never leave thee, nor sorsake thee!" Immediately
it occurred, that these words were to me; why else
should they bedirected in such a manner, just at the mo-
ment whtii 1 was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man? "Well, then," said I,
"if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
"can it be, or what matters it, though the world should
"all forsake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had
"all the world, and should lose the savour and blessing
"of God, there would be no comparison in the lols?"
From this moment I began to conclude in my mind,
that it was possible for me to be more happy in this for-
saken, solitary condition, than it was probable I ihould
have
have ever been in any other particular state in the world;
and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God
for bringing me to this place.
I know not what it was, but something mocked my
mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.
"How canst thou be such an hypocrite," said I, even
audibly, " to pretend to be thanksul for a condition,
"which, however thou mayest endeavour to be con-
"tented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be
"delivered from?" So I stopped there; but though I
could not say, I thanked God for being there, yet I sin-
cerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by
whatever asflicting providences, to fee the former condi-
tion of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and
repent. I never opened the bible, or shut it, but my
very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up
among my goods; and for assisting me afterwards to-
save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader the
trouble of so particular an account of my works this
year as the sirst; yet in general, it maybe observed,
that I was very seldom idle; having regularly divided
rhy time, according to the several daily employments
that, were besore me; such as, First, My duty to God,
and reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart
fome time for, thrice every day. Secondly, The going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours every morning when it did not rain.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cook-
ing, what I had kslled or catched for my supply. These
took up great part of the day; also it is tobe considered,
that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the
zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out;
so that about four hours in the evening was all the time
I could be sopposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad
with my gun in the afternoon. To
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
be added the exceeding laborioushess of my work; the
many hours, which, for want of tools, want of help,
and want of skill, every thing that I did took up out
of my time: for example, I was sull two and forty days
making me a board for a long shels, which I wanted in
in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and
saw-pit, would have cut six of them, out of the same
tree, in half a day.
My case was this: It was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be abroad
one. The tree I was three days cutting down, and
two more cutting osf the boughs, and reducing it to a
log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking
and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into chips,
till it began to be light enough to move; then I turned
it, and made one side smooth and flat as a board, from
end to end; then turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may
judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work;
but labour and patience carried me through that and
many other things; I only observe this in particular, to
fliew the reason v/hy so much of my time went away
with so little work, viz. that what might be a little to
be done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and re-
quired a prodigious time, to do alone and without such
assistance.
But, notwithstanding this, with patience and labour
I went through many things, and indeed every thing
my circumstances made necessary for me to do, as will
appear by what follows.
It was now the month of November when I expected
my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had ma-
nured, or dug up for them, was not great; for, as I
observed, my feed of each was not above the quantity
of half a peck; for I had lost one whole crop by sow-
ing in the dry season: but now my crop promised very
veil, when, on a Hidden, I found I was in danger of
losing
losing it all again by enemies of several sorts which it
was scarce poflible to keep srom it; as sirst the goats,
and wild creatures which I called hares, who tasting the
sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon
as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get no
time to shoot up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclo-
sure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal
of toil; and the more, because it required expedition,
the creatures daily spoiling my corn. However, as my
arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it
totally well fenced in about three weeks; and shooting
some of the creatures in the day-time, set my dog to
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate,
where he would stand and bark all night long; so, in a
little time, the enemies forsook the place, and the coru
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me besore, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; for, going along by the place
to fe"e how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded
with fowls of I know not how many forts, which stood a$
it were watching till I should be gone. I immediately let
fly among them (for I had always my gun with me.) I had
no sooner mot, but there arose up a little cloud offowls,
which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a
few days they would devour all my hopes, that I should
be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all; and
what to do I could not tell: however, I resolved not to
lose my corn, if poflible, though I should watch it
night and day. In the sirst place, I went among it, to
see what damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as is was yet too
green for them, the loss was not so great, but the re-
mainder was like to be a good crop, if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away,
I could easily see the thieves sitting upon Vll the trees
about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away,
and
8nJ the event proved it to be so; for. as I walked off,
as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight,
but they dropped down one by one into the corn again.
I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to stay
till more came down, knowing that every grain they eat
now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the
consequence; but coming np to the hedge, I sired again,
and killed three of them. TJ^s was what I wished for;
so I took them up, and served them as we serve notori-
ous thieves in England, viz. hanged them in chains, for
no LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
that this should have such an efFect as it had; for the
fowls would not only not come to the corn, but in short
they forsook all that part of the island, and I could
never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows
hung there.
This I was very glad of, you maybe sure; and about
the latter end of December, which was my second har-
vest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it
down, and all I could do was to make one as well as I
could out of one of the broad swords or cutlasses, which
I had saved among the arms out of the ship. However,
as my crop was but small, I had no great dissiculty to
cut it down; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut no-
thing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great bas-
ket which I had made, and so nibbed it out with my
hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found,
that out of my half-peck of feed, I had near two bu-
shels of rice, and above two bushels and an half of bar-
ley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure
at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw, that in time it would please God to sup-
ply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed again,
for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my
corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made
into meal, how to make bread of it; and if how to make
it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things be-
ing
ing added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not
to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed
against the next season, and in the mean time to employ
all my study and hours of working to accomplish this
great work of providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly laid, that now I worked for my
bread. It is a little wondersul, and what I believe few
people have thought much upon, viz. the strange mul-
titude of little things necessary in the providing, produc-
ing, curing, dressing, making, and sinishing, this one
article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made more
and more sensible of it every hour, even alter I got the
sirst handsul of seed corn, which, as I have said, came
up unexpectedly, and indeed to my surprize.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, nor spade or
shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a
wooden spade, as I observed besore; but this did my
work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a
great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not
only wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder
and much worse done.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work
it out with patience, and bear with the badness of the
persormance. When the corn was sowed, I had no har-
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a
great heavy bough cf a tree over it, to scratch the earth,
as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.'
When it was growing, or grown, I have observed al-
ready how many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it,
mew or reap it, cure or carry it hon e, thresh, part it
from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to
frind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into
read, and an oven to bake it in; and all these things I
did without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was
an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too; but
all this, as I said, made every thing laborious and tedi-
Vol. I. M eu»
dious to me, but that there was no help tor; neither was
my time so much loss to me, because I had divided it:
a certain part of it was every day appointed to these
works; and as I resolved to use none ot the corn for
bread, till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the n?xt
six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and in-
vention, to surnish myself with utensils, proper for per-
forming all the operations necessary for making the corn,
when I had it, sit for use. .
But, sirst, I was to prepare more land, for I had now
feed enough to low above an acre of ground. Besore I
did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a
spade, which, when it was done, was a very poor one
indeed, and being heavy, required double labour to
work with it; however, I went through that, and lowed
my feeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my
house as I could sind them to my mind, and fenced them
in with a good hedge, the stakes ot which were all cut
off that wood I had let besore, which I knew would
grow, so that in one year's time I was sure I should have
a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair.
This work was not so trifling but that it took me up
at least three months, because great part of that time
was of the wet s'aliin, when I could not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could not
go out, I found employment on the following occasion,
always observing, that all the while I. was at work, I
diverted myself with talkingto my parrot, and teachsng
him to speak; and I quickly learned him to know his
own name; at last, to speak it out pretty loud, POL;
which was the sirst word I ever heard spoken in the
island by any mouth but my own. This, theresore was
not my work, but an assistant to my work: for now, as
I said, I had a great employment upon my hands, which
was as follows: I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself lome earthen vessels, which in-
deed, I greatly wanted, but knew not how to come at
them: however, considering the heat of the.climate, I
did not doubt but, if I could tied out any such clay, I
msght botch up some such pot, as might, being dried
bv the run, be hard enough, and strong enough to bear
handling, and tohold anything that was dry, and required
to be kept so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c. which was thelhingl was upon, I resolved to
make iome as large as I could, and lit only to stand like
jars to hold what should be put into them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at
me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise
this paste, what odd, mishapen ugly things I made, how
many os them tell in, and how many sell out, the clay
not being stiff enough to be?r its own weight; how
many cracked by the over-violent heat of the ran, being
set out too hastily; and how many fell to pieces, with
only removing, as well besore as alter they were dried;
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to sind
the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and
work it, I could notmaKe above two large earthen ugly-
things, I cannot call them jars, in about two months
labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I liittd them gently up, and set them down again
in two gieat wicker baskets, which I had made on pur-
pose sor them, that they might not break; and as, be-
tween the pot and the basket, there wns a little room to
spare, I Untied it lull o. the rice and barley straw, and
these two being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my corn, and perhaps the meal when the corn
was bruised.
fiiougii I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better suc-
cess; such as little round pots, flat dimes, pitchers, and
pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to; and the
heat of the lun baked tlicm exceeding hard.
But all this would not answer my end; which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear
tiie sire, which none of these could do. It happened,
alter .ome time, n.akn ga pretty large sire sor cooking
my meat, when I went to put it out, aiter I had done
M a with
«+ LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
ware vessels in the sire, burnt as hard as a stone and
red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it,
and said to myself, that certainly they might be made
to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my sire, so as t»
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln
such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with
lead, though I had some lead to do it with: but I
placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a
pile, one upon another, and placed my sire-wood all
round it, with a great heap of embers under them: I
plied the sire with fresh suel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them stand in
that heat about sive or six hours, till I found one of
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay, melted by the
violence of the heat, and would have nan into glass, if
I had gone on; so I flacked my sire gradually, till the
pots began to abate of the red colour; and watching
them all night, that I might not let the sire abate too
sast, in the morning I had three very good, I will not
say handsome pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as
hard burnt as could be desired; and one of them per-
fectly glazed with the running of the sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I wanted
no fort of earthen-ware for my use; but I must observe
as to the shapes of them, they were very indifferent, as
any one may suppose, when I had no way of making
them, but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman
would make pies that never learned to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal
to mine, when I sound I had made an earthen pot that
would bear the sire; and I had hardly patience to stay
till they were cold, besore I set one upon the sire again,
with some water in it, to boil some meat, which I did
admirably well; and with a piece of a kid I made some
very
very good broth, thouoh I wanted oatmeal, and several
other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would
have had it.
My next concern was, to gei me a {tone mortar, to
stamp or belt some corn in: fer as to the mill, there was
no thought of arriving to that persection cf art with
one pair of hands. To Ripply this want, I was at a
great loss; for, os all trades in the world, I was as per-
fectly unqualisied for a stone-cutter, as for any whatso-
ever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I
spent many a day to sind cut a great stone big enough
to cut hollow, and make si for a mortar, and could sind
ROBTNSON CRUSOE nj
I had no wry to c! ig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks
in the island of hardness sussicient, but were ail of a san-
dvcrumbling stone, which would neither bear the weight
ot an heavy peftie, ncr wcuid it break the corn without
filling it with sand: so, after a great deal of time lost
in searching for a stone, 1 gave it over, and resolved to
lock out a great block of hard woed, which I found
indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it en the out-
side with my ax and hatchet; and then with the help of
sire., and insinite labour, made an hollow place in it, as
the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this,
I made a great heavy pestle or beater, of the wood cal-
led the iren-wood, and this I prepared and laid by against
I had try r.cxt crop of coin, when I proposed to myself
to grind, or rather pound, my corn or ir.cal to make
rr.y bread.
My next dissiculty was to make a sieve or sierce, to
dress my meal, and part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not fee it possible I could have any
bread. This was a most disssicult thing, so much as
but tothir.k on; sor to he sure I had nothing like the
r.eceflarv things to make it with: I mean, sine thin
canvas, or stusf to sierce the irtal through. And here
I wr.s at a sull stop for many months; nor did I really
know what to do; linen I had none lest, but what were
M 3 mere
mere rags; I had goats hair, but neither knew I how
to weave or lj>in it; and had I known how, here were
no tools to work it with: all the remedy 1 found for
this was, that at last I did remember I had among the
stamens cloathes which were saved out of the ship, some
neckcloths of cidlico or muslin; and with some pieces of
these I made three small sic-ves, but proper enough for
the work; and thus I made a shift for some years; how
I did afterwards, I shall shew in its place.
Thebakhig part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I mould make bread when I came to have corn;
for, sirst, I had no yeast: as to that part, as there was
no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself
much about it. But, for an oven, I was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that also, which was this; I made some earthen vessels
very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two
feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep; these I
burnt in the sire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great sire
upon the hearth, which I had paved with some square
tiles of my own making and burning also: but I sltould
not call them square.
When the sire-wood was burnt pretty much into cm-
bers or live coals, I drew them forward upoii this hearth,
so as to cover it all over; and there I let them lie till
the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away all the
embers, I put down my loaf or loaves: and whelming
down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers all
round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the
heat; and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world,
I baked my barley-loaves, and became in a liitle tims
a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made my-
self ieveral cakes cf the rice, and puddings ; indeed I
made no pics, neither had I anv thing to put into them,
supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or
goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all tin fe things took
me up most pait of the third year of my abode here;
for st is to ba observed, that in the intervals of theft
things I had my new harvest and husbandry to ma-
nage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it
home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my
large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for 1 had
no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn encreasing, I
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place
to lay it up in; for the increase of the com now yielded
me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty
bushels, and os the rice as much, or more; insomuch,
that I now resolved to begin to use it freely, for my
bread had been quite gene a great while; also I re-
folved to see what quantity would be sussicient for me a
whole year, and to sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could consume
. in a year; so I resolved to low just the lame quantity
every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would sully provide me with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of
land, which 1 had seen from the other side of the island;
and I was rtot without secret wishes, that I was on
shore there, sancying that seeing the main land, and an
inhabited countrv, I might sind some way or other to
convey myself sarther, and perhaps, at last, sind some
means ot escape.
slut all this while I made no allowance for the dan-
gers of inch a condition, and how I might sall into the
hards of savages, and perhaps ir.ch as I might have
reason to think sar worse than the lions and tygers cf
Africa: that if I once came into their power, I should
run a hazard, more than a thousand to or.e, of being
killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard
that the people os the Caribean coasts were cannibals,
or men eaters; aiid I knew by the latitude, that I could
not be sar off from that shore: that, suppose they were
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many Europe-
ans,
ans who had sallen into their hands had been served,
even when they had been ten or twenty together; much
more I, that was but one, and could make little or no
desence. All these things, I say, which I ought to have
considered well of, and which engaged my thoughts af-
terwards, took up none of my apprehensions at tint;
and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting
over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xtiry, and the long-boat
with the moulder of mutton sail, with which I "Vailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but this
was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look on our
ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon
the more a great way in the storm, when we were sirst
cast away. She lay almost where she did at sirst, but not
quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and
winds, almost bottom upwards, against the high ridge
of beachy, rough sand, but no water about her as
before.
. If I had had hands to have resitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat woold have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the
Brazils with her easy enough; but I might have easily
foreseen, that I could no more turn her, and set her up-
right upon her bottom, than I could remove the island.
However, I went to the wood, and cut levers and rol-
lers, and brought them to the boat, resolvin°- to try
what I could do: suggesting to myself that if I could
but turn her down, I might easily repair the damage
she had received, and that me would be a very good
boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared nopains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless
toil, and I spent, I think, three or four weeks -.bout it;
at last, sinding it impossible to heave it up with my little
strength, I sell to digging away the sand to undermine
it; and to to make it sell down, setting pieces of wood
to thrust and guide it right in the sall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it ui>
again, or to get under it, much les* to move it forwards
towards
fowards the water; so I was forced to give it up i
and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my
desire to venture across the main increased, rather
than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking, whether it was
not possible to make myself a canoe, or periagua, such
as the natives of thole climates make, even without
tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz. of the
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possi-
ble, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with the
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians;
but not at all considering the particular inccnveniencies
which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want
of hands to move it into the water when it was made;
a dissiculty much harder for me to surmount, than all
the consequences that want of tools could be to them;
for what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast
tree in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it
down, if after I might be able with my tools to hew and
dub the outside into a proper shape of a boat, and burn
or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a
boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it just where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind frcm this circumstance,
while I was making this boat, but I mould have imme-
diately thought how I should get it into the sea; but
my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the
sea in it, that I never once considered how I mould get
it off the land; and it was really in its own nature
more easy lor me to guide it over forty-sive miles of
fea, than about forty-sive sathom of land, where it lay,
to let it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did, who had any of his fenses awake. I
pleased myself with the design, without determining
whether or not I was able to undertake it; not but that
the dissiculty of launching my boat came often into my
head;
head ;"but I put a stop to my own enquiries into st, by
this foolish answer which I gave myself' Letme sirst
'make it, I'll warrant I'll sind some way or other to
'get it along when it is done.'
This was a most preposterous idea, but the eagerness
of my sancy prevailed, to work I went, and selled a
cedar tree: I question much whether Solomon ever had
inch an one for the building the temple at Jerusalem;
it was sive seet ten inches diameter at the lower part next
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the
end of twenty-two feet, alter which it lessened gradually
and then parted into branches; it, was not without in-
sinite labour that I Idled this tree: I was twenty days
hacking and hewing it at the bottom: I was fourteen
more getting the branches and limbs, and the vast
spreading head of it cut off; which I hacked and hewed
through with my ax and hatchet. Alter this it cost me
a month to shape it, to bring it to a proportion, and
to something like the bottom of a boat, that it might
swim upright as it ought ta"do. It cost me near three
months more to clear the inside, and work it cut, ib as to
make an exact boat of it: this I did, indeed, without si/e,
by mere mallet and chissel, and by the dmt of hard la-
bour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome peria-
gua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men,
and consequently big enough to have carried me and all
my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was extreme-
ly delighted with it: the boat was really much bigger
than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of
one tree in my life; and many a weary stroke it had cost
me, you may be lure. There remained nothing but to
get it into the water, which had I been able to effect, I
make no doubt but I mould have begun the maddest
voyage, and the most unlikely to be persormed, that
ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water sailed me,
though they cost insinite labour too; it lay about one
hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the
sirst
first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek*
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to
dig into the sursace of the earth, and so make a decli-
vity; this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of
pains: but who will grudge pains, that have their de-
liverance in view? But when this was worked through,
and this dissiculty removed, it was still much the same;
for I could no more stir the canoe, than I could the other
boat.
I then measured the distance of ground, and resolved
to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the ca-
noe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the wa-
ter. Well, I began this work, and when I entered into
it,anJ calculated how deep it was to be dug, how broad,
how the stusf to be thrown out, I found, that by the
number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must
have been ten or twelve years besore I should have gone
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that, at the
upper end, it must have been at least twenty feet deep.
In consequence of these dissiculties, I gave up all thoughts
of getting my vessel into the water.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late, the folly of beginning a work besore we count the
cost, and before we judge rightly cf our own strength to
go through with it.
While prosecuting this work I sinished my fourth year
in this istand, and kept my anniversary with the same
devotion, and with as much comfort as ever besore; for
by a constant study, and serious application of the word
of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a
different knowledge from what I had besore; I enter-
tained disferent notions of things; I looked now upon
the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires about.
In a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever
like to have; so I thought it looked, as we perhaps may
look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived in,
but was come out of; and well might I say, as Father
Abraham f id to Dives' Between me and thee thera
 is a great gulph sixed*' la
In the sirst place I was removed from all the wicked-
ness of the world here: I had neither the * Lust of the
'flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life:' I had
nothing to covet, for I had all I was now capable of en-
joying: I was lord of the whole manor, or, if I pleased,
I might call myself king, or emperor over the whole
country which I had possession of: there were no rivals.
I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com-
mand with me. I might have raised ship-loadings of
corn, but I had no use for it: so I let as little grow as
I thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoises or
turtles enough; but now and then one was as much as I
could put to any use. I had timber enough to have
built a fleet of ships; I had grapes enough to have made
wine, or have cured into raisins, to have loaded that
fleet when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was what was valuable.
I had enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what
was all the rest tome? if I killed more flesh tiian I
could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin; if I sowed
more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled: the tree*
that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground, I could
make no more use of them than for suel; and that I had
no occasion for, but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated
to me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of
this world are no sarther good to us, than they are for
our use; and that whatever we may heap up, indeed, to
give others, we enjoy as much as we can use, and no
more. The most covetous griping miser in the world
would have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he
had been in my case; for I possessed insinitely more than
I knew what to do with; I had no room for desire, ex-
cept it was of things which I had not, and they were but
trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had, as I
hinted before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling: alas! there the nasty,
. sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of use for it;
ajid I often thought with myself, that I would havogiven
a
a handsul of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or a hand-
mill to grind my corn .. nay, I would have given it all
for six-penny-worth of turnep and carrot feed out os
England, or for a handsul of peas and beans, and a bot-
tle of ink. As it was, I had not the lead advantage by.
it, or benesit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and
grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in the wet
season; and if I had had the drawer foil of diamonds,
it had been the s.line cafe; and they had been of no value
to me, becaule of no use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much easier
in itself than it was at sirst, and much easier to my mind
, as well as to my body. I frequently sat-down to my
meat with thanksulness, and admired the hand of Gods
providence, which had thus spread my table in the wil-
derness: I learned to look more upon the bright side of
my condition, and less upon the dark-side; and to consi-
der what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted: and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot
express them; and which I take notice of here, to put
those discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy
comfortably what God hath given them, because they
see and covet something that he has not given them.
All our discontents about what we want appear to me
to spring from the want of thanksulness for what we
have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubt-
less would be so to any one that mould sall into such dis-
tress as mine was; and this was to compare my present
condition with what I at sirst expected it mould be;
nay, with what'it would certainly have been, if the good
Providence of God had not wondersully ordered theship
to be cast up nearer to the more, where I not only could,
come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to
the shore for my relies and comfort; without which I
had wanted tools to work, weapons for desence, or gun-
powder and mot for getting my food. ,
1 spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in repre-
Vot. I. N . senting
/enting to mysels in the most lively colours, how I mud
have acted, if I had got nothing out of the ship; I re^
flected that I could not have so much as got any food,
except sish and turtles; and that, as it was long besore
I found anv of them, I must have perished sirst: that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere
savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any
contrivance, I had noway to flea or open them, or part
the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up;
but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
claws, like a beast.
These reslections made me very sensible of the good-
ness of Providence, and very thanksul for my present
condition, with all its hardships and misfortunes: and
this part also I cannot but recommend to the reflection
of those who are apt in their misery to say' Is any
'assiicf ion like mine?' Let them consider how much
worse the cases of some people are, and what their case
might have been, if it had been the will of Provi-
dence.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to com-
fort my mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my
present condition with what I had deserved, and had
theresore reason to expect from the hand of Providence;
I had lived a deadsul life, persectly destitute of the
knowledge and fear of God; I had been well instructed
by sather and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavours to insuse a religious awe of
God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the
nature and end of my being required of me: but, alas!
salling early into the sea-saring life, which of all others
makes men the most destitute of the iear of God, though
his terrors are always besore them; I say, sal-
ling early into the sea-taring life, and into sea-saring
company, all that little sense of religion, which I had
entertained, was laughed out of me by my messmates }
by an hardened despising of dangers, and the views of
death which grew habitual to me; by mv long absence
from all manner of opportunities to converse with any
thing
firing but what was like myself, or to hear any thing oi
what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the
least fense of what I was, or was to be, that in the:
greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape from
Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master oi
the ship, my being planted so well in Brazil, my receiv-
ing the cargo srom England, and the like, I never once
had the words ' Thank God,' so much as on my mind,
or in my mouth: nor in the greatest distress had I so
much thought as to pray to him, nor so much as to say,
'Lord have mercy upon me!' No, not to mention the
name of God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme
it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed,on account of my
wicked and hardened past lise; and when I looked about
me, and considered what particular providences h^d at*
tended me, since my coming into this place, and that
God had dealt bountisully with me; had not only pu-
nished me less than my iniquity deserved, but had so
plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hopes,
that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
mercies in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God in the present dis-
position of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thanksulness of my condition; and that I, who was yet
a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not
the due punishment os my sins; that I enjoyed so many
mercies, which I had no reason to have expected in that
place; that I ought never more to repine at my condi-
tion, but to rejoice and give daily thanks, for that daily
bread, which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have
"brought: that I ought to consider I had been fed, even
by a miracle, as great as that of feeding Elijah by
ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; and that J
could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part
of tl;e world( where I could have been cast more to my
Ji % advantage;
advantage: a place where, as I had no society, which
was my asfliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous
beasts, no surious wolves or tygers, to threaten my life;
no venomous or poisonous creatures which I might
have fed on to my hurt; no savages to murder and de-
vour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so
> it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to
make it a life of comfort, but to be able to make my
fense of God's goodness to me, and care over me in this
condition, be my daily consolation; and after I made a
. just improvement of these things, Iwent-away, and was
no more dejected.
I had now been here so song, that many things which
I brought on shore for my help, were either quite gone,
or verv much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time,
all but a very little, which I ceked out with water a
little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce lest any ap-
pearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted
I made use of it to minute down the days of the month
on which any remarkable thing happened to me; and
sirst, by casting up times past, I remember, that there
was a strange concurrence of days, in the various provi-
dences which besel me, and which, if I had been iuper-
stitioufly inclined to observe days as satal or fortunate,
I might have had reason to have looked upon with a
great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day I broke away
from my sather and my friends, and ran away to Hull,
in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was
taken by the Sallee man of war, and made aflave.
The same day ofthe year that I escaped out of thewreck
«f that ship in Yarmouth-Roads,that same day of the year
afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
Thesnmeday ofthe year on which I was born, viz.
the z0th of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I was
cast on shore in this island: so that my wicked life, and
solitary life, both began on a day. The
The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of
my bread; I mean, the biscuit which I brought out of
the ship. This I had husbanded to the last degree, al-
lowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a
year; and yet I was quite without bread for a year, be-
fore I got any corn of my own; and great reason I had
to be thanksul that I had any at all, t'ne getting it being,
as has been already observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay: as to linen, I had
been without it some time, except some checked shirts
which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and
which I caresully preserved, because many times I could
wear no other cloathson but a shirt; and it was a great
help to me, that I had, among all the mens deaths of
the ship, almost: three dozen of shirts. There were also
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which were lest
behind, but they were too hot to wear; and though it is
true the weather was so violent hot that there was no
need os cloaths, yet I could not go quite naked; no,
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor
could bear the thoughts or it, though I was all alone.
One reason why I did not choose to go quite naked
was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked, as with some cloaths on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, wjth a shirt
on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling un-
der the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it: no
mere could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat
of the sun without a cap or an hat; the heat of the sun
beating with such violence as it does in that place, would
give me the head-ach presently, by darting so directly
en my head, that I could not bear it; whereas, is I put
en my hat, it would soon g» away.
From these reasons I was induced, accordingly, to
consider about putting the few rags I had, which I
called cloaths, into some order; I had worn out all the
waistcoats, and my business was now to try if I could
not make jackets out os the great watch-coats, and with
such other materials as I had. I set to work tayloriiig,
N 3 er
or rather, indeed botching: for I made most piteous
work of it. However, I contrived to make two or three
waistcoats, which 1 hoped would serve me a great while;
as for breeches, or drawers, I made a very poor esfort,
indeed.
I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the
creatures I killed, I mean four-sooted ones; and I hnd
hung them up stretched out with sticks in the sun, by
which means some of them were so dry and hard, that
they were of little use; but others were very serviceable.
The sirst thing I made of these was a great cap for my
head, with the hair on the outside to shoot osf the rain;
and this I persormed so well, that 1 afterwards made a
suit of cloaths wholly of those skins; that is to say, a
waistcoat and breeches open at the knees, and both
loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me cool,
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge,
that they were wretchedly made; for, if I was a bad
carpenter, 1 was a worse taylor; however, they were
such as I snade a very good shift with; and when I was
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat
and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella, of which, indeed, I was in great want.
I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are
very usetul in the great heats of that part of the world;
and I selt theheats every jot as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to
be much abroad, it was a most usesul thing to me, as well
for the rains as the heats. I took great pains at it, and
was a long while before I could make any thing likely
to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the way, I
spoiled two or three besore I made one to my mind;
but, at last, I made one that answered indisferently well;
the main dissiculty I found was to make it let down. I
could make it to spread; but if it did not let down too,
and draw in, it would not be portable for me any way,
buL just over my head, which would not do: however,
*t last, as I said, I made one to answer; I covered it-
wst!}
with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain
like a pent-house, and kept off thesun so effectually, that
1 could walk out in the hottest or the weather, with
greater advantage than I could besore in the coolest; and
when I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it
under my arm.
Thus <I lived very comfortably, my mind being en-
tirely composed by resigning myself to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his
providence; this made my life be:ter than sociable; for,
when I began to regret the want of conversation, I
would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, Imay ay, with
even my Maker, by ejaculations andQpetitions, was not
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in
the world.
I cannot say, that after this, for sive years, any extra-
ordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on in-
the same course, in the same state and place, just as be-
fore; the chies thing I was employed in, besides my
yearly labour of planting my bailey and rice, and cur-
ing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just
enough to have sussicient stock os the year's provisions
besorehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my
daily labour of going out with my gun, I had a labo-
rious talk to make me a canoe, which at last I sinished;
fo that by digging a canal to it six feet wide and four
feet deep, I brought it into the creek almost half 3 mile.
As for the sirst, it was by far too large, having made it
without considering besorehand, as I ought to have done,
how I mould be able to launch it; in consequence of
which, not being able to bring it to the water, or the
water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a
memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time. In-
deed, the next time, though I could not get a tree pro-
per for it, and was in a place where I could not get
the water to it, at any less distance than, as I have said,
of near half a mile; yet, as I saw it was practicable I
juver gave it over till I had accomplished it; and though
\ was
I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my
labour, in hopes of having a boat with which I might
proceed to sea.
However, though my little periagua was sinished,
yet the size of it was not at all aniwerable to the design
which I had in view when I made the sirst; I mean, of
venturing over to the terra fima, where it was above
forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my
boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I
thought no more of it; but, as I had a boat, my next
design was to make a tour round the island; for, as I
had been on the other side, in one place, crofling, as I
have already described it, over the land: so the discove-
ries I made in thaC journey made me very eager to lee
the other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, J
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with
discretion and consideration, I sitted up a little mast to
my beat, and made me a sail to it out os some ot the
pieces of the ship's sails, which by in store, and os which
I had a great quantity by me.
Having sitted my mast aud sail, and tried the boat, I
found she would sail very well: I then made little lock-
ers and boxes at either end of my boat, to put provisions,
necessaries, ammunition, &c. into, to be kept dry, ei-
ther from rain, or the spray of the sea; and I cut in
the inside of the boat, alittle, long, hollow place, where
I could by my gun, making a flap to hang down over it
to keep t dry.
I sixed my umbrella also in a step ?.t the stern, like a
mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the
sun off me like an awning; and thus I every now and
then took a small voyage upon the sea, but never went
far from the creek. At last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour, and accordingly victualled my ship for the voyage;
putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rathe r
call them) of barley-bread; an earthen pot sull of
parched rice, (a food of which I eat a great deal) a small
bottle
bottle of rum: half a goat, and powder with shot for
killing more: and two large watch coats, of those which,
as I mentioned besore, I had saved out of the seamen*
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to
cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I set out
on the voyage; and I found it much longer than I ex-
pected; for though the island itself was not very large,
yet, when I came to the east-side of it, I found a great
ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea,
some above water, some under it; and beyond this, a
stioal of sand, lying dry half a league more; so that
I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to dou-
ble that point.
When I sirst discovered them, I was going to give over
my enterprize, and come back again, not knowing how
sar it might oblige me to go out to sea; and, above all,
doubting how I mould get back again; so I came to an
anchor, for I had made me a kind of anchor with a piece
of broken grappling which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went
n more, climbing up an hill, which seemed to overlook
that point, where I saw the sull extent of it, and resolved
to venture.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 14.1
ceived a strong, and indeed a most surious current, which
ran to the east, and even came close to the point; and I
took the more notice of it, because I saw there might be
some danger, that when I came into it, I might be car-
ried out to sea by its strength, and not be able to make
the island again; and, indeed, had I not gotten sirst upon
this hill, I believe it would have been so; for there was
the same current on the other side of the island, only that
it set off at a sarther distance; and I saw there was a
Jtrong eddy under the shore; so I had notMng to do but
to get out of the sirst current, and I should presently be
w an eddy.
I lay here, however, two day s; because the wind blow-
ing
ing pretty fresh (E. atS. E. and. that being just contrary
to the said current) made a great breach of the sea upon
the point; so that it was not safe for me to keep too
close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far osf
iecause of the stream.
The third day, in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the lea was calm, and I ventured;
but no sooner did I reach the point, when even I was
not my boat's length from the shore, than I found my-
self in a great depth of water, and a current like a sluice
of a mill; it carried my boat along with it with such
violence, that all I could do could not keep her so much
as on the edge ot it; but I found it hurried me sarther
and sarther out from the eddy, which was on the lest-
hand. There was no wind stiring to help me, and all I
could do with my paddle signisied nothing; and now I
began to give myself over for test; for, as the current
was on both sides the, island, I knew in a few leagues
distance they must join again, and then 1 was irrecover-
ably gone; nor did I see any possibility os avoiding it;
so that I had no prospect besore me but of perishing; not
by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shole, as
big almost as I could lift, and had tolled it into the boat;
and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say,
one of my earthen pots; but what was all this to being
driven into the vast occean, where, to be sure, there wan
no shore, no main land or ifland, for a thousand league*
at least.
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of
<5od to make the most miserable condition that mankind
could be in, worse. Now I looked back upon my deso-
late solitary island, as the most pleasant place in the world,
and all the happiness my heart could wish for, was to
be there again. I stretched out my hands to it with
eager wishes: ' O happy deiart!' laid I, I shall never
* see thee more! O miserable creature!' said I, ' whi.
'ther am I going!' Then I reproached myself with
my unthanksul temper, and how I had repined at my
solitary
solitary condition; and now what would I give to be
on shore there again! Thus we never fee the true state
of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its con-
traries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by
the want of it: it is scarce possible to imagine the con-,
sternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide
ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and kept my
boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the
side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I
could; when, about noon, as the sun passed the meri-
dian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my sace,
s'pririging up from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart
a little, arid especially when, in about half an hour
more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale: by this time
I was gotten at a frightsul distance from the island;
and, had the'least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another way too; for I had no compass
on board, and should never have known how to have
steered towards the island if I had once lost sight of it;
but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get
up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to
the north, as much as possible, to get out of the cur-
rent.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat be-
gan to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness of tha
water, some alteration of the current was near; for
where the current was so strong, the water was foul; but
perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate;
and presently I discovered to the east, at about half a
mile, a breach of the sea upon lome rocks; these rocks
I found caused the current to part again; and as the
main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the N. E. so the other returned by the repulse
of the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again to the N. W. with a very ssiarp stream.
Those who know what it is to have a reprieve brought
tihqp
them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves
just going to murder them, or who have been in such
like extremities, may guess what my present surprize
of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the
stream of this eddy; and the wind also freshening,
how gladly I spread my sail to it, running chear-
ftilly besore the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy-
under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back,
again, directly towards the island, but about two
leagues more towards the northward than the current
lay, which carried me away at sirst; so that when I
came near the island, I found myself open to the
northern shore of it, that is to lay, the other end of
the island, opposite to that which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league of
way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it'
was spent, and assisted me no sarther. However, be-
ing between the two great currents, viz,, that on the
fouth-side, which had hurried me away, and that on
the north, which lay about two leagues on the other side;
I say, between these two, in the west of the island, I
found the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind sair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making such
fresh way as I did besore.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the point
of the rocks which occasioned this distance stretching-
out, as is described besore, to the southward, and,
casting off the current more southerly, had, of course,
made another eddy to the north, and this I found very
strong, but not directly setting the way my course lav,
which was due west, but almost sull north. However,
having a fresii gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting
north-west, and in about an hour came within about a
mile os the shore, where, it being smooth water, I foon
got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
4 God
Cod thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and resresh-
ing myself with such things as I had, I brought my
boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied
under some trees, and laid me down to steep, be-
ing quite spent with the labour and satigue of th«
vovage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew
too much the case to think of attempting it by the way
I went out; and what might be at the other side (I
mean, the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind
to run any more ventures; so, I only resolved in the
morning to make my way westward along the shore,
and to lee if there was no creek where I might lay up
my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I wanted
her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting
the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a
mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient harbour
for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a
little dock made on purpose for her; here I put in, and
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to
look about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been besore, when I travelled on foot to
that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat, but my
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I be-
gan to march: the way was comfortable enough, after
liich a voyage as I had been; and I reached my o>.l
bower in the evening, where I found ever}' thing stand-
ing as I lest it; for I always kept it in good order, be-
ing, as I said besore, my country house.
I got over the sence, and laid me down in the made
to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell afleep:
but judge if you can, you, that read my story, what a
surprize I must have been in, when I was awaked out of
nvyfleep by a voice callingmebymv nameleveral times,
* Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe-! pocr Robin Crusoe?
Vol. I. 0 'Where
'Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you"?
'Where have you been?*
I was so sast asleep at sirst, being satigued with row-
ing, or paddling, as it is called, the sirst part of the day,
and walking the latter part, that I did not awake tho-
roughly; and dozing between steeping and waking;,
thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me: but as
the voice continued to repeat, 'Robin Crusoe! Robin
Crusoe!' at last I began to awake more persectly, and
was at sirst dreadsully frighted, and started up in theut-
jnost consternation* but no sooner were my eyes open,
than I saw my Pol sitting on the top of the hedge, and
immediately knew that this was he that spoke to me;
for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk
to him, and teach him; and he had learned it so per-
fectly, that he would sit upon my singer, and lay his
bill close to my sace, and cry' Poor Robin Crusoe,
 where are you! where have you been! hbw came you
'here!' and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while
besore I could compose myself. First, I was amazed
how the creature got thither, and then how he should
just keep about the place, and no where else: but as I
was well satissied it could be nobody but honest Pol, I
cot it over; and holding out my hand, and calling him-
by his name, Pol, the sociable, came to me, and sat
upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talk-
ing to me, 'Poor Robin Crusoe;' and how did I come
here; and, where I had been; just as if he had been
overjoyed to fee me again.
I had now enough of rambling to sea, and continued
for some days in a very quiet state, reflecting on the dan-
ger I had been in: I would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island, but I knew not.
how it was practicable to get it about; as to the east-
fide of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well
enouph there was no venturing that way; my very
fcean would shrink, and my very blood run chill, to
think
think of it; and to the other side of the island, I did
not know how it might be there ; but supposing the cur-
rent ran with the same force against the shore at the
cast, as it passed by it on the other, I might run the
fame risque of being driven down the stream, and car-
ried by the island, as I had been besore of being car-
ried away from it; so, with these thoughts, I contented
myself to be without any boat, though it had been the
product of so many months labour to make it, and of
fo many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near a
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1+7
siippose; and my thoughts, being much composed as to
my condition, and sully comforted in resigning myself
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived
very happily in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself, in this time, in all the mecha-
nic exercises which my necessities put me upon apply-
ing myself to; and, I believe, could, upon occasion,
have made a very good carpenter, especially considering
how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected persection in
my earthen-ware, and contrived to make them with a
wheel, which I found insinitely easier and better; be-
cause I made things round and shapeable, which besore
were very aukward and rough in their form. But I
think I never was more vain of my own persormance,
or more joysul for any thing I found out, than my
being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was
a very ugly clumsy thing when done, and only burnt
red like other earthen-ware, yet, as it was hard and sirm,
and would draw the linoak, I was exceedingly comforted
with it: for I had been always used to smoak, and
there were pipes in the ship; but I forgot them at sirst,
not knowing there was tobacco in the island; and after-
wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not come
at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made
abundance of necessary haikets, <u well as my invention
O * suggested;
suggested; though they were not very handsome, yet
they were convenient for my laying things up in, or
fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a
goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a
basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take
out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
.enough for me, and bring them home in a basket, and
leave the rest behind me: also hrge deep baskets were
. my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out
as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it in great
baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated consider-:
ably: and this was an article which it was impossible
fpr me to supply; I therefore began seriously to consider
what I must do when I should have no more powder;
that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I
had, as I observed in the third year of my being here,
kept a young kid, and bred her up tame; I was in
hopes of getting an he-kid, but I could not by any
means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat;
and I could never sind in my heart to kill her, till she
died at last of mere age.
But being now in the eleventh year of my residence;
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I iet
myself to study some art to trap and share the goats, to
fee whether I could not catch some of them alive; and
par! icularly I wanted a slie-goat great with young.
For this purpose I made shares to hamper them; and
I believe they were more than once taken in them; but
my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and always
found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-sall; so I dug seve-
ral large pits in the earth, in places where I had ob-
served the geats used to feed, and over these pits I
placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and ieveral times I put ears of bar-
ley and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I could
easily perceive, that the goats had gone in and eaten
up
tip the corn. At length, I set three traps in one night,
and going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was very discou-
raging; however, I altered my traps; and, going one
morning to fee my traps, I found, in one ot them, a
large old he-goat; and, in one of the others, three kids, a
male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him;
he was so sierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that
is to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which
was what I wanted; I could have killed him, but that
was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I
e'en let him out, and he ran away greatly frightened;
but I did not then know what I atterwaixls learned, that
liunger would tame a lion: if I had let him stay there
three or four days without food, and then have carried
him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he
would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they
are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are well used.
However, for the present, I let him go, knowing: no
better at that time; I then went to the three kids; and tak-
ing them one by one, I tied them with strings together,
and with some dissiculty brought them all home.
It was some time besore they would feed, but throw-
ing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they
began to be tame; and now I sound, that if I expected
to supply myself with goats-flesh, when I had no pow-
der or shot lest, breeding some up tame was my only
.way, when perhaps I might have them about my house
like a flock of sheep.
But then it occurred to me, that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild
when they grew up; and the only way for this was to
have some inclosed piece of ground well fenced, either
with hedge or pale, to keep them up so esfectually,
that those within might not break out, or those without
break in.
o 3 Ti>:»
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I saw there was an absolute ne:e0ity of doing it,
my sirst piece of work was to sind out a proper piece of
ground, viz. where there was likely to be herbage for
them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to
keep them from the sun.
Those who understand such inclosures will think I
had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon^s
place so very extensive, it being a plain open piece
of meadow-land, or savannah, (as our people call it in
the western colonies) which had two or three little drills
of fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I
fay, they will smile at my forecast, when I sViall tell
them I began my inclosing of this piece of ground in
fiich a manner, that my hedge or pale must have been
at least two miles about; nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles about,
I was like to have time enough to do it in; but I did
not consider, that my goats would be as wild in so much
compass, as if they had had the whole island; and I
should have so much room to chafe them in, that I
Jhould never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about
sifty yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I
stopped short, and resolved to incloie a piece of about
one hundred and sifty yards in length, and one hundred
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many
as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my
stock increased, I could add more ground to my in-
closure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went to
work with courage; I was abcut three months hedging
in the sirst piece; and, till I had done it, I tethered
the three kids in the best part os it, and used them to
feed asnea'"me as possible, to make them samiliar; and
very often I would go and cany them some ears of bar-
ley, or an handsul of rice, and feed them out of my
hand; so that alter my inclosure was sinished, and I let
them

them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleat-
ing after me for an handsul of corn.
This answered my end, and in dbout a year and a
half, I had a flock of about twelve gcass, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three and forty, besides se-
veral I kiiled for food. Being thus successsul, I in-
closed sive several pieces of ground to feed them in,
with little pens to drive them into, to take them as I
had occasion; and gates out os one piece of ground into
another.
But this was not all; for now I not only hud goats
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk likewise;
which, indeed, was an article I had not thought of, and
which, when it came into my thoughts, was realiy an
agreeable surprize; for now I set up my dairy, and had
fometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And, as
nature, who gives supplies or sood to every creature,
dictates even naturally how to make use of it; so I,
that never milked a cow, much less a geat, or saw but-

after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me
both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it
asterwards.
How mercisully can our great Creator treat hss crea-
tures, even in thole conditions in which they seemed to
be overwhelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten
the bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise
him for dungeons and prisons! What a table was here
spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing at
sirst but to perish for hunger!
It would have made a stoick smile, to have seen me
and my little samily sit down to dinner: there was n:y
majesty, the prince and lord of the whole island; I had
the lives of all iny subjects at absolute command; I
could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and
no rebess among all my subjects.
The:1, to fee how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants! Pol, as if he had been my
savourite, was the only creature that could talk to me;
"ROBINSON CRUSOK. 151
my dog, which was now grown very old and crazy,
and found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat al-
ways at my right-hand; and two cats, one on each side of
the table, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,
as a mark of special savour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought on
shore at sirst; for they were both dead, and had been
interred near my habitation by my own hands; and one
of them having multiplied by I know not what kind of
creature, these were two which I preserved tame, whereas
the rest ran wild into the woods, and became indeed
troublesome to me at last; for they would often come
into my house, and plunder me, till at last I was obliged
to flicot them; at length they left me with this atten-
dance, and in this plentisul manner I lived; neither
could I be said to want any thing but society, and of
that, in some time after this, I was like to have too
much.
'I was something impatient, as I have observed, to
have the use of my boat, though very loth to run any
more hazard: and theresore, sometimes, I sat contriv-
ing ways to get her about the island, and at other times
I sat myself down contented enough without her. But
I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to
the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my
last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the more lay,
and how the current set, that I might see what I had to
do: this inclination increased upon me every day, and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land; and fol-
lowing the edge of the shore, I did so; but had any one
in England been to meet such a man as I was, it must
either have frighted him, or raised a great deal of
laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at my-
self, I could not but smile at the notion of my travel-
ing through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in
such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my sigure,
as follows
I had a great high, shapelese cap, made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep
the
the sun from me, as to shoot the rain osf from running*
into my neck; nothing being; so hurtsul in these cli-
mates as the rain upon the flesh under the cloaths.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of
open-kneed breeches of the same: the breeches were
made of the skin of an old lie goat, whose hair hung
down such a length on each side, that, like Pantaloon's
it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and
slioes I had none; but I had made me a pair of some-
thing, I scarce knew what to call them, like buskins,
to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat-
terdashes, but of a most barbarous shape: as indeed
were all the rest of my cloaths.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead of
buckles, and, in a kind of a frog on either siJe of this, in-
stead of a sword and dagger, hung a little law and an
hatchet, one on one side, and one on the other: I had
another belt, not so broad, and sastened in the same
manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end
of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made
ot goat's skin; in one ot which hung my powder, in
the other my shot: at my back I carried my basket,
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great,
clumsy, ugly goat-skin umbrella, but which, after all,
was the moI!: necessary thing I had about me, next to
my gun: as for my sace, the colour of it was really not
so Mulatto-like, as one might expect from a man not
at all caresul of it, and living within nine or ten de-
grees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to
grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long: but as
I had heth scissars and razor.; sussicieni, I had cut it
pretty short, except what grew on my upper-lip, which
I had trimmed intu a large pair of Mahometan whis-
kers, such as I had observed worn by some Turks,
whom I saw at Sallee; for the Mcors did not wear such
though the Turks did: of these musiachios, or whiskers,
J. wsll not lay they were long enough to hang my hat
i . - upon
upon them; but they were of length and shape monffrom
enough, and such as in England would have passed for
frightsul.
But all this is by the bye: for as to my sigure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner of
consequence; so I say no more to that part. In this kind
of sigure I went my new journey, and was out sive or
six days. I travelled sirst along the sea shore, directly
to the place where 1 sirst brought my boat to an anchor
to get up upon the rocks; and, having no boat now to
take care ot, I went over the land a nearer way, to the
same height that I was upon besore; when, looking for-
ward to the point of the rock which lay out, and which
I was to double with my boat, I was surprized to sind
the sea all smooth and quiet; no ripling, no motion, no
current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in endeavouring to discover if
nothing from the lets of the tide had occasioned it: but
I was icon convinced how it was, viz. that the tide of
ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current
of waters from some great river on the shore, must be
the occasion of this current; and that according as the
wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from the north
this current came near, or went sarther from the shore;
for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I
plainly saw the current again as besore, only that it
ran farther osf, being near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my cafe, it set close upon the more, and
hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at another
time it would not have done.
This observation convinced me 1 had nothing to do
but to obsei ve the ebbing and flowing of the tide, and I
might very easily bring my boat about the island: but
when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
such a terror upon my spirits, at the remembrance of
the danger I had been in, that X could not think of it
again with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took
*p another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or
rather make me another periagua, or canoe; and so
have one tor one side of the island,. and one for the
other.
You are to understand, that I now had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little for-
tisication or tent, with the wall about it, under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I
had enlarged into several apartments, one within another.
One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had
a door out beyond my wall or fortisication, that is to
fay, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was
rilled up with the largest earthern pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fourteen or sisteen great
baskets, which would hold sive or six bushels each, where
I laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn;
fome in the ear, cut osf short from the straw, and the
other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes or
piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by thin
time become so large, and spread so very much, that
there was not the least appearance, to any one's view,
of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling, but a little sarther within the land,
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-
ground; which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and
which regularly yielded me their harvest in its season ,
and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more
land adjoining, the soil of which was equally well cal- ,
culated sor cultivation.
Besides this, there was my country-seat, I had now a
tolerable plantation also; for sirst, I had riy littlebowes
as I called it, which I kept in repair; that is to say, I
kept the hedge which circled it in constantly sitted up
to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the
inside; I kept the trees, which at sirst were no more
than my stakes, but were now grown very sirm and
tall, always so cut, that they might spread, jjrow thick,
z and
and make the more agreeable shade, which they did ef-
fectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my
tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread ov^-r
poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I made me
a squab or couch, with the steins of the creatures I had
killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid
on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I
had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me; and
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my
chies seat, I took up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cat-
tle; that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an
inconceivable deal of pains to fence and inclose this
ground, I was so uneasy to see it not kept entire, lest
the goats shouid break through, that I never lest ctf,
till with inssinite labour I had struck the outside of the
hedge so sull of small stakes, and so near to one ano-
ther, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there
was scarce room to put a hand through between them;
which, asterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all
did in the next rainy season, made the inclosure strong,
like a wall; indeed, stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap-
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I con-
sidered the keeping up a breed os tame creatures thus
at my hand, would be a living magazine of stem, milk,
butter, and cheese, for me, as long as I lived in the
place, is'it were to be forty years; and that keeping
them in my reach, depended entirely upon my persect-
ing my inclosures to such a degree, that I might be sure
of keeping them together; which by this method, in-
deed, I so esfectually secured, that when these littie
stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick
I was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I
principally depended on for my winter store of raisins,
and which I never failed to preserve very care full v, as
'tke

the test and nuit agreeable dainty of my whole diet;
and irdeed they were not agreeable only, but physical,
wholesome, nourishing, and resreshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally staid and lay here in my way thither; for I
II led frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order; some-
times I went out in her to divert myself, but no more
hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a
stone's cast or two slum the shore, I was so apprehen-
sive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the
currents or winds, or any other accident. But now I
come to a new scene of my life.
It happened one day, about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprized with the print of a
man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen in the sand: I stood like one thunderstruck,
or as if I had seen an apparition; I listened, I looked
round me; I could hear nothing, nor see any thing; I
went up to a rising ground to look sarther; I went
up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all
ojie, I could fee no other impression but that one. I
went to it again to see if there were any more, and to
observe if it might not be my sancy; but there was no
room for that, tor there was exactly the very print of a
soot, tots, heel, and every part of a foot; how it came
thither I knew not, nor could in the least imagine.
But, aster innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man
persectly contused and distracted, I came home to
.my iortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I
went on, but terrisied to the last degree, looking be-
hnid me at every two or three ste;:s, mistaking every
bush or tree, and sancying every stump at a distance to
he a man; nor is it possible to describe how many vari-
ous shapes an affrighted imagination represented things
to me ill; how many wild ideas were formed every mo-
ll, ent in my iancy, and what strange unaccountable
tl oughts'cae into my mind by tl;e wav.
Vol. I. P 'Whea (
When I came to my castle, for so I think. I called it
ever aster this, I fled into it like one pursued; whether
I went over by the ladder, as sirst contrived, or went
in at the hole in the rock, which I called a door, I can-
rot remember; for never frighted hare fled to cover, or
fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this
retreat.
I had no sleep that night; the sarther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehensions
were; which is something contrary to the nature of
such things, and especially to the usual practice of all
creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with my
own frightsul ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing
but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was
now a great way off it. Sometimes I sancied it must
be the devil; and reason joined in with me upon this sup-
position: for how should any other thing in human
shape come into the place? Where was the vessel that
brought them? What marks were there of any other
footsteps? And how was it possible a man mould come
there? But then to think that Satan should take human
shape upon him in such a place, where there could he
bo manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too,
(for he could not be sure I should see it;) this was an
amazement the other way. I considered that the devil
might have found out abundance of other ways to have
terrissied me, than this of the single print of a foot;
that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he
would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a
place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should
ever see it or not; and in the sand too, which the sirst
surge os the lea upon an high wind would have desaced
entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing
itself, and with all notions we usually entertain of the,
subtlety of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil: and
I presently concluded then, that it muit be some more
dangerous
dangerous creature, viz. that it must be some of the
savages of the main land ovtr-against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their rar.oes; and, either driven
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the
island; and had been en siiore, but were gone away
again to sea, h«ing as loth, perhaps, to have staid in
this desolate island, as I would have been to have had
them.
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155
I was very thanksul in my thought, that I was so happy
as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did
not lee my boat, by which they would hare concluded,
that some inhabitants had been in the place, and, per-
haps, have searched sarther scr me. Then terrible
thoughts racked my imaginations about their having
found mv boat, anc! that there were people here; and
that if so, I should certainly have them come again in
greater numbers, and devour me; that if it mould hap-
yen so that they should not sind me, yet they would
sind my inclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away all
my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for
mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all.
that former considence in God, which was founded
.upon such wondersul experience, as I had met with
os his goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto could r.ot preserve by his power
the provision which he had made sor me by his good-
ness. I reproached myself for my folly in not sowing
more cern one year than would jiist serve me till the
next season, as if no accident could intervene to pre-
vent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground;
and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for
the suture to have two or three years corn besore-hand,
so that whatever might come, I might not perish for
want of bread.
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the
life of man! and by what secret disfering springs are the
affections hurried about, as disfering circumstances pre-
Pa sent!
sent! To-day we love what to-morrow we Ii^te; to-
day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire
what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the appre-
hensions of. This was exemplisied in me at this time
in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whole only
affliction was, that I seemed banished from human so-
ciety, that I was alone circumscribed by the boundless
ocean, cut osf from mankind, and condemned to what I
call a lilent life: that I was as one whom Heaven thought
not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to ap-
yiear among the rest of his creatures; that to have seen
one of my own species would have seemed to me a rais-
ing me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,
could bestow; I say, that I mould now tremble at the
Very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to
sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appear-
ance of a waifs having set his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state os human life; and it af-
forded me a great many curious speculations afterwards,
when I had a little recovered my sirst surprize; I consi-
dered that this was the station of life the insinitely wile
and good providence of God had determined for me;
that as I could not foresee what the ends of Divine Wis-
dom might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his so-
vereignty,who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted
right by creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely
as he thought sit; and who, as I was a creature who had
osfended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn
me to what punishment he thought sit; and that it was
my part to submit to bear his indignation, because I
had sinned against him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only righte-
ous, but omnipotent, as he had thought sit thus to pu-
nish and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me; tiiat if
he did not think sit to do it, it was my unquestioned,
duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will;
and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in
him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and
directions of his daily providence. These
These thoughts took me up many hours, davs, nay,
I may soy, weeks and months; and one particular esiect
of my cogitations on this occasion, I cannot omit; viz.
one morning early, lying in my bed, and silled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearance os savages,
I found it discomposed me very much: upon which
those words of the Scripture came into my thoughts
"Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
"thee, and thou shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising chearsully out of my bed, my heart
was not only comforted, but I was guided and encou-
raged to pray earnesHy to God for deliveran:e. When
I had done praying, I took up my bible, and opening it
to read, the sirst words that presented themselves to me
were;' Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
"he shail strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the
"Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort this
gave me; and, in return, I thankfully laid down
the book, and was no more sad; at least, not en
that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that
all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that
this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I
came on fliore from my boat. This cheared me up a
little too, and I began to persuade myself it was all a
delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot;
and why might net I come that way from the boat, as
well as I w:-.s going that way to the boat? Again, I
considered also, that I could by no means tell sor cer-
tain where I had trod, cm ! where I had not; and that
if at lr-st this was only the print os my own foot, I had
played the part of thoie fools, who strive to make stories
of spares and apparitions, and then are themselves
frighted at them more than any body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for three
days and nights, so that I began to seem siiort of pro-
vssion; for I had lsttle or nothing within doors, but
p 3 some
some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion: and the poor creatures were in great
pain and inconvenience tor want of it; and indeed it al-
mostspoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself theresore with the belies that this
was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, (and
so I might be truly said to start at my own shadow) I
began to go abroad again, and went to my country-
house to milk my flock; but to lee with what fear I
went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I
was readv, every now and then, to lay down my basket
and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that
J had been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed
I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three days, and
having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to
think there was really nothing in it but my own imagi-
nation; but I could not periuade myself sully of this,
till I should go down to the shore again, and see this
print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and fee if
there was any similitude or sitness, that I might be as-
sured it was my own foot: but when I came to the place
sirst, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where I here-
abouts. Secondly, when I came to measure the mark
with my own foot, I found my foot' not so large by a
great deal. Both these things silled my head with new
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the
highest degree; so that I shook with cold, like one in an
ague, and went home again, silled with the belies, that
some man or men had been on more there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprized
betore I was aware; and what course to take for my se-
curity I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when posses-
sed with fear! It deprives them of the use of those
means which reason offers for their relies. The sirst
thing
thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my in-
closures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods,
that the enemy might not sind them, and then frequent the
island in prospect of the same or the like booty; then
to the sirrple thing of digging up my two corn-sields,
that they might not sind such a grain there, and (till be
prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish my
bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of
my habitation, and he prompted to look sarther, in or-
der to sind out the persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the siist night's cogitation,
after I was come home again, while the apprehensions
.which had so over-run my mind were fresh upon me,
and mv head was sull of vapours, as above. Thus,
fear of dr.nger is ten thousand times more terrifying than
danger itself when apparent to the eyes; and we sind the
burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the evil
which we are anxious about; but, which was worse
than all this, I had not ttat relies in this trouble for
the resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have,
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who comphined not only
that the Philistines were upon him, but that God had
forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways to com,-
pose my mind, by crying to God in mv distress, and
resting upon his providence, as I had done besore, for my
desence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had,
at least, been more chearsnlly supported under this new
surprize, and perhaps carried through it with more
resolution.
This consusion of my thoughts kept me awake all
night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and having, by
the employment of my nrnd, been, as it were, tired, and
my spirits .exhausted, I slept very soundly, and awaked
rmicn better composed than I had ever been besore: and
now I b^gan to think sedately; and, upon the utmost de-
bate with myself, I concluded, that this island, which
was so exceeding pleasant, sruitsul, and no sarther from
the masn land than as I had sci-n, was not lo entirely
abandoned as-I might imagine; that, although there
were
were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that
there might sometimes come boats osf srom the shore:
who, either with design, or perhaps never hut when they
were driven by cross winds, might come to this place.
That I had lived hire sisteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow cr sigure os any people besore;
and that if at any time they should be driven here, it was
probable they went awiy again as soon as they could,
seeing they had never thought sit to six there upon any
occasion to this time.
That the molt I could suggest danger from was, any
casual landingos straggling people srom the main; who,
as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here
against their will; so that they made no stay but went
off again with all possible speed, seldom remaining one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the
tides and day-light back again; and that theresore I had
nothing to do but to consider of some sase retreat, incale
I should see any savages land upon the spot.
Now I began to repent, that I had dug my cave so
large, as to bring adoor through again, which door, as I
said, came out beyond where my fortisication joined to
the rock. Upon maturely considering this, theresore, I
resolved to draw me a second fortisication, in the same
manner of a semi-circle, at a distance from my wall, just
where I had planted a double row of trees, about twelve
years besore, of which I made mention. These trees
having been planted so thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they might
be thicker and stronger, and my wail soon sinished.
I had ndw a double wall, and my cuter wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every
thing I could think of to make it strong; having in it
seven holes, each large enough to put my arm through.
In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten
feet, continually bringing earth cut of my cave, and lay-
ing it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it; and
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the r.:us-
quets, of which I took notice, that I got seven on shore
out
<mt of the ship; these, I lay, I planted like my cannon,
and sitted them into frames that held them like a carriage,
fo that I could sire all the seven guns in two minutes
time. This wall I was many a weary month in sinishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great distance every way, as sull with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165
"believe I might set m near twenty thousand, leaving a
pretty large lpace between them and my wall, that I
might have room to see an enemy, and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap-
proach my outer wall.
Thus, in two years I had a thick grove; and in sive
or six years a wood besore my dwelling, grown so mon-
strous thick and strong, that it was indeed persectly im-
passable; and no man would ever imagine there was any
thing behind it, much less an habitation. As for the
way I proposed myself to go in and out, (for I lest no
avenue) it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in, and lest room
to place another ladder upon that; so when the two lad-
ders were taken down, no man living could come down
without injuring himself; and if they had come down,
they were still on the out-side of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my preservation; and it will be seen at length,
they were not altogether without just reason; though I
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 165
suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me
fer my little herd of goats; they were not only a pre-
fent supply to me upon every occasion, and began to be
sussicient to me, without the expence of powder and shot,
but also abated the satigue of my hunting after the wild
ones; and I was unwilling to lose the advantage of them,
Mid to have them all to nurse up again.
To
To this purpose, aster long consideration, I could
think of but two ways to preserve them; one was, to
sind another convenient place to dig a cave under-ground,
and to drive them into it every night; and the other
was, to inclose two or three little bits of land, remote
from one another, and as much concealed as I could,
where I night keep about half a dozen young goats
in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the
flock in general, I might be able to raise them again with
li'tle trouble an 1 time; and this, though it would require
a great deal of time and labour, I thought was the most
rational design.
Accordingly, I spent some time to sind out the most
retired parts ot the island; and pitched upon one, which
was as private indeed as my heart could wish; for it
was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost
lost myself once besore, endeavouring to come back that
way from the eastern part ot the island. Here I found
a clenr piece of land near three acres, so surrounded with
woods, that it was almost an inclosure by nature; at
least, it si id not want near so much labour to make it so,
as the ether pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of ground,
and in less than a month, I had so fenced it round, that
my flock or herd, call it which you please, which were
riot so wild now as at sirst they might be supposed to be,
were well enough secured in it. So, without any sar-
ther delay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to
this piece; and when they were there, I continued
to persect the fence, till I had made it as secure
as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and
it took me up more time by a great deal.
I was at the expence of all this labour from my appre-
hensions on account of the print of a man's foot which I
had leen; for, as yet I never saw any human creature
come near the island. I had now livLtltwo years under
theie diiagreeabie apprehensions, which, indeed, made
my life much less comfortable than it was besore; ac
may
may be imagined, by any who know what it is to live in
the constant share of the fear of man; and this I must
obierve with gries too, that the discomposure os my
mind had too greatimpresssions also upon the religious
part of my thoughts, for the dread and terror of salling
into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so much
Upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a due
temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was
accustomed to do. I rather pvayed to God as under
great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with
danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered
and devoured besore morning; and I must testify from
my experience, that a temper of peace, thanksulness,
love, and aftection, is much tile more proper frame for
prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that
Under the dread of milchies impending, a man is no
more sit for a comforting persormance of the duty os
praying to Gcd, than he is tor repentance on a sick-bed;
for these discomposures affect the mind as the others do
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must ne-
cessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and
much greater; praying to God being pioperly an act of
the mind, not of the body.
But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place to make such another
deposit; when wandering more to the west point of the
island than I had ever dene yet, and looking out to, sea,
I thought I saw a boat upen the sea, at a great distance.
I had sound a perspective-glass or two, in one ol the sea-
men's chests, which I saved out of our ship; but I had it
not about me, and this was so remote, that I could not
tell what to make of it, though I looked,at it till my
eyes were not able to look any longer: whether it was
a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I descended from
the hill, I could see no more or it, so I gave it over;
only resolved to go no more without a perspective-glass
in my pocket.
When
When I was come down the hill to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been besore, I was foon
convinced, that seeing the print of a man's foot was
not such a strange thing in the island as I imagined;
and, but that it was a special providence that I was cast
upon the side of the island, where the savages never came,
I mould easily have known, that nothing was more fre-
quent than for the canoes from the main, when they hap-
pened to be a little too sar out at sea, to shoot over to that
iide of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often
met, and fought in their canoes, the victors, having
taken any prisoners, would bring them over to this
shore, where, according to their dreadsul customs, being
all canibals, they would kill and eat them. Of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, being
the S. W. point of the island, I was persectly con-
founded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express
the horror of my mind, at seeing the shorc spread with,
ikulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;
and, particularly, I observed a place where there had
been a sire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a
cock-pit, where it is to be supposed the savage wretches
had sat down to their inhuman feaitings upon the bodies
of their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to mylelf
from it fora long while; all my apprehensions were bu-
ried in the thoughts of riich a pitch of inhuman brutality,
and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature;
which, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so
near a view of besore; in short, I turned away my
sace from the horrid spectacle; I grew sick, aud wa*
just at the point of sainting, when nature discharged the
disorder from my stomach; and, having vomited with
an uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could
not bear to stay in the place a moment; so I got up the
hill again with all the speed I could, and walked on to-
wards my own habitation.
When
When I came a little out of that part of the island, I
Itood ssill some time amazed; and then recovering my-
self, I looked up with the utmost-asfection of my soul,
and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks,
that had cast my sirst lot in a part of the world, where
I was distinguished from siich dreadsul creatures as
these; and that though I had esteemed my present con-
dition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts
in it, that I had still more to give thanks for, than to
complain of; and this above all, that I had, even in this
miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge
of Himself, and the hope of His blessising, which wj.s
a felicity more than sussiciently equivalent to all the
misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thanksulness I went home to my cas-
tle, and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of
my circumstances, than ever I was before; for I ob-
served, that these wretches never came to this island in
search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not
wanting, or not expecting any thing here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody part of
it, without sinding any thing to their purpose. I knew
I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never
saw the least footsteps of a human creature there besore;
and might be here eighteen more as entirely concealed
as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them,
which I had no manner of occasion to do, it being my
only business to keep myself en:irely concealed where
I was, unless I found a better fort of creatures than
canibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches. I have been speaking of, and of the inhu-
man custom of their devouring and eating one another
up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close
within my own circle for almost two years after this.
When I say my own circle, I mean by it, my three plan-
tations; viz. my castle, my country-seat, which I called
my bower, and my inclosure inthe woods; nor did I
look after this for any other use, than as an inclosure for
Vol. I. Q^ my
my goa;s; for the aversion which nature gave me to
these horrid wretches was such, that I was as fearful of
seeing them, as of ieeing the devil himself; nor did I so
much as go to look after my boat in all this time, but
be^an rather to consider of making me another; for I
could not think of ever making any more attempts to
bring the other boat round the island, lest I mould meet
with some of thole creatures at sea, in which, if I hap-
pened to sall into their hands, I knew what would have
been my lot.
Time, however, and the satissaction I had, that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people,
foon wore off my uneasiness about them; and I began
to live just in the same composed manner as besore; only
with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept
my eyes more about me than I did besore, lest I should
happen to be seen by any of them; and, particularly, I
was more cautious ot siring my gun, lest any of them
on the island should happen to hear it; and it was there-
fore a very good providence to me, that I had surnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I had no need
to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them;
and if I did catch any more of them after this, it was
by traps andihares, as I had done besore; so that for
two years after this, I believe, I did not sire my gun off
once, theugh I never went out without it; and, which
wss more, as I had laved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or, at least, two cf
them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise
surnished op one of the great cutlafles that I had cut of
the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also; so that 1
was now a most formidable sellow to look at, when I
went abroad, if you add to the former description of
myself, the particular of two pistols and.a great bread
sword hanging at my side in a bell", but without a
scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm ledate way of living; all these things
lending
tending to mew me more and more how sar my condi-
tion was from being miserable, compared to some others;
nay, to many other particulars of life, which it might
have pleased God to have made my lot. It piit me
upon reflecting, how little repining there would be
among mankind, at any condition of life, if people
would rather compare their condition with those that
are worse, in order to be thanksul, than be always com-
paring them with those which are better, to assist their
murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, 1 thought that the
frights I had been in about these savage wretches, and
the concern I felt for my own preseivation, had taken
off the edge of my invention for my own convenience,
and I had dropt a gooa design, which I had once, bent
lYiy thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I could not
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer: this was really a whimsical
thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity
of it; for I presently saw there would be the want of se-
veral things necessary for making my beer, that it would
be impossible for me to supply; as sirst, casks to pre-
ferve it in, which was a thing that I could never accom-
plish, though I spent not only many days, but weeks,
ray, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In
the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeail
to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it boil;
and yet, had not all' these things intervened, 1 mean the
srights and terrors I was in about the savages, I had
undertaken it, and perhaps, brought it to pals too;
for I seldom gave any thing ever without accomplish-
ing it, when once I had it in my mind to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
bloody entertainment; and, is possible, save the victim
they mould bring hither to destroy. It would take up
a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be,
Qj, to
to set down all the contrivances I invented for destroy-
ing these creatures, or at least frightening them, so as
to prevent their coming hither any more: but all was
abortive; nothing could be possible to take effect, un-
less I was to be there to do it myself; and what could
one man do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or
their bows and arrows, with which they could shoot as
true to a mark as I could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their sire, and put in siveor six pounds of
17* LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
consequently communicate and blow up all that was near
it: but, as in the sirst place I mould be very loth to waste
so much powder upon them, my store being now within
the quantity of a barrel; so neither could I be sure of
its going eff at any certain time, when it might sur-
prize them; and, at best, that it would do little more
than just blow the sire about their ears, and fright them,
but not sussicient to make them forsake the place; so I
laid it aside; and then proposed, that I would six
myself in ambush, in some convenient place, with my
three guns all double loaded, and, in the middle of their
bloodv ceremony, let fly at them, when I should be
sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
lhot; and then salling in upon them with my three pil-
tols, and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there
were twenty, I should kill them all: this sancy pleased
my thoughts for some weeks; and I was so sull of it,
that I osten dreamed of it; and sometimes, that I was
just going to let fly at them in my sleep.
I went so sar with it in my imagination, that I em-
ployed mylelf several days, to sind cut proper places to
put myself in ambuscade, to watch sor them; and I
went srequently to the place itself, which was now
grown more samiliar to me; and elpecially while mv
mind was thus silled with thoughts of revenge, and ef
a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword,
17* LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
at
at the signals of the barbarous wn.tcb.es devouring one
another, abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill, where I was satissied I might securely wait till I
saw any of the boats coming; and might then, even
besore they would be ready to come on fliore, convey
myself unieen into the thickets of trees, in one oi which
there was an hollow large enough to conceal me entirely;
and where I might sit and observe all their bloody do-
ings, and take my sull aim at their heads, when they
were so close together as that it would be next to im-
possible that I should miss my shoot, or that I could sail
wounding three or four of them at the sirst shoot.
In this place, then, I resolved to six my design; and
accordingly I prepared two musquets, and my ordinary
fowling-piece. The two musquets I loaded with a
brace of slugs each, and four or sive smaller bullets, about
the size of pistol-bullets; and the fowling-piece I lea led
with near an handful of swan-shot, of the largest size;
I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each 5
and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and,
in my imagination, put it in practice, I continually
made my tour every morning up to the top of the hill,
which was from my calile, as I called it, about three
miles, or more, to fee if I could observe any boats upon
the lea, coming near the island, or standing over to-
wards it; but I began to be tired of this hard duty,
after I had for two or three months constantlv kept my
watch; but came always back without any discovery,
there having not, in all that time, been the least ap-
pearance, not only on or near the shore, but not on the
whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way.
As long as I kept up my da;ly tour to the hill, to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour os my de-
sign, aud my lbuits seemed to be all the tsme sn a fuit-
Q""3 - able
able frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing
twenty or thirty naked savages, for an osfence which I
had not at all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts,
any sarther than my passions were at sirst sired by the
horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the peo-
ple of that country, who, it seems, had been susfered
by Providence, in His wife disposition ot the world, to
have ho other guide than that of their own abominable
and vitiated passions; and, consequently, were lest, and
perhaps had been sor some ages, to act liich horrid
tiiings, and receive such dreadtul customs, as nothing
but nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actu-
ated by hellish degeneracy, could have run them into:
but now, when, as I have said, I began to be weaiy
of the fruitless excursions which I had made so long,
and so sar, every morning, in vain; so my opinion of
the action itself began to alter; and, with cooler
and calmer thoughts, I considered what it was I was go-
ing to engage hl; what authority or call I had, to pre-
tend to be judge and executioner upon these men as cri-
minals, whom Heavei had thought sit, for so many
ages, to luffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it
were, the executioners of His judgments upen one ano-
ther; also hew sar these people were offenders against
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood, which they had shed promiscuously one upon
another. I debated this very olten with mylelf thus
'How do l know what God himself judges in this par-
 ticular ca!e? It is certain these people do not commit
'this as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
 reproving, or their light reproaching them. They
* do not know it to be an osfence, and then commit it
* in desiance of Divine Justice, as we do in almost all
'the sins we commit. They think it no more a crime
'to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an
'ox; nor to eat human flcsh, than we do to eat mut-
'ton.'
When I had considered this a little, it followed ne-
cessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong; that these
people
yeople were net murderers in the fense that I had before
condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those
Christians were murderers, who often put to death the
prisoners taken in battle, or mere srequently, upon
many occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword,
without giving quarter, though they threw down their
arras and submitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was nothing tome : these people had done
me no injury; that if they attempted to injure me, or I
saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to sall
upon them, something might be iaid fork; but that I
was yet out of their power, and they had really no know-
ledge of n:e, and coniequently no design upon me; and
theresore it cculd not be just tor me to sall upon them:
that this would justisy the conduct of the Spaniards, in
all their barbrriiies practised in America, where they
destroyed millions of these people; who, however they
were idolaters and barbarians, anil had several bloody
and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrissicing
human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spa-
niards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them
out os the country is ipoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and detestation, even bv the Spaniaids themselves,
at this time, and by ail ether Christian nations of Eu-
rope, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece
of cruelty, unjustisiable either to God or man; and
foch as sor which the very name of a Spaniard is rec-
koned to be frighttul and terrible to all people of huma-
nity, o^ os Christian compassion, as is the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent lor the product of a
tace of men, who were without principles of tender-
ness, or the common bowels oi pity to the miserable,
which is reckoned to be a mark ot a generous temper in
the mind.
These consideratievs really put me to a pause, and to
a kmti of sull stop; and I began by little and little to
he off of my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong
measures
measures in my resolutions to attack the savages; that
it was not my business to meddle with them, unless
they sirst attacked me, and this it was my business, if
possible, to prevent; but that, if I were dil'covered and
attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirelv
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill
every one that not only should be on shore at that time,
but should ever come on shore afterwards; if but one
of them escaped to tell their country-people what had
happened, they would come over again by thousands to
revenge the death of their fellows; and I mould only
bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at pre-
sent I had no manner of occasion tor. ,
Upon the whole, I concluded, that, neither in prin-
ciples nor in policy, I ought one way or other to con-
cern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all
possible means, to conceal mysels from them, and not
to leave the least signaj to them to guess by, that there
were anv living creatures upon the island; I mean, of
human shape.
Religion joined in with these thoughts, and I was con-
vinced now, many ways, that I was persectly out of
my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes for
the destruction of innocent creatures; I mean, innocent
as to me; as to the crimes they were guilty of towards
one another, I had nothing to do with them; there
were national punishments to make a just retribution for
national osfences; and to bring public judgments upon,
thole who offend in a public manner, by such ways as
best please God.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was
a orcater satissaction io me, than that I had not been
176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
to believe would have been no less a sin, than that of
wilsul murder, if I had committed-it; and I gave moll
humble thanks on my knees ta God, who had thiu de-

grant
grant me the protection os his providence, that I might
not sall into the hands of barbarians; or that I might
not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more
clear call from Heaven to do it, in desence of my
own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year; and
fo sar was I from desiring an occasion for salling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went
up the hill to fee whether there were any of them in
sight, or to know whether any of them had been on more
there or not; that I might not be tempted to renew any
of my contrivances against them, or be provoked by any
advantage which might present itsels, to sall upon them:
only this I did; I went and removed my boat, which I
had on the other side the island, and cairied it down to
the east-end of the whole island, where I ran it into a
little cove which I found under some high locks, and
. where I knew, by reason of the currents, the savages
durst not, at least would not, come with their boats,
upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away every thing I had lest
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither; viz. a mast and sail, which I had made
for her, and a thing like an anchor, but, indeed, which
could not be called either anchor or grappling; however,
it was the best I could make of its kind. All these I
removed, that there might not be the least shadow of
3ny discovery, or appearance of boat, or of any
habitation, upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employment,viz. to milk my she-goats,
and manage my little flock in the wood; which being
on the other part of the island, was quite out of danger:
for certain it is, that thele savage people, who lome-
times haunted this island, never came with thoughts of
finding any thing here, and consequently never wan-
dered off srom the coast;-and I doubt not, but they
jnight have been several times on shore, after my ap-
prehensions
prehensions ot them had made me cautious, as well as
besore; and, indeed, I looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts or what my condition would have
been, is I had chopped upon them, and been discovered ,
besore that, when naked and unarmed, except with one.
gun, and that loaded often only with small shot. I
walked every where, peeping about the island, to see
what I could get: what a surprize should I have been
in, if when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I
had instead of that, seen sifteen or twenty savages, and
found them pursuing me; and, by the swiftness of their
running, no possibility of my escaping them!
The thoughts of this sometimes iunk my very foul
178 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
cculd not soon recover it; to think wh3t I should have
done, and that I not only should have been able to resist
them, but even should not have had presence of mind
enough to do what I might have done; much less, what
now, after so much consideration and preparation, I
might be able to do. Indeed, after seriously thinking
of these things, I frequently became melancholy, and
foretimes it would last a great while; but at length,
on due reflection, I changed my melancholy into thank-
fviness to that Providence who had delivered me from
fo many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those
mischiess which I could no way have been the agent in
delivering myself from; because I had not the least no-
tion of any such thing depending, or the least supposi-
tion of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation, which often had come
to my thoughts at former times, when sirst I began to fee
the mercisul dispositions of heaven in the darge.s we meet
with in this life; how wondersully we are delivered when
we know nothing of it: that when we are in a quandary,
(as we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this
way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this wav,
when we intended to go that; nay, when fense, our
own inclination, and perhaps business has called to go
tlie other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind,
from
 ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179
this way; and it shail afterwards appear, that had we
gone that way which we would have gone, and even to
our imagination ought to have gone, we should have
been ruined and lost; upon these, and many like re-
flections, I asterwards made it a certain rule, that when-
ever I found those secret hints, or pressings of my mind,
to do or not do any thing that presented, or to go this
way or that way, I never sailed to obey the secret dic-
tate; though I knew no other reason for it, than that
iuch a pressure, or such an hint, hung upon my mind.
I could give many examples of the success of this con-
duct in the course of my life; hut more especially in the
latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; be-
sides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of, if I had seen with the lame eyes then
that I saw with now: but it is never too late to be wise;
and I cannot but recommend to all considering men, whose
lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as
mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight
such secret intimations of Providence, let them come
from what invisible intelligence they may; that I shall
not discuss, aud perhaps cannot account for; but cer-
tainly they are proof of the converse of spirits, and a
secret communication between those embodied and those
tmembodied; and such a proof as cannot be withstood; ot
which I shall have occasion to give some very remarka-
ble instances in the remainder of my solitary residence
in this dismal place.
I believe the reader will not think it strange, if I
consess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I
lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put
an end to all invention, and to all contrivances, that I
had laid for my suture accommodations and conveni-
ences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my
hands than that os my food. I was unwilling even to
drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood, for fear the noise
I should make might be heard; much less would I sire
a gun, for the feme reason; and, above all, I was very
uneasy
uneasy at making any sire, lest the smoke, which is vi-
sible at a great distance in the day, mould betray me;
and lor this reason I removed that part of my business
which required sire, such as burning of pots and pipes,
&c. into my new apartment in the wood; where, after
I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable con-
solation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went
in a vast wav, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to ven-
ture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe re-
treat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident, (I would say,
it I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such
things now to Providence) I was cutting down some
thick brandies of trees to make charcoal. This was
a very essential article, and the method I took to make
it was as follows:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation
and yet I could not live there without baking my bread,
cooking my meat, &c. sol contrived to bum some wood
'as I had seen done in England under turs, till it became
chark, or dry coal; and then "jfttfiting the sire out, I
preserved the coal to carry home, fend perform the other
services, which sire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smoke.
But this by thebye. While I was cutting dewnsome
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch
of low brush-wood, or under-wood, there was a kind
of hollow place: I was curious to look into it;
and getting, with dissiculty, into the mouth of it, I
found it was pretty large, that is to say, sussicient for
me to stand upright in, and perhaps another with me;
but I must consess to you, I made more haste out than
I did in; when looking sarther into the place, which
was persectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of
some creature, whether devil or man, I knew not,
which twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the.
3 cave's
cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the re-
flection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and
thought that he who was afraid to see the devil was not
sit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and that I
dare believe, there was nothing in this cave more fright-
ful than myseli; upon this, assuming courage, I took
up a large sirebrand, and in I rushed again, with the
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three steps
in, but I was almost as much srightened as I was be-
fore; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in
fome pain; and it was followed by a broken noise, at
if of words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again.
I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a sur-
prize, that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had
a hat on my head, 1 will not answer for it, that my hair
might not have listed it off. But still plucking up my
spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a lit-
tle, with considering that the power and presence os God
was every where, and was able to protect me: upon this
I stepped forward again, and by the light of a sirebrand,
holding it up a little over my head, I Taw lving on the
ground a most monstrous frightsul old he-goat, just mak-
ing his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying indeed
of mere old age.
I stirred him a little, to fee if I could get him out;
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise him-
felf: and I thought with myself, he might e'en lie there;
for if he had frightened me so, he would certainly fright
any os the savages, if any of them mould be so hardy
as to come in there while he had any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprize, and began to
look round, when I found the cave was but very small;
that is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in
no manner ot shape, either round or square, no hands
having ever been employed in making.it but thole cf
mere nature. I observed also, tliat there was a place en
one side of it that went in further, but so low, that it re-
quired me to creep upon my hands and knees to get into
Vol. 1. R it;
it; and whither it went I knew not; so having no can-
dle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-
box, which I had made of the lock os one ot the mus-
quets, with some wild-sire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day I went provided with six
large candles ofmy own making, for I made very good
candles now of goats tallow; and, going into this low
place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have
said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought
was a venture bold enough, considering, that 1 knew not
how sar it might go, or what was beyond it: when I
was got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher
up; I believe near twenty feet; but never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to
look round the sides and roof os this vault or cave; the
walls reflected an hundred thousand lights to me from
my two candles; what it was in the rock, whether dia-
monds, or any other precious stones, or gold, which I
rather supposed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was in a most delightsul cavity or
grotto of it's kind, as could be expected, though per-
fectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a fort
of small loose gravel upon it; so that there was no nau-
seous creature to be seen; neither was there any damp
or wet on the sides of the roof; the only dissiculty in it
was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place of
security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at
the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things which I was moss anxious about,
to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my
magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two
fowling-pieces, (for I iiad three in all) and three muf-
quets, (for of them I had eight in all;) so I kept at my
castle only sive, which stood ready mounted, like pieces
os cannon, on my outer fence; and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I was
obliged
obliged to open the barrel of powder which I took up
out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I found
that the water had penetrated about three or four inches
into the powder on every side, which, caking and grow-
ing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell;
fo that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder in
the centre os the cask; and this was an agreeable dis-
covery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder
with me in my castle, for for of a surprize of any
kind. I also carried thither all the lead I had lest for
bullets.
I sancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded myself
while I was here, if sive hundred savages were to hunt
me, they could never sind me out, or if they did, they would
not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mcuth of the cave, the next day after I made this disco-
very; and I found it much easier to dig a great hole
there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than
to drag him cut; so I interred him there, to prevent of-
fence to my nose.
I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, and to
the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the
certainty that no savages would come to the place to dis-
turb me, I could have been content to have capitu-
lated for spending the reft of my time there, even to the
last moment, till I had laid me down and died like the
old goat in the cave: I had also arrived to some little
diversions and amusements, which made the time pass
more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before;
as, sirst, I had taught my Pol, as I noted besore, to
speak: and he did it so samiliarly, and talked so articu-
lately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and
he lived with me no less than six and twenty years;
haw long he might live afterwards, I knew not; though
E: I know
I know they have a notion in the Brazils, that they live
an hundred years; perhaps some of my Pols may be
alive there still, calling aster " Poor Robinson Crusoe,'"
to this day; I wish no Englishman the ill-luck to come
there and hear them; but is he did, he would certainly
believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant
and loviiig companion to me ser no less than sixleen
years of my time, and then died os mere eld age; as
tor my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to that
decree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at
sirst, to keep them from devouring me and all I had;
but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me
were gone, and after some time continually driving them
irom me, and letting them have no piovision with me,
they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three sa-
vourites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when
they had anv, I alvays drowned; and these were part
of my samily. Besi.les these, I always kept two or
three houshoid kids about me, which I taught to feed out
of my hand; and I had also more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all call "Robin
Crusoe," but none like my sirst; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him: I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose
names I knew not, which I caught upon the shore,
and cut their wings; and the little stakes, which I had
planted besore my castle-wall, being now grown up to a
good thick grove, these fowls all lived among thele low
trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me;
so that I began to be very well contented with the life I
led, if it might but have been secured from the dread
os savages.
But it was otherwise directed: and it may not be
amiss for all people who read my story, to make
this just observation from it; viz. how frequently, in the
course of our lives, the evil, which in itself we ieek most
to flrun, and which, when we are sallen into, is the most
dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or door of our
deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from
the
trie afsliction we are sallen into. I could give manv ex-
amples os ih s in the course of my life; but in nothing
was it more particularly remarkable, than in the cir-
cumstances os my last years of solitary residence in
this island.
It was now the month of December, in my twenty-
third year; and this being; the southern solstice, tor winter
I cannot call it, was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being prettv much abroad in the sields.
Going out one morning pretty early, even besore it was
thorough day-light, I was surprized with seeing a light
of some sire upon the shore, at a distance from me of
about two miles, towards the end of the island, where I
had ohserved some savages had been, as besore; though
not on the other iide; but, to my great asfliction, it was
on my side of the island.
I was, indeed, terribly affrighted at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprized; and yet I had no more peace
within, from the apprehensions I had, that if these sa-
vages, in rambling over the island, shoukl sind my corn
standing, or cut, or any of my works and improvements,'
they would immediately conclude that there were people
in the place, and would then never give over till they
found me out. In this extremity I went backdirectly to
my castle, and pulled up the ladder aster me, having made
all things without look as wild and natural as I could.
I then made preparations for putting myself in a pos-
ture of desence; I loaded all my cannon, as I called
them, that is to say, my musquets, which were mounted
upon mv new fortisication, and all my pistols, and resolved
to desend myselt to the last effort; not forgetting seri-
ously to recommend myself to the Divine Protection,
and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the
hands of the Barbarians: and in this posture I conti-
nued about two hours, when I began to be impa-
tient for intelligence abroad, but I had no spies to
(end out.
After sitting some time longer, and musing what
R 3 I should
I should do in this cafe, I was not able to bear sit-
ting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, and then
pulling the ladder up after me, I let it up again, and
m unted to the top of the hill; and pulling out my per-
spective-glais, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me
down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to look
for the place: I presently found there were no less than
nine naked savages sitting round a small sire they had
made; not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the weather being extreme hot; but, as I suppose, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which
they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I
could not tell.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled upon the shore; and, as it was then tide of ebb,
they seemed to me to wait the return of the flood to go
away again. It is not easy to imagine what consusion
this sight put me into, especially ieeing them come on
my side the island, and so near me too; but when I
observed their coming must be always with the current
of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my
mind, being satissied that I might go abroad with safety,
nil the time of tide os flood, if they were not on shore be-
fore; and having made this observation, I went abroad
about my harvest-work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and
row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I should have
observed, that for an hour and more before their departure
they went to (lancing, and I could easily discern their
postures and gestures by my glasses: I could not perceive,
by my nicest observations, but that they were stark-
naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but
whether they were men or women, that I could not dis-
tinguish.
As soon as I sew them shipped and gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle,
and my great sword by my' side without a scaobard ; and
iU LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
with all the speed I wa6 able to make, I went away to
the hill, where I had discovered the sirst appearance of
all. As scon as I got thither, which was not less than
two hours, (for I could not to sast, be»ng so loaded
with arms as I was) I perceived there had been three ca-
noes more of savages on that place; and looking out
farther, I saw they were all at.sea together, making over
for the main.
This was a dreadsul sight to me, especially when, go-
ing down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror
which the diimal work they had been about had left be-
hind: viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the siefli
of human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches
with merriment and sport. I was so siiled with indig-
nation at the sight, that I began nowto premeditate the
destruction os the next I should see there, let them be
who cr how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for it
was above sifteen months before any more of them were
on siioie there again; that is to say, I never saw them,
or any iootfteps or signals of them, in all that time:
for as to the rainy seasons, they are then sure not to
come abroad, at least not so sar; yet, all this while I
lived uncomfortably, by reas.n of the constant appre-
hensions I was in of their coming upon me by surprize:
from whence I observe, that the expectation os evil is
more bitter than the suffering, especially it there is no
room to shake off that expectation or those appre-
hensions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in contriving how to cir-
cumvent and sail upon them the very next time I should
see them; especially if they stiould be divided, as they
were the last time, into two pirtics; nor did 1 consider
at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen,
I WiS still the nsst day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and ib another, even ad uifinitum, till I should
be
he at length no less a murderer than they were in being
men-eaters, and perhaps much mere so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety
of mind, expecting I mould, one day or other, sall
into the hands of these merciless creatures; if I did at
any time venture abroad, it was not without looking
round me with the greatest care and caution imagina-
ble; and now I found, to my great comfort, how happy
it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of
goats; for I durst not, upon any account, sire my gun,
especially near that side of the island where they usually
came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled srom me now, I was sure to have them come back
again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them in a few days, and then I knew what to ex-
pect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more,
besore I law any more of the savages, and then I found
them again, as I mail loon observe. It is true, they
might have been there once or twice; but either they
n~.ade no stav, or at least I did not hear them; but in
the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in
my four and twentieth year, I had a very strange en-
counter with them, oi which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during the last sifteen or
sixteen months interval, was very great: I flept un-
quiet, dreamed always frightsul dreams, and often
started out of my sleep in the night; in the day great
trouble., overwhelmed my mind; in the night I dreamed
often of killing the savages, and the reasons why I
might justify such conduct. But to wave all this for
a time, it was in the midddle of May, on the 16th day,
I think, as well as my poor wooden calender would
reckon; for I marked all upon the post still; I sav, it
was on the 16th ot May, that it blew a violent storm
of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and
thunder, and the whole of the night was truly dismal
indeed. I know not what was the particular occasion
#1 it, but as I was reading in the bible, and taken up,
\vitl<
with serious thoughts about my present condition, I
was surprized with the noise of a gun, as I thought,
sired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprize of a quite disferent
nature from any I had met with besore; for the notions
this put into my thoughts were quite os another kind.
I started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and in a
trice clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the
rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the se-
cond time, got to the top of the bill; that very mo-
ment a flash of sire made me listen for a second gun,
which, accordingly, in about hals a moment, I heard,
and by the sound knew it was from that part of
the sea where I was driven out with the current in my
boat.
I immediatelv considered, that this must be some ship
in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some
other ship in company, and sired these guns sor signals
of distress, and to obtain help. I had, however, such
presence os mind at that minute, as to think, that
though I could not help their., it might be they could
help me; so I brought together all the dry woed I could
ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1S9
on sire upon the hill; the wood was dry, and blazed
freely; and though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burnt sairly out, so that I was certain, if there was any
such 'thing as a ship, they must needs ice it, and no
doubt they did; for as soon as ever my sire blazed up,
I heard another gun, and after that several others, all
from the same quarter. I plied my sire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at
sea, suil east of the island, whether a sail, or an hull, I
could not distinguish, no not with my glasses, the dis-
tance was so great, and the weather still something hazy
also: at least it was so out at sea.
I looked srequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move; so I presently concluded,
that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may
be
be lure, to be satissied, I took my gun in my hand, and
ran towards the south-east side of the island, to the
rocks, where I had Leen formerly carried away with
the current; and getting up there, the weather by this
time being persectly clear, I could plainly fee, to my
great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when I was
out in my boat; and which rocks, as they checked the
violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream
or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from
the molr desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had
been in all my life.
Thus, what is one man's sase'y, is another man's
destruction; for it seems, these men, whoever they were,
being o\it os their knowledge,, and the rocks being
wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the
night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E. Had
they seen the island, as I nereffaiily suppose they did
not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have
saved themselves on shore by the help ot their boat; but
their siring of their guns for help, especially when they*
saw, as I imagined, my sire, silled me with many
thoughts. First, I imagined, that, upon seeing my
light, they would have got into th.ir boat, and have
endeavoured to make the more; but that the sea run-
ning very high, they mig'it have been cast away; I
then thought, that they might have lost their boat be-
fore, as might be the cafe many ways; as particularly
by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many
times obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat,
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own
hands: other times I imagined, they had some other
ship or mips in company, who, upon the signals of dis-
tress they had made, had taken them up, and carried
them off: at other times, I sancied they were all gone
off to sea in their Iwat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were carried out
into the great ocean, where there was nothing but mi-
sery and the prospect of death; and that perhaps they
* might
might by this time think of starving, and of being in a
condition to eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the
condition 1 was in, I could do no more than look upon
the misery of the poor men, and pity them; which had
still this good effect on my side, that it gave me more
and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so
happily and comfortably provided for me in my deso-
late condition; and that of two ships companies who
were now cast away upon this part of the world, not
one life should be spared but mine. I learned here
again to observe, that it is very rare the providence of
God casts us into any condition of life, so low, or any
misery so great, but we may see something or other to be
thanksul for, and may sind others in worse circumstances
than ourselves.
Such certainly was the case with these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of them
were saved; nothing could make it reasonable so much
as to expect that they did not all perish there, except
the possibility only of their being taken up by another
(hip in company: and this was but mere possibility in-
deed; for I saw not the least signal or appearance of
any such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
what a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I felt in
my sold upon this sight; breaking out sometimes thus,
'O that there had been but one or two, nay, or but
'one soul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to me,
* that I might but have had one companion, one fel-
'low-creature, to have spoken to me, and to have enn-
'versed with!* In all the time of my solitary life, I
never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society
ot my sellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want
efit.

dered present to the mind by the power of imagination,
that
that motion carries out the soul by its impetuosity to
such violent, eager embracings of the object, that the

Such were these earnest wishings, that but one man
had been saved !" O that it had been but onet." I be-
lieve I repeated the words, "O that it-had been but
one!" a thousand times; and my desires were so moved

'clench together, and my singers press the palms of my
hands, thatif I had had any soft thing in my hand, it
would have crushed it involuntarily; and my teeth in
my head would, strike together, and set against one
another so strong, that fcr some time 1 could not part
them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the rea-
son and manner of them: all I can say is, to delcribe
the sact, which was ever surprizing to me when I found
it, though I knew not from what it should proceed; it
was doubtless the esfects os ardent wimes, and ot strong
ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which
the conversation of one of my fellow-christians would
have been to me.
But it was not to be: either their sate or mine, or
both, forbade it; for till the last year of my being on
this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of
that shin or no; and had only the affliction, seme days
after, to see the cerpie of a drowned boy come on stlore,
at the end of the istr.nd, which was next the shipwreck.
He had on no clothes, but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen sturt;
but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation
he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces
of eight, and a tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten
times more value than the sirst.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
. out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might
sind something on board, that might be uleful to me;
but that did not altogether press me so much, as the pos-
sibility there might be yet some living creature on board,
whole
whose life I might not only save, but by saving that life,
comfort mv o n to the last degree. And this thought
so impressed my heart, that I could not be quiet, night
or day, but I must venture out in my beat on beard
this wreck; and committing the rest to God's provi-
dence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my
mind that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
fome invisible direction, and that I mould be wanting to
myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back
to my castle, prepared every thing sor my voyage, took
a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a com-
pais to steer by, a bottle of rum, (for I had still a great
deal of that lest) a basket sull of raisins; and thus load-
ing myself with every thing necessary, 1 went down to
my boat, took the water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more; my second cargo was a great bag sull of rice,
the umbrella to let up over my head for shade, another
large pot sull of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a
bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese ; all which, with great
labour aud sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying to
God to direct my voyage, Ip:ltout, and rowing or pad-
dling the canoe along the shore, I came at last to the ut-
most point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture ornv/t to venture; I looked on the rapid currents
, which ran constantly on both fries of the island, at a dis-
tance, and winch were very terrible to me, from the re-
membrance of the hazard I had been in besore, and my
heart began to sail me; for I foresaw, that if I was
driven into either of those currents, I should be carried
a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or
sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was
but small, is any little gale of wind should rise, 1 snould
be inevitably lost.
These ti.oughts so oppressed my mind, that I berran
to ^>ve ever my enterprize, and having hauled my boat
Vol. I. S snto
into a little acek on the shoie, I Hepped out, and fet
me down u; on a little spot of rising ground, very pensive
and anxious, between fear and desire about my voyage;
when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the tide
was turned, and the flood came on, upon which my go-
ing was for so many hours impracticable: upon this it
presently occurred to me, that I mould go up to the
highest piece ot ground I could sind, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the
fluod came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven
one way out, I might not expect to be driven another
way home, with the same rapidity of the currents.
This thought was no sooner in my head, than I cast my
eye upon a little hill which ftissiciently overlooked the
sea both ways, and whence I had a clear view of the cur-
rents, orsers of the tide, and which way I was to guide
myself in my return. Here I found, that as the cur-
rent cf the ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by the skorc
of the north-side; and that I had nothing to do but to
keep to the north of the island in my return, and I should
do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the sirst of the tide; and repos-
ing mysels for that night in the canoe, under the great
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out: I made sirst a
little out to sea sull north, till I began to feel the benesit
ot the current, which let eastward, and which carried me
at a great rate, and yet did not lo hurry me as the south-
ern side of the current had done besore, and so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at a great rate,
directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came
up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at; the mip, which by
it's building was Spanish, stuck sast, jammed inbetw.vn
two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her was bea en
to pieces with the sea; and as her forecastle, which
struck on the rocks, had run on with great violence, the
4 m-c-
main-mall: and fore-mast were brought by the beard, that
is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound,
and the head and bow appeared sirm; when I came close
to her, a dog appeared upon her; which, leeing me com-
ing, yelped and cried, and as soon a* I cailed him,
jumped into the sea, to come to me; and I took him
into the boat, but found him almost dead from hunger
and thirst: I gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat
like a ravenous wolf, that had been starving a fortnight
in the show; I then gave the poor creature some fresh
water, with which, if I would have let him, he would
liave burst himself.
After this I went on board : the sirst fight I met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle
of the ship, with their arms sast about one another. I
concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship
struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and so
continually over her, that the men were not able to bear
it, and were strangled with the constant rustiing in of the
water, as much as if they had been under water; beside*
the dog, there was nothing lest in the ship that had life,
nor any goods tiiat I could see, but what were spoiled by
the water: there were some casks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and
which, the water being ebbed out, I could fee; but they
were too large to meddle with. I saw several chests,
which I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I
got two of them into the boat, without examining what
was in them.
Had the stem of the ship been sixed, and the fore-part
broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good
voyage; for by what I found in these two chests, I had
room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on
board; and if I may guess by the course she steered,
she must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the
Rio de la Plata, in tne south part of America, beyond
the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the Gulph of Mexico,
and so perhaps to Spain: she had, no doubt, a great
treasure sn her, but of no use at that time to any body;
Si. anil
and what became of the rest of her people I then
knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask sull of li-
quor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much dissiculty: there were several muiquets
in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it; as for the mufquets, I had no
occasion for them, so I lest them, but took the powder-
horn. I took a sirCrshovel and tongs, which I wanted
extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper-pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this car-
go, and the dog, 1 came away, the tide beginning to
make home aga n; and the same evening, about an hour
within night, I reached the island again, weary and sa-
tigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I
resolved to harbour what I had gotten in n>y new cave,
not to carry it heme to my castle: after resreshing my-
self, I got all my cargo en shore, and benan to examine
the particulars: the cask of liquor I found to be a kind
196 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
a word, not at all good; but when I crnie to open tire
chests, I found several things which I wanted: for ex-
ample, I found in one a sine cafe of bottles of an extra-
ordinary kind, anJ silled with cordial waters, sine, and
very good; the bottles held about three pints each, aud
were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very g^cd
succades, or sweat meats, so sastened also on tsle top,
that the salt-water had not hurt thsm: and two mere
of the same, which the water had spoiled. I found some
good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and half of white linen handkerclutfs and co-
loured neckcloths; the former were abb very welcome,
being exceeding resreshing to wipe my sace in a hot day;
besides this, when I came to the till in the chests, I found
there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held
about eleven hundred pieces in all; and'in one of them,
wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some
small bars or wedges of gold } I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound. * .yhe
Tlie other chest I sound had some clothes in it, but of
little value; but by the circumstances it must have be-
longed to the gunner's mate i though there was no
powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder
in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their
fowling-pieces on occasion: upon the whole, I got very
littli; by this voyage, that was of much use to me: for,
as to the money, I had no manner of occasion sor it; it
wis to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have
given it all for three or four pair of English shoes or
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had
not had on my feet now for manyyears. I had, indeed,
gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took otF the feet
os the two drowned men, whom I saw in the wreck; and
I found two pairmoie in one of the chests, which were
very welcome to me, but they were not like our English
slices, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes: I found in this seaman's chest
about sifty pieces os eight in royals, but no gold. I sup-
pose this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which
feemed to belong to feme ossicer.
[;. Well, however, I lugged.this money homejo my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that besore, which I
br."u»h* srom our own ship; ,but it was a great pity, as
I saui, that the other part of the ship had net come to
myshaie; for I am satissied I might have loaded my ca-
noe iewral times over with money, which, it I had ever
escaped to England, would have Iain here safe enough
till I lr ight have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and se-
cured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where I
laid her up, and made the best of my way to my eld habi-
tation, where I found every thing safe and quiet; so I
began to repose myself, live after my old sashion, and
take care ot my samily assairs; and, for a while, Hived
easy enough; only that I was more vigilant than I used
to be, looked ou' ottener, and did not go abroad so much;
and if at ar.y time I did stir with any freedom, it was al-
3 S ways
ways to the east part of the island, where I was pretty
well satissied the savages never came, and where I could
go without so many precautions, and such a load of arms
and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went
the other way.
I lived in this condition near two years more, during
which time my head was silled with projects and designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from this
island; sometimes I was for making another voyage to
the wreck, though my reason told me there was nothing
left worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes sora
ramble one way, sometimes another; and I believe ve-
rily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I
(hould have ventured to sea, bound any where, 1 knew
not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to
those who are touched with that general plague of man-
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their mise-
ries flow; I mean, that of not being satissied with the sta-
tion wherein God and nature hath placed them: for, not
to look back upon my primitive condition, and the ex-
cellent advice ot my sather, the opposition to which was,
as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes
of the same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which
so happily had seated me at the Brazils, as a planter,
blessed me with reasonable desires, and could I have been
contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been
by this time, I mean in the time of my being on this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the Bra-
zils; nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvements I
had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase
I should probably have made, if I had stayed, I might
have been worth an hundred thousand moidores; and
what business had I to leave a settled fortune, well stocked
plantation, improving and increasing, to turn supercargo
to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patience and time
would have so increased our stock at home, that we
*ould have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose
whose business it was to setch them? And though it
had cost us something more, yet the difference of that
price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate ot young heads, so
reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exer-
cise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of
time; and,fo it was with me now; and yet so deep had
the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not
satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring
upon the means and possibility of my escape from this
place; and that I may, with the greater pleasure to the
reader, bring en the remaining part os my story, it
may not be improper to give some account of my sirst
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme tor my
escape, and how and upon what foundation! acted.
