Robinson Crusoe
MANY years ago, before there
were any steamboats at all,
and the only vessels were sail-
ing ships, there lived in an English sea-
coast town a young lad whose name was
Robinson Crusoe, and whose greatest
desire was to go to sea. He used to
spend many happy hours, sitting up in
the bough of a tree, looking out over
the blue water. He loved adventure
as boys usually do, and could imagine
nothing pleasanter than to go around
the world on one of the ships whose sails
so often appeared on the horizon.
ONE day he made up his mind he
would hesitate no longer. He
was strong and big for his age,
and felt sure he could make his way.
So he packed a few belongings in a
small bundle, and without saying
"Good-bye" to his relatives or friends,
he-went to the town of Hull, where the
docks were. Here he saw many great
ships, loading and unloading all kinds
of goods, and the very thought that he
might soon be on one of them, as she
ploughed her way through the waves,
bound for a distant country, filled him
with enthusiasm. He had no difficulty
in finding a captain who was willing to
engage him as a sailor, and before long
he was sailing far away from home and
friends.
FOR many days the ship sailed
on and all went well. Young
Crusoe liked the sailor's life, as he
had been sure he would, and he was
popular with all on board. Then, sud-
denly, one day a fearful storm came up.
Black clouds filled the sky; the thunder
roared and the lightning flashed around
the vessel. The wind howled in the rig-
ging and the ship reeled.
A huge wave broke over the boat
and washed everybody on board into
the water. To swim in that rough sea
was impossible, and all the men, except
Robinson Crusoe, were drowned. He
escaped, because a big wave washed
him upon shore.
WORN out by his struggle with
the storm, Crusoe fell asleep,
and when he awoke, he found
himself on a desert island, with nothing
to be seen but the wrecked ship and
some trees and bushes. The sun was
shining brightly, however, so he made
a raft from some old planks which the
sea had washed up and he paddled out
to the wreck. From the wreck, he took
many things for his comfort—clothes,
weapons, ammunition, food, rope, sails,
and a cat and dog for company.
THE first thing Crusoe did was to
make a tent of the pieces of sail
which he had brought from the
wreck. Here he installed his cat and
dog, and he made a high fence of poles
around his home, to keep out wild
beasts or men, if there should be any.
In his trips over the island he found
many wild goats which would give him
food and milk. There were also plenty
of wild berries, and the sea abounded
in fish, which he was able to catch with
the tackle he had brought from the
ship. So he knew he would not starve.
BY THE time his home was fin-
ished, Robinson needed some new
clothes, for those he had worn
when saved, as well as those he had
brought from the wreck, were quite
worn out. So he shot some of the wild
goats, and dried the skins in the sun.
Of these, he made himself a complete
suit with shoes and a cap. He even
made a rude sort of umbrella from the
goat skin, which served to keep the sun
and rain from him.
A FTER he had lived in this way
,/\^ for many years, without ever
having seen a human being on the
island, Crusoe one day found a man's
foot-prints on the beach near his home.
He was greatly alarmed when he saw
them, and his first thought was for the
safety of his home, and his herd of
goats, which by this time were quite
tame. So he hastened back and occu-
pied himself in making the fence around
his home doubly secure.
WHILE walking on the beach a few
days later, Crusoe was amazed
to see a band of black men in
the distance. Upon approaching them,
he found they were about to kill a mem-
ber of their tribe, and in order to scare
them away, he fired his gun at them.
Thoroughly frightened at the unheard
of noise, the savages ran off, leaving be-
hind them the man they had intended
to kill. He seemed very grateful to
Crusoe for having saved his life, and
as he appeared willing to accompany
him, Crusoe took him home as a ser-
vant. Because he had found him on
Friday, Crusoe called him Friday.
AT FIRST, it was very difficult for
/~\ the two men to speak to each
other, for of course Friday knew
no English and could only make queer
noises. But by means of signs they
managed to understand each other, and
as Friday was clever, he soon learned to
speak English very well. Crusoe also
taught him to shoot, fish, sew and cook,
and do many other useful things. In-
deed, Friday proved to be a great com-
fort to his master, and Crusoe blessed
the day when he had found him.
IN order to be able to reach the other
side of the island, which was quite
large, Crusoe determined to build
a boat, and they started to work on it.
Friday wanted to burn out the logs, as
he had always been accustomed to do,
but Crusoe showed him how to use the
tools he had brought from the wreck.
The boat was soon ready, and with the
aid of a sail made from the canvas of the
ship, they could sail all around the
island to look for food.
ONE day, while working around
the tent, Crusoe happened to
look out to sea, and saw a speck
on the horizon which he thought might
be a ship. He and Friday dropped
their work to watch, and after watching
all morning, finally decided that it was
a ship sailing towards their island.
Later in the day, the ship anchored
near them and some sailors came ashore.
It was an English ship, and next day,
when it started back to England,
Crusoe and Friday were on board.
AFTER an uneventful voyage,
X"\ Crusoe and Friday landed in
England and went at once to
Crusoe's home in York. You can
imagine how glad his parents were to
see him again, for they long had given
him up for dead, never having heard
of him since he left home. They gave
their son and his true friend Friday a
royal welcome, and were much pleased
with the many curious things they had
brought.
