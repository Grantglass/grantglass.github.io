INTRODUCTION 

SO long as men are subject to disease, ac- 
counts of the terrible plague will be read 
with interest. It has been called the most 
desti-uctive of epidemics ; for when it rages 
most violently, from eighty-five to ninety- 
five per cent of those stricken die. The plague 
which still lurks in Asia and Africa, and now and 
again threatens Europe and America, seems to be 
the same disease which appalled England in I66d, 
and, more than three hundred years before, drove 
Boccaccio's gay Florentines to ihe villa where the 
stories of the Decameron were told. The spots 
on the skin were formerly more common tokens of 
the disease than they are to-day ; but the other 
symptoms, the fever, the vomiting, the frightful 
aches and pains, and the swellings or buboes in the 
neck, armpit, or groin — all these seem to have been 
the same in .earlier visitations as now. In earlier 
times, likewise, rats were supposed to be carriers of 
the pestilence ; in London in 1665, great numbers of 
them were killed, as they are killed to-day in most 
places where the plague breaks out Moreover, the 
plague, after steatfily losing ground for two centuries, 
till in western Europe it had become only a name, 
has, in the last decade, shown recuperative power 
which makes it once more a disease for western civil- 
isation to consider. It has appeared recently in 
Austria, Portugal, Scotland, tne United States^

INTRODUCTION 

Mexico, South America, and Australia.^ In none 
of these places, to be sure, has it assumed dangerous 
proportions ; tJie percentage of deaths among those 
stricken is very much smaller than it was in earlier 
times ; it is evident that, in this age of more intel- 
ligent sanitation, the plague is far less dangerous 
than it used to be,' Still, the fact that so recently 
it has broken out in lands which for years had 
not known it, renders the plague something of a 
menace. When we read Defoe's account of the 
Great Xx)ndon Plague, we are reading of scenes 
which it is within the limits of possibility may be 
realised in our own time in the least cleanly cities 
of Europe or America. 

It was because of contemporaneous interest in the 
disease that in less than two months after the appear- 
ance of MoB Flanders, Defoe brought out in March, 
1722, A Jottmal t^ the Plagw Year : Being Obser- 
vations or Memortah of the most Remarkable Occur- 
rences, as well Fublick as Private, mhich hajmned in 
London during the last Great Visiiation m 1666. 
Written by a Citizen tcho continued aU the while in 
London. Never made publick brfore. At this time 
the plague, which had raged for two yeai-s in southern 
IVance, seemed to threaten England with another 
visitation. As Mr. Lee has ahown,^ Defoe was 
anxious to induce his countrymen to "■make all pos- 
sible preparation for the preservation of themselves 
and families.'" He could think of no better way of 
doing so than to picture vividly the horrors of the 
pestilence of 1665. Besides, Defoe was always ready 
to make capital, whether literary or otherwise, out of

INTRODUCTION 

an3rthiDg that interested the public Hence TTie 
Journal (^the Plagtu Year.^ 

This JourtuU is a remarkable &bric of &ct and 
imagination, the basb of which is probably the 
writer's own recollection. It seems to 6e established 
now that he was five or six years <dd durine the 
Plague Year, instead of four as has been previously 
supposed, and therefore of an age to receive 
a pretty distinct impression of the gloom which 
overspread the city. During the next years of his 
childhood, he would naturafiy hear irom the city 
people of his acquaintance many a tale of the pesti- 
lence, the most appalling experience they had known. 
The result would oe a somewhat amorphous knowl- 
edge of the events of the Plague Year, which it 
would be possible for him, when he wished, to shape 
into definite narrative. In doing so, he would find 
help in such statistics as were accessible. 

The narrative resulting from Defoe's combination 
of recollection, tradition, imagination, and statistics 
is the most artistic that he ever pennal More than 
any other it possesses artistic unity. It is, to be sure, 
not so hard to give unihr to a work like the Plague 
as to a story like M<dl Flanders. In the Plague, as 
to a great extent in Robituon Crusoe, the subject 
matter arranges itself. When a writer places his 
hero on a small desert island, he is prevented by 
the very situation fh}m digressing far; it is almost 
inevitable that everything He writes shall seem perti- 
nent to the story. Again, when he chooses as his 
theme the visitation of a pestilence in a great city, 
he chooses one to which it is easy to give unity. 
He will naturally b^n with the first uireatening 
rumours of the pestiknce, then add by d^rees to

INTRODUCTION 

the sombreness of his narrative till he reaches his 
gloomy climax, and end with the jot of the people 
at the passing of the visitation. I^ioe's unsurpassed 
power of drcumstantial vividness would nowhere 
stand him in better stead than in such a story; to 
a reader anxious to learn the conditions of plague- 
stricken Lond<Hi, every additional anecdote or in- 
cident would be of interest. It is for this reason 
that the Journal <^ the ^^^W IVar contains very 
little that is superauous. The adventures of either 
Moll Flanders or Captain Singleton might have 
been abridged without altering the effect of the book 
in which they are related. If you cut out one of the 
stories about the plague, however, you lessen by just 
so much the vividness of the whole impression.^ 

In the Appendix will be found extracts from 
accounts of the Great Plague by contemporary 
writers. They show that Defoe did not deepen 
unduly the gloom nS bis pictures of the pestilence.

T was about the banning of September 1664t 
that I, amone the rest of my neighbours, heard) 
in ordinary £scouise, that the plague was re- 
turned again in Holland ; for it nad been very 
violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam 
and Botterdara, in the year 1663, whither, they say, 
it was brought, some said from Italy, others from the 
Levant, among some goods, which were brought home 
by their Turkey fleet ; others said it was brought 
from Candia ; others from Cyprus, It mattered not 
from whence it came ; but all agreed it was come into 
Holland again. 

We haa no such thing as printed newspapers in 
those days to spread rumours and reports of things, 
and to improve them by the invention of men, as I 
have lived to see practised since. But such things as 
those were gathered from the letters of merchants and 
others who corresponded abroad, and from them was 
handed about by word of mouth only ; so that things 
did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as 
they do now. But it seems that the Government 
had a true account of it, and several coimdls were 
held about ways to prevent its coming over ; but all 
was kept very private. Hence it was that this 
rumour died off" again, and people b^an to foiget it, 
as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that 
we hoped was not true, till the latter end of Novem-

ber or the beginning of December 1664, when two 
men, stud to oe FreDchmen, died of the plague in 
Long Acre, or mther at the upper end of Drury 
Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to con- 
ceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some 
vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Sec- 
retaries of State got knowledge of it, and concerning 
themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain 
of the truth, two physicians and a suipeon were 
ordered to go to the house and make inspection. 
This they did ; and finding evident tokens of the 
sickness upon both the boi^es that were dead, they 
gave their opinions publicly that they died of the 
plague. Whereupon it was given in to the parish 
clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it 
was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the 
usual manner, thus — 

Plague, 2. Pariahei infected, 1. 

The people showed a great concern at this, and 
b^an to be alarmed all over the town, and the more, 
because in the last week in December 1664 another 
man died in the same house, and of the same dis- 
temper. And then we were easy amin for about six 
weeks, when none having died with any marks of 
infection, it was said the distemper was gone ; but 
after that, I think it was about the 12th of Februaiy, 
another died in another house, but in the same pari^ 
and in the same manner. 

This turned the people^s eyes pretty much towards 
that end of the town, and the weekly bills showing 
an increase of burials in St. Giles's parish more than 
usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was 
among the people at that end of the town, and that 
many nad died of it, though they had taken care to 
keep it as much &om the knowledge of the public as

possible. This possessed the heads of the people very 
much, and few cared to go through Drury Lane, or 
the other streets suspected, unless they had extraor- 
dinary business, that obliged them to it. 

This increase of the bills stood thus : the usual 
number of burials in a week, in the parishes of St. 
Giles-in- the -Fields and St Andrew, Holbom, were 
from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few more 
or less; but from the time that the plague first be^an 
in St. Giles's parish, it was observed that the ordi- 
nary burials increa^ in number considerably. For 
example : —

The like increase of the bills was observed in the 
parishes of St. Bride, adjoining on one side of Hol- 
Dom parish, and in the parish of St James, Clerken- 
well, adjoining on the other side of Holbom; in both 
which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly 
were from four to six or eight, whereas at that time 
they were increased as follows : —

Besides this, it was observed with great u 
by the people that the weekly bills in general in- 
creased very much during these weeks, uthough it 
was at a time of the year when usually the bills are 
very moderate. 

The usual number of burials within the bills of 
mortality for a week was fi-om about 240 or there- 
abouts to SOO. The last was esteemed a pretty high 
bill ; but after this we found the bills successively 
increasing, as follows : —

This last bill was really frightful, being a higher 
number than had been known to have been buried in 
one week since the preceding visitation of 1656. 

However, all this went off again, and the weather 
proving cold, and the frost, which began in Decem- 
Der, still continuing very severe, even till near the 
end of February, attended with shaip though moder- 
ate winds, the bills decreased again, and the city 
grew healthy, and everybody began to look upon the 
danger as good as over ; only that still the burials 
in St. Giles's continued high. From the beginning 
of April especially they stood at twenty-five each 
week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th, when 
there was buried in St Giles's parish thirtVi whereof

two of the plague and eight of the spotted-fever, 
which was looked upon as the same thing ; likewise 
the number that died of the spotted-fever in tiie 
whole increased, being eight the week before, and 
twdve the week above named. 

This alanned us all again, and terrible apprehen- 
sions were among the people, especially tfae weather 
being now changed and growing warm, and the sum- 
mer l>eing at hand. However, the next week there 
seemed to be some hopes a^n ; the bills were low, 
the number of the dead in all was but 388, there was 
none of the plague, and but four of the spotted- 
fever. 

Rut the following week it returned again, and the 
distemper was spread into two or three other parishes, 
viz., St. Andrew's, Holbom ; St. Clement Danes ; 
and, to the great affliction of the city, one died within 
the walls, m the parish of St. Mary Woolchurch, 
that is to say, in Bearbinder Lane, near Stocks 
Market ; in all there were nine of &e plague and six 
of the spotted-fever. It was, however, upon inquiry, 
found that this Frenchman who died in Bearbmder 
Lane was one who, having lived in Long Acre, near 
the infected houses, had removed for fear of the dis- 
temper, not knowing that he was already infected. 

This was the beginning of May, yet the weather 
was temperate, variable, and cool enough, and peo- 
ple had still some hopes. That which encouraged 
them was, that the city was healthy, the vhole ninety- 
seven parishes buned but fifty-four, and we b^an to 
hooe, tiiat as it was chiefly among the people at that 
end of the town, it might go no &rtner ; and the 
rather, because the next week, which was from the 
9th of May to the 16th, there died but three, of 
which not one within the whole city or liberties ; 
and St. Andrew^s buried but fifteen, which was very 
low. 'TistrueSt. Gileses buried two-and-thirty, but 
[6]

still, as there was but one of the plague, people be- 
gan to be easy> The whole bill also was very low, 
for the week oefore the bill was but 347, and the 
week above meotioDed but 343. We continued in 
these hopes for a fow days, but it was but for a few, 
for the people were no more to be deceived thus ; 
they seamiea the houses, and found that the plague 
was really spread every way, and that many dira of it 
every day. So that now tdl our extenuations abated, 
and it was no more to be concealed ; nay, it quickly 
appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond 
all hopes of abatement ; that in the parish of St. 
Giles it was gotten into several streets, and several 
families lay all sick together : and, accordingly, in 
the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to 
show itself. There was indeed but fourteen set down 
of the plague, but this was all knavery and collusion, 
for in St Giles's parish they buried forty in all, 
whereof it was certain most of them died of the 
plague, though they were set down of other distem- 
pers ; and though the number of all the burials were 
not inci-eased above thirty-two, and the whole bill 
being but 386, yet there was fourteen of the spotted- 
fever, as well as fourteen of the plague^ and we took 
it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty 
died that week of the plague. 

The next bill was Irom the 33rd of May to the 
30th, when the number of the plague was seventeen. 
But the burials in St Giles's were fifty-three — a 
frightful number ! — of whom they set down but 
nine of the plague; but on an examination more 
strictly by the justices of the peace, and at the Lord 
Mayor's request, it was found there were twenty 
more who were really dead of the plague in that 
parish, but had been set down of the spotted-fever 
or other distempers, besides others concealed. 

But those were trifling things to what followed 
[6]

immediately after ; for now the weather set in hot, 
and from the first week in June the infection spread 
in s dreadful maimer, and the bills rose high ; the 
articles of the fever, spotted-fever, and teeth b^^an 
to swell ; for all that could conceal their distempers 
did it, to prevent their neighbours shunning and re- 
iiising to converse with them, and also to prevent 
authority shutting up their houses, which though it 
was not yet practised, yet was threatened, and 
people were extremely terrified at the thoughts 
of It. 

The second week in June, the parish of St. Giles, 
where still the weight of the infection lay, buried 
ISO, whereof^ though the bills said but sixty-eight of 
the plague, everybody said there had been 100 at 
leas^ calculating it from the usual number of funerals 
in that parish, as above. 

Till tliis week the city continued free, tiiere having 
never any died, except that one I^Venchman whom 1 
mentioned before, within the whole ninetv-seven 
parishes. Now there died four within the city, one 
ID Wood Street, one in Fenchurch Street, and two 
in Croaked Lane. Southwark was entirely free, 
having not one yet died ou that side of tlie water. 

I lived without Aldgate, about midway between 
Aldgate Church and Woitechapel Bars, on the left 
hand or north side of the street ; and as the distemper 
had not reached to that side of the city, our neigh- 
bourhood continued very easy. But at the oUier 
end of the town their consternation was very great ; 
and the richer sort of people, especially the nobility 
and gentry from the west part of the city, thronged 
out of town with their families and servants in an 
unusual manner; and this was more particularly 
seen in Whitechapel ; that is to say, the Broad 
Street where I lived ; indeed, nothing was to be seen 
but waggons and carts, with goods, women, servants, 
[7]

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

duldren, &c. ; coaches filled with people of the better 
sort, and hofsemen attending then, and all hurry- 
ii^ away ; then empty wa^^ns and carts appeared, 
and spare horses with servants, who, it was apparent, 
were retuming or sent irooi the countries to fetch 
more people ; Desidea innumerable numbers of men 
on horseback, some alone, others with servants, and, 
generally speaking, all loaded with baggage and 
fitted out for travelling, as any one might perceive 
by their appearance. 

This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to 
see, and as it was a sight which I could not but look 
on &om morning to night, for indeed there was 
nothing else of moment to be seen, it filled me with 
very serious thoughts of the misery that was coming 
upon the city, and the unhappy condition of those 
that would be left in it. 

llua hurry of the people was such for some weeks 
that there was no getting at the Lord Minor's door 
without exceeding difficulty ; there was suco pressing 
and crowding there to get passes and certificates of 
health for such as travelled abroad, for without 
these there was no being admitted to pass through 
the towns upon the road, or to lodge in any inn. 
Now, as there had none died in the city for all this 
time, my Lord Mayor gave certificates of health 
without any difficulty to all those who lived in the 
ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the liber- 
ties too for a while. 

This hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to 
say, all the month of May and June, and the more 
beuujse it was rumoured that an order of the Govern- 
ment was to be issued out to place turnpikes and 
barriers on the road to prevent people travelling, and 
that the towns on the road would not suffer people 
from London to pass for fear of bringing the inrec- 
tion along with them, though neither of these

rumours had anj foundation but in the imagination, 
espedally at first. 

I now bc^an to consider seriously with myself con- 
cerning ray own case, and how I ehould dispoee of 
myself; that ia to say, whether i should resolve to 
stay in I^ondon or snut up my house and flee, as 
many of my neighbours did. I have set this par- 
ticular down so fully, because I know not but it may 
be of moment to those who come after me, if they 
come to be brought to the same distress, and to the 
same manner of making their choice ; and therefore 
I desire this account may pass with them rather for 
a direction to themselves to act by than a history of 
my actings, seeing it may not he of one farthing 
vuue to them to note what became of me. 

I bad two important things before me: the one 
was the carrying on my business and shop, which was 
considerable, and in which was embaived all my 
effects in the world ; and the other was the preser- 
vation of my life in so dismal a calamity as I saw 
ap^arenUy was coming upon the whole city, and 
which, however gi-eat it was, my fears perhaps, as 
well as other people^ represented to be much greater 
than it could oe. 

The first consideration was of great moment to 
me ; my trade was a sadler, and as my dealings were 
chiefly not by a shop or chance trade, but among 
the merchant trading to the English colonies in 
America, so my effects lay very much in the hands 
of such. I was a single man, tis true, but I had a 
family of servants whom I kept at my business ; had 
a house, shop, and warehouses filled with goods ; and, 
in short, to leave them all as things in such a case 
must be left, that is to say, without any overseer or 
person fit to be trusted with them, had been to 
hazard the loss not only of my trade, but of my 
goods, and indeed of all I had in the world.

I had an elder brother at the same time in London, 
and not many yeare before come over from Portugal, 
and advising with him, his answer was in three 
words, the same that was given in another case quite 
difierent, viz., " Master, save thyself." In a word, 
he was for my retiring into the country, as he re- 
solved to do himself with his family ; telling me, 
what he had, it seems, heard abroad, that the best 
preparation for the pla^e was to run away from it 
As to my argument of losing my trade, my goods, 
or debts, he quite confuted me. He toJd me the 
same thing which I argued for my staying, viz., that 
I would trust God with my safety and health, was 
the strongest repulse to my pretensions of losing my 
trade ana my goods ; " for, says he, " is it not as 
reasonable that you should Ixust God with the 
chance or risk of losing your trade, as that ycKi 
should stay in so eminent a point of danger, and 
trust Him with your life?" 

I could not argue that I was in any strait as to a 
place where to go, having several friends atid rela- 
tions in Northamptonshire, whence our family first 
came from ; and particularly, I had an only sister 
in Lincolnshire, very willing to receive and enter- 
tain me. 

My brother, who had already sent his wife and 
two children into Bedfordshire, and resolved to follow 
them, pressed my going very earnestly; and I had 
once- resolved to comply with his desires, but at that 
time could get no horse ; for though it is true all the 
people did not go out of the city of London, yet I 
may venture to say, that in a manner all the horses 
did ; for there was hardly a horse to be bought or 
hired in the whole city for some weeks. Once I re- 
solved to travel on foot with one servant, and, as 
many did, lie at no inn, but carry a soldier's tent 
with us, and so lie in the fields, the weather being

very wann, and no danger irom taking cold. I say, 
as many did, because several did so at last, especially 
those who had been in the armies in the war which 
had not been many yean past : and I must needs say 
that, speaking of second causes, had most of the 
people that travelled done so, the plague had not 
been carried into so many country towns and houses 
as it was, to the great damage, and indeed to the ruin, 
of abundance of people. 

But then my servant, whom I had intended to 
take down with me, deceived me ; and being frighted 
at the increase of the distemper, and not knowing 
when I should go, he took other measures, and left 
me, so I was put off for that time ; and, one way or 
other, I always found that to appoint to go away 
was always crossed by some accicient or other, so as 
to disappoint and put it off again ; and this brings 
in a story which otherwise might be thought a need- 
less digression, viz., about these disappointments 
being m>m Heaven. 

I mention this story also as the best method I can 
advise any person to take in such a case, especially 
if he be one that makes conscience of his duty, and 
would be directed what to do in it, namely, that he 
should keep his eye upon the particular providences 
which occur at tlUt time, and look upon them com- 
plexly, as they regard one another, and as all to- 
gether r^iard the question before him, and then, I 
think, he may safely take them for intimations from 
Heaven of what is his unquestioned duty to do in 
such a case ; I mean as to going away from or stay- 
ing in the place where we dwell, when visited with 
an infectious distemper. 

It came very warmly into my mind one morning, 

as I was musing on this particular thing, that as 

nothing attends us without the direction or per- 

missiw) of Divine Power, so these disappointments

must have something in them extraordinary : and I 
ought to consider whether it did not evidently point 
out, or intimate to me, that it was the will of Heaven 
I should not go. It immediately followed in my 
thoughts, that if it really was from God that I 
should stay. He was able effectually to preserve me 
in the midst of all the death and danger that would 
surround me ; and that if I attempted to secure my- 
self by fleeing from my habitation, and acted con- 
trary to these intimations, which I believed to be 
Divine, it was a kind of flying from God, and that 
He could cause His justice to overtake me when and 
where He thought fit 

These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again, 
and when I came to discourse with my brother again, 
I told him that I inclined to stay and take my lot in 
that station in which God had placed me, and that 
it seemed to be made more especially my duty, on 
the account of what I have said. 

My brother, though a very religious man himself, 
laughed at all I had suggested about its being an 
intimation from Heaven, and told me several stories 
of such foolhardy people, as he called them, as I 
was ; that I ought indeed to submit to it as a work 
of Heaven if I had been any way disabled by dis- 
tempers or diseases, and that then not being able to 
go, I ought to acquiesce in the direction of Him, who, 
having been my Maker, had an undisputed right of 
sovereignty in disposing of me, and that then there 
had been no difficulty to determine which was the 
call of His providence and which was not ; but that 
I should take it as an intimation from Heaven that 
I should not go out of town, only because I could 
not hire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away 
that was to attend me, was ridiculous, since at the 
same time I had my health and limbs, and other ser- 
vants, and might with ease travel a day or two on

foot, and having a good certificate of being in per- 
fect health, might either hire a horse or take post 
on the road, as I thought fit. 

Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous 
consequences which attended the presumption of the 
Turks and Mahometans in Asia and in other places 
where he had been (for my brother, being a merchant, 
was a few years before, as I have already observed, 
returned from abroad, coming la.st from Lisbon), and 
how, presuming upon their professed predestinating 
notions, and of every man's end being predetermine 
and unalterably beforehand decreed, they would go 
unconcerned into infected places and converse with 
infected persons, by which means they died at the 
rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week, whereas the 
Europeans or Christian merchants, who kept them- 
selves retired and reserved, generally escaped the 
contagion. 

Upon these arguments my brother changed my 
resolutions again, and I began to resolve to go, and 
accordingly made all things ready ; for, in short, the 
infection increased round me, and the bilb were risen 
to almost seven hundred a week, and my brother told 
me he would venture to stay no longer. I desired 
him to let me consider of it but till the next day, and 
I would resolve ; and as I had already prepared every- 
thing as well as t could as to my business, and whom 
to entrust my affairs with, I had little to do but to 
resolve, 

I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my 
mind, irresolute, and not knowing what to do. I had 
set the evening wholly apart to consider seriously 
about it, and was all alone ; for already people haa, 
as it were by a general consent, taken up the custom 
of not going out of doors after sunset ; the reasons I 
shall have occasion to say more of by-and-by. 

In the retirement of tnis evening I endeavoured to

resolve, first, what was my duty to do, and I stated 
the arguments with which my brother had pressed 
me to go into the country, and I set against them 
the strung impressions which I had on my mind for 
staying ; the visible call I seemed to have from the 
particular circumstance of my calling, and the care 
due from me for the preservation of my effects, which 
were, as I might say, my estate; also the intimations 
which I thought I had from Heaven, that to me sig- 
nified a kind of direction to venture ; and it occurred 
to me, that if I had what I might call a direction to 
stay, I ought to suppose it contained a promise of 
being preserved if I ooeyed. 

I^is lay close to me, and my mind seemed more 
and more encouraged to stay than ever, and sup- 

Krted with a secret satisfaction that I should be 
pt. Add to this, that, turning over the Bible 
which lay before me, and while my thoughts were 
more than ordinarily serious upon the question, I 
cried out, " Well, f know not what to do ; Lord, 
direct me!^ and the like; and at that juncture I 
happened to stop turning over the book at the 91st 
Psalm, and casting my eye on the second verse, I read 
on to the seventh veise exclusive, and after that in- 
cluded the tenth, as follows : " I will say of the Lord, 
He is my refuge and my fortress : my God, in Him 
will I tnisL Surely He shall deliver t)iee from the 
snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 
He shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His 
wings shalt thou trust : His truth shall be thy shield 
and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror 
by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ; nor 
for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ; nor for 
the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand 
shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right 
hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with 
thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the

wicked. Because thou liast made the Lord, which 
is my reiiiee, even the most High, thy habitation : 
there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any 
plwue come nigh thy dwelling,** &c. 

1 scarce need tell the reader that from that moment 
I resolved that I would stay in the town, and cast- 
ing myself entirely upon the goodness and protection 
of the Almighty, would not seek any other shelter 
whatever ; and that, as my times were in His hands, 
He was as able to keep me in a time of the infection 
as in a time of health ; and if He did not think fit 
to deliver me, still I was in His hands, and it was meet 
He should do with me as should seem good to Him. 

With this resolution I went to bed ; and I was 
Airther confirmed in it the next day by the woman 
being taken ill with whom I had intended to entrust 
my house and all my affairs. But I had a further 
obligation laid on me on the same side, for the next 
day I found myself very much out of order also, so 
that if I would have gone away, I could not ; and I 
continued ill three or hiur days, and this entirely de- 
termined my stay ; so I took my leave of my brother, 
who went away to Dorking, in Surrey, and afterwards 
fetched a round farther into Buckinghamshire or 
Bedfordshire, to a retreat he had founa out there for 
his family. 

It was a very ill time to be sick in, for if any one 
complained, it was immediately said he had the 
plague ; and though I had indeed no symptoms of 
that distemper, yet being very ill, both in my head 
and in my stomach, I was not without apprehension 
that I really was infected ; but in about three days 
I grew belter ; the third night I rested well, sweated 
a little, and was much refreshed. The apprehensions 
of its being the infection went also quite away with 
my illness, and I went about my business as usual. 

These tilings, however, put off all my thoughts of

going into the country ; and my brother also being 
gone, I had no more debate either with him or with 
myself on that subject. 

It was now mid-JuIVi and the plague, which had 
chiefly raged at the otber end of the town, and, as I 
said before, in the parishes of St Giles, St Andrew, 
Holbom, and towards Westminster, b^i;an to now 
come eastward towards the part where I lived. It 
was to be observed, indeed, that it did not come 
straight on towards us ; for the city, that is to say, 
within the walK "as indifferently healthy still ; nor 
was it got then very much over the water into 
Southwark ; for though there died that week 1268 
of all distempers, whereof it might be supposed above 
900 died of the plague, yet there was but twenty- 
eight in the whole city, within the walls, and but 
nineteen in Southwark, Lambeth parish included; 
whereas in the parishes of St Giles and St Martin-in- 
the-Fields alone there died 421. 

But we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the 
out-parishes, which being very populous, and fuller 
also of poor, the distemper found more to prey upon 
than in the city, as I shall observe afterwards. We 
perceived, I say, the distemper to draw our way, viz., 
by the parishes of Clerkenwell, Cripplt^te, Shore- 
ditch, and Bishopsgate ; which last two parishes 
joining to Aldgate, Whitechapel, and Stepney, the 
mfection came at length to spread its utmost rage 
and violence in those parts, even when it abated at 
the western parishes where it began. 

It was very strange to observe that in this partic- 
ular week, from the 4th to the 11th of July, whan, 
as I have observed, there died neai- 400 of the plague 
in the two parishes of St. Martin and St Giles-in- 
the-Fields only, there died in the parish of Aldgate 
but four, in the parish of Whitechapel three, in the 
parish of Stepney but one.

Likewise in the next week, from the llth of July 
to the IStli, when the week^ bill was 1761, yet there 
died no more of the plague, on the whole Southwark 
side of the water, than sixteen. 

But this face of things soon changed, and it b^an 
to thicken in Cripplegate parish especially, ana in 
Clerkenwell ; so that by the second week in August, 
Cripplegate parish alone buried 886, and Clencen- 
well 155. Of the first, 850 might well be reckoned 
to die of the plague ; and of the last, the bill itself 
said 145 were of the plague. 

During the month of July, and while, as I have 
observed, our part of the town seenied to be spared 
in comparison of the west part, 1 went ordinarily 
about the streets, as my business required, and par- 
ticularly went generally once in a day, or in two 
days, into the city, to my brother's house, which he 
had given me charge of, and to see if it was safe; 
and having the key in my pocket, I used to go into 
the house, and over most of the rooms, to see that 
all was well ; for though it be something wonderful 
to tell, that any Bhould have hearts so hardened in 
the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal, yet 
certain it is that all sorts of villainies, and even lev- 
ities and debaucheries, were then practised in the 
town as openly as ever — I will not say quite as fre- 
quently, because the numbers of people were many 
wa^ lessened. 

But the city itself began now to be visited too, I 
mean within the walls; but the number of people 
there were indeed extremely lessened by so great a 
multitude having been gone into the country ; and 
even all this month of July they continued to flee, 
though not in such multitudes as formerly. In 
August, indeed, they fled in such a manner that I 
began to think there would be really none but mag- 
is^tes and servants left in the city.

As they fled now out of the city, so I should ob- 
serve that the Court removed early, viz., in the 
month of June, and went to Oxford, where it pleased 
God to preserve them ; and the distemper did not, 
as I beard of, so much as touch them, for which I 
cannot say that I ever saw they showed any ffreat 
token of thankfulness, and hardly anything of reiorm- 
ation, though they did not want being told that 
their crying vices might, without breach of charitvi 
be said to ha\'e gone far in bringing that terrible 
judgment upon the whole nation. 

'liie face of London was now indeed strangely 
altered, I mean the whole mass of buildings, city, 
liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and d- 
together; for as to the particular part called the 
city, or within the walls, that was not yet much in- 
fected. But in the whole the fare of things, I say, 
was much altered ; sorrow and sadness sat upon every 
face; and though some parts were not yet over- 
whelmed, yet all looked deeply concerned ; and as we 
saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked on 
himself and his family as in the utmost danger. 
Were it possible to represent those times exactly to 
those that did not see them, and give the reader due 
ideas of the horror that everywhere presented itself, 
it must make just impressions upon tneir minds and 
fill them with surprise. London might well be said 
to be all in tears ; the mourners did not go about 
the streets indeed, for nobody put on black or made 
a formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends ; 
but the voice of mourning was truly heard in the 
streets. The shrieks of women and children at the 
windows and dooiB of their houses, where their dear- 
est relations were perhaps dying, or just dead, were 
so frequent to be heard as we pissed the streets, that 
it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the 
woj)d tP bear them. Tears and lamentations were

seen almost in every house, especially in the first part 
of the visitation ; for towards the latter end men's 
hearts were hardened, and death was so always before 
their eyes, that they did not so much concern them- 
selves for the loss of their friends, expecting that 
themselves should be summoned the next hour. 

Business led me out sometimes to the other end of 
the town, even when the sickness was chiefly there ; 
and as the thing was new to me, as well as to every- 
body else, it was a most surprising thing to see those 
streets which were usually so thronged now grown 
desolate, and so few people to be seen in them, that 
if I had been a stranger and at a loss for my way, 
1 might sometimes have gone the length of a whole 
street, I mean of the by-streets, and seen nobody to 
direct me except watohmen set at the doors of such 
houses as were shut up, of which I shall speak 



One day, being at that part of the town on some 
special business, curiosity led me to observe things 
more than usually, and indeed I walked a great way 
where I had no business. I went up Holbom, and 
there the street was full of people, but they walked 
in the middle of the great street, neither on one side 
or other, because, as I suppose, they would not 
mingle with anybody that came out of houses, or 
meet with smells andl scents Irom houses that might 
be infected. 

The Inns of Court were all shut up ; nor were very 
many of the lawyers in the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, 
or Gray's Inn, to be seen there. Everybody was at 
peace ; there was no occasion for lawyers ; besides, it 
being in the time of the vacation too, they were gene- 
rally gone into the countiy. Whole rows of houses 
in some places were shut close up, the inhabitants all 
fled, and only a watohman or two left. 

When I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I

do not mean shut up by the magistrates, but that 
great numbers of persons followed the Couii, by the 
necessity of their employments and other' depend- 
ences ; and as others retired, really lighted with 
the distemper, it was a mere desolating of some of 
the streets. But the fright was not yet near so 
great in the city, abstractly so called, and particularly 
because, though they were at first in a most inexpres- 
sible consternation, yet as I have observed that the 
distemper intermitted often at first, so they were, 
as it were, alarmed and unalarmed again, and this 
several times, till it b^^n to be familiar to them; 
and that even when it appeared violent, yet seeing 
it did not presently spread into the city, or the east 
and south parts, the people b^an to take courage, 
and to be, as I may say, a little hardened. It is true 
a vast many people fled, as I have observed, yet they 
were chiefly from the west end of the town, and from 
that we call the heart of the city, that is to say, 
among the wealthiest of the people, and such people 
as were unencumbered with trades and business. 
But of the rest, the generality stayed, and seemed to 
abide the worst; so that in the place we call the 
Liberties, and in the suburbs, in Southwark, and in 
the east part, such as Wapping, Ratcliff, Stepney, 
RutherhiUie, and the like, the people generally 
stayed, except here and there a few wealthy families, 
who, as above, did not depend upon their business. 

It must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs 
were prodigiously full of people at the time of this 
visitation,! mean at the time that it began ; for though 
I have lived to see a further increase, and mighty 
throngs of people settling in London more than ever, 
yet we had always a notion that the numbers of 
people which, the wars being over, the armies dis- 
iMuided, and the royal family and the monarchy being 
restored, had Hocked to London to settle in business,

or to depend upon and attend the Court for rewards 
of services, proerments, end the like, was such that 
the town was computed to have in it above a hundred 
thousand people more than ever it held before ; nay, 
Rome tooL upon them to say it had twice as many, 
because all the ruined families of the royal party 
flocked hither. All the old soldiers set up trades 
here, and abundance of families settled here. Again, 
the Court brought with them a great flux of pride 
and new fashions. All people were grown gay and 
luxurious, and the joy of the Restoration had brought 
a vast many families to Loudon. 

1 often thought that as Jerusalem was besi^ed by 
the Romans when the Jews were assembled together 
to celebrate the Passover, by which means an incred- 
ible number of people were surprised there who 
would otherwise have been in other countries ; bo the 
plague entered London when an incredible increase 
of people had happened occasionally, by the particu- 
lar circumstances above named. As this conflux of 
the people to a youthful and gay Court made a great 
trade in the city, especially in everything that be- 
longed to flishioD and finery, so it drew by conse- 
quence a great number of workmen, manufacturers, 
and the like, being mostly poor people who depended 
upon their labour. And I remember in particular, 
that in a representation to my X^rd Mayor of the 
condition of the poor, it was estimated that there 
were no less than an hundred thousand riband-weavers 
in and about the city, the chiefest number of whom 
lived then in the parishes of Sfaoreditch, Stepney, 
Whitechapel, and Bishopsgate, that, namely, about 
Spitalfields ; that is to say, as Spitalfields was then, 
for it was not so large as now by one fifth part. 

By this, however, the number of people m the 
whole may be judged of; and, indeed, I often won- 
dered that,after the prodigiousnumbersofpeople that '

went away at first, there was yet so great a multitude 
left as it appeared there was. 

But I must go back again to the bcfinning of this 
surprising time. While the fears of the people were 
young, they were increased strangely by sex-eral odd 
accidents, which put altogether, it was reoUy a wonder 
tlie whole body of the people did not rise as one man 
and abandon their dwellings, leaving the place as a 
space of ground designed by Heaven for an Acel- 
dama, doomed to be destroyed from the face of 
the earth, and that all that would be found in it 
would perish with it. I shall name but a few of 
these things; but sure they were so many, and so 
many wizards and cunning people propagating them, 
that I have often wondered mere was any (women 
especially) left behind. 

In the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared 
for several months before the plague, as there aid the 
year after another, a little before the fire. The old 
women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the 
other sex, whom I could almost call old women too, 
remarked (especially afterward, though not till both 
those judgments were over) that those two comets 
passed directly over the city, and that so very near 
the houses that it was plain they imported something 
peculiar to the city alone ; that the comet before the 
[>estilence was of a faint, dull, languid colour, and its 
motion very heavy, solemn, and slow ; but that the 
comet before the fire was bright and sparkling, or, as 
others said, flaming, and its motion swift and furious ; 
and that accordingly one foretold a heavy judgment, 
slow but severe, terrible and frightful, as was the 
plague ; but the other foretold a stroke, sudden, 
swift, and fiery as the conflagration. Nay, so par- 
ticular some people were, that a.s they looked upon 
that comet preceding the fire, they fancied that tney 
' not only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely, and could

perceive the motion with their eye, but even they 
tieard it: that it made a rushing, mighty noise, 
fierce and terrible, though at a distance, and but just 
perceivable. 

I saw both these stars, and, I must confess, had so 
much of the common notion of such things in my 
head, that I was apt to look upon them as the fore- 
runners and wammgs of God^s judgments; and 
especially when, after the plague had followed the 
Srst, I yet saw another of the like kind, I could 
not but say God had not yet sufficiently scourged 
the city. 

But 1 could not at the same time carry these 
things to the height that others did, knowing, too, 
that natural causes are assigned by the astronomers 
for such things, and that their motions and even 
their revolutions are calculated, or pretended to be 
calculated, so that they cannot be so perfectly called 
the forerunners or foretellers, much less the procurers, 
of such events as pestilence, war, fire, and tne like. 

But let my thoughts and the thoughts of the 
philosophers he, or have been, what they will, these 
things had a more than ordinary influence'upon the 
minds of the common people, and they had almost 
universal melancholy apprehensions of some dreadful 
calamity and judgment coming upon the city ; and 
this principally from the sight of this comet, and the 
little alarm that was given in December by two 
people dying at St. Giles''s, as above. 

The appi'ehensions of the people were likewise 
strangely increased by the error of the times, in 
which, I think, the people, from what principle I 
cannot imagine, were more addicted to prophecies 
and astrological conjurations, dreams, and old wives' 
tales than ever they were before or since. Whether 
this unhappy temper was originally raised by the 
follies of some people who got money by it, that is

to say, by printing predictions and prognostications, 
1 know not ; biit certain it is, books frighted them 
terribly, such as Lilly's Almanack, Gaabury's As- 
trological Predictions, Poor Robin's Almanack, and 
the like ; also several pretended religious books, one 
entitled, *' Come out of her, my People, lest you be 
Partaker of her Plagues ; " another called, " Fair 
Warning;" another, "Britain's Remembi-ancer;" 
and many such, all, or most part of which, foretold, 
directly or covertly, the ruin of the city. Nay, some 
were so enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets 
with their oral predictions, pretending they were sent 
to preach to the city ; and one in particular, who, 
like Jonah to Nineveh, cried in the streets, " Yet 
forty days, and London shall be destroyed." I will 
not be positive whether he said yet forty days or yet 
a few days. Another ran about naked, except a pair 
of drawers about his waist, crying day ana night, 
like a man that Josephus mentions, who cried, " Woe 
to Jerusalem ! " a littie before the destruction of that 
city. So this poor naked creature cried, "Oh, the 
great and the dreadful God ! " and said no more, hut 
repeated those words continually, with a voice and 
countenance full of horror, a swift pace ; and nobody 
f»>uld ever find him to stop or rest, or take any sus- 
tenance, at least that ever I could hear of. I met 
this poor creature sevei-al times in the streets, and 
would have spoke to him, but he would not enter 
into speech with me or any one else, but held on his 
dismal cries continually. 

These things temtiea the people to the last degree, 
and especially when two or three times, as I nave 
mentioned already, they found one or two in the bills 
dead of the plague at St. Giles's. 

Next to these public things were the dreams of old 

women, or, I should say, the interpretation of old 

women upon other people's dreams ; and these put

abundance of people even out of tbeir wits. Some 
heard voivea warning them to be gone, for that there 
would be mch a plague in London, so that the living 
would not be able to bury the dead. Others saw 
apparitions in the air ; and I must be allowed to say 
of Doth, I hope without breach of charity, that they 
heard voices that never spake, and saw sights that 
never appeared, but the imagination of the people 
was really turned wayward and possessed. And no 
wonder, if they who were poring continually at the 
clouds saw shapes and figures, representations and 
appearances, which had nothing in them but air and 
vapour. Here they told us they saw a flaming sword 
held in a hand coming out of a cloud, with a point 
hanging directly over the city ; there they saw 
hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried; 
and there again, heaps of dead bodies l^nng un- 
buried, and the like, just as the imagination of the 
poor terrified people mmished them with matter to 
work upon. 

" So hypochondriac &ncles repKsent 
Ships, armies, battles in the finnament ; 
mi steadjr ejres the exhalations solve. 
And all to its first mstter, cloud. resolTC" 

I could fill thb account with the strange relations 
such people gave every day of what they had seen ; 
and every one was so positive of their having seen 
what they pretended to see, that th^re was no con- 
tradicting them without breach of friendship, or 
being aocounted rude and unmannerly on the one 
hand, and profane and impenetrable on tlie other. 
One time before the plague was begun (otherwise 
than as I have said in St. Giles's), I Uiink it was in 
March, seeing a crowd of people in the street, I joined 
with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them 
all staring up into the air to see what a woman told

them appeared plain to her, which was an angel 
clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his hand, 
wavjne it or brandishing it over his head. She de- 
scribed every part of the figure to the life, showed 
them the motion and the form, and the poor people 
came into it so ei^rly, and with so much readiness ; 
" Yes, I see it all plainly," says one ; " there 's the 
sword as plain as can be." Another saw the angel. 
One saw his very face, and cried out what a glorious 
creature he was ! One saw one thing, and one 
another. I looked as earnestly as the rest, but per- 
haps not with so much willingness to be imposed 
upon ; and I said, indeed, that I could see nothing 
but a white cloud, bright on one side by the shining 
of the sun upon the other part. The woman endeav- 
oured to show it me, but could not make me con- 
fess that I saw it, which, indeed, if I had I must 
have lied. But the woman, turning upon me, looked 
in my fiue, and fancied I laughed, in which her 
imagination deceived her too, for I really did not 
lau^, but was very seriously reflecting how the poor 
people were terrified by the force of their own imagi- 
nation. However, she turned Irom me, called me 
profane fellow, and a scofTer ; told me that it was a 
time of God''s anger, and dreadful judgments were 
approaching, and that despisers such as I should 
waiider and perish. 

The people about her seemed di^usted as well as 
she ; and 1 found there was no persuading them that 
I did not laugh at them, and that I should be rather 
mobbed by them tlian be able to undeceive them. 
So I left them ; and this appearance passed for as real 
as the blazing star itself. 

Anotlier encounter I had in the open day also ; 

and this was in going through a narrow passage from 

Petty France into Bishop^ate Churcnyard, by a 

tow of alms-homes. There are two churchyards to

Bishopsgate church or parish ; one we go over to pass 
from the place called Petty France into Bishopsgate 
Street, coming out just by the church door ; the 
other is on the side of the narrow passage where the 
alms-houses are on the left ; and a dwarf-wall with a 
palisado on it on the right hand, and the city wall 
on the other side more to the right 

In this narrow passage stands a man looking 
through between the palisadoes into the burying- 
place, and as many people as the narrowness of the 
passage would admit to stop, without hindering the 
passage of others, and he was talking mighty eagerly 
to them, and pointing now to one place, then to 
another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking 
upon such a gravestone there. He described the 
shape, the posture, and the movement of it so ex- 
actly that it was the greatest matter of amazement 
to him in the world tMt everybody did not see it as 
well as he. On a sudden he would cry, *' There it 
is; now it comes this way." Then, "'Tis turned 
bock ; '" till at length he persuaded the people into 
so firm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and 
another fancied he saw it ; and thus he came every 
day making a strange hubbub, considering it was in 
BO narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck 
eleven, and then the ghost would seem to start, and, 
as if he were called away, disappeared on a sudden. 

I looked earnestly every w^, and at the very 
moment that this man directed, but could not see 
the least appearance of anything ; but so positive 
was this poor man, that he gave the people the 
vapours in abundance, and sent them away tremb- 
ling and frighted, till at length few people that knew 
of it cared to go through that passage, and hardly 
anybody by night on any account whatever. 

This ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs 
to the houses, and to the erouod, and to the people,

plainly intimating, or else they so understanding it, 
that abundance of the people should cxime to be 
buried in that churchjara, as indeed happened ; but 
that he saw such aspects I must acknowledge I 
never believed, nor could I see anything of it myself, 
though I looked most earnestly to see it, if possible. 

These things serve to show how &r the people 
were really overcome with delusions; and as they 
had a notion of thf approach of a visitation, all their 
predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague, which 
should lay the whole city, and even the kingdom, 
waste, and should destroy almost all the nation, both 
man and beast. 

To this, aa I said before, the astrologers added 
stories of the conjunctions of planets in a malignant 
manner and witn a miBchievous influence, one of 
which conjunctions was to happen, and did happen, 
in October, and the other in November ; and they 
■ filled the people's heads with predictions on these 
signs of the heavens, intimating that those conjunc- 
tions foretold drought, famine, and pestilence. In 
the two first of them, however, they were entirely 
mistaken, for we had no droughty season, but in the 
banning of the year a hard irost, which lasted from 
December almost to March, and after that moderate 
weather, rather warm than hot, with refreshing 
winds, and, in short, very seasonable weather, and 
also several very great I'ains. 

Some endeavours were used to suppress the print- 
ing of such books as terrified the pecmle, and to 
frighten the dispersers of them, some of whom were 
taken up ; but nothing was done in it, as I am in- 
formed, the Government being unwilling to exasper- 
ate the people, who were, as I may say, all out of 
their wits already. 

Neither can I acquit those ministers that in their

their hearers. Many of them no doubt did it for 
the strengthenine the resolution of the people, and 
especially for quickening them to repentance, but it 
certainly answered not their end, at least not in pro- 
porttoa to the injury it did another way ; and in- 
deed, as God Himself through the whole Scriptures 
rather draws to Him by invitations and colls to turn 
to Him and live, than drives us by terror and amaze- 
ment, so I must confess I thought the ministers 
should have done also, imitating our blessed Lord 
and Master in this, that His whole Gospel is full of 
declarations from heaven of God's mercy, and His 
readiness to receive penitents and forgive them, com- 

Etaining, ** Ye will not come unto Me that ye may 
ave life," and that therefore His Gospel is called 
the Gospel of Peace and the Gospel of Grace. 

But we had some good men, and that of all per- 
suasions and opinions, whose discourses weie full of 
terror, who spolce nothing but dismal things ; and as 
they brought the people together with a kind of 
horror, sent them away in tears, prophesying noth- 
ing but evil tidings, terrifying the people with the 
apprehensions of being utterly destroyra, not guid- 
ing them, at least not enough, to cry to heaven for 
mercy. 

It was, indeed, a time of very unhappy breaches 
among us in matters of religion. Innumerable sects 
and divisions and separate opinions prevailed among 
the people. The Church of England was restored, 
indeed, with the restoration of the monarchy, about 
four years before, but the ministers and preachers of 
the Presbyterians and Independents, and of all the 
other sorts of professions, had b^un to gather sepa- 
rate societies and erect altar against altar, and all 
those had their meetings for worship apart, as they 
have now, but not so many then, the Dissenters 
being not thoroughly fi'nncd into a body as they are

since ; and those congrc^tions which were thus 
gathered together were yet but few. And even those 
that were the Govemment did not allow, but en- 
deavoured to suppress them and shut up their 
meetings. 

But the visitation reconciled them ag^n, at least 
for a time, and many of the best and most valuable 
ministers and preachers of the Dissenters were suf- 
fered to go into the churches where the incumbents 
were fled away, as many were, not being able to 
stand it ; and the people flocked without distinction 
to hear them preach, not much inquiring who or 
what opinion tliey were of. But after the sickness 
was over, that spirit of chaiity abated ; and every 
church being again supplied with their own minis- 
ters, or othere present«l where the minister was 
dead, things returned to their old channel again. 

One mischief always introduces another. These 
terrors and apprehensions of the people led them 
into a thousand weak, foolish, ana wicked things, 
which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked 
to encourage them to, and this was running about 
to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and astrologeis to 
know their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, 
to have their fortunes told them, their nativities cal- 
culated, and the like ; and this folly presently made 
the town swarm with a wicked generation of pre- 
tenders to magic, to the black art, as they called it, 
and I know not what; nay, to a thousand worse 
dealings with the devil than they were really guilty 
of. And this trade grew so open and so generally 
practised that it became common to have signs and 
inscriptions set up at doors : " Here lives a fortune- 
teller, " Here lives an astiwloger," " Here you may 
have your nativity calculated," and the like; and 
Friar Bacon's brazen-head, which was the usual sign 
of these people's dwellings, was to be seen almost in

every street, or else the sign of Mother Shipton, or 
of MerHn^s head, and the like. 

With what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff 
these oracles of the devil pleased and satisfied Uie 
people I really know not, but certain it is that in- 
numerable attendants crowded about their doors 
every day. And if but a grave fellow in a velvet 
jacket, a band, and a black cloak, which was the 
nabit those quack-conjurers generally went in, was 
but seen in the streets the people would follow them 
in crowds, and ask them questions as they wentjalong. 

I need not mention what a horrid delusion this 
was, or what it tended to ; but there was no remedy 
for it till the plague itself put an end to it all, ana, 
I suppose, cleared the town of most of those calcu- 
lators themselves. One mischief was, that if the 
poor people asked these mock astrolc^ers whether 
there would be a plague or no, they all agreed in 
general to answer " Yes," for that kept up their 
trade. And had the people not been kept in a 
fright about that, the wizards would presently have 
been rendered useless, and their craft had been at an 
end. But they always talked to them of such-and- 
such influences of the stars, of the conjunctions of 
such-and-such planets, which must necessarily bring 
sickness and distempers, and consequently the plague. 
And some had the assurance to tell them the plague 
was b^un already, which was too true, thougn they 
that said so knew nothing of the nmtter. The min- 
isters, to do them justice, and preachers of most sorts 
that were serious and understanding persons, thun- 
dered against these and other wicked practices, and 
exposed the folly as well as the wickedness of them 
together, and me most sober and judicious people 
despised and abhorred them. But it was impossible 
to make any impression upon the middling people 
and the working labouring poor. Their fears were

[Mcdominant over all their passions, and they threw 
away their money in a most distracted manner upon 
those whimsies. Maid-aervants especially, and men- 
servants, were tlie chief of their customers, and their 
question generally was, after the first demand of 
" Will there be a plague P " I say, the next question 
was, *' Oh, sir ! for the Lord^s sake, what will become 
of me f Will my mistress keep me, or will she turn 
me off? Will sne stay here, or will she go into the 
country? And if she eoes into the country, will 
she take me with her, or leave me here to be starved 
and undone ?^ And the like of men-servants. 

The truth is, the case of poor servants was very 
dismal, as I shall have occasion to mention again 
by-and-by, for it was apparent a prodigious number 
of them would be tumea away, and it was so. And 
of them abundance perished, and particuliu'ly of 
those that these false prophets had flattered with 
hopes that tbey should be continued in their services, 
and cfuiied with their masters and mistresses into 
the countiy; and had not public charity provided 
for these poor creatures, whose number was exceed- 
ing great, and in all cases of this nature must be 
so, they would have been in the worst condition of 
anypeople in the city. 

These things agitated the minds of the common 
people for many months, while the first apprehen- 
sions were upon them, and while the plague was not, 
as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also not 
foi^t that the more serious part of the inhabitants 
behaved after another manner. The Government 
encouraged their devotion, and appointed public 
prayera and days of fasting and humiliation, to make 
public confession of sin and implore the mercy of 
God to avert the dreadful judgment which hung 
over their heads ; and it is not to be expressed with 
what alacrity the people of all persuasions embraced

the occasion ; how they flocked to the churches and 
meetings, and they were all so thronged that there 
was often no coming near, no, not to the very doors 
of the largest churches. Also there were daily prayers 
appointed morning and evening at several churches, 
and days of private praying at other places ; at all 
which the people attended,! say, with an uncommon 
devotion. Several private families also, as well of 
one opinion as of another, kept &mily fasts, to which 
they admitted their near relations only. So that, in 
; really 



a word, those people who were really serious and 
religious applied themselves in a ti-uly Christian man- 
ner to the proper work of repentance and humilia- 
tion, as a Christian people ought to do. 

Again, the public showed that they would bear 
their share in these things; the veiy Court, which 
was then gay and luxurious, put on a nee of just con- 
cern for the public danger. All the plays and inter- 
ludes which, after the manner of the French Court, 
had been set up, and began to increase among us, 
were forbid to act ; the gaming-tables, public danc- 
ing-rooms, and music-houses, which multiplied and 
bqgan to debauch the manners of the people, were 
shut up and suppressed ; and the jack -puddings, 
merry-andrews, puppet-shows, rope-dancers, and such- 
like doings, which had bewitched the poor common 
people, shut up their shops, finding indeed no trade ; 
for the minds of the people were agitated with other 
things, and a kind of sadness and horror at these 
things sat upon the countenances even of the common 
pco^e. Death was before their eyes, and everybody 
' txgBM to think of their graves, not of mirth and 
diversions. 

But even those wholesome reflections, which, 

rightly managed, would have most happily led the 

people to fall upon their knees, make confession of 

their sins, and look up to their merciful Saviour &tt

pardon, imploring His conip&ssion on them in such a 
time of their distress, hy which we might have been 
as a second Nineveh, had a quite contrary extreme in 
the common people, who, ignorant and stupid in their 
reflections, as they were hrutishly wicked and thought- 
less before, were now led by their fright to extremes 
of folly ; and, as I have said before that they ran to 
conjurers and witches, and ail sorts of deceivers, to 
know what should became of them (who fed their 
fean, and kept them always alarmed and awake on 
purpose to delude them and pick their pockets), so 
they were as mad upon their running after quacks and 
mountebanks, and every practising old woman, for 
medicines and remedies ; storing themselves with such 
multitudes of pills, potions, and preservatives, as they 
were called, that they not only spent their money, but 
even poisoned themselves beforehand, for fear of the 
poison of the infection, and prepared their bodies for 
the plague, instead of preserving them against it. 
On the other hand, it is incredible, and scarce to be

" Anti -pestilential pills." " Incomparable drink

Others set up bills to summon people to their lodg- 
ings for directions and advice in the case of infection. 
These bad specious titles also, such as these : — 

" An eminent High Dutch physician, newly come over 
from Holland, where he resided during all the 
time of the great plague last year in Amsterdam, 
and cured multitudes of people that actually had 
the plague upon them." 

" An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, 
having a choice secret to prevent infection, which 
she found out by her great experience, and did 
wonderful cures with it in tile late plague there, 
wherein there died 20,000 in one day." 

" An ancient gentlewoman, having practised with 
great success in the tate plague in this city, anno 
1636, gives her advice only to the female sex. 
To be spoke with," &c, 

"An experienced physician, who has long studied the 
doctrine of antidotes against all sorts of poison 
and infection, has, after forty years" practice, 
arrived to such skill as may, with God's bless- 
ing, direct persons how to prevent their being 
touched by any contagious distemper whatso- 
ever. He directs the poor gratis." 

I takenotjceof these by wayof specimen. I could 
give you two or three dozen of the like and yet have 
abundance left behind. T is sufficient from these to 
apprise any one of the humour of those times, and 
how a set of thieves and pickpockets not only robbed 
and cheated the poor people of their money, but 
poisoned their bodies with odious and fatal prepara- 
tions ; some with mercury, and some with other 
things as bad, perfectly remote from the thing pre- 
tended to, and rather hurtful than serviceable to the 
body in case an infection followed.

I cannot omit a subtilty of one of those quack 
operators, with which he gulled the poor people to 
crowd about him, but did nothing for them without 
money. He had, it seems, addea to his bills, which 
he gave about the streets, this advertisement in capi- 
tal letters, viz., "He gives advice to the poor for 
nothing." 

Abundance of poor people came to him accord- 
ingly, to whom he made a great many fine speeches, 
examined them of the state of their health and of 
the constitution of their bodies, and told them many 
good things for them to do, which were of no great 
moment. But the issue and conclusion of all was, 
that he had a preparation which if they took such a 
Quantity ofeverymoming,hc would pawn his life they 
sDOuld never have the plague ; no, though th^ lived in 
the house with people that were infected. "ThK made 
the people all resolve to have it ; but then the price 
of tnat was so much, I think 't was half-a-crown. 
" But, sir,^ says one poor woman, " I am a poor alms- 
ui, and am kept by the parish, and your bilb 



sayiyou give the poor your help for nothing," " Av, 
g(>t>d woman," says the doctor, " so I do, as I pub- 
lished there. I give my advice to the poor for noth- 
ing) but not my physic." "Alas, sir!" says she, 
" that b a snare laid for the poor, then ; for you give 
them your advice for nothing ; that is to say, you ad- 
vise them gratis, to buy your physic fi>r their money ; 
so does every shopkeeper with his wares." Here tbe 
woman b^an to give nim ill words, and stood at his 
door all iJiat day, telling her tale to all the people 
that came, till the doctor finding she turned away nis 
customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again, and 
give her his box of physic for nothing, which perhaps, 
too, was good for nothing when she had it. 

But to return to the people, whose confusions 
fitted them to be imposed upon by all sorts of pre-

tenders and by every mountebank. There is no 
doubt but these quacking sort of fellows raised great 
gains out of the miserable people, for we daily found 
the crowds that ran after them were infinitely greater, 
and their doors yiere more thronged than tnose of 
Dr. Brooks, Dr. Upton, Dr. Hodges, Dr. Berwick, 
or any, though the most famous men of the time. 
And I was told that some of them got five pounds a 
day by their physic. 

But there was still another madness beyond all this, 
which may serve to give an idea of the distracted 
humour of the poor people at that time, and this was 
their following a worse sort of deceivers than any of 
these ; for these petty thieves only deluded them to 
pick their pockets and get their money, in which 
their wickedness, whatever it was, lay chiefly on the 
side of the deceivers deceiving, not upon the deceived. 
But in this part I am going to mention it lay chiefly 
in the people deceived, or equally in both, and this 
was in wearing charms, philtres, exorcisms, amulets, 
and I know not what preparations, to fortify the body 
with them against the plague ; as if the plague was 
not the hand of God, but a kind of a possession of 
an evil spirit, and that it was to be kept off with 
crossings, signs of the zodiac, papers tied up with so 
many knots, and certain words or figures written on 
them, as particularly the woid [Abracadabra, formed

I might spend a creatdea] of time in my exclama- 
tions against the follies, and indeed the wickedness, 
of those things, in a time of such danger, in a matter 
of such consequences as this, of a national infection. 
But my memorandums of these things relate rather 
to take notice only of the feet, and mention only 
that it was so. How the poor people found the in- 
sufficiency of those things, and how many of them 
were afterwards carried away in the dead-carts and 
thrown into the common graves of every parish 
with these hellish charms and trumpery hanging 
about their necks, remains to he spoken of as we go 
along. 

Ajl this was the effect of the hurry the people were 
in, after the first notion of the plague being at hand 
was among them, and which may be said to he irom 
about Michaelmas 1664, but more particularly after 
the two men died in St. Giles's, in the beginning of 
December ; and again, after another alarm in Feb- 
ruary. For when the plague evidently spread itself, 
they soon began to see the folly of tmsting to those 
unperforming creatures who hangulled them of their 
money ; and then their feara worked another way, 
namely, to amazement and stupidity, not knowing 
what course to take or what to do either to help or 
relieve themselves. But they ran about from one 
neighbour's house to another, and even in the streets, 
from one door to another, with repeated cries of, 
" Lord, have mercy upon us ! What shall we do ? " 

Indeed, the poor people were to be pitied in one 
particular thing, in which they had little or no relief, 
and which I desire to mention with a serious awe and 
reflection, which perhaps every one that reads this 
may not relish, namely, that whereas death now began 
not, as we may tiay, to hover over every one''B head 
only, but to look into their houses and chambers, 
and stire in their faces. Though there might be

some stupidity and dulness of the mind, and there 
was so, a great deal, yet there was a great deal of 
just alarm sounded into the very inmost soul, if I 
may so say, of others. Many consciences were 
awakened ; many hard hearts melted into tears ; 
many a penitent confession was made of crimes long 
concealed. It would wound the soul of any Christian 
to have heard the dying groans of many a despairing 
creature, and none durst come near to comfort them. 
Many a robbery, many a murder, was then confessed 
aloud, and nobody surviving to record the accounts 
of iL People might be heard, even into the streets 
as we passed along, calling upon God for mercy, 
through Jesus Christ, and saying, " I have been a 
thief,^ " I have been an adulterer," " I have been a 
murderer," and the like, and none durst stop to 
make the least inquiry into such things or to ad- 
minister comfort to the poor creatures, that in tlie 
anguish both of soul and body thus cried out. Some 
of the ministers did visit the sick at first and for a 
little while, but it was not to be done. It would 
have been present death to have gone into some 
houses. The very buriers of the dead, who were the 
hardenedest creatures in town, were sometimes beaten 
bock and so terrified that they durst not go into 
houses where the whole families were swept away 
tt^ether, and where the circumstances were more 
particularly horrible, as some were ; but this was, 
indeed, at the first heat of the distemper. 

Time inured them to it all, and they ventured 
everywhere afterwards without hesitation, as I sliall 
have occasion to mention at large hereafter. 

I am supposing now the plague to be b^un, as I 
have said, and that the magistrates began to take 
the condition of the people into their serious con- 
sideration. What they did as to the regulation of 
the inhabitants and of infected families I shall speak

they did as above, even to madness, the Lord Mayor, 
a veiy sober and religious gentleman, appointed 
physicians and surgeons for relief of the poor — I 
mean the diseased poor — and in particular ordered 
the College of Physici»is to publish directions for 
cheap remedies for the poor, in all the circumstances 
of the distemper. This, indeed, was one of the 
most charitable and judicious things that could be 
done at that time, for this drove the people from 
haunting the doors of every disperser of bills, and 
from talcing down blindly, and without considera- 
tion, poison for physic and death instead of life. 

This direction of the physicians was done by a con- 
sultation of the whole College, and as it was particu- 
larfy calculated for the use of the poor and for cheap 
raedicines, it was made public, so that everybody 
might see it, and copies were given gratis to all that 
desired it. But as it is public, and to be seen on all 
occasions, I need not give the reader of this the 
trouble of it. 

I shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or 
ct^iacity of the physicians when I say that the vio- 
lence of the distemper, when it came to its extremity, 
was like the fire the next year. The fire, which con- 
sumed what the plague could not touch, defied all 
the application of remedies; the fire-engines were 
broken, the buckets thrown away, and the power of 
man was baffled and brought to an end. So the 
plague defied all medicines ; the very phy.sicians 
were seized with it, with their preservatives in their 
mouths ; and men went about prescribing to others 
and telling them what to do, till the tokens were 
upon them, and they dropped down dead, destroyed

by that very enemy they directed othen to oppose. 
lliis was the case of several physicians, even some of 
them the most eminent, and of several of the most 
skilful surgeons. Abundance of quacks too died, 
who had the folly to trust to their own medicines, 
which they must needs be conscious to themselves 
were good for nothing, and who rather ought, like 
other sorts of thieves, to have run away, sensible of 
their guilt, from the justice that they could not but 
expect should punish them as they knew they had 
deserved. 

Not that it is any dercwation from the labour or 
application of the physicians to say they fell in the 
common calamity ; nor is it so intended by me ; it 
rather is to their praise that they ventured their 
lives so far as even to lose them in the service of 
mankind. They endeavoured to do good, and to 
save the lives of others. But we were not to expect 
that the physicians could stop God's judgments, or 
prevent a distemper eminently armed tmm heaven 
from executing the errand it was sent about. 

Doubtless, the physicians assisted many by their 
skill, and by their prudence and applications, to the 
saving of their lives and restoring their health. But 
it is not lessening their character or their skill, to 
say they could not cure those that had the tokens 
upon them, or those who were mortally infected be- 
fore the physicians were sent for, as was frequently 
the case. 

It remains to mention now what public measures 
were taken by the magistrates for the general safety, 
and to prevent the spreading of the distemper, when 
it first broke out I shall have frequent occasion to 
speak of the prudence of the magistrates, their char- 
ity, their vigilance for the poor, and for preserving 
good order, furnishing provisions, and the like, when 
the plague was increased, as it afterwards was. But

I am now upon the order and regulations they pub- 
lished for the government of infected families. 

I mentioned above shutting of houses up ; and it 
is needful to say something particularly to that, for 
this part of the history of tne plague is very mel- 
ancholy, but the moat wievoua story must be told, 

About June the Lora Mayor of London and the 
Court of Aldermen, as I have said, b^an more par- 
ticularly to concern themselves for the regulation of 
the city. 

The Justices of Peace for Middlesex, by direction 
of the Secretary of State, had begun to shut up 
houses in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields, St. 
Martin, St. Clement Danes, &c,, and it was with 
good success ; for in several streets where the plague 
broke out, upon strict guarding the houses that were 
infected, and taking care to oury those that died 
immediately after they were known to be dead, the 
plague ceased in those streets. It was also observed 
that the plague decreased Kooner in those parishes 
after they had been visited to the full than it did in 
the parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, 
Whitechapel, Stepney, and others, the early care 
taken in that manner being a great means to the 
putting a check to it. 

This shutting up of houses was a method first 
taken, as I understand, in the plague which hap- 
pened in 1603, at the coming of King James the 
First to the crown ; and the power of shutting people 
up in their own houses was granted by Act of Par- 
liament, entitled, " An Act for the charitable Relief 
and Ordering of Persons infected with the Plague ;" 
on which Act of Parliament the Lord Mayor and 
aldermen of the city of London founded the order 
they made at this time, and which took place the 
1st of July 1665, when the numbers infects] within 
the city were but few, the last bill for the ninety-

two pari^es being but four; and some houses hav- 
ing been shut up in the city, and some people being 
removed to the pest-house Deyond BunhiU Fields, in 
the way to Islington, — I say, by these means, when 
there aied near one thousand a wee(c in the whole, 
the number in the city was but twenty-eight, and the 
city was preserved more healthy in proportion than 
anyother place all the time of the infection. 

These onlers of my Lord Mayor's were published, 
as I have said, the latter end of June, and took place 
from the 1st of July, and were as follows, viz. : — 



Orders Conceived and Pitbushed by the Lord Mayor 
AND Aldermen of the City of London concern- 
ing THE Infection or the Plaooe, i665. 

" Whereas in the reign of our late sovereign King 
James, of happy memoiy, an Act was made for the 
charitable relief and ordering of persons infected with 
the plague, whereby authority was given to justices of 
the peace, mayors, bailiQs, and other head-officers to 
appoint within their several limits examiners, searchers, 
watchmen, keepers, and buriers for the persons and 
places infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the 
performance of their offices. And the same statute did 
also authorise the giving of other directions, as unto 
them for the present necessity should seem good in 
their discretions. It is now, upon special consideration, 
thought very expedient for preventing and avoiding of 
infection of sickness (If it shall so please Almighty God) 
that these otBcers following be appointed, and these 
orders hereafter duly observed. 

Exammerg to be appointed m every Parith. 

" First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that 

in every parish there be one, two, or more persons of 

good sort and credit chosen and appointed by the alder-

shall conform themselves accordingly.

" That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to 
inquire and learn from time to time what houses in 
every parish be visited, and what persons be sick, and 
of what diseases, as near as they can inform themselves; 
and upon doubt in that case, to command restraint of 
access until it appear what the disease shall prove. 
And if they find any person sick of the infection, to 
give order to the constable that the house be shut up ; 
and if the constable shall be found remiss or negligent, 
to give present notice thereof to the alderman of the 
wud. 

Waickmtn. 

"That to every infected house there be appointed 
two watchmen, one for every day, and the other for the 
night ; and that these watchmen have a special care 
that no person go in or out of such infected houses 
whereof they have the charge, upon pain of severe pun- 
ishment And the said watchmen to do such further 
offices as the sick house sliall need and require; and if 
the watchman be sent upon any business, to lock up the 
house and take the key with him ; and the watchman 
by day to attend until ten of the clock at night, and 
the watchman by night until six in the morning.

port to the utmost of their knowledge whether the per- 
sons whose bodies they are appointed to search do die 
of the infection, or of what other diseases, as ne^ as they 
can. And that the physicians who shall be appointed 
for cure and prevention of the infection do call before 
them the said searchers who are, or shall be, appointed 
for the several parishes under their respective cares, to 
the end they may consider whether they are fitly quali- 
fied for that employment, and charge them &om time 
to time as they shall see cause, if they appear defective 
in their duties. 

"That no searcher during this time of visitation be 
permitted to use any public work or employment, or 
keep any shop or stall, or be employed as a laundress, 
or in any other common employment whatsoever. 

C^rurgeotu. 

" For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as 
there hath been heretofore great abuse in misreporting 
the disease, to the further spreading of the infection, it 
is therefore ordered that there be chosen and appointed 
able and discreet chirurgeons, besides those that do 
already belong to the pest-house, amongst whom the 
city and Liberties to be quartered as the places lie most 
apt and convenient ; and every of these to have one 
quarter for his limit ; and the said chirurgeons in every 
of their limits to join with the searchers for the view sf 
the body, to the end there may be a true report made 
of the disease. 

" And further, that the said chirurgeons shall visit and 
search such-like persons as shall either send for them or 
be named and directed unto them by the examiners of 
every parish, and inform themselves of the disease of 
the said parties. 

"And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be 

sequestered from all other cures, and kept only to this 

disease of the infection, it is ordered that every of the

Sequetiration of the Sick. 

" As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner,

shall tibe same night be sequestered in the same house ; 
and in case he be so sequestered, then, though he after-

house holdeth in his own hands and occupieth by his 
own servants) ; and so as security be given to the 
parish whither such remove is made, that the attend-

expressed, without any cost of that parish to which 
any such remove shall happen to be made, and this

of Peace within those parishes and places as were 
called the Hamlets and out-parts took the same 
method. As I remember, the orders for shutting up 
of houses did not take place so soon on our side, be- 
cause, as I said before, the plague did not reach to 
these eastern parts of the town at least, nor b^n to 
be veiT violent, till the banning of August For 
examfue, the whole bill from the 11th to Uie 18th of 
July was 1761, yet there died but 71 of the plague 
in all those parishes we call the Tower Hamlets, and 
they were as follows : —

Tridtir. Hincoies . .

that same week were in the next adjoining parishes 



thus: —

St GUes^, Cripplcgttte . 



This shutting up of houses was at first counted a 
very cruel and unchristian method, and the poor 
people so confined made bitter lamentations. Com- 
plaints of the severity of it were also daily brought 
to my Lord Mayor, of houses causelessly (and some 
maliciously) shut up. I cannot say ; but upon in- 
quiry many that complained so loudly were found in 
a condition to be continued ; and others again, in- 
spection being made upon the sick person, and the

on his being content to be carried to the pest-house, 
were released. 

It is true that the locking up the doors of people's 
houses, and setting a watchman there night and day 
to prevent their stinine out or any coming to them, 
when perhaps the sound people in the family might 
have escaped if they had been removed from the sick, 
looked very hard and cruel ; and many people per- 
ished in uiese miserable confinements which, 'tis 
reasonable to believe, would not have been distem- 
pered if they had had liberty, though the plague was 
in the house ; at which the people were very clamor- 
ous and uneasy at first, and several violences were 
committed and injuries offered to the men who were 
set to watch the houses so shut up; also several 
people broke out by force in many places, as I shall 
observe by-and-by. But it was a public good that 
justified the private mischief, and there was no ob- 
taining the least mitigation by any application to 
magistrates or government at that time, at least not 
that I heard of. This put tlie people upon all man- 
ner of stratagem in oraer, if possible, to get out ; 
and it would fill a little volume to set down the arts 
used by the people of such houses to shut the eyes of 
the watchmen wno were employed, to deceive them, 
and to escape or break out from them, in which fre- 
quent scuffles and some mischief happened ; of which 
by itself. 

As I went along Houndsditch one morning about 
eight o'clock there was a great noise. It is true, in- 
deed, there was not much crowd, because people were 
not very free to gather together, or to stay long 
together when they were there ; nor did I stay long 
there. But the outcry was loud enough to prompt 
my curiosity, and I called to one that lookea out of 
a window, and asked what was the matter. 

A watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep

bis post at the door of a house which wa^ infected, 
or said to be infected, and was shut up. He had 
been there all night for two nights together, as he 
told his story, ana the day-watchman had been there 
one day, and was now come to relieve him. All this 
while no noise had been heard in the house, no light 
had been seen ; they called for nothing, sent him of 
no errands, which used to be the chief ousiness of the 
watchmen ; neither had they given him any disturb- 
ance, as he said, irom the Monday afternoon, when 
he heard great crying and screaming in the house, 
which, as he supposed, was occasioned by some of the 
family dying just at that time. It seems, the night 
before, the dead-cart, aa it was called, had been 
stopped there, and a servant-maid had been brought 
down to the door dead, and the buriers or bearers, as 
they were called, put her into the cart, wrapt only in 
a green rug, and carried her away. 

The watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, 
when he heard that noise and crying, as above, and 
nobody answered a great while ; but at last one 
looked out and said with an angry, quick tone, and 
yet a kind of crying voice, or a voice of one that was 
crying, *'What d'ye want, that ye make such a 
knocking?" He answered, "I am the watchman! 
How do you do? What is the matter?" The per- 
son answered, "What is that to you? Stop the 
dead-cart." Thiti, it seems, was about one o'clock. 
Soon after, as the fellow said, he stopped the dead- 
cart, and then knocked again, but nobody answered. 
He continued knocking, and the bellman called out 
several times, "Bring out your dead;" but nobody 
answered, till the man that drove the cart, being 
called to other houses, would stay no longer, ana 
drove away. 

The watchman knew not what to make of all this, 

so he let them alone till the moming-man or day-

watcliman, as they called him, came to relieve him. 
Giving him an account of the particulars, they 
knocked at the door a great while, but nobody an- 
swered ; and they observed that the window or case- 
ment at which the person had looked out who had 
answered before continued open, being up two pair 
of stairs. 

Upon this the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, 
got a long ladder, and one of them went up to the 
window and looked into the room, where he saw a 
woman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal manner, 
having no clothes on her but her shift. But though 
he caUed aloud, and putting in his long staff, knocked 
hard on the floor, yet nobody stirred or answered ; 
neither could he hear any noise in the house. 

He came down again upon this, and acquainted 
his iellow, who went up also ; and finding it just so, 
they resolved to acquaint either the Lxira Mayor or 
some other magistrate of it, but did not offer to go 
in at the window. Ilie magistrate, it seems, upon 
the information of the two men, ordered the house 
to be broke open, a constable and other persons being 
appointed to be present, that nothing might be 
plundered; and accordingly it was so done, when 
nobody was found in the house but that young 
woman, who having been infected and past recovery, 
the rest had left her to die by herself, and were every 
one gone, having found some way to delude the 
wat(£raan, and to get open the door, or get out at 
some back-door, or over the tops of the houses, so 
that he knew nothing of it; and as to those cries 
and ^rieks which he heard, it was supposed they 
were the passionate cries of the family at the bitter 
parting, which, tq be sure, it was to them all, this 
being the sister to the mistress of the bmily. ITie

that I could never learn ; nor, indeed, did I make 
much inquiry after it 

Many such escapes were made out of infected 
houses, as particulaj'ly when the watchman was sent 
of some errand; for it was hb business to go of any 
errand that the family sent him of; that is to say, 
for necessaries, such as food and physic; to fetch 
physicians, if they would come, or suraeons, or 
nurses, or to order the dead-cart, and the uke ; but 
with this condition, too, that when he went he waa 
to lock up the outer door of the house and take the 
key away with him. To evade this, and cheat the 
watchmen, people got two or three keys made to 
their locks, or they found ways to unscrew the locks 
such as were screwed on, and so take off the lock, 
being in the inside of the house, and while they sent 
away the watchman to the market, to the bake- 
house, or for one trifle or another, open the door 
and go out as oflen as they pleased. But this bein^ 
found out, the officers afterwards had orders to pad- 
lock up the doors on the outside, and place bolts on' 
them as they thought Jit. 

At another house, as I was informed, in the street 
next within Aldgate, a whole &mily was shut up 
and locked in because the maid-servant was taken 
sick. The master of the house had complained by 
his friends to the next alderman and to the Lord 
Mayor, and had consented to have the maid carried 
to the pest-house, but was refused ; so the door was 
marked with a red cross, a padlock on the outside, 
as above, and a watchman set to keep the door, ac- 
cording to public order. 

After the master of the house found there was no 
remedy, but that he, his wife, and his children were 
to be locked up with this poor distempered servant, 
he called to the watchman, and told him he must go 
then and fetch a nurse for them to attend this poor 
[57]

pri, for that it would be certain death to them all 
to oblige them to nurse her ; and told him plainly 
that if he would not do this, the maid must perish 
either of the distemper or be starved for want of 
food, for he was resolved none of his family should 
eo near her ; and she lay in the garret four storey 
high, where she could not cry out, or call to any- 
body for help. 

Ine watchman consented to that, and went and 
fetched a nurse, ss he was appointed, and brought 
her to them the same evening. During this interval 
the master of the house took his opportunity to 
break a large hole through his shop into a bulk 
or stall, where formerly a cobbler haa sat, before or 
under his shop-window ; but the tenant, as may be 
supposed at such a dismal time as that, was dead or 
removed, and so he had the key in his own keeping. 
Having made his way into this stall, which he could 
not have done if the man had been at the door, the 
noise he was obliged to make being such as would 
have alarmed the watchman ; I say, having made 
his way into this stall, he sat still till the watchman 
returned with the nurse, and all the next day also. 
But the night following, having contrived to send 
the watchman of another trifling errand, which, as I 
take it, was to an apothecary's for a plaister for the 
maid, which he was to stay for the making up, or 
some other such errand that might secure his staying 
some time; in that time he conveyed himself and all 
hia family out of the house, and left the nurse and 
the watchman to bury the poor wench — that is, 
throw her into the cart — and take care of the 
bouse. 

I could give a great many such stories as these, 

diverting enough, which in the long course of that 

dismal year I met with — that is,lieard of — and 

which are very certain to be true, or very near the

truth ; that is to say, true in the general, for no man 
could at such a time leam all the particulars. There 
was likewise violence used with the watchmen, as was 
reported, in abundance of places ; and I believe that 
from the beginning of the visitation to the end, 
there was not less uian eighteen or twenty of them 
killed, or so wounded as to be taken up for dead, 
which was supposed to be done by the people in the 
infected houses which were shut up, and wnere they 
attempted to come out, and were opposed. 

Nor, indeed, could less be expected, for here were 
so many prisons in the town as there were houses 
shut up ; and as the people shut up or imprisoned so 
were guilty of no crime, only shut up because miser- 
able, it was really the more intolerable to them. 

It had also this difference, that every prison, as we 
may call it, had but one jailer, and as he had the 
whole house to guard, and that many houses were 
so situated as that they had several ways out, some 
more, some less, and some into several streets, it was 
impossible for one man so to guard eU the passages 
as to prevent the escape of people made desperate Dy 
the fnght of their circumstances, by the resentment 
of their usage, or by the raging of the distemper it- 
self ; so that they would talk to the watchman on 
one aide of the house, while the family made their 
escape at another. 

For example, in Coleman Street there are abun- 
dance of alleys, as appears still. A house was shut 
up in that Uiey call White's Alley, and this house 
had a back-window, not a door, into a court, which 
had a passage into Bell Alley. A watchman was set 
by the constable at the door of this house, and there 
he stood, or his comrade, night and day, while the 
family went all away in the evening out at that win- 
dow into the court, and left the poor fellows warding 
and watching for near a fortnight.

Not far from the same place they blew up a 
watchman with gunpowder, and burned the poor 
fellow dreadfully ; and while he made hideous cries, 
and nobody would venture to come near to help him, 
the whole family that were able to stir got out at the 
windows one storey high, two that were Jeft sick call- 
ing out for help. Care was taken to give them 
nursea to look after them, but the persons fled were 
never found, till after the plague was abated they 
returned ; but as nothing could De proved, so nothing 
could be done to them. 

It is to be considei'ed, too, that as these were 
prisons without bars and bolts, which our common 
prisons ore furnished with, so the people let them- 
selves down out of their windows, even in the face 
of the watchman, bringing swords or pistols in their 
bands, and threatening the poor wretch to shoot him 
if he stirred or called for help. 

In other cases, some had gardens, and walls or 
pales, between them and their neighbours, or y&>^s 
and bock-housatf; and these, by foendship and en- 
treaties, would get leave to get over those walls or 
pales, and so go out at their neighbours' doors ; or, 
by giving money to their servants, get them to let 
them through in the night ; so that, in short, the 
shutting up of houses was in no wise to be depended 
upon. Neither did it answer the end at all, serving 
more to make the people desperate, and drive them 
to such extremities as that they would break out at 
all adventures. 

And that which was still worse, those that did 
thus break out spread the infection farther by their 
wandering about with the distemper upon them, in 
their desperate cireiimstances, than they would^ 
otherwise have done ; for whoever considers all tiie 
particulars in such cases must acknowledge, and we 
cannot doubt but the severity of those confinem^its

made many people desperate, and made them run 
out of their houses at all hazards, and with the 
plague visibly upon them, not knowing either whither 
to go or what to do, or, indeed, what they did ; and 
many that did so were driven to dreadful exigencies 
and extremities, and perished in the streets or fields 
for mere want, or dropped down by the raging 
violence of the fever upon them. Others wandered 
into the countiy, and went forward any way, as their 
desperation guided them, not knowing whither they 
went or would go, till faint and tired, and not get- 
ting any relief, the houses and villages on the road 
refusing to admit them to lodge, whether infected or 
no, they have perished by the roadside, or gotten 
into barns and died there, none daring to come to 
them or relieve them, though perhaps not infected, 
for nobody would believe them. 

On the other hand, when the plague at first seized 
a family, that is to say, when any one body of the 
family had gone out and unwarily or otherwise 
catched the distemper and brought it home, it was 
certainly known by the family before it was known 
to the oflUoers, who, as you will see by the order, 
were appointed to examine into the circumstances of 
all aicli persons when they heard of their being sick. 

In this interval between their being taken sick 
and the examiners coming, the master of the house 
had leisure and liberty to remove himself or all his 
family, if he knew whither to go, and many did 
so. But the great disaster was, tnat many did thus 
after they were really infected themselves, and so 
carried the disease into the houses of those who 
were so hospitable as to receive them, which, it 
must be confessed, was very cruel and ungrateful. 

And this was, in part, the reason of the general 

notion, or scandal rather, which went about of the 

temper of people infected, iinmety, that they did not

take tbe least care or make any scruple of infecting 
others, though I cannot say but there might be some 
truth in it too, but not so general as was reported. 
What natural reason could be given for so wicked a 
thing at a time when they might conclude them- 
selves just going to appear at the bar of Divine 
JusUce I know not. I am verv well satisfied that it 
cannot be reconciled to religion and principle any 
more than it can be to generosity and humanity, but 
I may speak of that again. 

I am speaking now of people made desperate by 
the apprehensions uf their being shut up, and their 
breaking out by stratagem or force, either before or 
after they were shut up, whose misery was not 
lessened when they were out, but sadly increased. 
On the other hand, many that thus got away had 
retreats to go to and other houses, where they 
locked themselves up and kept hid till the plague 
was over ; and many families, foreseeing the approach 
of the distemper, laid up stores of provisions sufli- 
cient for their whole families, and shut themselves 
up, and that so entirely that they were neither seen 
or heard of till the infection was quite ceased, and 
then came abroad sound and well. I might recollect 
several such as these, and ^ve you the particulars 
of their management ; for, doubtless, it was the mast 
effectual secure step that could be taken for such 
whose circumstances would not admit them to re- 
move, or who had not retreats abroad proper for the 
case ; for, in being thus shut up, they were as if they 
had been a hundred miles off. Nor do I remember 
that any one of those families miscarried. Among 
these several Dutch merchants were particularly re- 
markable, who kept their houses like little garrisons 
besieged, suffering none to go in or out or come near 
them, particularly one in a court in Throgmorton 
Street, whose bouse looked into Draper's Garden.

But I come back to the case of families infected, 
and shut up by the magistrates. The misery of those 
fiunilies is not to be expressed ; and it was senerally 
in such houses that we heard the most dismal shrieks 
and outcries of the poor people, terrified and even 
frighted to death by the sight of the condition of 
their dearest relations, and by the terror of being im- 
prisoned as they were. 

I remember, and while I am writing this story I 
think I bear the very sound of it, a certain lady had 
an only daughter, a young maiden about nineteen 
years old, and who was possessed of a very consider- 
able fortune. They were only lodgers in the house 
where they were. The young woman, her motho', 
and the maid had been abroad on some occasion, I 
do not remember what, for the house was not shut 
up ; but about two hours after they came home the 
young lady complained she was not well ; in a quar- 
ter of an hour more she vomited and had a violent 
pain in her head. " Pray God," says her mother, in 
a terrible fright, " my child has not the distemper ! " 
The pain in ner head increasing, her mother ordered 
the bed to be wanned, and resolved to put her to 
bed, and prepared to give her things to sweat, which 
was the ordinary remedy to be taken when the first 
apprehensions of the distemper began. 

While the bed was airing the mother undressed 
the young woman, and just as she was laid down in 
the oed, she, looking upon her body vHth a candle, 
immediately discovered the fatal tokens on the in- 
side of her thighs. Her mother, not being able to 
contain herself, threw down her candle and screeched 
out in such a frightlul manner that it was enough to 
place horror upon the stoutest heart in the world ; 
nor was it one scream or one cry, but the fright 
having seized her spirits, she fainted first, tben re- 
covered, then ran all over the house, up the stairs 
[63]

and down the stairs, like one distracted, and indeed 
really was distracted, and continued screeching and 
ciying out for several hours void of all sense, or, at 
least, government of her senses, and, as [ was told, 
never came thoroughly to herself again. As to the 
young maiden, she was a dead corpse from that 
moment, for the gangrene which occasions the spots 
bad spread [ove^ her whole body, and she died in 
less than two hours. But still the mother continued 
crying out, not knowing anything more of her child, 
several hours after she was dead. It is so long ago 
that I am not certain, but I think the mother never 
recovered, but died in two or three weeks after. 

This was an extraordinary case, and I am therefore 
the more particular in it, because I came so much to 
the knowledge of it; but there were innumerable 
such-like cases, and it was seldom that the weekly 
bill came in but there were two or three put in 
frighted ; that is, that may well be called frighted to 
death. But besides those who were so frighted as to 
die upon the spot, there were great numbers frighted 
to other extremes, some frighted out of their senses, 
some out of their memory, and some out of their 
understanding. But I return to the shutting up of 
houses. 

As several people, I say, got out of their houses 
by stratagem after they were shut up, so others got 
out by bribing the watchmen, and giving them 
money to let them go privately out in the night. I 
must confess I thought it at that time the most in- 
nocent corruption or bribery that any man could be 
guilty of, and therefore could not but pity the poor 
men, and think it was hard when three of uiose 
watdimen were publicly whipped through the streets 
for suffering people to go out of houses shut up. 

But notwithstanding that severity, money pre- 
vailed with the poor men, and many femilies found

means to make sallies out, and escape that way after 
they had been shut up; but these were generally 
such as had some places to retire to ; and thougn 
there was no easy pasiiing the roads any whither 
after the Ist of August, yet there were many ways 
of retreat, and particularly, as I hinted, some got 
tents and set them up in the fields, carrying beds or 
straw to lie on, and provisions to eat, and so lived in 
them as hermits in a cell, for nobody would venture 
to come near tliem ; and several stories were told of 
such, some comical, some tragical, some who lived 
like wandering pilgrims in the deserts, and escaped 
by m^ing themselves exiles in such a manner as is 
scarce to be credited, and who yet enjoyed more 
liberty than was to be expected in such cases. 

I have by me a story of two brothers and their 
kinsman, who being single men, but that had stayed 
in the city too long to get away, and indeed not 
knowing where to go to have any retreat, nor having 
wherewith to travel far, took a course for their own 
preservation, which though in itself at first desper- 
ate, yet was so natural that it may be wondered that 
no more did so at that time. They were but of 
mean condition, and yet not so very poor as that 
they could not JUmish themselves with some little 
conveniences such as might serve to Veep life and 
sout together; and finding the distemper increasing 
in a terrible manner, they resolved to shift as well as 
they could, and to be gone. 

One of them had been a soldier in the late wars, 
and before that in the Low Countries, and having 
been bred to no particular employment but his arms, 
and besides being wounded, ana not able to work 
very hard, had for some time been employed at a 
baker's of sea-biscuit in Wapping. 

The brother of this man was a seaman too, but 
somehow or other had been hurt of one leg, that he

could not go to sea, but had worked for his living 
at a sailmaker's in Wapping, or thereabouts; and 
being a good husband, had laid up some money, and 
was the richest of the three. 

The third man was a joiner or caipenter by trade, 
a handy fellow, and he had no wealth but his box or 
basket of tools, with the help of which he could at 
any time get bis living, such a time as this excepted, 
wherever he went, and he lived near Shadwell. 

They all lived in Stepney parish, which, as I have 
said, being the last that was infected, or at least 
violently, they stayed there till they evidently saw 
the plague was abating at tlte west part of the town, 
and coming towards the east, where they lived. 

The story of those three men, if the reader will be 
content to have me give it in their own persons, 
without taking upon me to either vouch the particu- 
lars or answer for any mistakes, I shall give as dis- 
tinctly as I can, believing the hisixin' will be a very 
good pattern for any poor man to follow, in case the 
like public desolation should happen here; and if 
there may be no such occasion, which God of His in- 
finite mercy grant us, still the sto^ may have its 
uses so many ways as that it will, I hope, never be 
said that the relating has been unprofitable. 

I say all this previous to the history, having yet, 
for the present, much more to say before I quit my 
own part. 

I went all the first part of the time freely about 
the streets, though not so finely as to run myself into 
apparent danger, except when they dug the great pit 
in the churchyard of our parish or Aldgate. A 
terrible pit it was, and I could not resist my curi- 
osity to go and see it As near as I may judge, it 
was about forty feet in length, and about fifteen or 
sixteen feet broad, and, at the time I first looked at 
it. about nine feet deep ; but it was said they dug it 
[66]

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

near twenty feet deep afterwards in one part of it, till 
they could go no deeper for the water; for they had, 
it seems, dug several large pits before this. For 
though the plamie was long a-coraing to our parish, 
yet, when it did come, there was no parish in or 
about I^ndon where it raged with such violence as 
in the two parishes of Ald^te and Whitechapel. 

I say they had dug several pits in another ground, 
when the distemper b^^n to spread in our parish, 
and especially when the dead-carts began to go about, 
which was not, in our parish, till the beginning of 
August Into these pits they had put periiaps fifty 
or sixty bodies each ; then they made larger holes, 
wherein they buned all that the cart' brought in a 
week, which, by the middle to the end of August, 
came to from 200to400 a week ; and they could not 
well dig them larger, because of the order of the 
magistrates confining them to leave no bodies within 
six ieet of the surface ; and the water coming on at 
about seventeen or eighteen feet, they could not well, 
I say, put more in one pit But now, at the ban- 
ning of September, the plague raging in a dreadful 
manner, and the number of burials in our parish in- 
creasing to more than was ever buried in any parish 
about London of no larger extent, they ordered this 
dreadful gulf to be dug, for such it was rather than 
a pit. 

They had supposed this pit would have supplied 
them for a month or more when they dug it, and 
some blamed the churchwardens for sufTering such a 
Inghtfiil thing, telling them they were making prep- 
arations to bury the whole parish, and the like; 
but time made it appear the churchwardens knew the 
condition of the parish better than they did, for the 
pit being finished the 4th of September, I think, 
the^ began to bury in it the 6th, and by the SOth, 
which was just two weeks, they had thrown into it

1114 bodies, when they were obliged to fill it up, the 
bodies being then come to lie within six feet of the 
surface. I doubt not but there mav be some ancient 
persons alive in the parish who can justify the fact of 
this, and are able to show even in what place of the 
churchyard the pit lay better than I can. The mark 
of it also was many yean to be seen in the church- 
yard on the surface, lying in length parallel with the 
passage which goes by the west wall of the church- 
yard out of Houndsditch, and turns east again into 
Whitechai)el, coming out near the Three Nuns' Inn. 

It was about the 10th of September that my curi-, 
osity led, or rather drove, me to go and see this pit 
agam, when there had been near 400 people buned 
in it ; and I was not content to see it in the day-time, 
as I had done before, for then there would have been 
nothing to have been seen but the loose earth ; for 
all the bodies that were thrown in were immediately 
covered with earth by those tliey called the buriers, 
which at other times were called bearers ; but I re- 
solved to go in the night and see some of them thrown 

There was a strict order to prevent people coming 
to those pits, and that was only to prevent infection. 
But after some time that order was more necessary, 
for people that were infected and near their end, and 
delirious also, would run to those pits, wrapt in 
blankets or rugs, and throw themselves in, and, as 
they said, bury themselves. I cannot say that the 
officers suffered any willingly to lie there ; but I 
have heard that in a great pit in Finsbury, in th^ 
parish of Cripplegate, it lyine open then to the 
nelds, for it was not then wt^ea about, [some] came 
and threw themselves in, and expired there, Defore 
they threw any earth upon them ; and that when they 
came to bury others, and found them there, they 
were quite dead, though not cold.

This may serve a little to describe the dreadful 
condition of that day, though it is impossible to 
say anything that is aole to give a true idea of it to 
those who did not see it, other than this, that it was 
indeed very, very, very dreadful, and such as no 
tongue can express. 

I got admittance into the churchyard by being ac- 
quainted with the sexton who attended, who, though 
he did not refuse me at all, yet earnestly persuaded 
me not to go, telling me very seriously, for he was a 
good, religious, and sensible man, that it was indeed 
their business and duty to venture, and to run all 
hazards, and that in it they might hope to be pre- 
served ; but that I had no apparent call to it but 
my own curiosity, which, he saia, he believed I would 
not pretend was sufficient to justify my running that 
hazard. I told him I had been pressed in my mind 
to go, and that perhaps it might be an instructing 
sight, that might not be without its uses. " Nay, 
says the good man, " if you will venture upon that 
score, name of God go in ; for, depend upon it, 
't will he a sermon to you, it may be, the best that 
ever you heard in your life, 'T is a speaking sight," 
says he, " and has a voice with it, and a loud one, 
to call us all to repentance ; " and with that he 
opened the door and said, " Go, if you will." 

His discourse had shocked my resolution a little, 
and I stood wavering for a good while, but just at 
that interval I saw two links come over from the end 
of the Minories, and heard the bellman, and then 
appeared a dead-cart, as they called it, coming over 
the streets ; so I could no longer resist my desire of 
seeing it, and went in. There was nobody, as I 
could perceive at first, in the churchyard, or going 
into it, but the buriers and the fellow that drove the 
cart, or rather led the horse and cart ; but when 
they came up to the pit they saw a man go to and

agiun, muffled up in a brown cloak, and making 
motions with his hands under his cloak, as if he was 
in a great agony, and the buriers immediately 
gathered about him, supposing he was one of those 
poor delirious or desperate creatures that used to 
pretend, as I have said, to bury themselves. He 
said nothing as he walked about, but two or three 
times eroaned very deeply and loud, and sighed as 
he would break his heart. 

When the buriers came up to him they soon found 
he was neither a person infected and desperate, as i 
have observed aoove, or a person distempered in 
mind, but one oppressed with a dreadful weight of 
grief indeed, having his wife and several of his chil- 
dren all in the cart that was just come in with him, 
and he followed in an agony and excess of sorrow. 
He mourned heartily, »s it was easy to see, but 
with a kind of masculine grief that could not give 
itself vent by tears ; and calmly defying the buriers 
to let him alone, said he would only see the bodies 
thrown in and go away, so they left importuning him. 
But no sooner was the cart turned round and the 
bodies shot into the pit promiscuously, which was a 
surprise to him, for he at least eiipected they would 
have been decently laid in, though indeed he was 
afterwards convinced that was jmpiacticable ; I say, 
no sooner did he see the sight but he cried out 
aloud, unable to contain himself. I could not hear 
what he said, but he went backward two or thi^e 
steps and fell down in a swoon. Ilie buriers ran to 
him and took him up, and in a little while he came 
to himself, and they led him away to the Pie Tavern 
over against the end of Houndsditch, where, it seems, 
the man was known, and where they took care of 
him. He looked into the pit again as he went away, 
but the buriers had covered the bodies so immediately 
with throwing in earth, that though thei-e was light

enough, for there were lanterns, and candles in them, 
iloced all night round the sides of the pit, upon 
_jeaps of earUi, seven or eight, or perhaps more, yet 
uothing could be seeu. 

Iliis was a mournful scene indeed, and affected me 
almost as much as the rest ; but the other was awful 
and full of terror. The cart had in it sixteen or seven- 
teen bodies ; some were wrapt up in linen sheets, some 
in rags, some little other than naked, or so loose that 
what covering they had fell from them in the shoot- 
ing out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among 
the rest ; but the matter was not much to them, or the 
indecency much to any one else, seeing they were 
all dead, and were to be huddled together into the 
common grave of mankind, as we may call it, for 
here was no difference made, but poor and rich went 
bother ; there was no other way of burials, neither 
was it possible there should, for coffins wem not to 
be had for the prodigious numbers that fell in such 
a calamity as this. 

It was reported by way of scandal upon the buriers, 
that if any corpse was delivered to them decently 
wound up, as we called it then, in a winding-sheet 
tied over the head and feet, which some did, and 
which was generally of good linen ; I say, it was re- 
ported that the buriers were so wicked as to strip 
them in the cart and carry them quite naked to the 
ground. But as I cannot easily credit anything so 
vile among Christians, and at a time so filled with 
terrors as that was, [ can only relate it and leave it 
undetermined. 

Innumerable stories also went about of the cruel 
behaviours and prB<;tices of nurses who tended the 
sick, and of their hastening on the fate of those they 
tended in their sickness. But I shall say more of 
this in its place. 

I was indeed shocked with this sight ; it almost

overwhelmed me, and I went away with my heart 
most afflicted, and full of the afflicting thoughts, such 
as I cannot describe. Just at my going out of the 
church, and turning up the street towards my own 
house, I saw another cart with links, and a bellman 
going before, coming out of Harrow Alley in the 
Butcher Row, on the other side of the way, and 
being, as I perceived, very full of dead bodies, it went 
directly over the street also toward the church. I 
stood a while, but I had no stomach to go back again 
to see the same dismal scene over again, so J went 
directly home, where I could not but consider with 
thankfulness the risk I had run, believing I had gotten 
no injury, as indeed I had not 

Here the poor unhappy gentleman's grief came 
into my head a^in, and ind^d I could not but shed 
tears in the reflection upon it, perhaps more than 
he did himself; but his ,cftse lay so heavy upon 
my mind that 1 could not prevail with myself, but 
that I must go out again into the street, and go 
to the Pie Tavern, resolving to inquire what became 
of him. 

It was by this time one o'clock hi the morning, 
and yet the poor gentleman was there. The truth 
was, the people of the house, knowing him, had 
entertained him, and kept him there afl the night, 
notwithstanding the danger of being infected by him, 
though it appeared the man was perfectly sound 
himself. 

It is with regret that I take notice of this tavern. 
The people were civil, mannerly, and an obliging 
sort of folks enough, and had till this time kept 
their house open and their trade going on, though 
not so very publicly as formerly ; but there was a 
dreadful set of fellows that used their house, and 
who, in the middle of all this horror, met there every 
night, behaved with all the revelling and roaring

extravagances as is usual for such people to do at 
other times, and, indeed, to such an offensive degree 
that the very master and mistress of the house grew 
first ashamed and then terrified at them. 

They sat generally in a room next the street, and 
as they always kept late hours, so when the dead- 
cart came across the street-end to go into Hounds- 
ditch, which was in view of the tavern windows, 
they would frequently open the windows as soon 
as Uiey heard the bell and look out at them ; and as 
they might often hear sad lamentations of people 
in the streets or at their windows as the carts went 
along, they would make their impudent mocks and 
jeers at them, especially if they h^ird the poor people 
call upon God to have mercy upon them, as many 
would do at those times in their ordinary passing 
along the streets. 

These gentlemen, heing something disturbed with 
the clutter of bringing the poor gentleman into the 
home, as above, were first angry and very high with 
the master of the house for suffering such a fellow, 
as they called him, to be brought out of the grave 
into their house ; but being answered that the man 
was a neighbour, and that he was sound, but over- 
whelmed with the calamity of his family, and the 
like, they turned their anger into ridiculing the man 
and his sorrow for his wife and children, taunted 
hira with want of coui'age to leap into the great pit 
and go to heaven, as they jeeringly expressed it, 
along with them, adding some very profane and even 
blasphemous expressions. 

Ttiey were at this vile work when I came back to 
the house, and, as far as I could see, though the 
man sat still, mute and disconsolate, and their af- 
fronts could not divert his sorrow, yet he was both 
grieved and offended at their discourse. Upon this 
I gently reproved them, being well enough acquainted

with their characters, and not unknown in person to 
two of them. 

They immediately fell upon me with ill language 
and oaths, asked me what I did out of my grave at 
such a time when so many honester men were car- 
ried into the churchyard, and why I was not at 
home saying my prayers against the dead-cart came 
for me, and the lik& 

I was indeed astonished at the impudence of the 
men, thou{^ not at all discomposed at their treat- 
ment of roe However, I kept my temper. I told 
them that though I defied them or any man in the 
world to tax me with any dishonesty, yet I acknowl- 
edged that in this terrible judgment of God many 
better than I were swept away and carried to their 
grave. But to answer their ouestion directly, the 
case was, that I was mercifully preserved by that 
great God whose name thev had blasphemed and 
taken in vain by cursing ana swearing in a di-eadful 
manner, and that I believed I was preserved in par- 
ticular, among other ends of His goodness, that I 
might reprove them for their audacious boldness tn 
behaving in such a manner and in such an awful 
time as this was, especially for their jeering and 
mocking at an honest gentleman and a neighbour 
(for some of them knew him), who, they saw, was 
overwhelmed with sorrow for the breaches which 
it had pleased God to make upon his family. 

I cannot call exactly to mind the hellish, abomi- 
nable raillery which was the return they made to that 
talk of mine, being provoked, it seems, that I was 
not at all afraid to be free with them ; nor, if I could 
remember, would I fill my account with any of the 
words, the horrid oaths, curses, and vile expressions, 
such as, at that time of the day, even the worst and 
ordinariest people in the street would not use ; for, 
except such hardened creatures as these, the most

wicked wretches that could be found had at that time 
some terror upon their minds of the hand of that 
Power which could thus in a moment destroy them. 

But that which was the worst in all their devilish 
language was, that they were not airaid to blaspheme 
God and talk atheistically, making a jest of my call- 
ing the plague the hand of God ; mocking, ana even 
laughin?, at the word judgment, as if the providence 
of God had no concern in the inflicting such a deso- 
lating stroke, and that the people caluiig upon God 
as they saw the carts carrying away the aead bodies 
was all enthusiastic, abeunl, and impertinent. 

I made them some reply, such as I thought proper, 
but which I found wassoikr from putting a check to 
their horrid way of speaking that it made them rail 
the more, so that I confess it filled me with horror 
and a kind of rage, and I came away, as I told them, 
lest the hand of that Judgment which had visited the 
whole city should glorify His vengeance upon them, 
and all that were near them. 

They received all reproof with the utmost con- 
tempt, and made the greatest mockery that was 
possible for them to do at me, giving me all the 
opprobrious, insolent scoffs that they could think of 
for preaching to thetn, as they called it, which indeed 
grieved me, rather than angered me ; and I went away, 
blessing God, however, in my mind that I had not 
spared them, though they had insulted me so much. 

They continued this wretched course three or four 
days after this, continually mocking and jeering at 
all that showed themselves religious or serious, or 
that were any way touched with the sense of the 
terrible judgment of God upon us; and I was in- 
formed they flouted in the same manner at the good 
people who, notwithstanding the contagion, met at 
the church, &sted, and prayed to God to remove His 
hand from them.

I say, they continued this dreadful course three or 
four days — I think it was no more — when one of 
them, ji«rticularly he who asked the poor gentleman 
what he did out of his grave, was struck irom Heaven 
with the plague, and died in the most deplorable 
manner ; and, in a word, they were every one of them 
carried into the great pit which I have mentioned 
ahove, before it was quite filled up, which was not 
above a fortnight or thereabout. 

Tliese men were guilty of many extravagances, 
such as one would think human nature should have 
trembled at the thoughts of at such a time of general 
terror as was then upon us, and particularly scoffing 
and mocking at everything, which they happened to 
see that was religious among the people, especially at 
their thronging zealously to the jHace of public wor- 
ship to implore mercy from Heaven in such a time 
of distress ; and this tavern where they held their 
club being within view of the church-door, they had 
the more particular occasion for their atheistical pro- 
fane mirth. 

But this began to abate a little with them before 
the accident which I have related happened, for the 
infection increased so violently at this part of the 
town now, that people began to be afraid to come to 
the church ; at least such numbeis did not resort 
thither as was usual. Many of the clei^men like- 
wise were dead, and others gone into the country ; 
for it really required a steady courage and a strong 
faith for a man not only to venture being in town at 
such a time as this, but likewise to venture to come 
to church and perform the office of a minister to a 
congregation, of whom he had reason to believe many 
of them were actually infected with the plague, and 
to do this every day, or twice a day, as in some 
places was done. 

It is true the people showed an extraordinary zeal 
[76]

in these religious exercises, and as the church-doors 
were always open, people would go in single at all 
times, whether the minister was officiating or no, and 
locking themselves into separate pews, would be pray- 
ing to God with great fervency and devotion. 

Others assembled at meeting-houses, eveiy one as 
their different opinions in such things guidea, but all 
were promiscuously the subject of these men's drollery, 
especially at the beginning of the visitation. 

It seems they had been checked for their open 
insulting religion in this manner by several good 
people of every persuasion, and that, and the violent 
raging of the infection, I suppose, was the occasion 
that they had al>ated much of their rudeness for some 
time before, and were only roused by the spirit of 
rilialdn' and atheism at the clamour which was made 
when the gentleman was first brought in there, and 
perhaps were agitated by the same devil, when I took 
upon me to reprove them ; though I did it at first 
with all the calmness, temper, and good manners that 
I could, which for a while they insulted me the more 
tor, thinking it had been in fear of their resentment, 
though afterwards they found the contrary. 

I went home, indeed, grieved and afflicted in my 
mind at the abominable wickedness of those men, not 
doubting, however, that they would l>e made dreadful 
rxiimples of God's justice ; for I looked upon this 
dismiu time to be a particular season of Divine ven- 
geance, and that God would on this occasion single 
out the proper objects of His displeasure in a more 
especial and remarkable manner than at another 
time ; and that though I did believe that many good 
people would, and did, fall in the common calamity, 
and that it was no certain rule to judge of the eter- 
nal state of any one bv their being distinguished in 
such a time of general destruction neither one way 
or other, yet, I savi it could not but seem rtusoiiable

to believe that God would not think fit to spare by 
His mercy such open declared enemies, that should 
insult His name and Being, defy His vengeance, and 
mock at His worship and worshippers at such a time ; 
no, not though His mercy had thought fit to hear 
with and spare them at other times ; that this wa» a 
day of visitation, a day of God's anger, and those 
words came into my thought, Jer. v, 9 : " Shall I 
not visit for these things ? saith the Lord : and shall 
not My soul be avenged of such a nation as this ! *" 

These things, I say, lay upon my mind, and I went 
home very much grieved and oppressed with the 
horror of these men's wickedness, and to think that 
anything could be so vile, so hardened, and so notori- 
ously wicked as to insult God, and His servants, and 
His worship in such a manner, and at such a time as 
thb was, when He had, as it were, His sword drawn 
in His hand on purpose to take vengeance, not on 
them only, but on the whole nation. 

I had, indeed, been in some passion at first with 
them, though it was really raised, not by any affront 
they had offered me personally, but by the horror 
their blaspheming tongues filled me with. However, 
I was douotful in my thoughts whether the resent- 
ment I retained was not all upon my own private 
account, for they had given me a great deal of ill 
language too — I mean pei-sonally; but after some 
pause, and having a weight of grief upon my mind, I 
retired myself as soon as I came home, for I slept 
not that night ; and giving God most humble thaiiKS 
for my preservation in the eminent danger I had 
been in, I set my mind seriously and with the ut- 
most earnestness to pray for those desperate wretches, 
that Grod would pcutlon them, open their eyes, and 
eilectually humble them. 

By this I not only did my duty, namely, to pray 

for those who despitefiilly used me, but I fully tried

my own heart, to my full satis&ction, that it was not 
filled with any spirit of resentment as they had 
offended me in particular ; and I humbly recommend 
the method to all those that would know, or be cer- 
tain, how to distinguish between their real zeal for 
the honour of God and the ef^ts of their private 
passions and resentment. 

But I must go back here to the particular incidents 
which occur to my thoughts of the time of the visita- 
tion, and particularly to the time of their shutting 
up houses, in the first part of their sickness ; for 
before the sickness was come to its hei^t people had 
more room to make their observations than they had 
afterward ; but when it was in the extremity there 
was no such thing as communication with one another, 
as before. 

During the shutting up of houses, as I have scud, 
some violence was oHered to the watchmen. As to 
soldiers, there were none to be found ; the few guards 
which the king then had, which were nothing like 
the number entertained since, were dispersed, either 
at Oxford with the Court, or in quarters in the 
remoter parts of the country, small detachments ex- 
cepted, who did duty at the Tower and at Whitehall, 
and these but very few. Neither am I positive that 
there was any other guard at the Tower than the 
warders, as they called them, who stand at the gate 
with gowns ana caps, the same as the yeomen of the 
guard, except the ordinary gunners, who were twenty- 
four, and the officers appointed to look after the 
magazine, who were called armourers. As to trained 
bands, there was no possibility of raising any ; neither, 
if the Lieutenancy, either of London or Middlesex, 
had ordered the drums to beat for the militia, would 
any of the companies, I believe, have drawn together, 
whatever risk they had run. 

This made the watchmen be the less regarded, and 
[79]

perhaps occasioned the greater violence to be used 
against them. I mention it on this score to observe 
that the setting watchmen thus to keep the people in 
was, first of all, not effectual, but that the people 
broke ont, whether by force or by stratagem, even 
almost as often as they pleased ; and, second, that 
those that did thus break out were generally people in- 
fected, who, in their desperation, running about frota 
one place to another, valued not whom they injured, 
and which perhaps, as I have said, might give birth 
to report that it was natural to the infected people 
to desire to infect others, which report was really 
false. 

And I know it so well, and in so many several 
cases, that I could give several relations of good, 
pious, and relifrious people who, when they have had 
the distemper, nave Ibeen so far from being forward 
to infect others that they have forbid Uieir own 
family to come near them, in hopes of their being 
preserved, and have even died without seeing their 
nearest relations, lest they should be instrumental to 
give them the distemper, and infect or endanger 
them. If, then, there were cases wherein the infected 
people were careless of the injury they did to others, 
this was certainly one of Uiem, if not the chief, 
namely, when people who had the distemper had 
broken out irom houses which were so shut up, and 
having been driven to extremities for provision or 
for entertainment, had endeavoured to conceal their 
condition, and have been thereby instrumental in- 
voluntarily to infect othei's who have been ignorant 
and unwary. 

This is one of the reasons why I believed then, and 
do believe still, that the shutting up houses thus by 
force, and restraining, or rather imprisoning, people 
in their own houses, as I said above, was of little or 
DO service in the whole. Nay, I am of opinion it was

rather hurtful, having forced those desperate people 
to wander abroad with the placue upon them, who 
would otherwise hsve died quietlv in their beds. 

I remember one citizen who, having thus broken 
out of his house in Alder^te Street or thereabout, 
went along the road to Mington ; he attempted to 
have gone in at the Angel Inn, and after that at the 
White Horse, two inns Known still by the same signs, 
but was refused; after which he came to the Red 
Bull, an inn also still continuing the same sign. He 
asked them for lodging for one night only, pretend- 
ing to be going into Lincolnshire, and assuring them of 
his being very sound and free from the infection, which 
also at that time had not reached much that way. 

They told him they had no lodging that they 
could spare but one bed up in the garret, and that 
they could spare that bea but for one night, some 
drovers being expected the next day with cattle ; 
so, if he would accept of that lodging, he might have 
it, which he did. So a servant was sent up with a 
candle with him to show him the room. He was 
verv well dressed, and looked like a person not used 
to lie in a garret ; and when he came to the room he 
fetched a deep sigh, and said to the servant, " I have 
seldom lain in such a lodging as this." However, 
the servant assuring him again that they had no 
better, " Well,"^ savs he, " I must make shift ; this is 
a dreadful time ; out it is but for one night.** So 
he sat down upon the bedside, and bade the maid, I 
think it was, fetch him up a pint of warm ale. Ac- 
cordingly the servant went for the ale, but some 
hurry in the house, which perhaps employed her other 
ways, put it out of her head, and she went up no 
more to him. 

The next morning, seeing no appearance of the 

gentleman, somebody in the nouse asked the servant 

uiat had showed him upstairs what was becoiue of

him. She started. " Alas ! " says she, " I nerer 
thought more of him. He bade me carry him some 
warm ale, but I forgot" Upon which, not the 
maid, but some other person was sent up to see after 
him, who, coming into the room, found him stark 
dead and almost cold, stretched out across the bed. 
His clothes were pulled off, his jaw fallen, his eyes 
open in a most frightful posture, the rug of the bed 
being grasped hai^ in one of his hands, so that it 
was plain he died soon after the maid left him ; and 
t is probable, had she gone up with the ale, she had 
found him dead in a few minutes after he sat down 
upon the bed. The alarm was great in the house, 
as any one may suppose, they having been fi'ee from 
the distemper til) that disaster, which, bringing the 
infection to the house, spread it immediately to 
other houses round about it I do not remember 
how many died in the house itself, but I think the 
maid-servant who went up (irst with him fell pres- 
ently ill by the flight, and several others; for, 
whereas there died but two in Islington of the plague 
the week before, there died seventeen the week after, 
whereof fourteen were of the plague. This was in 
the week from the 11th of July to the 18th. 

There was one shift that some families had, and 
that not a few, when their houses happened to be 
infected, and that was this : the families who, in the 
first breaking out of the distemper, fled away into 
the country and had retreats among their friends, 
generally fnund some or other of their neighbours 
or relations to commit the charge of those houses to 
for the safety of the goods and the like. Some 
houses were, indeed, entirely locked up, the doors 
padlocked, the windows and doors naving deal 
boards nailed over them, and only the inspection of 
them committed to the ordinary watchmen and 
parish officers ; but these were but few.

It was thought that there were not less than 
10,000 houses forsaken of the inhabitants in the 
city and suburbs,- including what was in the out- 
parishes and in Surrey, or tbe side of the water they 
called Southwark. This was besides the numbers of 
lodgeT^ and of particular persons who were fled out 
of other families ; so that in all it was computed 
that about 200,000 people were fled and gone. But 
of this I shall speak again. But I mention it here 
on this account, namely, that it was a rule with 
those who had thus two houses in their keeping or 
care, that if anybody was taken sick in a fomily, 
before the master of the family let the e^uiminers or 
any other officer know of it, lie immediately would 
send all the rest of bis family, whether children or 
servants, as it fell out to be, to such other house 
which he had so in chat^ and then giving notice 
of the sick person to the examiner, have a nurse or 
nurses appointed, and have another person to be 
shut up in the house with them (which many for 
money would do), so to take charge of the house 
in case the person should die. 

This was, in many cases, the saving a whole iamily, 
who, if they had been shut up with the sick person, 
would inevitably have perished. But, on the other 
hand, this was another of the inconveniences of shut- 
ting up houses ; for the apprehensions and terror of 
being shut up made many run away with the rest of 
the »mily, who, though it was not publicly known, 
and they were not quite sick, had yet the distemper 
upon them ; and who, by having an uninterrupted 
lioerty to go about, but being obliged still to con- 
ceal tneir circumstances, or perhaps not knowing it 
themselves, gave the distemper to others, and spread 
the infection in a dreadful manner, as I shall explain 
further hereafter. 

And here I may be able to make an observation

or two of my own, whicli may be of use hereafter to 
those into whose hands these may come, if they 
should eversee the like dreadful visil^tioD. (L) The 
infection generally came into the houses of the citi- 
zens by the means of their servants, whom they were 
obliged to send up and down the streets for neces- 
saries ; that is to say, for food or physic, to bake- 
houses, brew-houses, shops, &c. ; ana who going 
necessarily through the streets into shops, madcets, 
and the like, it was impossible but that they should, 
one way or other, meet with distempered people, 
who conveyed the &tal breath into them, and they 
brought it home to the families to which they be- 
longed. (S.) It was a great mistake that such a 
great city as this had but one pest-house ; for had 
there been, instead of one pest-house — viz., beyond 
Bunhill P'ields, where, at most, they could receive, 
perhaps, two hundred or three hundred people — 
I say, had there, instead of that one, been several 
pest-houses, every one able to contain a thousand 
people, without lying two in a bed, or two beds in 
a room ; and had every master of a family, as soon 
as any servant especially had been taken sick tn his 
house, been obliged to send thera to the next pest- 
house, if they were willing, as many were, and had 
the examiners done the like among the poor people 
when any had been stricken with the motion : I 
say, had this been done where the people were will- 
ing (not otherwise), and the houses not been shut, I 
am persuaded, and was all the while of that opinion, 
that not so many, by several thousands, had died ; 
for it was observed, and I could pve several instances 
within the compass of ray own knowledge, where a 
servant had been taken sick, and the &mily had 
either time to send him out or retire from the house 
and leave the sick person, as I have said above, they 
had till been preserved ; whereas when, upon one or

more sickening in a family, the house has been shut 
up, the whole family have perished, and the bearers 
been obliged to go in to fetch out the dead bodies, 
not being able to bring them to the door, and at 
last none left to do it. 

(3.) This put it out of question to me, that the 
calamity was spread by inf«^ion ; that is to say, by 
some certain steams or fumes, which the physicians 
call effluvia, by the breath, or by the sweat, or by the 
stench of the sores of the sick persons, or some other 
way, perhaps, beyond even the reach of the physi- 
cians themselves, which effluvia affected the sound 
who came within certain distances of the sick, im- 
mediately penetrating the vital mri:s of the said 
sound persons, putting their blood into an immedi- 
ate ferment, and agitating their spirits to that degree 
which it was found they were agitated ; and so those 
newly infected persons communicated it in the same 
manner to others. And this I shall give ^ome 
instances of, that cannot but convince those who 
seriously consider it; and I cannot but with some 
wonder find some people, now the contagion is over, 
talk of its being an immediate stroke irom Heaven, 
without the agency of means, having commission to 
strike this and tnat particular person, and none 
other, which I look upon with contempt as the effect 
of manifest ignorance and enthusiasm ; likewise the 
opinion of others, who talk of infection being carried 
on by the air only, by carrying with it vast numbers 
of insects and invisible creatures, who enter into 
the body with the breath, or even at the pores with 
the air, and there generate or emit most acute 
poisons, or poisonous ovse or eggs, which minele 
themselves with the blood, and so infect the body : 
a discourse full of learned simplicity, and manifested 
to be so by universal experience ; but I shall say 
more to tlus case in its order.

I must here take further notice that nothing was 
more fatal to the inhahitants of this city than the 
supine n^ligence of the people themselves, who, 
during the long notice or warning they bad of the 
visitation, made no provision for it, hy laying in 
store of provisions, or of other necessaries, by which 
they migtit have lived retired, and within their own 
houses, as I have observed others did, and who were 
in a great measure preserved by that caution ; nor 
were they, after they were a little hardened to it, 
so shy of conversing with one another, when actu- 
ally infected, ae they were at first, no, though they 
knew it. 

I acknowledge I was one of those thoughtless ones 
that had made so little provision that my servants 
were obliged to go out of doors to buy every trifle 
by penny and halfpenny, just as before it o^aii, 
even till my experience showing nie the folly, I be- 
gan to be wiser so late that I had scarce time to store 
myself sufficient for our common subsistence for a 
month. 

I had in family only an ancient woman that 
managed the hoa<<e, a maid-servant, two apprentices, 
and myself; and the plague beginning to increase 
about (IS, I had many sad thoughts about what 
course I should take, and how I should act. 'Hie 
many dismal objects, which happened everywhere as 
I went about the streets, had filled my mind with 
a great deal of horror, for fear of the distemper, 
which was, indeed, very horrible in itself, and in 
some more than in others. Ihe swellings, which 
were generally in the neck or groin, when they grew 
hard and would not break, grew so painful that it 
was equal to the most exquisite torture ; and some, 
not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out 
at windows or shot themselves, or otherwise made 
themselves away, and I saw several dismal objects

of that kind. Others, unable to contain themselves, 
vent«d their pain by incessant roarings, and such 
loud and lamentable cries were to be neard as we 
walked along the streets that would pierce the very 
heart to think of, especially when it was to be con- 
sidered that the same dreadful scourge might be 
expected every moment to seize upon ourselves. 

I cannot say but that now I began to faint in my 
resolutions; my heart tailed me very much, and 
sorely I repented of my rashness. When I had been 
out, and met with such terrible things as these I have 
talked of, I say I repented my rashnq^ in venturing 
to abide in town. I wished often that I had not 
taken upon me to stay, but had gone away with my 
brother and his family. 

Terri6ed by those ftightful objects, I would retire 
home sometimes, and resolve to go out no more ; 
and perhaps I would keep those resolutions for three 
or four days, which time I spent in the most serious 
thankfulness for my preservation and the preservation 
of my family, and the constant confession of my sins, 
^ving myself up to God every day, and applying to 
Him with fasting, humiliation, and meditation. 
Such intervals as 1 had I employed in reading books 
and in writing down my memorandums of what 
occurred to me every day, and out of which, after- 
wards, I took most of this work, as it relates to my 
observations without doors. What I wrote of my 

Srivate meditations I reserve for private use, and 
esire it may not be made public on any account 
whatever. 

I also wrote other meditations upon divine sub- 
jects, such as occurred to me at that time and were 
profitable to myself, but not fit for any other view, 
and therefore I say no more of that. 

I had a very good friend, a physician, whose name 
was Heath, whom I frequently visited during this

dismal time, and to whose advice I was very much 
obliged for many things which he directed me to 
take, by way of preventmg the infection when I went 
out, as ne found I frequently did, and to hold in my 
mouth when I was in the streets. He also came very 
often to see me, and as he was a good Christian as 
well as a good physician, his agreeable conversation 
was a very great support to me in the worst of this 
terrible time. 

It was now the beginning of August, and the 
plague grew very violent and terrible in the place 
where I lived, and Dr. Heath coming to visit me, 
and finding that I ventured so often out in the 
streets, earnestly persuaded me to lock myself up 
and my family, and not to sutler any of us to go out 
of doors ; to keep all our windows fast, shutters and 
curtains close, and never to open them ; but first, to 
make a very strong smoke in the room where the 
window or door was to be opened, with rosin and 
pitch, brimstone or gunpowder, and the like; and 
we did this for some time : but as I had not laid in 
a store of provision for such a retreat, it was impos- 
sible that we could keep within doors entirely. 
However, I attempted, though it was so very late, to 
dp something towards it : and first, as I had con- 
venience both for brewing and baking, I went and 
boi^ht two sacks of meal, and for several weeks, 
having an oven, we baked all our own bread ; also I 
bought malt, and brewed as much beer as all the 
casks I had would hold, and which seemed enough 
to serve my house for five or six weeks ; also I laid 
in a quantity of salt butter and Cheshire cheese ; but 
I had no flesh-meat, and the plague raged so violently 
among the butchers and slaughter-houses on the 
other side of our street, where they are known to 
dwell in great numbers, that it was not advisable so 
much as to go over the street among them.

And here I must observe again, that this necessity 
of going out of our houses to buy provisions was in 
a great measure the ruin of the wnole dty, for the 
people catched the distemper on these occasions one 
of another, and even the provisions themselves were 
often tainted ; at least I have great reason to be- 
lieve so ; and therefore I cannot say with satisfaction 
what I know is repeated with great assurance, that 
the market-people and such as brought provisions to 
town were never infected. I am certain the butchers 
of Whitechapel, where the greatest part of the flesh- 
meat was killed, were dreadfully visited, and that at 
least to such a d^ree that few of their shops were 
kept open, and those tbat remained of them killed 
their meat at Mile End and that way, and brought 
it to market upon horses. 

However, the poor people could not lay up pro- 
visions, and there was a necessity that they must go 
to market to buy, and others to send servants or 
their children ; and as this was a necessity which 
renewed itself daily, it brought abundance of un- 
sound people to the market^ and a great many 
that went thither sound brought death home with 
them. 

It is true people used all possible precaution. 
When any one bought a joint of meat in the market 
they would not take it olF the butcher's hand, but 
took it off the hooks themselves. On the other 
hand, the butcher would not touch the money, but 
have it put into opot fiill of vinegar, which he kept for 
that purpose. The buyer carried always small money 
to make up any odd sum, that they might take no 
change. They carried bottles of scents and perfumes 
in their hands, and all the means that could he used 
were used ; but then the poor could not do even 
these things, and they went at all hazards. 

Innumerable dismal stories we heard every day on

du8 very account. Sometimes a man or woman 
dropped down dead in the very markets, for many 
people that had the plague upon them knew nothing 
of it till the inward gangrene had affected their 
vitals, and they died in a few moments. This caused 
that many died frequently in that manner in the 
streets suddenly, without any warning ; others per- 
haps had time to go to the next bulk or stall, or to 
any door-pon:h, and just sit down and die, as I have 
said before. 

These objects were so frequent in the streets that 
when the plague came to be very raging on one side, 
there was scarce any passing by the streets but that 
several dead bodies would be lying here and there 
upon the ground. On the other hand, it is observ- 
able, that though at first the people would stop as 
they went along and call to the neighbours to come 
out on such an occasion, yet afterward no notice was 
taken of them ; but that, if at any time we found a 
corpse' lying, go across the way and not come near 
it ; or, if in a narrow lane or passage, go back again 
and seek some other way to go onthebusiness we were 
upon ; and in those cases the corpse was always left* 
till the officers had notice to come and take them 
away, or till night, when the bearers attending the 
dead-cart wpula take them up and carry them away. 
Nor did those undaunted creatures who performed 
these offices fail to search their pockets, and some- 
times strip off their clothes if they were well dressed, 
as sometimes they were, and carry off what they 
could get 

But to return to the markets. The butchers took 
that care that if any person died in the market they 
had the officers always at hand to take them up upon 
hand-barrows and carry them to the next church- 
yard ; and this was so frequent that such were not 
entered in the weekly bill, "Pound dead in the

streets or fields,^ as is the case now, but they went 
into the geaerai articles of the great distemper. 

But now the fury of the distemper increased to 
such a degree that even the markeU were but veiy 
thinly furnished with provisions or frequented wjtn 
buyers compared to what they were before ; and the 
Loitl Mayor caused the country people who brought 
provisions to be stopped in the streets leading into 
the town, and to ait down there with their goods, 
where they sold what they brought, and went imme- 
diately away ; and this encouraged the country 
people greatly to do so, for they sold their provisions 
at the very entrances into the town, and even in the 
fields, as particularly in the fields beyond White- 
chiMiel, in Spitalfielm ; ^ also in St. George's Fields 
in Southwark, in Bunhill Fields, and in a great field 
called Wood's Close, near Islington. Thither the 
Lord Mayor, aldermen, and magistrates sent their 
officers and servants to buy for Uieir families, them- 
selves keeping within doors as much as possible, and 
the like did many other people; and after this 
method was taken the countiy people came with 
great cheerfulness, and brought provisions of all 
sorts, and very seldom got any harm, which, I sup- 
pose, added also to that report of their being mirac- 
ulously preserved. 

As for my little family, having thus, as I have 
s^d, laid in a store of bread, butter, cheese, and beer, 
I took my friend and physician's advice, and locked 
myself up, and my family, and resolved to suffer the 
hardship of living a few months without flesh-meat, 
rather tnan to purchase it at the hazard of our lives. 

But though I confined my family, I could not pre- 
vail upon my unsatisfied curiosity to stay within en- 
tirely myself; and though I generally came frighted

and terrified home, yet I could not restrain ; only 
that indeed I did not do it so frequently as at 
first 

I had some little obligations, indeed, upon me to 

to to my brother^s house, vhich was in Coleman 
treet parish, and which he had left to my care, and 
I went at first every day, but afterwards only once 
or twice a week. 

In these walks I had many dismal scenes before 
my eyes, as particularly of persons falling dead in 
the streets, terrible shrieks and ecreechings of women, 
who, in their agonies, would throw open their cham- 
ber windows and cry out in a dismal, surprising 
manner. It is impossible to describe the variety of 
postures in which the passions of the poor people 
would express themselves. 

Passing through Tokenhouse Yard, in Lothbury, 
of a sudden a casement %'iolently opened just over my 
head, and a woman gave three nightful screeches, 
and then cried, " Oh ! death, death, death ! " io a 
most inimitable tone, and which struck me with 
horror and a chillness in my very blood. There was 
nobody to be seen in the whole street, neither did 
any other window open, for people had no curiosity 
now in any case, nor could anybody help one another, 
so I went on to pass into Bell Alley. 

Just in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the pas- 
sage, there was a more terrible cry tlian that, though 
it was not so directed out at the window ; but the 
whole family was in a terrible fright, and I could 
hear women and children run screaming about the 
rooms like distracted, when a garret- window opened, 
and somebody from a window on the other side the 
alley called and asked, *' What is the matter ? ^ upon 
which, from the first window it was answered, "O 
Lord, my old master has hanged himself! " The 
other asked again, ** Is he quite dead P " and the

first answered, " Ay, ay, quite dead ; quite dead 
and cold ! "" This person was a merchant and a 
deputy alderman, and very rich. I care not to men- 
tion the name, though I knew his name too, but 
that would be an h&mship to the family, which is 
now flourishing again. 

But this is but one ; it is scarce credible what 
dreadful cases happened in particular families every 
day. People in the rage of the distemper, or in the 
torment of their swellings, which was indeed intoler- 
able, running out of their own government, raving 
and distracted, and oftentimes laying violent hands 
upon themselves, throwing themselves out at their 
windows, shooting themselves, &c ; mothers murder- 
ing their own children in their lunacy, some dying 
of mere grief as a passion, some of mere fright 
and surprise without any infet-tion at all, others 
frighted into idiotism and foolish distractions, 
some into despair and lunacy, others into melancholy 
madness. 

The pain of the swelling was in particular very 
violent, and to some intolerable ; the physicians and 
surgeons may be said to have tortured many poor 
creatures even to death. The swellings in some 
grew hard, and they applied violent drawing-plaisters 
or poultices to break them, and if these did not do 
they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner. 
In some those swellings were made hard partly by 
the force of the distemper and partly by their being 
too violently drawn, and were so hard that no in- 
strument could cut them, and then they burnt them 
with caustics, so that many died raving mad with 
the torment, and some in the veiy operation. In 
these distresses, some, for want of help to hold them 
down in their beds, or to took to them, laid hands 
upon themselves, as above. Some broke out into 
the streets, perhaps naked, and would run directly

down to the river, if they were not stopped by the 
watchmen or other officers, and plunge themselves 
into the water wherever they found it. 

It often pierced my very soul to hear the croans 
and cries <a those who were thus tormented, out of 
the two this was counted the most promising par- 
ticular in the whole infection, for, if these swellmgs 
could be brought to a head, and to break and run, 
or, as the surgeons call it, to digest, the patient 
generally recovered ; whereas those who, like the 
gentlewoman's daughter, were struck with death at 
the banning, and had the tokens come out upon 
them, often went about indifferent easy till a little be- 
fore they died, and some till the moment they dropped 
down, as in apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case. 
Such would be taken suddenly very sick, and would 
run to a bench or bulk, or any convenient place that 
ofiered itself, or to their own houses if possible, as I 
mentioned before, and there sit down, grow faint, 
and die. This kind of dying was much tfie same as 
it was with those who die of common mortifications, 
who die swooning, and, as it were, go away in a 
dream. Such as died thus had very little notice of 
their being infected at all till the gangrene was 
spread through their whole body ; nor could physi- 
cians themselves know certainly how it was with 
them, till they opened their breasts or other parts 
of their body, and saw the tokens. 

We had at this time a great many frightful stories 
told us of nurses and watchmen who looked after 
the dying people ; that is to say, hired nurses, who 
attended infected people, using them barbarously, 
starving them, smothenng them, or by other wicked 
means hastening their end, that is to say, murdering 
of them ; and watchmen, being set to guard houses 
that were shut up when there has been but one per- 
son left, and pernaps that one lying sick, that they

have broke in and murdered that body, and immedi- 
ately thrown them out into the dead-cart ! and ao 
they have gone scarce cold to the grave. 

I cannot say but that same such murdera were 
committed, and I think two were sent to prison for 
it, but died before they could be tried ; and I have 
heard that three others, at several times, were ex- 
cused for murders of that kind; but I must say I be- 
lieve nothing of its being so common a crime as some 
have since been pleased to say, nor did it seem to be 
so rational where the people were brought so low as 
not to be able to help themselves, for such seldom 
recovered, and there was no temptation to commit a 
murder, at least none equal to ttie fact, where they 
were sure persons would die in so short a time, and 
could not live. 

That there were a great many robberies and 
wicked practices committed even in this dreadful 
time I do not deny. The power of avarice was 
so strong in some that they would run any hazard 
to steal and to plunder ; and particularly in houses 
where all the fiimities or innabitants have been 
dead and carried out, tbey would break in at all 
hazards, and without r^ard to the daneer of infec- 
tion, take even the clothes off the deaa bodies and 
the bed-clothes from others where they lay dead. 

This, I suppose, must be the case of a family in 
Hoiuidsditch, where a man aad his daughter, the rest 
of the family being, as I suppose, cairied away before 
by the dead-cart, were found stark naked, one in one 
chamber and one in another, lying dead on the floor, 
and the clothes of the beds, firom whence 't is sup* 
posed they were rolled off by thieves, stolen and 
carried quite away. 

It is indeed to be observed that the women were 
in all this calamity the most rash, fearless, and des- 
perate creatures, and as there were vast numbers that

went about as nurses to tend those that were sick, 
they committed a great many petty thieveries in the 
houses where they were employed ; and some of them 
were publicly whipped for it, when perhaps they 
ou^t rather to have been hanged for examples, for 
numbers of houses were robbed on these occasions, 
till at length the parish officers were sent to recom- 
mend nurses to the sick, and always took an account 
whom it was they sent, so as that they might call 
them to account if the house had been abused where 
they were placed. 

But these robberies extended chiefly to wearing- 
clothes, linen, and what rings or money they could 
come at when the person died who was under their 
care, but not to a general plunder of the houses ; 
and I could give you an account of one of these 
nurses, whet, several years after, being on her death- 
bed, confessed with the utmost horror the robberies 
she had committed at the time of her being a nurse, 
and by which she had enriched herself to a great 
d^ree. But as for murders, I do not find that 
there was ever any proof of the fiicts in the manner 
as it has been reported, except as above. 

They did tell me, indeed, of a nurse in one place 
that laid a wet cloth upon the face of a dying 
patient whom she tended, and so put an end to his 
life, who was just expiring before ; and another that 
smothered a young woman she was looking to when 
she was in a fainting fit, and would have come to 
herself; some that killed them by giving them one 
thing, some another, and some st^ed them by giv- 
ing them nothing at all. But these stories hod two 
marks of suspicion that always attended them, which 
caused me always to slight them, and to look on 
them as mere stories, that people continually frighted 
one another with. First, that wherever it was that 
we heard it, they always placed the scene at the

farther end of the town, oppoeJte or most remote 
from where you were to hear it. If you heard it in 
Whitechapel, it had happened at St. Giles% or at 
Westminster, or Holbom, or that end of the town. 
If you heard of it at that end of the town, then it 
was done in Whitechapel, or the Minories, or about 
Cripplegate parish. If you heard of it in the city, 
why, then it happened in Southwark ; and if you 
heard of it in Southwark, then it was done in the 
city, and the like. 

In the next place, of what part soever you heard 
the story, the particulars were always the same, es- 
pecially that of laying a wet double clout on a dying 
man''s face, and that of smothering a young gentle- 
woman ; so that it was apparent, at least to my 
judgment, that there was more of tale than of ti-uth 
in tnose things. 

However, I cannot say but it had some effect upon 
the people, and particularly that, as I said before, 



they grew more cautious whom they took into their 
houses, and whom they trusted their lives with, and 
had them always recommended if they could j and 
where they could not find such, for tnev were not 
very plenty, they applied to the parish officers. 

But here again the misery of that time lay upon 
the poor, who, being infected, had neither food or 
physic, neither physician or apothecary to assist 
them, or nune to attend them. Many of those died 
calling for help, and even for sustenance, out at their 
windows, in a most miserable and deplorable man- 
ner; but it must be added that whenever the cases 
of such persons or families were represented to my 
Lord Mayor they always were relieved. 

It is true, in some houses where the] people were 
not very poor, vet where they had sent perhaps their 
wives and children away, and if they had any ser- 
vants they had been dismissed ; — I say, it is true,

that to save the expenses, many such aa these shut 
themselves in, and not having help, died alone. 

A neighbour and acquaintance of mine, having 
aome money owing to him irom a shopkeeper in 
Whitecross Street or thereabouts, sent his apprentice, 
a youth about eighteen years of age, to endeavour to 
get the money. He came to the door, and finding 
It shut, knocked pretty hard, and, as he thought, 
heard somebody answer within, but was not sure, so 
he waited, and after some stay knocked again, and 
then a third time, when he heard somebody coming 
downstairs. 

At length the man of the house came to the door ; 
he had on his breeches or drawers, and a yellow 
flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of slipped- 
shoes, a white cap on his head, and, as the young man 
said, " death in his face." 

When he opened the door, says he, " What do 
you disturb me thus for?" "The boy, though a little 
surprised, replied, " I come &om such a one, and my 
master sent me for the money which he says you 
know of." " Very well, chila," returns the living 
ghost ; " call as you go by at Cripplegate Church, 
and bid them ring the bell ; " and with these words 
-ihut the door again, and went up again, and died the 



same day ; nay, perhaps the same hour. This the 
young man told me himself, and I have reason to be- 
lieve it. This was while the plague was not come to 
a height : I think it was in June, towards the latter 
end of the month ; it must be before the dead-carts 
came about, and while they used the ceremony of 
ringing the bell for the deaa, which was over for cer- 
tain, in that parish at least, before the month of 
July, for by the S5th of July there died 550 and up- 
waras in a week, and then tliey could no more bury 
in form, rich or poor.

dreadful calamity, yet the numbers of thieves were 
abroad upon all occasions, where they had found any 
prey, and that these were generally women. It was 
one morning about eleven o'clock, I had walked out 
to my brother's house in Coleman Street parish, as I 
often did, to see that all was safe. 

My brother^s house had a little court before it, and 
a brick wall and a gate in it, and within that several 
warehouses where his goods of several sorts lay. It 
happened that i n one of these warehouses were several 
packs of women's high-crowned hats, which came out 
of the country, and were, as I suppose, for exporta- 
tion, whither I know not. 

I was surprised that when I came near my brother's 
door, which was in a place they called Swan Alley, 
I met three or four women witn high-crowned hats 
on their heads ; and, as I remembered afterwards, 
one, if not more, had some hats likewise in their 
hands ; but as I did not see them come out at my 
brother's door, and not knowing that mv brother had 
any such goods in his warehouse, I did not ofler to 
say anything to them, but went across the way to 
shun meeting them, as was usual to do at .that time, 
for fear of the plague. But when I came nearer to 
the gate, I met another woman with more hats come 
out of the gate. " What business, mistress," said I, 
'* have you had there P " " There are more people 
there," said she ; " I have had no more business there 
than they.** I was hasty to get to the gate then, and 
SEud no more to her, by which means she got away. 
But just as I came to the gate, I saw two more com- 
ing across the yard to come out with hats also on 
their heads and under their arms, at which I threw 
the gate to behind me, which having a spring lock 
fastened itself; and turning to the women, "For- 
sooth," said I, " what are you doing here P " and 
seized upon the hats, and took them from them.

One of them, who, I confess, did not look like a 
thief — " Indeed," says she, " we are wrong, butjwe 
were told they were goods that had no owner. Be 
pleased to take them again ; and look yonder, there 
are more such customers as we." She cried and 
looked pitifully, so I took the hats from her, and 
opened the gate, and bade them be gone, for I pitied 
the women indeed ; but when I looked towards the 
warehouse, as she dii'ected, there were six or seven 
more, all women, fitting themselves with hats, as un- 
concerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter's 
shop buying for their money, 

I was surprised, not at thc|sight of so many thieves 
only, but at the circumstances I was in ; being now 
to thrust myself in among so many people, who for 
some weeks had been so shy of myself, that if I met 
anybody in the street I would cross the way from 
them. 

They were equally surprised, though on another 
account. They all told me they were neighbours, 
that they had heard any one might take them, that 
they were nobody's goods, and the like. I talked 
big to them at first, went back to the gate and took 
out the key, so that they were all my prisoners, 
threatened to lock them aU into the warehouse, and 
go and fetch my Lord Mayor's officers for them. 

They beggea heartily, protested they found the 
gate open, and the warehouse door open ; and that 
it had no doubt been broken open by some who ex- 
pected to find goods of greater value, whidi indeed 
was reasonable to believe, oecause the lock was broke, 
and a padlock that hung to the door on the outside 
also loose, and not abundance of the hats carried 
away. 

At length I considered that this was not a time 

to be cruel and rigorous ; and besides that, it would 

necessarily oblige me to go much about, to have

several people come to me, and I go to several whose 
drcuntstaiices of health I knew nothing of; and that 
even at this time the plague was so high as that 
there died 4000 a week ; so that in showing my re- 
sentment, or even in seeking justice for my brother's 
goods, I might lose my own life ; so I contented my- 
self with taking the names and places where some of 
them lived, who were really inhaoitants in the neigh- 
bourhood, and threatening that my brother should 
call them to an account for it when he returned to 
his habitation. 

Then tl talked a little upon another foot with 
them, and asked thera how they could do such things 
as these in a time of such general calamity, and, as 
it were, in the Cace of God's most dreadful judgments, 
when the plague was at their very doors, and, it 
may he, in their very houses, and they did not know 
but that the dead-cart might stop at their doors in a 
few hour^ to carry them to their graves. 

I could not perceive that my discourse made much 
impression upon them all that while, till it happened 
that there came two men of the neighbournood, 
hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my brother, 
for they had been both dependents upon his fiunily, 
and they came to my assistance. These being, as I 
said, neighbours, presently knew three of the women, 
and told me who they were, and where they lived ; 
and, it seems, they had given me a true account of 
themselves before. 

This brings these two men to a further remem- 
brance. The name of one was John Hayward, who 
was at that time under-sexton of the parish of St 
Stephen, Coleman Street. Bv under-sexton was 
understood at that time graveaigger and bearer of 
the dead. This man carried, or assisted to carry, 
all the dead to their graves which were buried in 
that large parish, and who were carried in form, and

after that form of buiying was stopped, went with the 
dead-cart and the bell to fetch the dead bodies from 
the houses where they lay, and fetched many of thein 
out of the chambers and houses ; for the parish was, 
and is still, remarkable particularly, above all the 
parishes in London, for a gi-eat numner of alleys and 
thoroughfares, very long, into which no carts could 
come, and where uiey were obliged to go and fetch 
the bodies a very long way ; which alleys now remain 
to witness it, such as White's Alley, Cross Key Court, 
Swan Alley, Bell Alley, White Horse Alley, and 
many more. Here they went with a kind of hand- 
barrow and laid the d^ul bodies on it, and carried 
them out to the carts ; which work he performed and 
never had the distemper at all, but lived about twenty 
years after it, and was sexton of the parish to the 
time of his death. His wife at the same time was a 
nurse to infected people, and tended many that died 
in the parish, being for her honesty recommended by 



the parish officers, yet she never was infected neither. 

He never used any preservative against the infec- 
tion, other than holding garlic and rue in his mouth, 
and smoking tobacco. Iliis I also had from his own 
mouth. And his wife's remedy was washing her 
head in vinegar, and sprinkling her head-clothes so 
with vinegar as to keep them always moist ; and if 
the smell of any of those she waited on was more 
than ordinary oflensive, she snulfed vinegar up her 
nose and sprinkled vinegar upon her head-clothes, 
and held a handkerchief wetted with vintgar to her 
mouth. 

It must be confessed that though the plague was 
chiefly among the poor, yet were the poor the most 
venturous and fearless of it, and went about their 
employment with a sort of brutal courage ; I must 
call it BO, for it was founded neither on religion nor 
prudence; scarce did they use any caution, out ran

into any business which they could get employnient 
in, though it was the most hazardous. Such was 
that of tending the sick, watching houses shut up, 
carrying infected persons to the pest-house, and, 
which was still worse, carrying the dead away to 
their graves. 

It was under this John Hayward's care, and within 
his bounds, that the story of the piper, with which 
people have made thems^ves so nierry, happened, 
and he assured me that it was true. It is said that 
it was a blind piper; but, as John told me, the fiel- 
low was not blind, but an ignorant, weak, poor man, 
and usually walked his rounds about ten o'clock at 
night and went piping along from door to door, and 
the people usually took him in at public-houses 
where they knew him, and would give him drink and 
victuals, and sometimes farthings ; and he in return 
would pipe and sing and talk simply, which diverted 
the people ; and thus he lived. It was but a very 
bad time for this diversion while things were as I 
have told, yet the poor fellow went about as usual, 
but was almost starved ; and when anybody asked 
' how he did he would answer, the dead-cart had not 
taken him yet, but that they had promised to call 
for him next week. 

It happened one night l^at this poor fellow, 
whether somebody had given him too much drink or 
no — John Hay ward said he had not drink in his 
house, but that they had given him a little more 
victuals than ordinary at a public-house in Coleman 
Street — and the poor fellow, having not usually had 
a bellyful for perhaps not a good while, was laid alt 
along upon the top of a bulk or stall, and fast asleep, 
at a door in the street near London Wall, towards 
Crif^l^ate, and that upon the same bulk or stall 
the people of some house, in the alley of which the 
house was a comer, hearing a bell, which they always

rang before the cart came, had laid a body really 
dead of the plague just by him, thinking, too, that 
this poor fellow nad been a dead body, as the other 



i, and laid there hy some of the seighbours. 

Accordingly, when John Hayward with his bell 
and the cart came along, finding two dead bodies lie 
upon the stall, they took them up with the instru- 
ment they used and threw them into the cart, and all 
this while the piper slept soundly. 

From hence they passed along and took in other 
dead bodies, till, as honest John Hayward told me, 
they almost buried him alive in the cart ; yet all this 
while he slept soundly. At length the cart came to 
the place where the bodies were to be thrown into 
the ground, which, as I do remember, was at Mount 
Mill ; and as the cart usually stopped some time 
before they were ready to shoot out the melancholy 
load they had in it, as soon as the cart stopped the 
fellow awaked and strutted a little to get nis head 
out from among the deaa bodies, when, raising him- 
self up in the cart, he called out, *' Hey ! where am 
I?" This frighted the fellow that attended about 
the work ; but after some pause John Hayward, re- 
covering himself, said, "Lord, bless us! There's 
somebody in the cart not quite dead ! " So another 
called to him and said, " Who are you P " The fel- 
low answered, "I am the poor piper. Where am 
I?" "Where are you?" says Hayward. "Why, 
you are in the dead-cart, and we are going to bury 
you." "But I an't dead though, am I?" says the 
piper, which made them laugh a little, though, as 
John said, they were heartily frighted at first; so 
they helped the poor fellow down, and he went about 
his business, 

I know the story goes he set up his pipes in the 

cart and frichted the bearers and others so that they 

ran away ; but John Hayward did not tell the story

so, nor say anything of his piping at all ; but that 
he was a poor piper, and that he was carried away as 
above I am fully satisfied of the truth of. 

It is to be noted here that the dead-carts iu the 
city were not confined to particular parishes, but one 
cart went through several parishes, according as the 
number of dead presentea; nor were they tied to 
carry the dead to their respective parishes, but many 
of tne dead taken up in the city were carried to 
the burying-ground in the out-parts for want of 
room. 

I have already mentioned the surprise that this 
judgment was at first among the people. I must be 
allowed to give some of my observations on the more 
serious and religious part Surely never city, at least 
of this bulk and magnitude, was taken in a condition 
so perfectly unprepared for such a dreadful visita- 
tion, whether I am to speak of the civil preparations 
or religious. They were, indeed, as )f they had 
had no warning, no expectation, no apprehensions, 
and consequenUy the least pronsion imaginable was 
made for it in a public way. For example, the Lord 
Mayor and sherins had made no provision as ma^s- 
trates for the r^ulationa which were to be observed. 
They had gone into no measures for relief of the 
poor. The citizens had no public magazines or 
store-houses for com or meal for the subttistence of 
the poor, which if they had provided themselves, as 
in such cases is done abroad, many miserable families, 
who were now reduced to the utmost distress, would 
have been relieved, and that in a better manner than 
now could be done. 

The stock of the city's money I can say but little 
to. The Chamber of London was said to be exceed- 
ing rich, and it may be concluded that they were so, 
by the vast sums of money issued from thence in the 
rebuilding the public edifices after the fire of Lon-

don, and in building new works, such as, for the first 
part, the Guildhall, Blackwell Hall, part of Leaden- 
ball, half the Exchange, the Session House, the 
Compter, the prisons of Ludgate, Newgate &c, 
several of the vbarfe and stairs and landing-places on 
the river; all which were either burned down or 
damaged by the great (ire of London, the next year 
after the pWue ; and of the second sort, the Monu- 
ment, Fleet Ditch with its bridges, and the Hospi- 
tal of Bethlem or Bedlam, &c. But possibly the 
managers of the city's credit at that time made more 
conscience of breaking in upon the orphan's money 
to show charity to the distressed citizens than the 
managers in the following vears did to beautify the 
city and re-edify the buildings, though, in the first 
case, the losers would have thought their fortunes 
better bestowed, and the public faith of the city have 
been less subjected to scandal and reproach. 

It must be acknowledged that the absent citizens, 
who, though they were fled for safety into the coun- 
try, were yet great^ interested in the welfare of 
those whom they left behind, forgot not to contri- 
bute liberally to the relief of the poor, and lai^ 
sums were ^so collected among trading towns in 
the remotest parts of England ; and, as I nave heard 
also, the nobUity and the gentry in all parts of Eng- 
land took the deplorable condition of the city into 
their consideration, and sent up large sums of money 
in charity to the Lord Mayor and magistrates for the 
relief of the poor. The king also, as I was told, or- 
dered a thousand pounds a week to be distributed in 
fbur parts: one quarter to the city and liberty of 
Westminster ; one quarter or part among the inhabi- 
tants of the Southwark side of the water ; one 
quarter to the liberty and parts within of the city, 
exclusive of the city within tne walls ; and one-fourth 
part to the suburK in the county of Middlesex, and

the east and north parts of the city. But this latter 
I only speak of as a report. 

Certain it is, the greatest part of the poor or 
families who formerly lived by their labour, or by 
retail trade, lived now on charity; and had there 
not been prodigious sums of money given by char- 
itable, well-minded Christians for the support of 
such, the city could never have subsisted. There 
were, no question, accounts kept of their charity, 
and of the just distribution of it by the magistrates. 
But as such multitudes of those very officers died 
through whose hands it was distributed, and also 
that, as I have been told, most of the accounts of 
those things were lost in the great fire which hap- 
pened in the very next year, and which burnt even 
the chamberl^n's olHce and many of their papers, so 
I could never come at the particular account which 
I used great endeavours to nave seen. 

It may, however, be a direction in case of the 
approach of a like visitation, which God keep the 
city from ; — I say, it may be of use to observe that 
by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at 
that time in distributing weekly great sums of 
money for relief of the poor, a multitude of people, 
who would otherwise have perished, were relieved, 
and their lives preserved. And here let me enter 
into a brief state of the case of the poor at that 
time, and what way apprehended from them, from 
whence may be jutj^ed nereafter what may be ex- 
pected if the like distress should come upon the city. 

At the beeinnine of the plague, when there was 
now no more nope but that me whole city would be 
visited ; when, as I have said, all that had friends or 
estates in the country retired with their families ; 
and when, indeed, one would have thought the very 
city itself was running out of the gates, and that 
there would be nobody left behind ; you may be

sure from that hour all trade, except such as related 
to immediate subsistence, was, as it were, at a full 
stop. 

This is so lively a case, and contains in it so much 
of the real condition of the people, that I think I 
cannot be too particular in it, and therefore I de- 
scend to the several arrangements or classes of people 
who fell into immediate distress upou this occasion. 
For example : — 

1. All master-workmen in manufactures, especi&lly 
such as belonged to ornament, and the less necessary 

Krts of the people's dress, clothes, and furniture for 
uses, such as riband-weavers and other weavers, gold 
and silver lace makers, and gold and silver wire drawers, 
sempstresses, milliners, shoemakers, hatmakers, and 
glovemakers ; also upholsterers, joiners, cabinet-makers, 
]ook)ng>glass makers, and innumerable trades which 
depend upon such as these ; — I say, the master-work- 
men in such stopped their work, dismissed their jour- 
neymen and workmen, and all their dependents. 

S. As merchandising was at a full stop, for very few 
ships ventured to come up the river, and none at all 
went out, so all the cxtraottlinary ofRcers of the customs, 
likewise the watermen, carmen, porters, and all the 
poor, whose labour depended ujwn the merchants, were 
at once dismissed, and put out of business. 

3. All the tradesmen usually employed in building or 
repairing of houses were at a full stop, for the people 
were far from wanting to build houses when so many 
thousand houses were at once stripped of their inhabi- 
tants ; so that this one article turned all the ordinary 
workmen of that kind out of business, such as brick- 
layers, masons, carpenters, joiners, plasterers, painters, 
glaziers, smiths, plumbers, and all the labourers depend- 
ing on such. 

4. As navigation was at a stop, our ships neither 
coming in or going out as before, so the seamen were 
all out of employment, and many of them in the last

and lowest degree of distress ; and with the seamen 
were all the aeverai tradesmen and workmen belonging 
to and depending upon the building and fitting out of 
ships, such as ship-carpenters, caulkers, ropemakers, 
dry aMpcrs, sailmakers, anchorsmiths, and other smiths; 
blockmakera, carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship- 
carvers, and the hke. The masters of those perhaps 
might live upon their substance, but the traders were 
universally at a stop, and consequently all their work- 
men discharged. Add to these that the river was in a 
manner without boats, and all or most part of the water- 
men, lightermen, boat-builders, and lighter-builders, 
in like manner idle and laid by. 

5. All families retrenched their living as much as 
possible, as well those that fled as those that stayed ; so 
that an innumerable multitude of footmen, serving-men, 
shopkeepers, journeymen, merchants' bookkeepers, and 
such sort of people, and especially poor maid-servants, 
were turned off, and left friendless and helpless, with- 
out employment and without habitation, and this was 
really a dismal article. 

I might be more particular as to this part, but it 
may suffice to mention in general, all trades being 
stopped, employmeiit c«ased, the labour, and by that 
the bread, of the poor were cut off; and at first in- 
deed the cries of tne . poor were most lamentable to 
hear, though by the distribution of charity their 
misery that way vas greatly abated. Many indeed 
fled into the counties, but thousands of them having 
stayed in London till nothing but desperation sent 
them away, death overtook tbem on tne road, and 
they served for no better tban the messengers of 
death ; indeed, others carrying the infection along 
with them, spread it veiy unhappily into the re- 
motest parts of the kingaom. 

Many of these were the miserable objects of de- 
spair which I have mentioned before, and were re-

moved by the destruction which followed. These 
might be said to perish, not by the infection itself, 
but by the consequence of it ; indeed, namely, by 
hunger and distress, and the want of all things, 
being without lodging, without money, without 
friends, without means to get their bread, or with- 
out any one to give it them ; for many of them were 
without what we call l^al settlement, and so could 
not claim of the parishes, and all the support they 
had was by application to the magistrates for relief, 
which relief was (to give the mngistrates their due) 
carefully and cheerfully administered, as they found 
it necessary, and those that stayed behind never felt 
the want and distress of that kind, which they felt 
who went away in the manner above noted. 

Let any one who is acquainted with what multi- 
tudes of people get their daily bread in this city by 
their labour, whether artificci-s or mere workmen — I 
say, let any man consider what must be the misera- 
ble condition of this town if, on a sudden, they 
should be all turned out of employment, that labour 
should cease, and wages for work be no more. 

This was the case with us at that time ; and bad 
not the sums of money contributed in charity by 
well-disposed people of every kind, as well abroad as 
at home, been prodigiously great, it had not been in 
the power of the Lord Mayor and sheriffs to have 
kept the public peace. Nor were they without ap- 
prehensions, as it was, that desperation should push 
the people upon tumults, and cause them to rifle the 
houses of rich men and plunder the markets of provi- 
sions; in which case the country people, who brought 
provisions very freely and boldly to town, would have 
been terrified from coming any more, and the town 
would have sunk under an unavoidable famine. 

But the prudence of my Lord Mayor and the 

Court of Aldermen within the city, and of the justices 

[110]

of peace in the out-parts, was such, and they were 
supported with money from all parts so w^, that 
the poor people were kept quiet, and their wants every- 
where relieved, as far as was possible to be done. 

Two tilings besides this contributed to prevent the 
mob doing any mischief. One was, that really the 
rich themselves had not laid up stores of provisions 
in their houses, as indeed they ought to have done, 
and which if they had been wise enough to have done, 
and locked themselves entirely up, as some few did, 
they had perhaps escaped the disease better. But as 
it appeared they had not, so the mob had no notion 
of finding stores of provisions there if they had 
broken in, as it is plain they were sometimes veiy 
near doing, and which, if they bad, they had finished 
the ruin of the whole city, for there were no regular 
troops to have withstood them, nor could the trained 
bands have been brought together to defend the city, 
no men being to be found to bear arms. 

But the vigilance of the Lord Mayor and such 
magistrates as could be bad (for some, even of the 
aldermen, were dead, and some absent) prevented 
this ; and they did it by the most kind and gentle 
methods they could think of, as particularly by re- 
lieving the most desperate with money, and putting 
others into business, and particularly that employ- 
ment of watching houses that were infected and shut 
up. And as the number of these were very great, 
for it was said there was at one time ten tiiousand 
houses shut up, and every house had two watchmen 
to guard it, viz., one by night and the other by day, 
this gave opportunity to employ a very great number 
of poor men at a time. 

The women and servants that were turned off from 
their places were likewise employed as nurses to tend 
the sick in all places, and this took off a very great 
number of them.

And, which though a mekncholy article in itself, 
yet was a deliverance in its kind, namely, the plaeue, 
mindle 



which raged in a dreadful manner &om the mindle 
of August to the middle of October, carried off in 
that time thirty or forty thousand of these very 
people, which, had they been left, would certainly 
have heen an insufferable burden by their poverty ; 
that is to say, the whole city could not have sup- 
ported the expense of them, or have provided food 
for them ; and they would in time have been even 
driven to the necessity of plundering either the city 
itself or the country adjacent, to have subsisted them- 
selves, which would, firat or last, have put the whole 
nation, as well as the city, into the utmost terror and 
confusion. 

It was observable, then, that this calamity of the 
people made them very humble ; for now for about 
nine weeks hither there died near a thousand a 
day, one day with another, even by the account of 
the weekly bills, which vet, I have reason to be 
assured, never gave a full account, by many thou- 
sands, the confusion being such, and the carts working 
in the dark when they carried the dead, that in some 
places no account at all was kept, but they worked 
on, the clerks and sextons not attending tor weeks 
together, and not knowing what number Uiey carried. 
This account is verified by the following bills of 
mortality : —

So that the gross of the people were carried off in 
these two months ; for, as the whole number which 
was brought in to die of the plague was but 68,590, 
here is 50,000 of them, within a trifle, in two months ; 
I say 50,000, because, as there wants 295 in the 
number above, so there wants two days [nc] of two 
months in the account of time. 

Now, when I say that the parish oflicers did not 
give in a full account, or were not to be depended 
upon for their account, let any one but consider how 
men could be exact in such a time of dreadful dis- 
tress, and when many of them were taken sick them- 
selves, and perhaps died in the very time when their 
accounts were to be given in; I mean' the parish 
derks, besides inferior officers ; for though these 
poor men ventured at all hazards, yet they were far 
from being exempt from the common calamity, es- 
pecially if it be true that the parish of Stepney had, 
within the year, 116 sextons, gravediggers, and their 
assistants ; that is to say, Bearers, liellmen, and 
drivers of carts for carrying off the dead bodies. 

Indeed the work was not of a nature to allow them 
leisure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which 
were all huddled together in the dark into a pit; 
which pit or trench no man could come nigh but at 
the utmost peril. I observed often that in the 
parishes of Aldgate and Cripplegate, Whitecbapel 
and Stepney, there were five, six, seven, and eight 
hundrea in a week in the bills, whereas, if we may 
believe the opinion of those that lived in the city all 
the time as well as I, there died sometimes SOOO a 
week in those parishes ; and I saw it under the hand 
of one that made as strict an examination into that 
part as he could, that there really died an hundred 
thousand people of the plague in that one year, 
whereas in the bills, the articles of the plague, it was 
but 68,590.

If I may be allowed to give my opinion, by what 
I saw with my eyes and heard from other people that 
were eve-witnesses, I do verily believe the same, viz., 
that there died at least 100,000 of the plague only, 
besides other distempers, and besides those which 
died in the fields and highways and secret places out 
of thecompass of the communication, as it was called, 
and who were not put down in the bills, though th^ 
really belonged to the body of the inhabitants. It 
was known to us all that abundance of poor despair- 
ing creatures who had the distemper upon them, and 
were grown stupid or melancholy by their misery, as 
many were, wandered away into the fields and woods, 
and into secret, uncouth places, almost anywhere, to 
creep into a bush or hedge and die. 

Ine inhabitants of the villages adjacent would, 
in pity, carry them food, and set it at a distance, 
that tiiey might fetch i^ if they were able ; and 
sometimes they were not able, and the next time 
they went they should find the poor wretches lie 
dead and the food untouched. The number of these 
miserable objects were many, and I know so many 
that perished thus, and so exactly where, that I 
believe I could go to the very place and dig their 
bones up still ; for the country people would go and 
dig a hole at a distance from them, and then with 
long poles, and hooks at the end of them, drag the 
bodies into these pits, and then throw the earth in 
from as far as they could cast it, to cover them, tak- 
ing notice how the wind blew, and so coming on that 
side which the seamen call to windward, that the 
scent of the bodies might blow from them ; and thus 
great numbers went out of the world, who were never 
Known, or any account of them taken, as well within 
tbe bills of mortality as without.

lation of others, for I seldom walked into the fields,

except towards Bethnal Green and Hackney, or as 
hereafter. But when I did walk, I always saw a 
great many poor wanderers at a distance; but I 
could know little of their cases, for whether it were 
in the street or iu the fields, if we had seen anybody 
coming, it was a general method to walk away ; yet 
I believe the account is exactly true. 

As this puts me upon mentioning my walking the 
streets and fields, I cannot omit taking notice what 
a desolate place the city was at that time. The 
great street I lived in, which is known to be one of 
the broadest of all the streets of London, I mean 
of the suburbs as well as the liberties, all the side 
where the butchers lived, especially without the bars, 
was more like a green field than a paved street, and 
the people generally went in the middle with the 
horses and carts. It is true that the &rthest end 
towards Whitechapel Church was not all paved, but 
even the part that was paved was fiill of grass also ; 
but this need not seem strange, since the great streets 
within the city, such as Leanenhall Street, Bishops- 
gate Street, Comhill, and even the Exchange itself, 
had grass growing in them in several places ; neither 
cart or coach were seen in the streets from morning 
to evening, except some country carts to bring roots 
and beans, or peas, hay, and straw, to the market, 
and those but very few compared to what was usual. 
As for coat^hes, they were scarce used but to carry 
sick people to the pest-house, and to other hospitals, 
and some few to carry physicians to such places as 
they thought fit to venture to visit ; for really 
coaches were dangerous things, and people did not 
care to venture into them, bemuse they did not know 
who might have been carried in them last, and sick, 
infected people were, as 1 have said, ordinarily carried 
in them to the pest-houses, and sometimes people 
expired in them as they went along.

It is true, when the infection came to such a 
height as I have now mentioned, there were very few 
physicians which cared to stir abroad to sidi houses, 
and very many of the most eminent of the fiiculty 
were dead, as well as the surgeons also ; for now it 
was indeed a dismal time, and for about a month 
together, not taking any notice of the bills of mortal- 
il^, I beli«ve there did not die less than 1500 or 1700 
a day, one day with another. 

One of the worst days we had in the whole time, 
as I thought, was in the beginning of September, 
when, indeed, good people began to think that God 
was resolved to make a full end of the people in this 
miserable city. This was at that time when the 
^ague was niUy come into the eastern parishes. 
The parish of Aldgate, if I may give my opinion, 
buried above a thousand a week for two weeks, 
though the bills did not say so many ; — but it sur- 
rounded me at so dismal a rate that there was not a 
house in twenty uninfected in the Minones, in 
Houndsditch, and in those parts of Aldgate parish 
about the Butcher Row and the alleys over against 
me. I say, in those places death reigned in every 
comer. Whitechapel parish was in tlie same con- 
dition, and though much less than the parish I lived 
in, yet buried near 600 a week by the bills, and in 
my opinion near twice as many. Whole families, 
and indeed whole streets of families, were swept away 
together ; insomuch that it was frequent for neigh- 
bours to call to the bellman to go to such-and-such 
houses and fetch out the people, for that they were 
all dead. 

And, indeed, the work of removing the dead bodies 
by carts was now grown so very odious and danger- 
ous that it was complained of that the bearere did 
not take care to clear such houses where all the in- 
habitants were dead, but that sometimes the bodies 
[116]

lay several days unburied, till the neighbouring 
families were offended with the stench, and conse- 
quently infected ; and this ne^ect of the officers was 
such that the churchwardens and constables were 
summoned to look after it, and even the justices of 
the Hamlets were obliged to venture their lives 
among them to quicken and encourage them, for 
innumerable of the bearers died of the distemper, 
infected by the bodies they were obliged to come so 
near. And had it not been that the number of poor 
people who wanted employment and wanted bread 
(as I have said before) waa so great that necessity 
drove them to undertake anything and venture any- 
thing, they would never have found people to be 
empKiyed. And then the bodies of the dead would 
have uun above ground, and have perished and rotted 
in a dreadful manner. 

But the magistrates cannot be enough commended 
in this, that they kept such good order for the bury- 
ing of the dead, that as fast as any of those they 
employed to carry off and bury the dead fell sick or 
died, as was many times the case, they immediately 
supplied the places with others, which, by reason of 
the great number of poor that was left out of busi- 
ness, as above, was not hard to do. This occasioned, 
that notwithstanding the infinite number of people 
which died and were sick, almost all together, yet 
they were always cleared away and carried off every 
night, so that it was never to be said of London that 
the living were not able to bury the dead. 

As the desolation was greater during those terrible 
times, so the amazement of the people increased, and 
a thousand unaccountable things tney would do in 
the violence of their fright, as others did the same 
in the agonies of their distemper, and this part was 
very affecting. Some went roaring and crying and 
wringing their hands along the street ; some would

go praying and lifting up their hands to heaven, call- 
ing upon God for mercy. I cannot say, indeed, 
whether this was not in their distraction, but, be it 
so, it was still an indication of a more serious mind, 
when they had the use of their senses, and was much 
better, even as it was, than the frightful yellings and 
cryings that every day, and especially in the even- 
ings, were heard in some streets. I suppose the 
world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an 
enthusiast. He, though not infected at all out in 
his head, went about denouncing of judgment upon 
the city in a frightful manner, sometimes quite 
naked, and with a pan of burning charcoal on his 
head. What he said, or pretended, indeed I could 
not leam. 

I will not say whether that clergyman was distracted 
or not, or whether he did it in pure zeal for the poor 
people, who went every evening through the streets of 
Whitechapel, and, with his hands lilted up, repeated 
that part of the Liturgy of the Chureh continually, 
" Spare us, good Lord ; spare Thy people, whom 
Thou hast redeemed with Iny most precious blood." 
I say, I cannot speak positively of these things, be- 
cause these were only the dismal objects which repre- 
sented themselves to me as I looKed through my 
chamber windows (for I seldom opened the casements), 
while I confined myself within doors during that 
most violent raging of the pestilence ; when, indeed, 
as I have said, many began to think, and even to 
say, that there would none escape ; and indeed I be- 
gan to think so too, and therefore kept within doors 
for about a fortnight, and never stirred out. But I 
could not hold it. Besides, there were some people 
who, notwithstanding the danger, did not omit pub- 
licly to attend the worship of God, even in the most 
dangerous times ; and though it is true that a great 
many cleigymen did shut up their churches, and

fled, as other people did, for tlie safety of their lives, 
yet all did not do so. Some ventured to officiate 
and to keep up the assemblies of the people by con- 
stant prayeis, and sometimes sermons or brief ex- 
hortations to repentance and reformation, and this 
as long as any would come to hear them. And Dis- 
senters did the like also, and even in the very 
churches where the parish ministers were either dead 
or fled ; nor was there any room for making differ- 
ence at such a time as this was. 

It was indeed a lamentable thing to hear the 
miserable lamentations of poor dying creatures call- 
ing out for ministers to comfort them and pray with 
them, to counsel them and to direct them, calling 
out to God for pardon and mercy, and confessing 
aloud their past sins. It would make the stoutest 
heart bleed to hear how many warnings were then 
given by dying penitents to others not to put off 
and delay tneir repentance to the day of distress ; 
that such a time of calamity as this was no time for 
repentance, was no time to call upon God. I wish 
I could repeat the very sound of those groans and 
of those exclamations that I heard from some poor 
dying creatures when in the height of their agonies 
and aiatress, and that I could make him that reads 
this hear, as I imagine I now hear them, for the 
sound seems still to ring in my ears. 

If I could but tell this part in such moving ac- 
cents as should alarm the very soul of the reader, I 
should rejoice that I retarded those things, however 
short and imperfect. 

It pleased Grod that I was still spared, and very 
hearty and sound in health, but very impatient of 
being pent up within doois without air, as I have 
been for fourteen days or thereabouts, and I could 
not restrain myself, but I would go to carry a letter 
for my brother to the post-house. Then it was in-

deed that I observed a profound silence in the 
streets. When I came to the post-house, as I went 
to put in my letter, I saw a man stand in one comer 
of the yard and talking to another at a window, and 
a third had opened a door belonging to the office. 
In the middle of the yard lay a Gmall leather purse 
with two keys hanging at it, with money in it, but 
nohody would meddle with it I asked now long it 
had lain there ; the man at the window said it had 
lain almost an hour, but that they had not meddled 
with it, because they did not know but the person 
who dropp^ it might come back to look for it. I 
had no such need of money, nor was the sum so big 
that I had any inclination to meddle with it, or to 
get the money at the hazard it might be attended 
with ; so I seemed to go away, when the man who 
had opened the door said he would take it up, but 
so that if the right owner came for it he should be 
sure to have it. So he went in and fetched 1 pail of 
water, and set it down hard by the purse, then went 
again and fetched some gunpowder, and cast a good 
deal of powder upon the purse, and then made a 
train from that which he had thrown loose upon the 
purse. The train reached about two yards. After 
this he goes in a third time and fetches out a pair of 
tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, I suppose, 
on purpose, and first setting fire to the train of pow- 
der, that singed the purse, and also smoked the air 
su6Sciently. But he was not content with that, but 
he then takes up the purse with the tongs, holding 
it so long till the tongs burnt through the purse, 
and then he shook the money out into the pail of 
water, so he carried it in. The money, as I remem- 
ber, was about thirteen shillings and some smooth 
groats and brass farthings. 

There might perhaps have been several poor peo- 
ple, as I have observed above, that would nave been

hardy enough to have ventured for the sake of the 
money ; but you may easilv see by what I have 
observed that the few people who were spared were 
very careful of themselves at that time when the 
distress was so exceeding great. 

Much about the same time I walked out into the 
fields towards Bow ; for 1 had a great mind to see 
how things were managed in the river and among 
the ships ; and as I had some concern in shipping, 1 
had a notion that it had been one of the best ways 
of securing one's self from the infection to have re- 
tired into a ship; and musing how to satisfy my 
curiosity in that point, I turned awt^ over the fields 
from Bow to Bromley, and down to Blackwall to the 
stairs, which are there for landing or taking water. 

Here I saw a poor man walking on the bank, or 
sea-wall, as they call it, by himself I walked a 
while also about, seeing the nouses all shut up. At 
last I fell into some talk, at a distance, with this 
poor man ; first I asked him how people did there- 
abouts. " Alas, sir ! " says he, ** almost desolate ; 
all dead or sick. Here are very few families in this 
part, or in that village" (pointing at Poplar), 
" where half of them are not dead already, and the 
rest sick." Then he pointing to one house, " There 
they are all dead," said he, *'and the house stands 
open ; nobody dares go into iL A poor thief," says 
he, " ventured in to steal something, but he paid 
dear for his theft, for he was carried to the church- 
yard too last night." Then he pointed to several 
other houses. "There," says he, " they are all dead, 
the man and his wife, and five children. There," 
says he, ** they are shut up ; you see a watchman at 
the door ; " and so of other houses. " Why," says I, 
" what do you here all alone ? " " Why, says he, 
"I am a poor, desolate man ; it has pleased God I 
am not yet visited, though my family is, and one of

my children detuL" ** How do you mean, then," said 
if "titat you are not viaitedf "Why," says he, 
" that 'a my houae " (pointing to a very little, low- 
boatded house), " and there my poor wife and two 
children live," said he, " if they may be said to live, 
for my wife and one of the children are visited, but 
I do not come at them." And with that word I saw 
the tears run very plentifiilly down his face ; and so 
they did down mine too, I assure you. 

** But," said I, " why do you not come at tbem ? 
How can you abandon your own flesh and blood ? " 
" Oh, sir, says he, " the Lord forbid ! I do not 
abandon them ; I work for them as much as I am 
able ; and, blessed be the Lord, I keep them from 
want ;" and with that I observed he lifted up his 
eyes to heaven, with a countenance that presently 
told me I had happened on a man that was no 
hypocrite, but a senous, religious, good man, anc 
hi8 ejaculation was an expression of thankAilness 
that, in such a condition as he was in, he should be 
able to say his family did not want. " Well," says 
I, " honest man, that is a great mercy as things go 
now with the poor. But how do you live, then, and 
bow are you Itept from the dreadful calamity that 
is now upon us all ? " " Why, sir," says he, " I am 
a waterman, and there's my boat," says he, "and 
the boat serves me for a house. I work in it in the 
day, and I sleep in it in the night ; and what I get 
I lay down upon that stone," says he, showing me a 
broad stone on the other side of the street, a good 
way from his house ; ** and then," says he, " I halloo, 
and call to them till I make them hear ; and they 
come and fetch it." 

" Well, friend," says I, " but how can you get any 

money as a waterman P Does anybody go by water 

these times?" " Yes, sir," says ne, " in the way I 

am employed there does. Do you see there," says

he, " five ships lie at anchor '" (pointing down the 
river a good way below the town), " and do you see," 
says he, " eight or ten ships lie at the chain there, 
and at anchor yonder P " (pointing above the town). 
"All those ships have iamilies on board, of their 
merchants and owners, and such-like, who have locked 
themselves up and live on board, close shut in, for 
fear of the infection ; and I tend on them to fetch 
things for them, carry letters, and do what is abso- 
lutely necessary, that they may not be obliged to 
come on shore : and every night I &sten my boat on 
board one of the ship's boats, and thei-e I sleep by 
myself, and, blessed be God, I am preserved hitherto." 

" Well," said I, " friend, but will they let you come 
on board after you have been on shore here, when 
this is such a terrible place, and so infected as it is P " 

" Why, as to that," said he, " I very seldom go up 
the ship-side, but deliver what I bring to their boat, 
or lie by the side, and they hoist it on board. If I 
did, I think they are in no danger fittm me, for I 
never go into any house on shore, or touch anybody, 
no, not of my own family ; but I fetch provisions for 
them." 

" Nay," says I, " but that may be worse, for you 
must have those provisions of somebody or other; 
and since all this part of the town ia so infected, it 
is dangerous so much as to speak with anybody, for 
the viEage," said I, "is, as it were, the beginning of 
London, though it be at some distance from it." 

*' That is true," added he ; " but you do not under- 
stand me right ; I do not buy provisions for them 
here. I row up to Greenwich and buy fresh meat 
there, and sometimes I row down the river to Wool- 
wich and buy there ; then I go to single farm-houses 
on the Kentish side, where I am known, and buy 
fowls and eggs and butter, and bring to the ships, as 
they direct me, sometimes one, sometimes the other.

I seldom come on shore here, and I came now only to 
call to my wife and hear how my little family do, and 
give them a little monev, which I received last night" 

" Poor man ! " said 1 ; " and how much hast thou 
gotten for them ? " 

" I have gotten four shillings," said he, " which is 
a great sum, as things go now with poor men ; but 
they have given me a bag of bread too, and a salt 
fish and some flesh ; so ^1 helps out." 

" Well," said I, " and have you given it them yet ? " 

"No," said he ; *'but I have called, and my wife 
has answered that she cannot come out yet, but in 
half-an-hour she hopes to come, and I am waiting 
for her. Poor woman!" says he, "she is brought 
sadly down. She has a swelling, and it is broke, 
and I hope she will recover ; but I fear the child 
will die, out it is the Lord " 

Here he stopped, and wept very much. 

" Well, honest friend," said I, " thou hast a sure 
Comforter, if thou hast brought thyself to be resigned 
to the will of God ; He is dealing with us aU in 
judgment." 

" Oh, sir ! " says he, "it is infinite mercy if any of 
us are spared, and who am I to repine ! " 

"Sayest thou so?" said I, "and how much less is 
my faith than thine ?" And here my heart smote 
me, suggesting how much better this poor man^s 
foundation was on which he stayed in the danger 
than mine; that he had nowhere to fly ; that he had 
a family to bind him to attendance, wnich 1 had not ; 
and mine was mere presumption, his a true depend- 
ence, and a courage resting on God ; and yet that he 
used all possible caution for his safety. 

I turned a little way from the man while these 
thoughts engaged me, for, indeed, 1 could no more 
refrain from tears than he. 

At length, after some further talk, the poor woman

opened the door and called, " Robert, Robert." He 
answered, and bid her stay a few moments and he 
would come ; so he ran down the common stairs to 
his boat and fetched up a sock, in which was the 

Erorisions he had brought from the ships ; and when 
e returned he hallooed again. Then he went to 
the great stone which he showed me and emptied the 
sack, and laid all out, everything by themselves, and 
then retired ; and his wife came with a little boy to 
fetch them away, and he called and said such a cap- 
tain had sent such a thing, and such a captain such 
a thing, and at the ena adds, " Giod has sent it 
all ; give thanks to Him." When the poor woman 
had taken up oil, she was so weak she could not 
carry it at once in, though the weight was not much 
neither ; so she left the oiscuit, which was in a little 
bag, and left a little boy to watch it till she came 
again. 

** Well, but," says I to him, " did you leave her 
the foiu: shillings too, which you said was your week's 
pay?" 

" Yes, yes," says he ; " you shall hear her own it." 
So he calls again, " Rachel, Rachel," which, it seems, 
was her name, "did you take up the money?" 
"Yes," said she. "How much was it?" said he. 
"Four shillings and a groat," said she. "Well, 
well," says he, " the Lord Keep you all ; " and so he 
turned to go away. 

As I could not refnun contributing tears to this 
man's story, so neither could I refram my charity 
for his assistance. So I called him, " Hark thee, 
friend," said I, " come hither, for I believe thou art 
in health, that I may venture thee ; " so I pulled out 
my hand, which was in my pocket before, " Here," 
says I, "go and call thy Rachel once more, and give 
her a little more comfort from me. God will never 
forsake a family that trust in Him as thou dost"

So I gave him four other shillings, and bid him go 
lay them on the stone and call his wife. 

I have not words to express the poor man's thank- 
fulness, neither could he express it himself but by 
tears running down his face. He called his wife, 
and told her God had moved the heart of a stranger, 
upon hearing their condition, to give them all that 
money, and a great deal more sucn as that he said 
to her. The woman, too, made signs of the like 
thankAilness, as well to Heaven as to nie, and joy- 
fully picked it up ; and I parted with no money all 
that year that I thought better bestowed. 

I then Bsksd the poor man if the distemper had 
not reached to Greenwich. He said it had not till 
about a fortnight before ; but that then he feared it 
had, but that it was only at that end of the town 
which lay south towards Deptford Bridge ; that he 
went only to a butcher's shop and a grocer's, where 
he generally bought such things as they sent him 
for, but was very carefuL 

I asked him then how it came to pass that those 

Qle who had so shut themselves up in the ships 
not laid in sufficient stores of all things neces- 
sary. He said some of them had, but, on the other 
hand, some did not come on board till they were 
frighted into it, and till it was too dangerous for 
them to go to the proper people to lay in quantities 
of things, and that he waited on two ships, which he 
showed me, that had laid in little or nothing but 
biscuit bread and ship beer, and that he had bought 
everything else almost for them. I asked him if 
there was any more ships that had separated them- 
selves as those had done. He told me yes, all the 
way up from the point, right against Greenwich, to 
wiUiin the shore of Limehouse and KedrifT, all the 
ships that could have room rid two and two in 
the middle of the stream, and that some of them had

several fiunilies on board. I asked him if the dis- 
temper bad not readied them. He said he believed 
it had not, except two or three ships, whose people 
had not been so watchful to keep the seamen from 
going on shore, as others had been, and he said it 
was a very fine sif^t to see how the ships la; up the 
PooL 

When he said he waa going over to Greenwiidi as 
soon as the tide began to come in, I asked if he 
would let me go wiui him, and tm'ng me back, for 
that I had a gKBt mind to see how the ships were 
ranged, as he nad , told me. He told me, if I would 
assure him on the word of a Christian and of an 
honest man, that I had not the distemper, he would. 
I assured him that I had not ; that it had pleased 
God to preserve me ; that I lived in Whitechapel, but 
was too impatient of being so long within doors, and 
that I had ventured out so &r for the refreshment 
of a little air, but that none in my house had so 
much as been touched with it 

"Well, sir," says he, "as your charity has been 
moved to pity me and my poor family, sure you can- 
not have so httle pity left as to put yourself into my 
boat if you were not sound in nealtb, which would 
be nothing less than killing me, and ruining my 
whole &mily.** The poor man troubled me so mucn 
when he spoke of his family with such a sensible 
concern, and in such an afTectionate manner, that I 
could not satisfy myself at first to go at all. I told 
him I would lay aside my curiosity rather than make 
him uneasy, though I was sure, and very thankful 
for it, that I had no more distemper upon me than 
the f^hest man in the world. Well, fie would not 
have me put it off neither, but, to let me see how 
confident he was that I was just to him, now im- 
portuned me to go ; so when the tide came up to 
Lis boat I went in, and he carried me to Greenwich.

While he bought the things which he had in his 
charge to buy, I walked up to the top of the hill 
under which the town stands, and on the east side of 
the town, to get a prospect of the river. But it was 
a Eurprising sight to see the number of ships which 
lay in rows, two and two, and some places two or 
three such lines in the breadth of the river, and this 
not only up quite to the town, between tiie houses 
which we call Ratcliff and Redriff, which they name 
the Pool, but even down the whole river, as far as the 
head of Long Reach, which is as far as the hills give 
us leave to see it. 

I cannot guess at the number of ships, but I think 
there must be several hundreds of sail; and I could 
not but applaud the contrivance, for ten thousand 
people, and more, who attended ship alTairs were 
certainly sheltered here from the violence of the 
contagion, and lived very safe and very easy. 

I returned to my own dwelling very well satisfied 
with my day's journey, and particularly with the 
poor man ; also, I rejoiced to see that such little 
sanctuaries were provided for so many &milies in a 
time of such desolation. I observed dso, that as the 
violence of the plague had increased, so the ships 
which had families on board removed and went 
farther off, till, as I was told, some went quite away 
to sea, and put into such harbouT^ and safe roads on 
the north coast as they could best come at. 

But it was also true that all the people who thus 
lefl the lai]d and lived on board the ships were not 
entirely safe from the infection, for many died and 
were thrown overboard into the river, some in coffins, 
and some, as I heard, without coffins, whose bodies 
were seen sometimes to drive up and down with the 
tide in the river. 

But I believe J may venture to say that in those 

ships which were thus infet^ted it either happened

where the people had recourse to them too late, and 
did not fly to the ship till they had stayed too lotiK 
on shore and had the distemper upon them, though 
perhaps they might not perceive it, and so the dis- 
temper did not come to them on board the ships, bitt 
they really carried it with them ; or it was in these 
ships where the poor waterman said they had not 
had time to furnish themselves with provisions, but 
were obliged to send often on shore to buy what they 
had occasion for, or suffered boats to come to them 
from the shore. And so the distemper was brought 
insensibly among thero. 

And here I cannot but take notice that the strange 
temper of the people of London at that Ume contrib- 
uted extremely to their own destruction. The 
plague b^^, as I have observed, at the other end 
of the town, namely, in Long Acre, Dniry Lane, &c., 
and came on towards the city very gradually and 
slowly. It was felt at first in December, then again 
in February, then again in April, and always but a 
very little at a time ; then it stopped till May, and 
even the last week in May there was but seventeen, 
and all at that end of the town ; and all this while, 
even so long as till there died above 3000 a week, 
yet had the people in Redriff, and in Wapping and 
natctiff, on Doth sides the river, and almost all South- 
wark side, a mighty fancy that they should not be 
visited, or at l^st that it would not be so violent 
among them. Some people fancied the smell of the 
pitch and tar, and such other things as oil and rosin 
and brimstone, which is so much used by all trades 
relating to shipping, would preserve them. Others 
ai^ed it, because it was in its extremest violence in 
Westminster and the parish of St Giles and St. 
Andrew, &c., and b^an to abate again before it 
came among them, which was true indeed, in part.

N.B. — That it was observed the numbera men- 
tioned in Stepney parish at that time were generally 
all on that side where Stepney paiish joined ba 
Shoreditch, which we now call Spitalfields, where 
the parish of Stepney comes up to the very wall of 
Shoreditch Churchyard, and the plague at this time 
was abated at St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and raged 
most violently in Crippl^ate, Bishopsgate, and 
Shoreditch parishes ; but there was not ten people a 
week that died of it in all that part of Stepney 
parish which takes in Limehouse, RatcIiiF Highway, 
and which are now the parishes of Shadwell and 
Wapping, even to SL Catherine's by the Tower, till 
after the whole month of August was expired. But 
they paid for it afterwards, as I shall observe by- 
and-by. 

This, I say, made the people of RedrilF and Wap- 
ping, Ratcbff and Limehouse, so secure, and flatter 
themselves so much with the plague's going off with- 
out reaching them, that they took no care either to 
fly into the country or shut themselves up. Nay, so 
far were they from stirring that they rather received 
tbeir fnends fmd relations from the city into their 
houses, and several from other places really took

sanctuary in that part of the town as a place of 
safety, and as a place which they thougot God 
would pass over, and not visit as the rest was 
visited. 

And this was the reason that when it came upon 
them they were more surprised, more unprovided, and 
more at a loss what to do than they were in other 
places ; for when it came among them really and 
with violence, as it did indeed in Septemher and 
October, there was then no stirring out into the 
country, nobody would suffer a stranger to come 
near them, no, nor near the towns where they dwelt ; 
and, as I have been told, several that wandered into 
the country on Surrey side were found starved to 
death in the woods and commons, that country being 
more open and more woody than any other part so 
near London, especially about Norwood and the 
parishes of Camberwell, Dulwich, and Lusum, where, 
it seems, nobody durst relieve the poor distressed 
people for fear of the infection. 

This notion having, as I said, prevailed with the 
people in that part of the town, was in part the 
occasion, as I said before, that they had recourse to 
ships for their retreat ; and where they did this early 
and with prudence, Aimishing themselves so with 
provisions that they had no need to go on shore for 
supplies or suffer boats to come on Doard to bring 
them, — I say, where they did so they had certainly 
the safest retreat of any people whatsoever ; but the 
distress was such that people ran on board, in their 
fright, without bread to eat, and some into ships 
that had no men on board to remove them farther 
off, or to take the boat and go down the river to 
buy provisions where it might be done safely, and 
these often suffered and were infected on board as 
much as on shore. 

As the richer sort got into ships, so the lower rank

got into hoys, smacks, lighters, and fishing-boats ; 
and many, especially watermen, lay in their boats ; 
but those made sad work of it, especially the latter, 
for, going about for provision, and perhaps to get 
their su&istence, the infection got in among them 
and made a fearful havoc ; many of the watermen 
died alone in their wherries as they rid at their roads, 
as well above bridge as below, and were not found 
sometimes till they were not in condition for any- 
body to touch or come near them. 

Indeed, the distress of the people at this seafiuing 
end of the town was very deplorable, and deserved 
the greatest commiseration. But, alas ! this was a 
time when eve^ one's private safety lay su near them 
that they had no room to pity the distresses of 
others ; for every one had death, as it were, at his 
door, and many even in their femilies, and knew not 
what to do or whither to fly. 

This, I say, took away all compassion ; self-pre- 
servation, indeed, appeared here to be the firet law. 
For the children ran away from their parents as they 
languished in the utmost distress. And in some 

Slaoes, though not so frequent as the other, parents 
id the like to their children ; nav, some dreadful 
examples there were, and particuWly two in one 
week, of distressed mothers, raving and distracted, 
killing their own children ; one whereof was not far 
olF from where I dwelt, the poor lunatic creature not 
living herself long enough to be sensible of the sin 
of what she haa done, much less to be punished 
for it. 

It is not, indeed, to be wondered at, for the 
danger of immediate death to ourselves took away 
all bowels of love, all concern for one another. I 
speak in general, for there were many instances of 
immovable affection, pity, and duty in many, and 
some that came to my knowledge, that is to say, by

hearsay ; for I shall not take upon me to vouch the 
truth of the particulars. 

To introduce one, let me first mention that one of 
the most deplorable cases in all the present calamity 
was that of women with child, who, when they came 
to the hour of their sorrows and their pains come 
upon them, could neither have help of one kind or 
another ; neither midwife or neigbouring women to 
come near them. Most of the midwives were dead, 
especially of such as served the poor ; and many, if 
not all the midwives of note, were fled into the 
country ; so that it was next to impossible for a poor 
woman that could not pay an immoderate price to 
get any midwife to come to her, and if they did, 
those they could get were generally unskilful and 
ienorant creatures ; and the consequence of this was, 
that a most unusual and incredible number of women 
were reduced to the utmost disti-ess. Some were de- 
livered and spoiled by the rashness and ignorance of 
those who pretended to lay them. Childi-en without 
number were, I might say, murdered by the same, 
but a more justifiable ignorance, pretending they 
would save the mother, whatever became of the child ; 
and many times both mother and child were lost in 
the same manner ; and especially where the mother 
had the distemper, there nobody would come near 
tliem, and both sometimes perished. Sometimes the 
mother has died of the plague, and the infant, it 
may be, half bom, or bom but not parted from the 
mother. Some died in the very pains of their 
travail, and not delivered at all ; and so many were 
the cases of this kind that it is hard to judge of 
them. 

Something of it will appear in the unusual num- 
bers which are put into the weekly bills (though 
I am far from allowing them to be aole to give any- 
thing of a full account) under the articles of —

To the disparity of these numbers is to be con- 
sidered and allowed for, that, according to our usual 
opinion who were then upon the spot, there were 
not one-third of the people in the town during the 
months of August and September as were in the 
months of January and February. In a word, 
the usual number that used to die of these three

lliis inequality, I say, is exceedingly augmented 
when the numbers of people are considered. I pre- 
tend not to make any exact calculation of the num- 
bers of people which were at this time in the city, 
but I shall make a probable conjecture at that part 
by-and-by. What I have said row is to explain the 
misery of those poor creatures above, so that it might 
well be said, as in the Scripture, Woe be to those 
who are with child, and to those which ^ve suck in 
that day. For, indeed, it was a woe to them in 
particular. 

I was not conversant in many particular femilies 
where these things happened, but the outcries of the , 
miserable were heard aiar ofF. As to those who were 
with child, we have seen some calculation made ; S91 
women dead in child-bed in nine weeks, out of one- 
third part of the number of whom there usually died 
in that time but eighty-four of the same disaster. 
Let the reader calculate the proportion. 

There is no room to doubt but the misery of those 
that gave suck was in proportion as great. Our bills 
of mortality could give but little light in this, yet 
some it did. There were several more than usual 
starved at nurse, but this was nothing. The misery 
was where they were, fit^, starved for want of a 
nurse, the mother dying, and all the family and the 
infants found dead by them, merely for want ; and, if 
I may speak my opinion, I do oelieve that many 
hundreds of poor helpless infants perished in this 
[135]

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

manner. Secondly, not starved, but poisoned by 
the nurse. Nay, even where the mother has been 
nurse, and having received the infection, has poisoned, 
that is, infected the infant with her milk, even be- 
fore they knew they were infected themselves ; nay, 
and the in&nt has died in such a case before the 
mother. I cannot but remember to leave this 
admonition upon record, if ever such another dread- 
ful visitation should happen in this city, that all 
women that are with child or that give suck should 
be gone, if they have any possible means, out of the 
place, because their misery, if infected, will so much 
exceed all other peopleV 

I could tell here dismal stories of living infants 
being found sucking the breasts of their mothers. Or 
nurses, ailer they have been dead of the plague. Of 
a mother in the parish where I lived, who, having a 
child that was not well, sent for an apothecary to 
view the child ; and when he came, as the relation 
goes, was giving the child suck at her breast, and to 
all appearance was herself very well ; but when the 
apothecary came close to ber he saw the tokens upon 
that breast with which she was suckling the child. 
He was surprised enough, to be sure, but, not willing 
to ftight the poor woman too much, he desired she 
would give the child into his hand ; so he takes the 
child, and going to a cradle in the room, lays it 
in, and opening its cloths, found the tokens upon 
the child too, and both died before he could get 
home to send a preventive medicine to the father of 
the child, to whom he had told their condition. 
Whether the child infected the nurse-mother or the 
mother the child was not certain, but the last most 
likely. Likewise of a child brought home, to the 
parents from a nurse that had died of the plague, 
yet the tender mother would not refuse to take in 
her child, and laid it in her bosom, by which she 
[136]

A JOUBNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

was infected, and died with the child in her arms 
dead also. 

It would make the hardest heart move at the in- 
stances tiiat were frequently found of tender mothers 
tending and watching with their dear children, and 
even dying before them, and sometimes taking the 
distemper from them and dying, when the child for 
whom the affectionate heart had been sacrificed has 
got over it and escaped. 

The like of a tradesman in East Smithfield, whose 
wife was big with child of her first child, and fell 
in labour, having the plague upon her. He could 
neither get midwife to assist her or nurse to tend 
her, and two servants which he kept fled both from 
her. He ran frtim house to house li ke one distracted, 
but could get no help ; the utmost he could get was, 
that a watchman, who attended at an infected house 
shut up, promised to send a nurse in the morning. 
lite poor man, with his heart broke, went back, 
assisted his wife what he could, acted the part of 
the midwife, brought the child dead into the world, 
and his wife in about an hour died in his arras, where 
he held her dead body fast till the morning, when 
the watchman came and brought the nurse as he had 
promised ; and coming up the stairs, for he had left 
the door open, or only latched, they found the man 
sitting with his dead wife in his arms, and so over- 
whelmed with grief that he died in a few hours after, 
without any sign of the infection upon him, but 
merely sank under the weight of his grief, 

I have heard also of some who, on the death of 
their relations, have grown stupid with the insup- 
portable sorrow, and of one in particular, who was 
so absolutely overcome with the pressure upon his 
spirits that oy d^rees his head sank into his body, 
so between his shoulders, that the crown of his head 
was very httle seen above the bone of his shoulders ; 
(137]

and by d^rees, losing both voice and sense, his face, 
looking forward, lay against bis ooUar-bone, and 
could not be kept up any otberwise, unless held up 
by tbe hands of other people; and the poor man 
never came to himself again, but languished near a 
year in that condition, and died. Nor was he ever 
once seen to lift up his eyes or to look upon any 
particular object. 

I cannot undertake to give any other than a sum- 
mary of such passages as these, because it was not 
possible to come at the particulars, where sometimes 
the whole families where such things happened were 
earned off by the distemper. But there were innum- 
erable cases of this kind which presented to the eye 
and the ear, even in passing along the streets, as I 
have hinted above. Nor is it easy to give any story 
of this or that family which there was not divers 
parallel stories to be met with of the same kind. 

But as I am now talking of the time when the 
plague raged at the easternmost part of tbe town, 
how for a long time the people of those parts had 
flattered themselves that they should escape, and 
how they were surprised when it came upon them as 
it did; tar, indeed, it came upon them like an armed 
man when it did come; — I say, this brings me back 
to the three poor men who wandered from Wapping, 
not knowing whither to go or what to do, and whom 
I mentioned before ; one a biscuit-baker, one a sail- 
maker, and the other a joiner, all of Wapping or 
thereabouts. 

The sleepiness and security of that part, as I have 
observed, was such that they not only did not shift 
for themselves as others did, but they boasted of be- 
ing safe, and of safety being with them ; and many 
people fled out of the city, and out of the infected 
suburbs, to Wapping, RatclifT, Limehouse, Poplar, 
and such places, as to places c^ security ; and it is 
[138]

not at all unlikely that their doing this helped to 
bring the plague that way faster than it might other- 
wise nave come. For though I am much for people 
flying away, and emptying such a town as this, upon 
the nrat appearance of a uke visitation, and that all 
people who have any possible retreat should make 
use of it in time, ana be gone, yet I must say, when 
all that will fly are gone, those that are left, and 
must stand it, should stand stock-still where they 
are, and not shift from one end of the town or one 
part of the town to the other ; for that is the bane 
and mischief of the whole, and they carry the plague 
from house to bouse in their very clothes. 

Wherefore were we ordered to kill all the d(^ 
and cats, hut because as they were domestic animals, 
and are apt to run from house to house, and from 
street to street, so they are capable of carrying the 
effluvia or infectious steams of bodies infected even 
in their furs and hair P And therefore it was that, 
in the beginning of the infection, an order was pub- 
lished by the Lord Mayor, and by the magistrates, 
according to the advice of the physicians, that all 
the dogs and cats should be immediately killed, and 
an officer was appointed for the execution. 

It is incredible, if their account is to be depended 
upon, what a prodigious number of those creatures 
were destroyed. I think they talked of forty thou- 
sand dogs, and Ave times as many cat^ few houses 
being without a cat, some having several, sometimes 
five or six in a house. All possible endeavours were 
used, also, to destroy the mice and rats, especially 
the latter, by laying ratsbane and other poisons for 
them, and a prodigious multitude of them were also 
destroyed. 

I often reflected upon the unprovided condition 
that the whole body of the people were in at the 
first coming of this calamity upon them, and how it

was for want of timely entering into measures and 
managements, as well public aa private, that all the 
confusions that followed were brought upon us, and 
that such a prodigious number of people sank in that 
disaster, which, if proper steps had been taken, might. 
Providence concurring, have been avoided, and which, 
if [losterity think fit, they may take a caution and 
warning m>m. But I Audi come to this ptut again. 

I come bock to my three men. Their story has 
a moral in every part of it, and their whole conduct, 
and that of some whom they joined with, is a pattern 
for all poor men to follow, ot women either, if ever 
such a time comes again ; and if there was no other 
end in recording it, I think this a very just one, 
whether my account be exactly according to feet 
or no. 

Two of them are said to be brothers, the one an 
old soldier, but now a biscuit-baker; the other a 
lame sailor, but now a sailmaker ; the third a joiner. 
Says John the biscuit-baker one day to Thomas his 
brother, the sailmaker, "Brother Tom, what will 
become of us ? The plague grows hot in the dty, 
and increases this way. What shall we do f" 

"Truly," says Thomas, "I am at a great loss 
what to do, for I find if it comes down into Wapping 
I shall be turned out of my lodmng.^ And thus 
they began to talk of it beforehand. 

John. Turned out of your lodging, Tom ! If 
you are, I don't know who will take you in ; for 
people are so afraid of one another now, there's no 
getting a lodging anywhere. 

Thonum. Why, the people where I lodge are 
good, civil people, and have kindness enough for me 
too; hut tney say I go abroad every day to my 
work, and it will be dangerous; and they talk of 
locking themselves up and letting nobody come near 
them.

•/ioAn. Why, they are in the right, to be sure, if 
they resolve to venture staying in town. 

Thomtu. Nay, I might even resolve to stay within 
doors too, for, except a suit of sails that my master 
has in hand, and which I am just linishii^ I am like 
to get no more work a great while. There's no 
traoe stirs now. Workmen and servants are turned 
off everywhere, so that I might be glad to be locked 
up too ; but I do not see they will be willing to 
consent to that, any more than to the other. 

John. Why, what will you do then, brother ? 
And what shall I do? fori am almost as bad as you. 
The people where I lodge are all gone into the 
country but a maid, and she is to go next week, 
and to shut the house quite up, so that I shall be 
turned adrift to the wide world before you, and I 
am resolved to go away too, if I knew but where 
to go. 

Thomag. We were both distracted we did not go 
away at first ; then we might have travelled any- 
where. There 's no stirring now ; w^ shall be starved 
if we pretend to go out of town. They wont let us 
have victuals, no, not for our money, nor let us come 
into the towns, much less into their houses. 

John. And that which is almost bs bad, I have 
but little money to help myself with neither. 

Tfumuu. As to that, we might make shift. I 
have a little, though not much ; but I tell you 
there's no stirring on the road. I know a couple of 
poor honest men in our street have attempted to 
travel, and at Bamet, or Whetstone, or thereabout, 
the people offered to fire at them if they pretended 
to go forward, so they are come back again quite 
discouraged, 

John. I would have ventured their fire if I had 

been there. If I had been denied food for my 

money they should have seen me take it before tbeur

faces, and if I had tendered money for it they could 
not have taken any course with me by law. 

TTumuu. You talk your old soIdier^s lanjifuage, as 
if you were in the Low Countries now, but this is 
a serious thing. The people have good reason to 
keep anybody off that they are not satisfied are 
sound, at such a time as this, and we must not 
plunder them. 

J<An. No, brother, you mistake the case, and 
mistake roe too. I would plunder nobody ; but for 
any town upon the road to deny me leave to pass 
through the town in the open highway, and deny me 
provisions for my money, is to say the town has a 
right to starve me to death, which cannot be true. 

Thomas, But they do not deny you liberty to go 
back again from whence you came, and therefore they 
do not starve you. 

John. But the next town behind me will, by the 
same rule, deny me leave to go back, and so they do 
starve me between them. Besides, there is no law to 
prohibit my travelling wherever I will on the road. 

TTionuu. But there will be so much difBculty in 
disputing with them at every town on the road that 
it IS not for poor men to do it or undertake it, at 
such a time as this is especially. 

John. Why, brother, our condition at this rate is 
worse than anybody else^s, for we can neither go 
away nor stay here. I am of the same mind with 
the lepers of Samaria. If we stay here we are sure 
to die ; I mean especially as you and I are stated, 
without a dwelling-house of our own, and without 
lodging in anybody else's. There is no lying in the 
street at such a time as this ; we had as good go into 
the dead-cart at once. Therefore I say, if we stay 
here we are sure to die, mid if we go away we can 
but die ; I am resolved to be gone. 

TTiomas. You will go away. Whither will you

go, and vhat can you do P I would as willingly go 
away a« you, if I knew whither. But we have no 
acquaintance, no friends. Here we were bom, and 
here we must die. 

John. Look you, Tom, the whole kingdom is 
my native country as well as this town, "^u may 
as well say I must not go out of my house if it la 
on (ire as that I must not go out of the town I was 
bom in when it is infected with the plague. I was 
bom in England, and have a right to live in it if I 
can. 

Thomtu. But yon know every vagrant person may, 
by the laws of England, be taken up, and passed 
rack to their last legal settlement. 

John. But how shall they make me vagrant i* I 
desire only to travel on, upon my lawful occasions. 

Thomas. What lawful occasions can we pretend to 
travel, or rather wander uponP They will not be 
put off with words. 

John. Is not flying to save our lives a lawful 
occasion P And do they not all know that the fact 
is true ? We cannot be said to dissemble. 

Thomas. But suppose they let us pass, whither 
shall we goP 

John. Anywhere to save our lives ; it is time 
enough to consider that when we are got out of this 
town. If I am once out of this dreadful place, I care 
not where I go, 

Thomas. We shall be driven to great extremities. 
I know not what to think of it. 

John. Well, Tom, consider of it a little. 

This was about the banning of July ; and though 
the plague was come forward in the west and north 
parts of the town, yet all Wapping, as I have 
observed before, and Redriff, and Ratcliff, and Lime- 
house, and Poplar, in short, Deptford and Green- 
wich, all both sides of the river from the Hermitage,

and from over against it, quite down to Bladcwall, 
was entirely fiee ; there had not one person died of 
the plague in all Stepney parish, and not one on the 
soutn side of Wbitechapel Road, no, not in any 
parish ; and yet the weekly bill was that very week 
risen up to 1006. 

It was a fortnight after this hefore the two brothers 
met again, and then the case was a little altered, and 
the plague was exceedingly advanced and the number 
greatly increased ; the bill was up at 2785, and pro- 
digiously increasing, though still both sides of the 
river, as below, kept pretty well. But some b^an 
to die in Redriff, and about live or six in RatclifT 
Highway, when the sailmaker came to his brother 
John express, and in some fright ; for he was abso- 
lutely warned out of bis lodging, and had only a 
week to provide himself. His brother John was in 
as bad a case, for he was quite out, and had only 
begged leave of his master, the biscuit-baker, to lodge 
in an out-hoiise belonging to his work-house, where 
he only lay upon straw, with some biscuit-sacks, or 
bread-saclcs, as they called them, laid upon it, and 
some of the same sacks to cover him. 

Here they resolved, seeing all employment being 
at an end, and no work or wages to be had, they 
would make the best of their way to get out of the 
reach of the dreadiiil infection, and, being as good 
husbands as tbey could, would endeavour to live upon 
what they had as long as it would last, and then 
work for more, if they could get work anywhere, of 
any kind, let it be what it would. 

While they were considering to put this resolution 
in practice in the beat manner they could, the third 
man, who was acquainted very well with the sail- 
maker, came to know of the design, and got leave to 
be one of the number ; and thus they prepared to 
set out

It happened that they had not an equal share of 
money, but as the saihnaker, who had the best atock, 
was, besides his being lame, the most unfit to expect 
to get anything by working in the country, so he was 
content that what money ^ey had should all go into 
one public stock, on condition that whatever any one 
of them could gain more than another, it should, 
without any grudging, be all added to the public 
stock. 

They resolved to load themselves with as little 
baggage as possible, because they resolved at first 
to travel on foot, and to go a great way, that they 
might, if possible, be effectually sale; and a great 
many consultations they had with themselves before 
they could agree about what way they should travel, 
which they were so far from adjusting that even to 
the mommg they set out they were not resolved 
on it. 

At last the seaman put in a hint that determined 
it. ''First," says he, '* the weather is very hot, and 
therefore I am for travelling north, that we may not 
have the sun upon our faces and beating on our 
breasts, which will heat and suffocate us ; and I have 
been told," says he, " that it is not good to overheat 
our blood at a time when, for aught we know, the 
infection may be in the very air. In the next place," 
says he, " I am for going the way that may be con- 
trary to the wind, as it may blow when we set out, 
that we may not have the wind blow the air of the 
dty on our backs as we go." These two cautions 
were approved of, if it could be brought so to hit 
that the wind might not be in the south when they 
set out to go nortn. 

John the baker, who had been a soldier, then put 

in his opinion. " First," says he, " we none of us 

expect to get any lodging on the road, and it will 

be a little too hard to lie just in the op«Q fiir.

Though it be warm weather, jet it may be wet and 
damp, and we have a double reason to ti^e care of 
our nealths at such a time as this ; and therefore," 
aa.ys he, " vou, brother Tom, that are a sailmaker, 
might easily make us a little tent, and I will under- 
take to set it up every night, and take it down, and 
a fig for all the inns in England ; if we have a good 
tent over our heads we shall do well enough." 

The joiner opposed this, and told them, let them 
leave that to him ; he would undertake to build them 
a house every night with his hatchet and mallet, 
though he had no other tools, which should be folly 
to their satisfaction, and as good as a tent. 

The soldier and the joiner disputed that point some 
time, but at last the soldier earned it for a tent. The 
only objection against it was, that it must be carried 
with them, and that would increase their baggage too 
much, the weather being hot ; but the sailmaker had 
a piece of good hap felTin which made that easy, for 
his master whom he worked for, having a rope-walk 
as well as sailmaking trade, had a litt^, poor horse 
that he made no use of then, and being willing to 
assist the three honest men, he gave them the horse 
for the carrying their baggage ; also for a small 
matter of three days' work that his man did for him 
before he went, he let him have an old top-gallant 
sail that was worn out, but was sufficient and more 
than enough to make a very good tent. The soldier 
showed how to shape it, and they soon by his direc- 
tion made their tent, and fitted it with poles or 
staves for the purpose ; and thus they were nimished 
for their journey, viz., three men, one tent, one 
horse, one gun, for the soldier would not go without 
arms, for now he said he was no more a biscuit-baker, 
but a trooper. 

The joiner had a small bag of tools, such as might 
be useful if he should get any work abroad, as well

^r their subsistence as his own. What money they 
had they brought all into one public stock, and thus 
they began their journey. It seems that in the 
morning when they set out the wind blew, as the 
sailor said, by his pocket-compass, at N.W. by W. 
So they directed, or rather resolved to direct, their 
course N.W- 

But then a difficulty came in their way, that, as 
they set out irom the hither end of Wapptng, near 
the Hermitage, and that the plague was now very 
violent, especially on the north side of the city, as in 
Shoreditch and Cripplegate parish, they did not 
think it safe for them to go near those parts; so 
they went away east through RatclifF Highway as far 
as RatctifT Cross, and leaving Stepney Church stilt 
on their left hand, being afraid to come up from 
Ratcliff Cross to Mile End, because they must come 
just by the churchyard, and because the wind, that 
seemed to blow more &om the west, blew directly 
from the side of the city where the plague was 
hottest. So I say, leaving Stepney, they fetched a 
long compass, and going to Poplar and Bromley, 
came into the great road just at Bow. 

Here the watch placed upon Bow Bridge would 
have questioned them, but they, crossing the road 
into a narrow way that turns out of the nither end 
of the town of Bow to Old Ford, avoided any inquiry 
there, and travelled to Old Ford. The constables 
everywhere were upon their guard, not so much, it 
seems, to stop people passing by as to stop them 
from taking up their abode in their towns, and 
withal because of a report that was newly raised at 
that time, and that, indeed, was not wry improbable, 
viz., that the poor people in London, hemg distressed 
and starved for want of work, and by that means for 
want of bread, were up in arms and had raised a 
tumult, and that they would come out to all the

towns round to plunder for bread. This, I say, was 
only a rumour, and it was very well it was no more. 
But it was not so far off ^m being a reality as it 
has been thought, for in a few weeks more the poor 
people became so desperate by the calamity they 
BufKred that they were with great difficulty kept 
from running out into the fields and towns, and tear- 
ing all in pieces wherever they came ; and, as I have 
observed before, nothing hindered them but that 
the plague raced so violently, and fell in upon them 
so] furiously, that they rather went to the grave by 
thousands than into the fields in mobs by thousands ; 
for, in the parts about the parishes of St. Sepulchre, 
Clerkenwell, Crippl^ate, Bishopsgate, and Shore- 
ditch, which were the places where the mob Iwan 
to threaten, the distemper came on so furiously that 
there died in those few parishes even then, before the 
plague was come to its height, no less than 5S61 
people in the first three weeks in August, when, at 
the same time, the parts about Wapping, Ratcliff, 
and Rotherhithe wa«, as before described, hardly 
touched, or but very lightly ; so that, in a won^ 
though, as I said before, the good management of 
the Lord Mayor and justices did much to pre^'ent 
the rage and desperation of the people from break- 
ing out in rabbles and tumults, and, in short, from 
the poor plundering the rich, — I say, though they 
did much, tbe dead-carts did more, for as I have 
said that in five parishes only there died about 6000 
in twenty days, so there might be probably three 
times that number sick all that time, for some re- 
covered, and great numbers fell sick every day and 
died afterwards. Besides, I must still be allowed to 
say that if the bills of mortality said five thousand, 
I always believed it was near twice as many in reality, 
tha« being no room to believe that the account they 
gave was right, or that, indeed, they were, among

such confusions as I saw tbem in, in any condition to 
keep ail exact account. 

But to return to my travellers^ Here they were 
only examined, and as they seemed rather coming 
from the country than from the city, they found the 
people the easier with them; that they talked to 
them, let them come into a public-house where the 
constable and his warders were, and gave them drink 
and some victuals, which greatly refreshed and en- 
couraged them ; and here it came into their beads to 
say, when they should be inquired of afterwards, not 
tiat they came &om London, luit that they came 
out of Essex. 

To forward this little fraud, they obtained so 
much favour of the constable at Old Fotd as to give 
tbem a certificate of their passing from Essex through 
that village, and that they had not been at London, 
which, though false in the common acceptation of 
London in the county, yet was literally true, Wap- 

Eing or RatcUBF being no part either of the city or 
bertjr. 

This certificate directed to the next constable that 
was at Homerton, one of the hamlets of the parish 
of Hackney, was so serviceable to them that it pro- 
cured them, not a free passage there only, but a full 
certificate of health from a justice of the peace, who, 
upon the constable's application, granted it without 
much difGculty; and tnus they passed through the 
long divided town of Hackney (for it lay then in 
several separated hamlets)^ and travelled on till they 
came into the great north road on the top of Stam- 
ford HiU. 

By this time they be^an to be weary, and so in 
the back -road from Hackney, a little before it opened 
into the said great road, tbey resolved to set up 
their tent and encamp for the first night, which they 
did accotdinely, with this addition, that finding a

bam, or a building like a bam, and fii^t searching 
as well as they could to be sure there was nobody in 
it, they set up their tent, with the head of it gainst 
the bain. Iiiis they did also because the wind blew 
that night very high, and they were but young at 
such a way of lodging, as well as at the managing 
their tent. 

Here they went to sleep ; but the joiner, a grave 
and sober man, and not pleased with their lying at 
this loose rate the first night, could not sleep, and 
resolved, after trying to sleep to no purpose, that he 
would get out, and, taking the gun in his hand, 
stand sentinel and guard his companions. So, with 
the gun in his hand, he walked to and again before 
the bam, for that stood in the field near the road, 
but within the hedge. He had not been long upon 
the scout but he heard a noise of people coming on, 
as if it had been a great number, and they t^me on, 
as he thought, directly towards the bam. He did 
not presenuy awake his companions, but in a few 
minutes more, their noise growing louder and louder, 
the biscuit-baker called to him and asked him what 
was the matter, and quickly started out too. The 
other, being the lame sailmaker and most weary, lay 
still in the tent 

As they expected, so the people whom they had 
heard came on directly to the b^, when one of our 
travellers challenged, like soldiers upon the guard, 
with "Who comes there?" The people did not 
answer immediately, but one of them speaking to 
another that was bebind him, " Alas ! alas ! we are 
all disappointed,^ says he. ** Here are some people 
before us ; the bam is taken up." 

They all stopped upon that, as under some sur- 
prise, and it seems there was about thirteen of them 
in all, and some women among them. They con- 
sulted tf^ther what tliey shoiud do, and by their

discourse our traTellera soon found they were poor, 
distressed people too, like themselves, seeking shelter 
and safety ; and besides, our travellers had do need 
to be afraid of their coming up to disturb them, for 
as soon as they heard the words, " Who comes there?^ 
these could hear the women say, as if frighted, '* Do 
not go near them. How do you know but they may 
have the plague P" And when one uf the men said, 
" Let us out speak to them," the women said, " No, 
don't by any means. We have escaped thus far by 
the goodness of God ; do not let us run into danger 
now, we beseech you," 

Our travellers found by this that they were a good, 
sober sort of people, and flying for their lives, as 
they were ; and, as they wei-e encouraged by it, so 
John said to the joiner, his comrade, *' Let us en- 
courage them too as much as we can ;" so he called 
to them, " Hark ye, good people," says the joiner, 
" we find by your t^k tliat you are flying from the 
same dreadnu enemy as we are. Do not be afraid of 
us ; we are only three poor men of us. If you are 
free from the distemper you shall not be hurt by us. 
We are not in the bam, but in a little tent here in 
the outside, and we will remove for you ; we can set 
up our tent again immediately anywhere else ■," and 
upon this a parley began between the joiner, whose 
name was Richard, and one of their men, who said his 
name was Ford. 

Ford. And do you assure us that you are all 
sound menP 

Richard. Nay, we are concerned to tell you of it, 
that you may not be imeasy or think yourselves in 
danger; but you see we do not desire you should 
put yourselven into any danger, and therefore I tell 
you that we have not made use of the barn, so we 
will remove from it, that you may be safe and we

Ford, That is very kind and charitable ; but if we 
have reason to be satisJied that you are sound and free 
from the visitation, wby should we make you remove 
now you are settled in your lodging, and, it may be, 
are laid down to rest P We will go into the bam, if 
you please, to rest ourselves a while, and we need not 
disturb you. 

Hidiard, Well, but you are more than we are. 
I hope you will assure us that you are all of you 
sound too, for the danger is as great from you to us 
as from us to you. 

Ford, Blessed be Grod that some do escape, though 
it is but few ; what may be our portion still we know 
not, but hitherto we are preserved. 

Richard. What part of the town do you come 
from P Was the plague come to the places where 
you lived P 

Ford. Ay, ay, in a most frightful and terrible 
manner, or else we had not fled awav as we do; 
but we believe there will be very few left alive be- 
hind us. 

Michord. What part do you come from P 

Ford. We are most of us of Cnpplegate parish, 
only two or three of Clerkenwell parish, but on the 
hither ^de. 

Richard. How then was it that you came away no 
sooner P 

Ford. We have been away some time, and kept 
tcwetber as wdl as we could at the hither end of 
Islington, where we got leave to lie in an old unin- 
habited house, and had some bedding and conveni- 
ences of our own that we brought wiUi us ; but the 
Slague is come up into Islington too, and a house next 
oor to our poor dwelling was infected and shut up, 
and we are come away in a fright.

whither, but God will guide those that look up to 
Him. 

They parleved no further at that time, but came 
.all upto the oam, and with some difficulty got into 
it. There was nothing but hay in the bam, but it 
was almost full of that, and they accommodated 
themselves as well as they could, and went to rest ; 
but our travellei-s observed that before they went to 
sleep an ancient man, who, it seems, was father of 
one of the women, went to prayer with all the 
company, recommending themselves to the blessing 
and directiou of Providence, before they went to 
sleep. 

It was soon day at that time of the year, and as 
Richard the joiner had kept guard the first part of 
the ni^t, so John the soldier relieved him, and he 
had the post in the muming, and they began to be 
a(X]uainted with one another. It seema when they 
left Islington they intended to have gone north, 
away to Highgate, but were stopped at Holloway, 
and there tney would not let them pass ; so they 
crossed over the fields and hilb to the eastward, and 
came out at the Boarded River, and so avoiding the 
towns, they left Hornsey on the left hand and New- 
ington on the right band, and came into the great 
road about Stamford Hilt on that side, as the three 
travellers had done on the other side. And now 
they had thoughts of going over the river in the 
marshes, and make forwards to Epping Forest, where 
they hoped they should get leave to rest. It seems 
they were not poor, at least not so poor as to be in 
want ; at least they had enough to subsist them 
moderately for two or three months, when, as they 
said, they were in hopes the cold weather would 
check the infection, or at least the violence of it 
would have spent itself, and would abate, if it were 
only for want of people left alive to be infected.

This was much the fate of our three travellers, 
only that they seemed to be the better furnished fot 
travelling, and had it in their view to go farther off; 
for as to the first, they did not propose to go farther 
than one day's journey, that so they might have 
intelligence eveiy two or three days how things 
were at London. 

But here our travelleis found themselves under an 
unexpected inconvenience, namely, that of their 
horse, for by means of the horse to carry their bag- 
eige they were obliged to keep in the road, whereas 
the people of this other band went over the fields or 
roads, path or no path, way or no way, as they 
pleased ; neither had they any occasion to pass 
through any town, or come near any town, other 
than to buy such things as they wanted for their 
necessary subsistence, and in that indeed they were 
put to much difficulty ; of which in its place. 

But our three travellers were ohligea to keep the 
road, or else they must commit spoil, and do the 
country a great deal of damage in breaking down 
fences and gates to go over enclosed fields, which 
they were loath to do if they could help it 

Our three travellers, however, had a great mind to 
join themselves to this company and take their lot 
with them ; and after some discourse they laid aside 
their first design which looked northward, and re- 
solved to follow the other into Essex ; so in the 
morning they took up their tent and loaded their 
horse, and away they travelled all together. 

^ey had some difficulty in passing the ferry at 
the river-side, the ferryman being afraid of them ; 
but after some parley at a distance, the ferryman 
was content to Imng his boat to a place distant from 
the usual ferry, and leave it there for them to take 
it ; so putting themselves over, he directed them to 
leave the boat, and he, having another boat, said he

would fetch it again, which it seems, however, he did 
not do for above eight days. 

Here giving the ferryman money beforehand, they 
had a supply of victuals and drinl^ which he brought 
and left m the boat for them, but not without, as I 
Raid, having received the mmiey beforehand. But 
now our travellers were at a great loss and difficulty 
how to get the horse over, the boat being small 
and not fit for it, and at last could not do it with- 
out unloading the baggage and making him swim 
over. 

From the river they travelled towards the forest, 
but when tbey came to Wolthamstow the people of 
that town denied to admit them, as was the case 
everywhere. The constables and their watchmen 
kept them off at a distance and parleyed with them. 
They gave the same account of themselves as before, 
but these gave no credit to what they said, giving it 
for a reason that two or three companies had already 
come that way and made the like pretences, but 
that they had given several people the distemper in 
the towns where they had passed, and had been after- 
wards so hardly used by the country, though with 
justice too, as they had deserved, that about Brent- 
wood, or that way, several of them perished in the 
fields, whether of the plague or of mere want and 
distress they could not t^. 

This was a good reason indeed why the people of 
Walthamstow should he very cautious, and why they 
should resolve not to entertain anybody that they 
were not well satisfied o£ But, as Richaid the joiner 
and one of the other men who parleyed with them 
told them, it was no reason why they should block 
up the roads and refuse to let people pass through 
the town, and who asked nothing of them but to go 
through the street ; that if their people were afraid 
of them, they might go into their houses and shut

their doors ; they would neither show them civility 
nor incivility, but go on about their business. 

The constables and attendants, not to be per- 
suaded by reason, continued obstinate, and would 
hearken to nothing, so the two men that talked with 
them went back to their fellows to consult what was 
to be done. It was very discouraging in the whole, 
and they knew not what to do for a good while ; but 
at last John the soldier and hiscuit^baker, considei*- 
ing a while, " Come," says he, " leave the rest of the 
parley to me." He had not appeared yet, so he sets 
the joiner, Richard, to work to cut some poles out 
of the trees and shape them as like guns as be could, 
and in a Uttle time he had five or six fair muskets, 
which at a distance would not be known ; and about 
the part where the lock of a gun is be caused tbem 
to wrap cloth and rags such as they had, as soldiers 
do in wet weather to preserve the locks of their pieces 
from rust ; the rest was discoloured with day or mud, 
such as they could get ; and all this while uie rest of 
them sat under the trees by bis direction, in two or 
three bodies, where they made 6res at a good distance 
from one another. 

While this was doing he advanced himself and two 
or three with him, ana set up their tent in the lane 
within sight of the barrier which the town's men had 
made, and set a sentinel just by it with the real gun, 
the only one they had, and who walked to and fro 
with the gun on his shoulder, so as that the people 
of the town might see tbem. Also, he tied the horse 
to a gate in the hedge just by, and got some dry 
sticks ti^ther and kindled a fire cut the other side 
of the tent, so that the people of the town could see 
the lire and the smoke, but could not see what they 
were doing at it 

After the country people had looked upon them

could see, could not but suppose that they were a 
great many in company, they began to be uneasy, 
not for their going away, but for staying where they 
were ; and above all, perceiving they haa horses and 
arms, for they had seen one horse and one gun at the 
tent, and they had seen others of them walk about 
the field on the inside of the hedge by the side of 
the lane with their muskets, as they took them to 
be, shouldered ; I say, upon such a sight as this, 
you may be assured they were alarmed and terribly 
irighted, and it seems they went to a justice of the 
peace to know what they should do. What the jus- 
tice advised them to I know not, but towards the 
evening they called from the barrier, as above, to 
the sentinel at the tent 

"What do you want?" says Joho.^ 

" Why, what do you iutend to do P " says the 
constable.

to do?" 

Constable. Why don''t you be gone ? What do you 
stay there for ? 

John. Why do you stop us on the king^s highway, 
and pretend to refuse us leave to go on our way ? 

Constable. We are not bound to tell you our 
reason, though we did let you know it was because of 
the plague. 

John. We told vou we were all sound and free 
from the plague, which we were not bound to have 
satisfied you of, and yet you pretend to stop us on 
the highway.

king's highway; ^tis a way upon aufTenince. You 
see nere is a gate, and if we do let people pass here, 
we make them pay toll. 

John. We have a right to seek our own safety as 
well as you, and you may see we are flying for 
our lives, and ^is very unchristian and unjust to 
stop us. 

Constable. You may go back from whence you 
came ; we do not hinder you from that. 

John. No ; it is a stronger enemy than you that 
keeps us from doing that, or else we should not have 
come hither. 

Constable. Well, you may go any other way, then. 

John. No, ito ; I suppose you see we are able to 
send you going, and all the people of vour parish, 
and come through your town when we wifl ; but since 
you have stopped us here, we are content. You see 
we have encamped here, and here we will live. We 
hope you will furnish us with victuals. 

Constable. We furnish you ! What mean you by 
that? 

John. Why, you would not have us starve, would 
you P If you stop us here, you must keep us. 

Constable. You will be ill kept at our mainte- 

John. If you stint us, we shall make ourselves the 
better allowance. 

CoMtable. Why, you will not pretend to quarter 
upon us by force, will you ? 

John. We have offered do violence to you yet 
Why do you seem to oblige us to it? I am an old 
soldier, and cannot starve, and if you think that we 
shall be obliged to go back for want of provisions,

Constable. Since you threaten us, we shall take 
care to be strong enough for you. I have orders to 
raise the county upon vou.

John, It is you that threaten, not we. And since 
you are for mischief you cannot Mame us if we do 
notgive you time for it ; we shall b^n out march in 
a few minutes.^ 

Constable. What is it you demand of us P 

John. At first we desired nothing of you but 
leave to go through the town ; we shomd hare ofiered 
no injury to any of you, neither would you have 
had any injury or loss by us. We are not thieves, 
but poor people in distress, and flying from the dread- 
ful plague in London, which devours thousands 
every week. We wonder how you could be so 
unmerciful 1 

Cotutabk. Self-preservation obliges us. 

John, What ! To shut up your compassion in a 
case of such distress as this ? 

Con^abk. Well, if you will pass over the fields 
on your left band, and behind that part of the 
town, I will endeavour to have gates opened for 



baggage that way ; it does not lead into the road 
that we want to go, and why should you force us 
out of the road P Besides, you have Icept us here 
all day without any pi-ovisions hut such as we brought 
with us. I think you ought to send us some provi- 
sions for our relief. 

Conntable. If you will go another way we will send 
you some provisions. 

John. That is the way to have all the towns in the 
county stop up the ways against us. 

Constable. If they all furnish you with food, what 
will you be the worse? I see you have tents ; you 
want no lodging.

John. Well, what quantity of prorisioDS will you 
send us? 

Conttabk. How many are you P 

John. Nay, we do not ask enough for all our 
company ; we are in three companies. If you will 
send us Dread for twenty men and about six or seven 
women for three days, and show us the way over the 
field you speak of, we desire not to put your people 
into any fear for us ; we will eo out of our way to 
oblige you, though we are as free from infection as 
you are. ' 

Constable. And will you assure us that your other 
people shall oifer us no new disturbance P 

John. No, no, you may depend on it. 

Constable. You must oblige yourself, too, that 
none of your people shall come a step nearer than 
where the provisions we send you shall oe set down. 

John. I aaswer for it we will not. 

Accordingly they sent to the place twenty loaves of 
bread and mree or four large pieces of good beef, and 
opened some gates, througn which they passed ; but 
none of tliem had courage so much as to look out to 
see ihem go, and, as it was evening, if they had 
looked they could not have seen them so as to know 
how few they were. 

This was John the soldier's management. But 
this gave such an alarm to the county, that had they 
really been two or three hundred the whole county 
would have been raised upon them, and they would 
have been sent to prison, or perhaps knocked on the 
head. 

They were soon made sensible of this, for two days 
afterwards they found several parties of horsemen

bdp Rlchanl and his people to march the lower wa^ on the siae

sham, for they had no Captain Richard, or any such company.

and footmen also about, in pursuit of three companies 
of men, armed, as they said, with muskets, who 
were broke out from London, and had the plague 
upon them, and that were not only spreading the 
distemper among the people, but plundering the 
country. 

As they saw now the consequence of their case, 
they soon saw the danger they were in, so they re- 
solved, by the advice also of the old soldier, to divide 
themselves again. John and his two comrades, with 
the horse, went away as if towards Waltham ; the 
other in two companies, but all a little asunder, and 
went towards Epping. 

The first nigat they encamped all in the forest, 
and not far on of one another, but not setting up 
the tent, lest that should discover them. On the 
other hand, Richard went to woHc with his ose and 
his hatchet, and cutting down branches of trees, he 
built three tents or hovels, in which they all en- 
camped with as much convenience as they could 
expect 

The provisions they had at Walthamstow served 
them very plentifully this night; and as for the 
next, they left it to Fmvidence. They had &red so 
well with the old soldier's conduct that they now 
willingly made him their leader, and the first of his 
conduct appeared to be very good. He told them 
that they were now at a proper distance enough 
from I^ndon ; that as they need not be immediately 
beholden to the country for relief, so they ought to 
be as careful the country did not infect them as that 
they did not infect the country; that what little 
money they had, they must be as frugal of as they 
could ; that as he would not have them think of 
offering the country any violence, so they must en- 
deavour to ma\ic the sense of their condition go as 
far with the country as it could. They all refened

themselTes to his direction, so they left their three 
houses staoding, and the next day went avay towards 
Epping. The captain also, for so they now called 
him. and his two fellow-travellers laia aside their 
design of going to Waltham, and all went together. 

When they came near Epping they halted, choos- 
ing out a proper place in the open forest, not very 
near the highwavt but not far out of it on the north 
side, under a little cluster of low pollard-trees. Hera 
they pitched their little camp, which consisted of three 
large tents or huts made of poles, which their car- 
penter, and such as were his assistants, cut down 
and fixed in the ground in a circle, binding all the 
small ends together at the top, and thickening the 
sides with boughs of trees and bushes, so thai they 
were completely close and warm. Iliey had, besides 
this, a little tent, where the women lay by them- 
selves, and a hut to pat the horse in. 

It happened that the next day, or next but one, 
was market-day at Epping, when Captain John and 
one of the otner men went to market and bought 
some provisions ; that is to say, bread, and some 
mutton and beef; and two of the women went sepa- 
rately, as if they had not belonged to the rest, and 
bougnt more. John took the horse to bring it 
home, and the sack which the carpenter carrieff his 
tools in to put it in. The carpenter went to work and 
made them benches and stools to sit on, such as the 
wood he could get would afford, and a kind of table 
to dine on. 

They were taken do notice of for two or three 
days, but after that abundance of people ran out of 
the town to look at them, and all the country was 
alarmed about them. The people at first seemed 
alraid to come near them ; and, on the other hand, 
they desired the people to keep off, for there was a 
rumour that the plague was at Waltham, and that it

had been in Epping two or three days ; so John 
called out to them not to come to them, " for," sayg 
he, " we are all whole and sound people here, and 
we would not have you bring the plague among us, 
nor pretend we brought it among you." 

After this the pansh officers came up to them and 
parleyed with them at a distance, and desired to 
know who they were, and by what authority they 
pretended to nx their stand at that place. John 
answered very frankly, they were poor distressed 
people from London, who, foreseeing the misery 
tiiey should be reduced to if the plague spread into 
the city, had fled out in time for their lives, and, 
having no acquaintance or relations to fly to, had 
first taken up at Islington, but, the plague being 
come into that town, were fled farther; and as they 
supposed that the people of Epping might have 
ren^d them coming into their town, they had 

Stitched their tents thus in the open field and in the 
brest, being willing to bear all the hardships of 
such a disconsolate lodging rather than have any 
one think or be alraid that they should receive 
injury by them. 

At first the Epping people talked roughly to them, 
and told them they must remove ; that this was no 
place for them ; and that they pretended to be sound 
and well, but that they might be infected with the 
plague for aught they knew, and might infect the 
whole country, and they could not suffer them there. 
John argued very calmly with them a great while, 
and told them that I^ondon was the place by which 
they, that is, the townsmen of Epping and all the 
country round them, subsisted ; to whom they sold 
the produce of their lands, and out of whom they 
made their rent of their farms ; and to be so cruel 
to the inhabitants of London, or to any of those by 
whom they gained so much, was very bard, and they

would be loth to have it remembered hereafter, and 
have it told how barbarous, how inhospitable, and 
how unkind they were to the people of London when 
they fled from the face of the most terrible enemy in 
the world ; that it would be enough' to make the 
name of an Eppine man hateful through all the city, 
and to have the rabble stone them in tne very streets 
whenever they came so much as to market ; that they 
were not yet secure from being visited themselves, 
and that, as he heard, Waltham was already ; that 
they would think it very hard that when any of them 
fled for fear before they were touched, they should 
be denied the liberty of lying so much as in the 
open fields. 

The Epping men told them again that they, in- 
deed, saia they were sound and free from the nifec- 
tion, but that they had no assurance of it; and that 
it was reported that there had been a great rabble 
of people at Walthamstow, who made such pre- 
tences of being sound as they did, but tliat they 
threatened to plunder the town and force their way, 
whether the parish officers would or no ; that there 
were near two hundred of them, and had arms and 
tents like Low Countiy soldiers ; that they extorted 

f>rovisions from the town, by threatening them with 
ivingupon them at free quarter, showing their arms, 
and talking in the language of soldiers ; and that 
several of them being gone away towards Romford 
and Brentwood, the country had been infected by 
them, and the plague spread into both those large 
towns, so that the people durst not go to market 
there as usual ; that it was vei7 likwy they were 
some of that party ; and if so, they deserved to be 
sent to the county jail, and be secured till they had 
made satisfaction for the damage they had done, and 
for the terror and fright they had put the country 
into.

John answered that what other people had done 
was nothing to them ; that they assured them they 
were all of one company ; that they had never been 
more in number than they saw them at that time 
(which, by the way, was very true) ; that they came 
out in two separate companies, but joined by the 
way, their cases being the same; that they were 
ready to give what account of themselves anybody 
could deijire of them and to give in their names and 
places of abode, that so they might be called to an 
account for any disorder that they might be guilty 
of; that the townsmen might see they were content 
to live hardly, and only desired a little room to 
breathe in on the forest where it was wholesome; 
for where it was not they could not stay, and would 
decamp if they found it otherwise there. 

" But,^ said the townsmen, " we have a great 
charge of poor upon our hands already, and we must 
take care not to increase it ; we suppose you can give 
us no security against your being chargeable to our 
parish and to the inhabitants, any more than you can 
of being dangerous to us as to the infection." 

" Why, look you," says John, " as to being chat^e- 
ahle to you, we hope we shall not If you will relieve 
us with provisions for our present necessity, we will be 
very thankful ; as we all lived without cnarity when 
we were at home, so we will oblige ourselves luUy to 
repay yaa, if God please to bring us back to our own 
families and houses in safety, and to restore health to 
the people of London. . . 

** As to our dying here, we assure you, if any of us 
die, we that survive will bury them, and put you to 
no expense, except it should be that we should all die, 
and then, indee<^ the last man not being able to bury 
himself, would put you to that single expense, which, 
I am persu.'ided," says John, *' he would leave enough 
behind him to pay you for the expense of.

** On the other hand," says John, " if you will shut 
up all bowels of compassion, and not relieve us at all, 
we shall not extort anything by violence or steal Irom 
any one ; but when what little we have is spent, if 
we perish for want, God's will be done," 

John wrought so upon the townsmen, by talking 
thus rationally and smoothly to them, that they went 
away ; and though they did not give any consent to 
their staying there, yet they did not molest them ; 
and the poor people continued there three or four 
days longer without any disturbance. In this time 
they had got some remote acxiuaintance with a victual- 
ling-house at the outskirts of the town, to whom they 
called at a distance to bring some little things that 
they wanted, and which they caused to be set down 
at a distance, and always paid for very honestly. 

During this time the younger people of the town 
came ftequently pretty near them, and would stand 
and look at them, ana sometimes talk with thom at 
some space between; and particularly it was observed 
that the first Sabbath-day the poor people kept re- 
tired, worshipped God together, and were heard to 
sii^ psalms. 

These things, and a quiet, inofiensive behaviour, 
began to get them the good opinion of the country, 
ana people began to pity them and speak very well 
of them ; the consequence of which was, that Upon 
the occasion of a very wet, rainy night, a certain gen- 
tleman who lived in the neighbourhood sent them a 
little cart with twelve trusses or bundles of straw, as 
well for them to lodge upon as to cover and thatch 
their huts and to keep them dry. The minister of a 
parish not far off, not knowing of the other, sent 
them also about two bushels of wheat and half a 
bushel of white peas. 

They were very thankful, to be sure, for this relief, 
and particularly the straw wa^ a very great comfort

to them ; for though the ingenious carpenter had 
made frames for them to lie in like troughs, and 
filled them with leaves of trees, and such mings as 
they could get, and had cut all their tent-cloth out 
to make them coverlids, yet they lay damp, and hard, 
and unwholesome till this straw came, which was to 
them like feather-beds, and, as John said, more wel- 
come than feather-beds would have been at another 
time. 

This gentleman and the minister having thus be- 
gun, and given an example of charity to these wander- 
ers, others quickly followed, and they received every 
day some benevolence or other from the people, but 
chiefly from the gentlemen who dwelt in the country 
round about Some sent them chairs, stoob, tables, 
and such household things as they gave notice they 
wanted ; sbme sent them blankets, rugs, and cover- 
lids, some earthenware, and some kitchen ware for 
ordering their food. 

Encouraged by this good usage, their carpenter in 
a few days built them a large shed or house with 
rafters, and a roof in form, and an upper floor, in 
which they lodged warm, for the weather began to 
be damp and cold in the banning of September. 
But this house, being very well thatched, and the 
sides and roof made very thick, kept out the cold well 
enough. He made, also, an earthen wall at one end 
with a chimney in it, and another of the company, 
with a vast deal of trouble and pains, made a funnel 
to the chimney to carry out the smoke. 

Here they lived comfortably, though coarsely, till 
the beginning of September, when they had the bad 
news to hear, whether true or not, that the plague, 
which was veiy hot at Waltham Abbey on one side, 
and at Romford and Brentwood on tne other side, 
was also come to Epping, to Woodford, and to moat 
of the towns upon the Forest, and which, as they

said, was brought down among them chiefly by the 
higglers, and such people aa went to aod from 
London with provisions. 

If this was true, it was an evident contradiction to 
that report which was afterwards spread all over 
England, but which, as I have said, I cannot conflmi 
of my own knowledge, namely, that the market- 
people carrying provisions to the city never got the 
infection, or earned it back into the countiy, both 
whi<^ I have been assured, has been false. 

It might be that they were preserved even beyond 
expectation, though not to a miracle, that abun- 
dance went and came and were not touched, and that 
was much for the encouragement of the poor people 
of London, who had been completely miserable if 
the people that brought provisions to the markets 
had not been many times wonderfully preserved, or 
at least more preserved than could be reasonably 
expected. 

But DOW these new inmates began to be disturbed 
more effectually, for the towns about them were 
really infected, and they began to be afraid to ti-ust 
one another so much as to go abroad for such things 
as they wanted, and this pinched them very ban), 
for now they had little or nothing but what the 
charitable gentlemen of the country supplied them 
with. But, for their encouragement, it happened 
that other gentlemen in the country, who had not 
sent them anything before, began to hear of them 
and supply them, and one sent them a large pig, 
that is to say, a porker, another two sheep, and 
another sent them a calf. In short, they hod meat 
enough, and sometimes had cheese and milk, and all 
siich things. They were chiefly put to it for bread, 
for when the gentlemen sent them com they had no- 
where to bake it or to grind it. Iliis made them 
eat the first two bushel of wheat that was sent them

in parched corn, as the Israelites of old did^ without 
grinding or making bread of it 

At last they found means to cany their com to a 
windmill near Woodford, where they had it ground, 
and afterwards the biscuit-baker made a hearth so 
hollow and dry that he could bake biscuit-cakes 
tolerably well ; and thus they came into a condition 
to live without any assistance or supplies from the 
towns; and it was welt they did, for the country 
was soon after fuUy infected, and about ISO were 
said to have died of the distemper in the villages 
near them, which was a terrible thing to them. 

On this they called a new couadl, and now the 
towns had no need to be afraid they should settle 
near them ; but, on the contrair, several families of 
the poorer sort of the inhabitants quitted their 
houses and built huts in the forest aner the same 
manner as they had done. But it was observed that 
several of these poor people that had so removed had 
the sickness even in their huts or booths ; the reason 
of which was plain, namely, not because they removed 
into the air, but, (1) because they did not remove 
time enough ; that is to say, not till, by openly con- 
versing with the other people their neighbours, they 
had the distemper upon them, or (as may be said) 
among them, and so carried it about them whither 
they went. Or (2) because they were not careful 
enough, after they were safely removed out of the 
towns, not to come in again and mingle with the 
diseased people. 

But be it which of these it will, when our travellers 
began to perceive that the plague was not only in the 
towns, but even in the tents and huts on the forest 
near them, they b^an then not only to be afraid, 
but to think of decamping and removing ; for had 
they stayed they would have been in manifest danger 
of their lives.

It is not to be wondered that they were greatly 
afflicted at being obliged to quit the place where they 
bad been so kindly received, and where they had been 



treated with so much humanity and charity; but 
necessity and the hazard of life, which they came 
out so for to preserve, prevailed with them, and they 



saw no remedy. John, however, thought of a remedy 
for their present misfortune, namely, that he would 
first acquaint that gentleman who was their principal 
benefactor with the dintress they were in, mid to 
crave his assistance and advice. 

The good, charitable gentleman encouraged them 
to quit the place, for fear they should be cut off from 
any retreat at all by the violence of the dbtemper ; 
but whither they should go, that he found very hard 
to direct them to. At last John asked of him 
whether he, being a justice of the peace, would give 
them certificates of health to other justices whom 
thev might come before, that so, whatever might be 
their lot, they might not be repulsed now they had 
been also so long from London. This his worship 
immediately granted, and gave them proper letters 
of health, ana from thence they were at liberty to 
travel whither they pleased. 

Accordingly they nad a full certificate of health, 
intimating that they had resided in a village in the 
county of Essex so long that, being examined and 
scrutinised sufficiently, and having been retired from 
all conversation for above forty days, without any 
appearance of sickness, they were therefore certainly 
concluded to be sound men, and might be safely en- 
tertained anywhere, having at last removed rather 
for fear of the plague, which was come into such a 
town, rather than for having any signal of infection 
upon them, or upon any belonging to them. 

With this certificate they removed, though with 

great reluctance ; and John inclining not to go far

from home, they moved towards the marshes on the 
side of Waltham. But here they found a man who, 
it seems, kept a weir or stop upon the river, mnde to 
niiae the water for the bai^ which go up and down 
the river, and he terrified them with dismal stories 
of the aicknesa having been spread into all the towns 
on the river, and near the river, on the side of 
Middlesex and Hertfordshire; that is to say, into 
Waltham, Waltham Cross, Enfield, and Ware, and 
all the towns on the road, that they were afraid to 
go that way, though it seems the man imposed upon 
them, for that the thing was not really true. 

However, it terrified them, and they resolved to 
move across the forest towards Romford and Brent- 
wood ; but they heard that there were numbers of 
people fled out of London that way, who lay up and 
down in the forest called Hainault Forest, reaching 
near Romford, and who, having no subsistence or 
habitation, not only lived oddly and suffered great 
extremities in the woods and fields for want of relief, 
but were said to be made so desperate by those ex- 
tremities AS that they offered many violences to the 
county, robbed and plundered, and killed cattle, and 
the like ; that others, building huts and hovels by 
the roadside, be^ed, and that with an importunity 
next door to demanding relief; so that the county 
was very uneasy, and had been obliged to take some 
of them up. 

This, in the first place, intimated to them that 
they would be sure to find the charity and kindness 
of the county, which they had found here where they 
were before, hardened and shut up ag^nst them ; 
and that, on the other hand, they would be ques- 
tioned wherever they came, and would be in danger 
of violence from others in like cases as themselves. 

Upon all these considerations John, their captain, 

in all tiieir names, went back to their good niend

and benefactor, who had relieved them before, and 
laying their case truly before him, himbly asked his 
advice ; and he as kindly advised them to take up 
their old quarters again, or if not, to remove but a 
little &rther out of the road, and directed them 
to a proper place for them ; and as they really 
wanted some house rather than huts to shelter them 
at that time of the year, it growing on towards 
Michaelmas, they found an old decayed house, 
which had been formerly some cottage or little hab- 
itation, but was so out of repair as scarce habitable, 
and by the consent of a farmer to whose farm it be- 
longed, they got leave to make what use of it they 
could. 

The ingenious joiner and all the pest, by his 
directions, went to work with it, and in a very few 
days made it capable to shelter them all in cose of 
bad weather, and in which there was an old chim- 
ney and an old oven, though both lying in ruins ; 
yet they made them both lit for use, and raising ad- 
ditions, sheds, and lean-tos on every side, they soon 
made the house capable to hold them all. 

They chiefly wanted boards to make window-shut- 
ters, floors, doors, and several other things; but as 
the eentlemen above favoured them, and the country 
was by that means made easy with them, and, above 
all, that they were known to be all sound and in 
good health, everybody helped them with what they 
could spare. 

Here they encamped for good and all, and re- 
solved to remove no more. They saw plainly how 
terribly alarmed that county was everywhere at 
anybody that came from London, and that they 
should have no admittance anywhere hut with the 
utmost difficulty, at least no friendly reception and 
assistance, as they bad received here. 

Now, although they received great assistance and

encouragement fit>in the country gentlemen and 
from the people round about them, yet they were 
put to great straits, for the weather grew cold and 
wet in October and November, and they had not 
been used to so much hardship ; so that they 
rot colds in their limbs and distempers, but never 
had the infection ; and thus about December they 
came home to the city again. 

I give this story thus at lat^ principally to give 
an account what became of the great numbers of 
people which immediately appeared in the citv 
as Soon aa the sickness abatea ; for, as I have said, 
great numbers of those that were able and had re- 
treats in the country fled to those retreats. So, 
when it was increased to such a frightful extremity 
as I have related, the middling people who had not 
Jriends fled to all parts of the country where they 
could get shelter, as well those that nad money to 
relieve themselves as those that had not Those 
that had money always fled farthest, because they 
were able to sumist themselves ; but those who were 
empty suffered, as I have said, great hardships, and 
were often driven by necessity to relieve their wants 
at the expense of the country. By that means the 
country was made very uneasy at them, and some- 
times took them up, though even then they scarce 
knew what to do with th«m, and were always very 
backward to punish them, but often, too, they 
forced them from place to place, till they were 
obliged to come hack again to London. 

I have, since my knowing this story of John and 
his brother, inquired and found that there were agreat 
many of the poor disconsolate people, as above, fled 
into the country every way, and some of them got 
little sheds;, and barns, and outhouses to live in, 
where they could obtain so much kindness of the 
country, and especially where they had any the least

themselves little huts and retreats in the fields and 
woods, and lived like hermits in holes and caves, or 
any place they could find, and where, we may be sure, 
they suffered great extremities, such that many of 
them were obliged to come back again whatever the 
danger was ; and so those little huts were often found 
empty, and the country people supposed the inhabi- 
tants lay dead in them of Uie plague, and would not 
go near them for fear, no, not in a great while ; nor 
is it unlikely but that some of the unhappy wan- 
derers might die so all alone, even sometimes for 
want of help, as particularly in one tent or hut was 
found a man dead, and on the gate of a field just by 
was cut with his knife, in uneven letters, the follow- 
ing words, by which it may be supposed the other 
man escaped, or that, one dying first, the other buried 
him as well as he could : — 

"Omls&Y! 
We BoTH SImLL DvE. 

WoE, WoE." 

I have given an account already of what I found to 
have been the case down the river among the seafar- 
ing men ; how the ships lay in the offing, as it 's 
called, in rows or lines astem of one another, quite 
down from the Pool as far as I could see. I nave 
been told that they lay in the same manner quite 
down the river as low as Gravesend, and some far be- 
yond, even everywhere, or in every place where they 
could ride with safety as to wind and weather ; nor 
did I ever hear that tne plague reached to any of the 
people on board those ships, except such as lay up in 
the Pool, or as high as Deptford Reach, although 
the people went frequently on shore to the country

towns aod villages, and &riners^ bouses, to buy fresh 
provision§, fowb, pigs, calves, and the like for their 
Bupply. 

Likewise I found that the watermen on the river 
above the bridge found means to convey themselves 
sway up the river as far as they could go, and that 
they had, many of them, their whole families in their 
boats, covered with tilts and bales, as they call them, 
and furnished with straw within for their lodging, 
aod that they lay thus all along by the shore in the 
marshes, some of them setting up little tents with 
their sails, and so lying under them on shore in the 
day, and going into their boats at night ; and in this 
manner, as I nave heard, the river-sides were lined 
with boats and people as long as they had anything 
to subsist on, or could get anything of the country ; 
and, indeed, the country people, as well gentlemen 
as others, on these and all other occasions, were very 
forward to relieve them, but they were by no means 
willing to receive them into their towns and houses, 
and for that we cannot blame them. 

TTiere was one unhappy citizen, within my know- 
ledge, who had been visited in a dreadful manner, 
so that his wife and all his children were dead, and 
himself and two servants only left, with an elderly 
woman, a near relation, who had nursed those that 
were dead as well as she could. Thii disconsolate 
man goes to a village near the town, though not 
within the bills of mortality, and finding an empty 
house there, inquires out the owner, and took the 
house. After a few days he got a cart and loaded it 
with goods, and carries them down to the houw ; the 
people of the village opposed his driving the cart 
along, but with some areuings and some force, the 
men that drove the cart along got through the street 
up to the door of the house. There the constable 
resisted them again, and would not let them be

brought in. The man caused &e goods to be un- 
loaden and laid at the door, and sent the cart away ; 
upon which they carried the man before a justice of 
peace ; that is to say, they commanded him to go, 
which he did. The justice ordered him to cause the 
cart to fetch away the goods again, which he refused 
to do ; upon which the justice ordered the constable 
to puisue the carters and fetch them back, and make 
them reload the goods and carry Uiem away, or to 
set them in the stocks till th^ came for fiirther 
orders ; and if they could not tind them, nor the 
man would not consent to take tiiem away, they 
should cause them to be drawn with hooks from the 
house-door and burned in the street. The poor dis- 
tressed man upon this fetched the goods again, but 
with grievous cries and lamentations at the nardship 
of his case. But there was no remedy ; self-pres- 
ervation obliged the people to those seventies, 
which they would not otherwise have been concerned 
in. Whether this poor man lived or died I cannot 
tell, but it was reported that he had the plague upon 
him at that time ; and perhaps the people might re- 
port that to justify their usage of him ; but it was 
not unlikely that either he or his goods, or both, 
were dangerous, when his whole family had been 
dead of the distemper so little a white before. 

I know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent 
to London were much blamed for cruelty to the poor 
people that ran from the contagion in their distress, 
and many very severe things were done, as may be 
seen from what has been said ; but I cannot but say 
also that, where- there was room for charity and 
assistance to the people, without apparent dai^r to 
themselves, they were willing enough to help and 
relieve them. But as every town were indeed judges 
in their own case, so the poor people who ran abroad 
in their extremities were often ul-used and driven

back again into tiie town ; and this caused infinite 
exclamations and outcries against the country towns, 
and made the clamour very popular. 

And yet, more or less, maugre all the caution, 
there was not a town of any note within ten (or, I 
believe, twenty) miles of the city but what was more 
or less infected and had some aied among tLem. I 
have heard the accounts of several, such as they were 
reckoned up, as follows : —

Another thing might render the country more 
strict with respect to the citizens, and especially with 
respect to the poor, and this was what I hinted at 
before, namely, that there was a seeming propensity 
or a wicked inclination in thme that were infected 
to infect others. 

There had been great debates among our physicians 
as to the reason of this. Some will have it to be in 
the nature of the disease, and that it impresses every 
one that is seized upon by it with a kind of a rage, 
and a hatred against their own kind, as if there was 
a malignity not only in the distemper to communicate 
itself, but in the very nature of man, prompting him 
with evil will or an evil eye, that, as they say in 
the case of a mad dog, who, though the gentlest

creature before of any of his kind, yet then will fly 
upon &nd bite any one that conies next him, and 
those as soon as any who had been most observed by 
him before. 

Others placed it to the account of the corruption 
of human nature, who cannot bear to see itself more 
miserable than others of its own species, and has a 
kind of involuntary wish that all men were as un- 
happy or in as bad a condition as itself. 

Otnei-s say it was only a kind of desperation, not 
knowing or regarding what they did, and conse- 
quently tinconcemed at the danger or safety, not 
only of anybody near them, but even of themselves 
also. And indeed when men are once come to a con- 
dition to abandon themselves, and be unconcerned 
for the safety or at the danger of themselves, it can- 
not be so much wondered that they should be care- 
less of the safety of other people. 

But I choose to give this grave debate a quite dif- 
ferent turn, and answer it or resolve it all by s^ing 
that I do not grant the fact. On the contrary, I say 
that the thing is not really so, but that it was a 
general comptaiot raised by the people inhabiting 
the outlying villages against the citizens to justify, 
or at least excuse, those hardships and seventies so 
much talked of, and in which complaints both sides 
may be said to have injured one another ; that is to 
say, the citizens pressing to be received and harboiued 
in time of distress, and with the plague upon them, 
complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country 
people in being refused entrance and forced back 
again with their goods and families ; and the inhabi- 
tants, finding themselves so imposed upon, and the 
citizens breaking in as it were upon them whether 
they would or no, complain that when they were in- 
fected they were not only regardless of others, but 
even willing to infect them ; neither of which were

really true, that is to say, m the colours they were 
described tn. 

It is true there is something to be said for the 
frequent alarms which were given to the country of 
the resolution of the people of London to come out 
by force, not only for relief, but to plunder and rob ; 
that they ran about the streets with the distemper 
upon them without any control ; and that no care 
was taken to shut up nouses, and confine the sick 

Ctple from infecting others; whereas, to do the 
ndoners justice, thev never practised such things, 
except in such particular cases as I have mentioned 
above, and such like. On the other hand, everything 
was managed with so much care, and such excellent 
order was observed in the whole city and suburbs by 
the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen, and by 
the justices of the peace, church- wardens, &c., in the 
out-ports, that London may be a pattern to all 
the cities in the world for the good government and 
the excellent order that was everywhere kept, even 
in the time of the most violent infection, and when 
the people were in the utmost consternation and db- 
tress. But of this I shall speak by itself. 

One thing, it is to be oteerved, was owing princi- 
pally to the prudence of the magistrates, and ought 
to lie mentioned to their honour, viz., the moderation 
which they used in the great and difficult work of 
shutting up of houses. It is true, as I have men- 
tioned, that the shutting up of houses was a great 
subject of discontent, and I may say indeed the only 
subject of discontent among the people at that time ; 
for the confining the sound in the same house with 
the sick was counted very terrible, and the complaints 
of people so confined were very grievous. They were 
heard into the very streets, and they were sometimes 
such that called for resentment, though oftener for 
compassion. They had no way to converse with any

of their friends but out at their window§, where they 
would make such piteous lamentations as often moved 
the hearts of those they talked with, and of others 
who, passing by, heard their story ; and as those 
complaints oftentimes reproached the severity, and 
sometimes the insolence, of the watchmen placed at 
their doors, those watchmen would answer saucily 
enough, and perhaps be apt to aflront the peopfe 
who were in the street talking to the said families ; 
for which, or for their ill-treatment of the families, 
I think seven or eight of them in several places were 
killed ; I know not whether I should say murdered 
or not, because I cannot enter into tlie particular 
cases. It is true the watchmen were on tneir duty, 
and acting in the post where they were placed by a 
lawful auUiority ; and killing, any public legal officer 
in the execution of his office is always, iu the lan- 
guage of the law, colled mincer. But as they were 
not authorised by the magistrates' instructions, or by 
the power they acted under, to be injurious or abus- 
ive, either to the people who were under their obser- 
vation, or to anv that concerned themselves for 
them ; so when they did so, they might be said to 
act themselves, not uieir office ; to act as private per- 
sons, not as persons employed ; and consequently, if 
they brought mischief upon themselves by such an 
undue behaviour, that mischief was upon their own 
heads ; and indeed they had so much the hearty curses 
of the people, whether they deserved it or not, that 
whatever befell them nobody pitied them, and every- 
body was apt to say they desei-ved it, whatever it 
was. Nor do I remember that anybody was ever 
punished, at least to any considerable degree, for 
whatever was done to the watchmen that guarded 
their houses.

watchmen were deceived or overpowered, and that the 
people got away, I have taken notice of already, and 
shall say no more to that. But I say the magislxates 
did moderate and ease famihes upon many occasions 
in this case, and particularly in that of taking away, 
or suffering to be removed, the sick persons out of 
such houses when they were willing to be removed 
either to a pest-house or other places, and sometimes 
giving the well persons in the family so shut up leave 
to remove upon information given that they were 
well, and that they would confine themselves m such 
houses where they went so long as should be re- 
quired of them. The concern, also, of the magis- 
bstes for the supplying such poor families as were 
infected — I say, supplying them with necessaiies, as 
well physic as food — was very great, and in which 
they did not content themselves with giving the 
necessary orders to the ofEcers appointed, but the 
aldermen in person, and on hoiseoack, frequently 
rode to such houses and caused the people to be 
asked at their windows whether they were duly at- 
tended or not ; also, whether they wanted anyuing 
that was necessary, and if the officers had constantly 
carried their messages and fetched them such things 
as they wanted or not. And if they answered in the 
affirmative, all was well ; but if they complained that 
they were ill supphed, and that the officer did not do 
his duty, or did not treat them civilly, they (the 
officers) were generally removed, and others placed in 
their stead. 

It is true such complaint might be unjust, and if 
the officer had such ailments to use as would con- 
vince the magistrate that he was right, and that the 
people had injured himi he was continued and they 
reproved. But this part could not well bear a pai*- 
ttcular inquiry, for the parties could very ill be well 
heard aod answered in the street from the windows,

as was the case then. TTie magistrates, therefore, 
generally chose to favour the people and remove the 
man, as what seemed to be the least wrong and of 
the least ill consequence ; seeing if the watchman was 
injured, yet they could easily make him amends by 
giving him anoUier post of the like nature ; but if 
the bmily was injured, there was no satisfaction 
could be made to them, the damage perhaps being 
irreparable, as it concerned their lives, 

A great variety of these cases Jrequently happened 
between the watchmen and the poor people shut up, 
besides those I formerly mentioned about escaping. 
Sometimes the watchmen were absent, sometimes 
drunk, sometimes asleep when the people wanted 
them, and such never &i1ed to be punished severely, 
as indeed they deserved. 

But after all that was or could be done in these 
cases, the shutting up of houses, so as to confine those 
that were well with those that were sick, had very 
great inconveniences in it, and some that were very 
tragical, and which merited to have been considered 
if there had been room for it. But it was authorised 
by a law, it had the public good in view as the end 
chiefly aimed at, and all the private injuries that 
were done by the putting it in execution must be 
put to the account of the public benefit. 

It is doubtful to this day whether, in the whole, it 
contributed anything to the stop of the infection, 
and, indeed, I cannot say it did, for nothing could 
run with greater fury and rage than the infection did 
when it was in its chief violence, though tlie houses 
infected were shut up as exactly and as effectually as 
it was possible. Certain it is that if all the infected 
persons were effectually shut in, no sound pei-son 
could have been infected hy them, because they could 
not have come near them. But the case was this, 
end I shall only touch it here, namely, that the in-

fection was propagated insensibly, and by such per- 
sons as were not visibly infected, who neither knew 
whom they infected or who they were infected by. 

A house in Whitechapel was shut up for the sake 
of one infected maid, who had only spots, not the 
tokens come out upon her, and recovered ; yet these 
people obtained no liberty to stir, neither for air or 
exercise forty days. Want of breath, fear, anger, 
vexation, and all the other grie& attending such au 
injurious treatment cast the mistress of the family 
into a fever, and visitors came into the bouse and said 
it was the plague, though the physicians declared it 
was not. However, the family were obliged to b^n 
their quarantine anew on the report of the visitor 
or examiner, though thetr former quarantine wanted 
but a few days of being finished. This oppressed 
them so with anger and grief, and, as before, strait- 
ened them also so much as to room, and for want of 
breathing and free air, that most of the family fell 
sick, one of one distemper, one of another, chiefly 
scorbutic ailments ; only one a violent colic ; till, 
after several prolongings of their confinement, some 
or other of those that came in with the visitors to 
inspect the persons that were ill, in hopes of releas- 
ing them. Drought the distemper with them and 
infected the whole house, and all or most of them 
died, not of the plague as really upon them before, 
but of the plague that those people brought them, 
who should nave been careful to have protected them 
from it. And this was a thing which frequently 
hf^pened, and was, indeed, one of the worst conse- 
quences of shutting houses up. 

I bad about this time a little hardship put upon 
me, which I was at first greatly afflicted at, and very 
much disturbed about, though, as it proved, it did 
not expose me to any disaster ; and this was being 
appointed by the alderman of Portsoken Ward one 
[183]

of the examiners of the houses in the precinct where 
I lived. We had a Urge parish, and bad no less 
than eij^hteen examiners, aa the order called us ; the 
people called us visitors. I endeavoured with all 
my might to be excused from such an employment, 
and used many arguments with the alderman^s, 
deputy to be excused ; particularly I al]^^ that I 
was aeainst shutting up houses at all, and that it 
would oe very hard to oblige me to be an instrument 
in that which was against my judgment, and which 
I did verily believe would not answer the end it was 
intended for ; but all the abatement I could get was 
only, that whereas the officer was appointed by my 
Lord Mayor to continue two months, I should lie 
obliged to bold it but three weeks, on condition 
nevertheless that I could then get some other suffi- 
cient housekeeper to serve the rest of the time for 
me, which was, in short, but a very small favour, it 
being very difficult to get any man to accept of such 
an employment, that was fit to be entrustwl with it. 
It is true that shutting up of houses had one effect, 
which 1 am sensible was of moment, namely, it con- 
fined the distempered people, who would otherwise 
have been both very trouolesome and very danger- 
ous in their running about streets with the distemper 
upon them, which, when they were delirious, they 
would have done in a most fnghtful manner, and as 
indeed they be^n to do at first very much, till they 
were thus restrained ; nay, so very open they were 
that the poor would go about and beg at people's 



doors, and say they had the plague upon them, and 
beg rags for their sores, or both, or anything that 
delirious nature happened to think of 

A poor, unhappy gentlewoman, a substantial citi- 
zen's wife, was (if tne story be true) murdered by 
one of these creatures in Aldersgate Street, or that 
way. He was going along the street, raving mad,

to be sure, and singing ; the people only said he was 
drunk, but he himself s^d he hod the plague upon 
bim, which, it seems, was true ; aud meeting this 
gentlewoman, he would kiss her. She was terribly 
frighted, as he was only a rude fellow, and she ran 
from him, but the street being very thin of people, 
there was nobody near enough to help her. Wnen 
she saw he would overtake her, she turned and gave 
him a thrust so foreibly, he being but weak, and 
pushed him down backward. But very unhappily, 
she being so near, he caught hold of her, and pulled 
her down also, and gettmg up first, mastered her, 
and kissed her ; and which was worst of all, when he 
had done, told her he had the plague, and why 
should not she have it as well as neP She was 
frighted enough before, being also young with child; 
but when she heard him say he had the plague, she 
screamed out and fell down into a swoon, or in a fit, 
which, though she recovered a little, yet killed her 
in a very few days, and I never heard whether she 
had the plague or no. 

Another infected person came and knocked at the 
door of a citizen's house where they knew him very 
well ; the servant let him in, and being told the mas- 
ter of the house was above, he ran up, and came 
into the room to them as the whole family was at 
supper. They began to rise up, a little surprised, 
not knowing what the matter was, but be bia them 
sit still, he only came to take his leave of them. 

ITiey asked him, " Why, Mr , where are you 

going ? " " Going P " says he ; " I have got the sick- 
ness, and shall die to-morrow night." T" is easy to 
believe, though not to describ^ the consternation 
they were all in. The women and the man's daugh- 
ters, which were but little girls, were frighted 
almost to death, and got up, one running out at one 
door and one at another, some downstairs and some

upstairs, and getting together as well as they could, 
locked themselves into their chambers, aud screamed 
out at the window for help, as if they had been 
frighted out of their wits. The master, more com- 
posed than they,'thou^ both frighted and provoked, 
was going to lay hands on him and throw him down- 
sturs, being in a passion, but then, considering a 
little the condition of the man and the danger of 
touching him, horror seized his mind, and be stood 
still like one astonished. The poor distempered 
man all this while, being as well diseased in his 
brain as in his body, stood still hkeoneamazed. At 
length he turns round : " Ay ! ^ says he, with all the 
seeming calmness imaginable, " is it so with you all ? 
Are you all disturbed at me p Why, then 1 11 e'en 
go home and die there.* And so he goes imme- 
diately downstairs. The servant that haa let him in 
goes down after him with a candle, but was afraid to 
go past him and open the door, so he stood on the 
stain to see what he would do. The man went 
and opened the door, and went out and flung the 
door after him. It was some while before the 
fomily recovered the fright, but as no ill consequence 
attended, they have had occasion since to spsak of 
it (you may be sure) with great satisfaction. Though 
the man was gone, it was some time, nay, as I heard, 
some days before they recovered themselves of the 
huriy they were in ; nor did they go up and down 
the bouse with any assurance till they had burnt a 
great variety of fumes and perfumes in oil the rooms, 
and made a great many smokes of pitch, of gunpowder, 
and of sulphur, all separately shifted, and washed their 
clothes, and the like. As to the poor man, whether 
be lived or died I dont remember. 

It is most certain that, if by the shutting up of 
houses the sick had not been confined, multitudes who, 
Id the height of their fever, were delirious and dis-

tracted would have been continually running up and 
down the streets ; and even as. it was a very great 
number did so, and offered all sorts of violence to 
those they met, even just as a mad dog runs on and 
bites at every one he meets; nor can I doubt but 
that, should one of those in^ted, diseased creatures 
have bitten any man or woman while the &enzy of 
the distemper was upon them, they, I mean the per- 
son so wounded, would as certainly have been incura- 
bly infected as one that was sick before, and bad 
the tokens upon him. 

I heard of one infected creature who, running out 
of his bed in his shirt in the anguish and agony of 
his swellings, of which he had three upon him, got 
his shoes on and went to put on his coat ; but the 
nurse resisting, and snatching the coat from him, 
he threw her down, ran over her, ran downstairs 
and into the street, directly to the Thames in his 
shirt, the nurse running after him, and calling to 
the watch to stop him ; but the watchman, frighted 
at the man, and afraid to touch him, let him go on ; 
upon which he ran down to the Stillyard stairs, 
threw away his shirt, and plunged into the Thames, 
and, being a good swimmer, swam quite over the 
river ; ana the tide being coming in, as they call it, 
that is, running westward, he reached the Und not 
till he came atwut the Falcon stairs, where landing, 
and finding no people there, it being in the night, 
he ran about the streets there, naked as be was, for 
a good while, when, it being by that time high 
water, he takes the river again, and swam back to 
the Stillyard, landed, ran up the streets again to his 
own house, knocking at the door, went up the stairs 
and into his bed again ; and that this terrible ex- 
periment cured him of the plague, that is to say, 
that the violent motion of his arms and legs stretched 
the parts where the swellings he had upon him were,

that is to say, under his armg and his groin, and caused 
them to ripen and break, and that the cold of the 
water abated the fever in his blood. 

I have only to add that I do not relate this any 
more than some of the other, as a fact within my 
own knowledge, so as that I can vouch the truth of 
them, and especially that of the man being cured by 
the extravagant adventure, which I confess I do not 
think very possible ; but it may sen'e to confirm the 
many desperate things which the distressed people 
falling into deliriums, and what we call hght headed- 
ness, were frequently run upon at that time, and how 
infinitely more such there would have been if such 
people had not been confined by the shutting up of 
nouses ; and this I take to be the best, if not the 
only good thing which was performed by that severe 
method. 

On the o^er hand, the complaints and the mur- 
murings were very bitter against the thing itself. It 
would pierce the hearts of all that came by to hear 
the piteous cries of those infected people, who, being 
thus out of their understandings by the violence of 
their pain, or the heat of their blood, were eitlier 
shut in or perhaps tied in their beds and chairs, to 
prevent their doing themselves hurt, and who would 
make a dreadful outcry at their being confined, and 
at their being not permitted to die at laree, as they 
called it, and as they would have done before. 

This running of distempered people about the 
streets was very dismal, and the magistrates did their 
utmost to prevent it ; but as it was generally in the 
night and always sudden when such attempts were 
made, the officers could not be at hand to prevent 
it; and even when any got out in the day, the 
officers appointed did not care to meddle with them, 
because, as they were all grievously infected, to be 
sure, when they were come to that height, so they

were more than ordinarily infectious, and it was one 
of the most dangerous thin^ that could be to touch 
them. On the other hand, they generally ran on, 
not knowing what they did, till they dropped down 
stark dead, or till they had exhausted their spirits so 
as that they would fall and then die in perhaps half- 
an-hour or an hour ; and, which was most piteous to 
hear, they were sure to come to themselves entirely 
in that half-hour or hour, and then to make mast 
grievous and piercing cries and lamentations in the 
deep, afflicting sense of the condition they were in. 
This was much of it before the order for shutting up 
of houses were strictly put in execution, for at first 
the watchmen were not so vigorous and severe as 
they were afterward in the keeping the people in ; 
that is to say, before they were, I mean some of 
them, severely punished for their neglect, failing in 
their duty, and letting people who were under their 
care slip away, or conniving at their going abroad, 
whether sick or well. But after they saw the officers 
Appointed to examine into their conduct were re- 
solved to have them do their duty or be punished for 
the omission, they were more exact, and the people 
were strictly restrained ; which was a thing they 
took so ill and bore so impatiently that their discon- 
tents can hardly be described. But there was an 
absolute necessity for it, that must be confessed, 
unless some other measures had been timely entered 
upon, and it was too late for that. 

Had not this particular of the sick being restrained 
as above been our case at that time, London would 
have been the most dreadful place that ever was in 
the world; there would, for aught I know, have as 
many people died in the streets as died in their 
houses ; for when the distemper was at its height it 
generally made them raving and delirious, and when 
they were so they would never be persuaded to keep

in their beds but by force ; and nmny who were not 
tied threw themsefves out of windows, when they 
found they could not get leave to go out of their 
doors. 

It was for want of people conversing one with 
another, in this time of calamity, that it was impos- 
sible any particular person could come at the know- 
ledge of all the extraordinary cases that occurred in 
different families ; and particularly 1 believe it was 
never known to this day how many P^ple in their 
deliriums drowned themselves in the Thames, and in 
the river which runs from the marshes by Hackney, 
which we generally called Ware River, or Hackney 
River. As to those which were set down in the 
weekly bill, they were indeed few ; nor could it be 
known of any of those whether they drowned them- 
selves by accident or not. But I believe I might 
reckon up more who, within the compass of my 
knowledge or observation, really drowned themselves 
in that year than are put down in the bill of all put 
together, for many of the bodies were never found 
who yet were known to be lost ; and the like in 
other methods of self-destruction. There was also 
one man in or about Whitecross Street burned him- 
self to death in his bed ; some said it was done by 
himself, others that it was by the treachery of the 
nurse that attended him ; but that he had the 
plague upon him was agreed by alL 

It was a merciful disposition of Providence also, 
and which I have many times thought of at that 
time, that no fires, or no considerable ones at least, 
happened in the city during that year, which, if it 
had been otherwise, would have been very dread5il ; 
and either the people must have Iet<them alone un- 
quenched, or have come together in great crowds 
and throngs, unconcerned at the danger of the in- 
fection, not concerned at the houses theV went into,

f^t the goods they handled, or at the persons or the 
people they came funone. But so it was, that ex- 
cepting that in Crippusate parish, and two or 
three Tittle eruptions of fires, which were presently 
extinguished, there was no disaster of Uut kind 
happened in the whole year. They told us a story 
of a house in a place called Swan AlW, passing trom 
Goswell Street, near the end of Old Street, into St. 
John Street, that a family was infected there in so 
terrible a manner that every one of the house died. 
The last person lay dead on the floor, and, as it is sup- 
posed, had laid henelf all along to die just before 
the fire ; the fire, it seems, had Sdlen from its place, 
being of wood, and had taken hold of the boards 
and the joists they L^ on, and burnt as &r as just 
to the body, but had not taken hold of the dead 
body, though she had little more than her shift on, 
and had gone out of itself, not hurting the rest of 
the house, though it was a slight timber house. 
How true this nnght be I do not determine, but the 
city being to suner severely the next year by fire, 
this year it felt very little of that calamity. 

Indeed, considering the deliriums which the agony 
threw people into, and how I have mention^ in 
their madness, when they were alone, they did many 
despoate things, it was very strange there were no 
more disasters of that kind. 

It has been frequently asked me, and I cannot say 
that I ever knew bow to give a direct answer to it, 
how it came to pass that so many infected people 
appeared abroad in the streets at tne same time that 
the houses which were infected were so vigilantly 
searched, and all of them shut up and guarded as 
they were. 

I confess I know not what answer to give to tiiis, 

unless it be this, that in so great and populous a 

city as this is it was impossible to discover every

house that was infected b& soon as it was so, or to shut 
up all the houses that were infected ; so that people 
bad the liberty of going about the streets, even where 
thev pleased, unless they were known to belong to 
such-and-such infected bouses. 

It is true that, as several physicians told my Lord 
Mayor, the Airy of the contagion was such at some 
particular times, and people sickened so fast and died 
so soon, that it was impossible, and indeed to no 
purpose, to go about to inquire who was sick 
and who was well, or to shut them up with such 
exactness as the thing required, almost every house 
in a whole street being infected, and in many places 
every peraon in some of the houses ; and that which 
was still worse, by the time that the houses were 
known to be infected, most of the persons infected 
would be stone dead, and the rest run away for fear 
of being shut up ; so that it was to very small pur- 
pose to call them infected houses and shut them up, 
the infection having ravaged and taken its leave of 
the bouse before it was really known that the family 
was any way touched. 

This mi^t be sufficient to convince any reason- 
able person, that as it was not in the power of the 
magistrates, or of any human methods of policy, to 
prevent the spreading the infection, so that this way 
of shutting up of houses was peifectly insufficient for 
that end. Indeed it seemed to have no manner of 
public good in it, equal or proportionable to the 
grievous burden that it was to the particular families 
that were so shut up ; and, as &r as I was employed 
by the public in directing that seventy, I frequently 
found occasion to see that it was incapable of answer- 
ing the end. For example, as I was desired, as a 
visitor or examiner, to inquire into the particulars 
of several families which were infected, we scarce 
came to auy house where the plague had visibly ap-

peared in the family but that some of the family 
were fled and gone. The magistrates would resent 
this, and chai^ the examiners with being remiss in 
their examination or inspection. But by that means 
houses were long infected before it was known. 
Now, as I was in this dangerous office but half the 
appointed time, which was two months, it was long 
enough to inform myself that we were no way capa- 
ble of coming at the knowledge of the true state of 
any family but by inquiring at the door or of the 
neighbours. As for going into every bouse to 
search, that was a part no authority would ofler to 
impose on the inhabitants, or any citizen would 
undertake, for it would have been exposing us to 
certain infection and death, and to the luin of our 
own families, as well as of ourselves ; nor would any 
citizen of probity, and that could be depended upon, 
have stayed in the town, if they had been made 
liable to such a severity. 

Seeing then that we could come at the certainty 
of things by no method but that of inquiry of the 
neighbours or of the family, and on that we could 
not justly depend, it was not possible but that the 
uncertainty of this matter would remain as above. 

It is true masters of families were bound by the 
order to give notice to the examiner of the place 
wherein he lived, within two hours after he should 
discover it, of any person being sick in his house, 
that is to say, having signs of the infection, but they 
found so many ways to evade this and excuse their 
Diligence that they seldom gave that notice till 
they nad taken measures to have every one escape 
out of the house who had a mind to escape, whether 
they were sick or sound ; and white this was so, it is 
easy to see that the shutting up of houses was no 
way to be depended upon as a sufficient method for 
putting a stop to the infection, because, as I have

said elsewhere, many of those that so went out of 
those infected houses had the plaeue really upon 
th^ti, Uiough they might really think thems^ves 
sound. And some of these were the people that 
walked the streets till they fell down dead, not that 
they were suddenly struck with the distemper as 
with a buUet that killed wiUi the stroke, but that 
th^ really had the infection in their blood long 
before ; only, that as it preyed secretly on the vitals, 
it appeared not till it seized the heart with a mortal 
power, and the patient died in a moment, as with a 
sudden fainting or an apoplectic fit. 

I know that some even of our physicians thought 
for a time that those people that so died in the 
streets were seized but that moment they fell, as if 
they had been touched by a stroke from heaven, as 
men are killed by a flash of lightning, but they found 
reason to alter their opinion afterwards; for upon 
examining the bodies of such after they were dead, 
tiiey always either had tokens upon them or other 
evident proofs of the distemper having been longer 
upon them than they had otherwise expected. 

This often was thie reason that, as I have said, we 
that were examiners were not able to come at the 
knowledge of the infection being entered into a house 
till it was too late to shut it up, and sometimes not 
till the people that were left were all dead. In Petti- 
coat L^e two houses together were infected, and 
several people sick ; but ^e distemper was so well 
concealed, tne examiner, who was my neighbour, got 
no knowledge of it till notice was sent him that the 
people were all dead, and that the carts should call 
there to fetch them away. The two heads of the 
families concerted their measures, and so ordered 
their matters as that when the examiner was in the 
neighbourhood they appeared generally at a time, 
ana answered, that is, lied, for one another, or got

some of the neightmurhood to say they vere all in 
health, and, perhaps, knew no better, till, death 
making it impossible to keep it any longer as a 
secret, the d^d-carts were <»lled in the night to 
both the houses, and so it became public But 
when the examiner ordered the constable to shut up 
the houses there wa^ nobody left in them but three 
people, two in one house, and one in the other, jiist 
dying, and a nurse in each house, who acknowletu^ 
that they had buried five before, that the houses had 
been infected nine or ten days, and that for all the 
rest of the two families, which were many, they 
were gone, some sick, some well, or whether sick or 
well could not be known. 

In like manner, at another house in the same 
lane, a man having his family infected, but very un- 
willing to be shut up, when be could conceal it no 
longer, shut up himself; that is to say, he set the 
great red cross upon his door, with the words, " Lord 
nave mercy upon us," and so deluded the esaminer,who 
supposed it had been done by the constable, by order 
of the other examiner, for there were two examines 
to every district or precinct. By this means he had 
free egress and regress into his house again, and out 
of it, as he pleased, notwithstanding it was infected, 
till at length his stratagem was found out, and then 
he, with the sound part of his servants and &mily, 
made ofT and escaped, so they were not shut up 
at all. 

These things made it very hard, if not impossible, 
as I have said, to prevent the spreading of an infec- 
tion by the shutting up of houses, unless the people 
would think the shutting of their houses no 
grievance, and be so willing to have it done as that 
they would give notice duly and faithfully to the 
magistrates of their being infected, as soon as it was 
known by themselves ; but as that cannot be expected

from tliem, and the examiners cannot be suppoeed^ 
as above, to go into their houses to visit and search, 
all the good of shutting up houses will be defeated, 
and few houses will be shut up in time, except those 
of the poor, who cannot conceal it, and of some 
people who will be discovered by the terror and con- 
sternation which the thing put them into. 

I got myself discharged of the dangerous office I 
was in as scran as I could get another admitted, whom 
I had obtained for a little money to accept of it ; and 
so, instead of serving the two months, which was 
directed, I was not above three weeks in it ; and a 
great while too, considering it was in the month of 
August, at which time the distemper began to rage 
with great violence at our end of tne town. 

In the execution of this office I could not refrain 
speaking my opinion among my neighbours as to 
tiiia shutting up the people in their houses ; in which 
we saw most evidently the severities that were used, 
though grievous in themselves, had also this partic- 
ular objection against them, namely, that they did 
flot answer the end, as I have said, but that the dis- 
tempered people went day by day about the streets ; 
and it was our united opinion that a method to have 
removed the sound from the sick, in case of a par- 
ticular house being visited, would have been much 
more reasonable on many accounts, leaving nobody 
with the sick persons but such as should, on such 
occasion, request to stay and declare themselves 
content to be shut up with them. 

Our scheme for removing those that were sound 
from those that were sick was only in such houses as 
were infected, and confining the sick was no confine- 
ment; those that could not stir would not com- 
plain while they were in their senses, and while 
they had the power of judging. Indeed, when 
they came to be delirious and light-headed, then 
[196]

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

they would cry out of the cruelty of being con- 
fined ; but for the removal of those that were well, 
we thought it highly reasonable and just, for 
their own sakes, they should be removed from the 
sick, and that, for other peopled safety, they should 
keep retired for a while, to see that they were 
sound, and might not infect others ; and we thought 
twenty or thirty days enou^ for this. 

Now, certainly, if houses bad been pro\-ided on 
purpose for those that were sound to perform this 
demiquarantine in, they would havemucn less reason 
to think themselves injured in such a restraint than 
in being confined with infected people in the houses 
where they lived. 

It is here, however, to be observed that after the 
funerals became so many that people could not toll 
the bell, mourn or weep, or wear black for one 
another, as they did before; no, nor so much as 
make coffins for those that died ; so after a while 
the fury of the infection appeared to be so increased 
that, in short, they shut up no houses at all. It 
seemed enough tJiat all the remedies of that kind 
had been used till they were found fruitless, and that 
the plague spread itself with an irresistible fury ; so 
that as the fire the succeeding year spread itself, and 
burned with such violence that the citizens, in de- 
spair, gave over their endeavours to extinguish it, so 
in the plague it came at last to such violence that 
the people sat still looking at one another, and 
seemed quite abandoned to despair; whole streets 
seemed to be desolated, and not to be shut up only, 
but to be emptied of their inhabita.nts ; doors were 
led open, windows stood shattering with the wind 
in empty houses for want of people to shut them. 
• In a word, people began to give up themselves to 
their fears, and to think that all regulations and 
methods were in vain, and that there was nothing

A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR 

to be hoped for but ao universal desolation ; and it 
was even in the height of this general despair that it 
pleased God to stay His hand, and to slacken the 
fury of the contagion in such a manner as was even 
surprising, like its banning, and demonstrated it to 
be His own particular hand, and that above, if not 
without the agency of means, as I shall take notice 
of in its proper place. 

But I must still speak of the plague as in its 
height, raging even to desolation, and the people 
under the most dreadful consternation, even, as I 
have said, to despair. It is hardly credible to what 
excesses the passions of men carried them in this ex- 
tremity of the distemper, and this part, I think, was 
as moving as the rest What could aSect a man in 
his full power of reflection, and what could make 
deeper impressions on the soul, than to see a man 
almost naked, and got out of his house, or perhaps 
out of his bed, into the street, come out of Harrow 
Alley, a populous conjunction or collection of alleys, 
courts, and passages in the Butcher Kow in White- 
chapel, — I say, what could be more affecting than 
to see this poor man come out into the open street, 
run dancing and singing, and making a thousand 
antic gestures, with five or six women and children 
running after him, crying and calling upon him for 
the Lord's sake, to come back, and entreating the 
help of others to biing him back, but all in vain, 
nobody daring to lay a hand upon him or to come 
near him ? 

, This was a most grievous and afflicting thing to 
me, who saw it all from my own windows ; fra* all 
this while the poor aiflicted man was, as I observed 
it, even then m the utmost agony of pun, having, 
as they said, two swellings upon him, which coulda 
Dot be brought to break or to suppurate ; but, by 
laying strong caustics on them, the surgeons had, it

seems, hopes to break them, which caustics were 
then upon him, burning his flesh as with a hot iron. 
I cannot say what became of this poor man, but I 
think he continued roving about in that nuuiner till 
he fell down and died. 

No wonder the aspect of the city itself was fright- 
ful. The usual concourse of people in the streets, 
and which used to be supplied &om our end of the 
town, was abated. The Exchange was not kept 
shut, indeed, but it was no more frequented. Tne 
fires were lost ; they had been almost extinguished 
for some days by a very smart and hasty rain. But 
that was not all ; some of the physicians insisted 
that they were not onlyno benefit, out injurious to 
the healui of people. This they made a loud clamor 
about, and compuuned to the Lord Mayor about it 
On the other hand, others of the same faculty, and 
eminent too, opposed them, and gave their reasons 
why the fires were, and must be, useful to assuage 
the violence of the distemper. J cannot give a full 
account of their argument on both sides ; only this 
I remember, that they cavilled very much with one 
another. Some were for fires, but that they must 
be made of wood and not coal, and of particular 
sorts of wood too, such as fir in particular, or cedar, 
because of the strong effluvia of turpentine ; others 
were for coal and not wood, because of the sulphur 
and bitumen ; and others were for neither one or 
other. Upon the whole, the Lord Mayor ordered 
no more fires, and especially on this account, namely, 
that the plague was so fierce that they saw evidently 
it defied all means, and rather seemed to increase 
than decrease upon any application to check and 
abate it ; and yet this amazement of the magistrates 
proceeded rather from want of being able to apply 
any means successfully than from any unwillingness 
eitner to expose themselves or undertake the care and

weight of business ; for, to do them justice, they 
neiUier spared their pains or their persons. But 
nothing answered; the infection raged, and the 
people were now frighted and terriliea to the last 
d^ree, so that, as I may say, they gave themselves 
up, and, as I mentioned above, abandoned them- 
selves to their despair. 

But let me observe here, that when I say the 
people abandoned themselves to despair, I do not 
mean to what men call a religious despair, or a de- 
spair of their eternal state, but I mean a despair of 
their being able to escape the infection or to outlive 
the plague, which, they saw, was so raging and so 
irresistible in its force, that indeed few people that 
were touched with it in its height, about August and 
September, escaped ; and, which is very pai-ticular, 
contrary to its ordinary operation in June and July, 
and the banning of August, when, as I have ob- 
served, many were infected, and continued so many 
days, and then went ofT, after having had the poison 
in their blood a long time ; but now, on the contrary, 
most of the people who were taken dunng the two 
last weeks in August, and in the three fii^t weeks in 
S^tember, generally died in two or three days at 
furthest, and many the very same day they were 
taken ; whether the dog-days, or, as our astrologers 

Sretended to express themselves, jbe influence of the 
og-star had that malignant effect, or all those who 
had the seeds of infection before in them brought it 
up to a maturity at that time altogether, I know not ; 
but this was tne time when it was reported, that 
above 3000 people died in one night ; and they that 
would have us oelieve they more critically ob^rved 
it pretend to say that they all died within the space 
of two hours, viz., between the hours of one and 
three in the morning.

time, more than before, there vere innumerable in- 
stances of it, and I could name several in my neigh- 
bourhood. One family without the Bars, and not 
far from me, were all seemingly well on the Monday, 
being ten in family. That evening one maid and 
one apprentice were taken ill, and died the next 
morning, when the other apprentice and two children 
were touched, whereof one died the same evening, 
and the other two on Wednesday. In a word, by 
Saturday at noon the master, mistress, four children, 
and four servants were all gone, and the house left 
entirely empty, except an ancient woman who came 
in to take cnaige of the goods for the master of the 
&mily's brother, who lived not far off, and who had 
not been sick. 

Many houses were then left desolate, all the people 
being carried away dead ; and espedally in an alley 
&rther on the same side beyond the Bars, going in 
at the sign of Moses and Aaron, there were several 
houses tiwether, which, they said, had not one person 
left alive in th«n, and some that died last in several 
of those houses were left a little too long before they 
were fetched out to be buried ; the reason of which 
was not, as some have written, very untruly, that the 
living were not suflicient to bury the dead, but that 
the mortality was so great in the yard or alley that 
there was noixxly left to give notice to the buners or 
sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be 
buried. It was said, how true I know not, that some 
of those bodies were so much corrupted and so rotten 
that it was with difficulty they were carried ; and as 
the carts could not come any nearer than to the 
Alley Gate in the High Street, it was so much the 
more difficult to bring them along; but I am not 
certain how muiy bodies were then left. I am sure 
that ordinarily it was not so. 

As I have mentioned how the people were brought

into a condition to despfur of life and abandon them- 
selves, so this very thing had a strange effect among 
UB for three or lour weeks ; that is, it made them 
bold and venturous, they were no more shy of one 
pother, or restrained within doors, but went any- 
where and everywhere, and b^an to converse. One 
would say to another, " I do not ask you how you 
are, or say how I am ; it is certain we shall alt go ; 
so 'tis no matter who is sick or who is sound ;^ 
and so they ran desperately into any place or any 
company. 

A^ it brought the people into public company, so 
it was surprising how it brought them to crowd into 
the churt^ies. They inquired no more into whom 
they sat near to or far from, what offensive smells 
they met with, or what condition the people seemed 
to be in, but looking upon themselves all as so many 
dead corpses, they come to the churches without the 
least caution, and crowded together, as if their lives 
were of no consequence compared to the work which 
they came about there. Indeed, the zeal which they 
showed in coming, and the earnestness and affection 
they showed in their attention to what they heard, 
made it manifest what a value people would all put 
upon the worship of God if they tnought every day 
they attended at the church that it would be their 
last 

Nor was it without other strange effects, for it 
took away all manner of prejudice at or scruple about 
the person whom they found in the pulpit when 
they came to the churches. It cannot be doubted 
but that maiiy of the ministers of the parish churches 
were cut off, among others, in so common and dread- 
ful a calamity ; and others had not courage enough 
to stand it, but removed into the country as they 
found means for escape. As then some parish 
churches were quite vacant and forsaken, the people

made no scruple of desiring such Dissenters as had 
been a few years before deprived of their livings by 
virtue of the Act of ParHament called the Act of 
Uniformity to preach in the churches ; nor did the 
church ministers in that case make any difficulty of 
accepting their assistance ; so that many of those 
whom they called silenced ministers had their mouths 
opened on this occasion and preached publicly to the 
people. 

Here we may observe, and I hope it will not be 
amiss to take notice of it, that a near view of death 
would soon reconcile men of good principles one to 
another, and that it is chiefly owing to our easy 
situation in life and our putting these things far 
from us that our breaches are fomented, ill blood 
continued, prejudices, breach of charity and of 
Christian union, so much kept and so far carried on 
among us as it is. Anotner plague year would 
reconcile all these differences ; a close conversing 
with death, or with diseases that threaten death, 
would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the 
animosities among us, and bring us to see with 
differing eyes than those which we looked on things 
with before. As the people who had been used to 
join with the Church were reconciled at this time 
with the admitting the Dissenters to preach to them, 
so the Dissenters, who with an uncommon prejudice 
had broken off from the communion of the Church 
of England, were now content to come to their parish 
churches, and to conform to the worship which they 
did not approve of before ; but as the terror of the 
infection aoated, those things all returned again to 
their less desirable channel, and to the course they 
were in before. 

I mention this but historically. I have no mind 

to enter into arguments to move either or both sides 

to a more charitable compliance one with another,

I do not see that it is probable such a discourse 
would be either suitable or successful ; the breaches 
seem rather to widen, and tend to a widening fur- 
ther, than to closing, and who am I that I should 
think myself able to influence either one side or 
other ? But this I may repeat again, that tis evi- 
dent death will reconcile us all ; on the other side 
the grave we shall he all brethren again. In heaven, 
whither I hope we may come from all parties and 
persuasions, we shall find neither prejudice or 
scruple ; there we shall be of one principle and of 
one opinion. Why we cannot be content to go hand 
in hand to the place where we shall join heart and 
hand without the least hesitation, and with the 
most complete harmony and affection, — I say, why 
we cannot do so here 1 can say nothing to, neither 
shall I say anything more of it but that it remains 
to be lamented. 

I could dwell a great while upon the calamities 
of this dreadful time, and go on' to describe the ob- 
jects that appeared among us every day, iiie dread- 
ful extravagancies which the distraction of sick 
people drave them into; bow the streets began now 
to be fuller of frightful objects, and families to be 
made even a terror to themselves. But after I have 
told you, as I have above, that one man. being tied 
in his bed, and finding no other way to deliver him- 
self, set the bed on lire with his candle, which un- 
happily stood within his reach, and burnt himself 
in his bed ; and how another, by the insufferable 
torment he bore, danced and sung naked in the 
streets not knowing one ecstasy from another; I 
say, after I have mentioned these things, what can 
be added more? What can be said to represent 
the misery of these times more lively to the reader, 
or to give him a more perfect idea of a complicated 
distress ?

I must acknowledge that thia time was terrible, 
that I was sometimes at the end of all my resolu- 
tions, and that I had not the coura^ that 1 had at 
the beginning. As the extremity brought other 
people abroad, it drove me home, and except having 
made my voyi^ down to Blackwall and Gre^iwich, 
as I have related, which was an excursion, I kept 
afterwards vety much within doo:^, as I had n>r 
about a fortnight before. I have said already that 
I repented several times that I had ventured U> stay 
in town, and had not gone away with my brother 
and his family, but it was too late for that now ; and 
after I had retreated and stayed within doors a good 
while before my impatience led me abroad, then 
they called me, as I have said, to an ugly and dan- 
gerous office, which brought me out again ; but as 
that was expired while the height of the distemper 
lasted, I retired again, and continued close ten or 
twelve days more, during which many dismal spec- 
tacles represented themselves in my view, out of my 
own windows and in our own street, as that particu- 
larly from Harrow AUey, of the poor outrageous 
creature which danced and sung in his agony ; and 
many others there were. Scarce a day or night 
passed over but some dismal thing or other happened 
at the end of that Harrow Alley, which was a place 
full of poor people, most of them belonging to the 
butchers, or to employments depending upon the 
butchery. 

Sometimes heaps and throngs of people would 
burst out of the alley, most of them women, mak- 
ing a dreadful clamour, mixed or compounded of 
screeches, cryings, and calling one another, that we 
could not conceive what to make of it. Almost alt 
the dead part of the night the dead-cart stood at 
the end of that alley, for if it went in it could not 
well turn again, and could go in but a little way.

There, I stty, it stood to receive dead bodies, and as 
the churchvfttd was but a little way off, if it went 
away full it would soon be back again. It is im- 
possible to describe the most horrible cries and noise 
the poor people would make at their bringing the 
dead bodies of their children and friends out of the 
cart, and by the number one would have thought 
there had been none left behind, or that there were 
people enough for a small aty living in those 
places. Several times they criecf " Muider," some- 
times " I^re ; " but it was easy to perceive it was all 
distraction, and the complaints of distressed and dis- 
tempered people. 

I oelieve it was everywhere thus at that time, for 
the plague raged for six or seven weeks beyond all 
that I nave expressed, and came even to sudi a 
height that, in the extremity, they b^an to break 
into that excellent order of which I have spoken so 
much in behalf of the magistrates, namely, that no 
dead bodies were seen in the streets or burials in 
the daytime, for there was a necessity in this ex- 
tremity to bear with its being otherwise for a little 
while. 

One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I 
thought it was extraordinary, at least it seemed a 
remarkable hand of Divine justice, viz., that all the 
predictors, astrologers, fortune-tellers, and what they 
called cunning-men, conjurers, and the like ; calcula- 
tors of nativities and dreamers of dreams, and such 
people, were gone and vanished ; not one of them 
was to be found. I am verily persuaded that a 
^reat number of them fell in the heat of the calam- 
ity, having ventured to stay upon the prospect of 
getting great estates ; and indeed their gain was 
but too great for a time, through the madness and 
folly of the people. But now they were silent; 
many of them went to their long home, not able

to foretell their owd &te or to calculate their own 
nativities. Some have been critical enough to aay 
that every one of them died. I dare not affirm 
that; hut this I must own, that I never beard of 
one of them that ever appeared after the calamity 
was over. 

But to return to my particular observations during 
this dreadful part of the visitation. I am now come, 
as I have said, to the month of September, which 
was the most dreadful of its kind, I believe, that ever 
London saw ; for, by all the accounts which I have 
seen of the preceding visitations which have been 
in London, nothing has been like it, the number in 
the weekly bill amounting to almost 40,000 from the 
22nd of August to the Soth of September, being but 
five weeks. The particulars of the bills are as foUows,

This was a prodigious number of itself, but if I 
should add the reasons which I have to believe that 
this account was deficieut, and how deficient it was, 
you would, with me, make no scruple to j>el'eve that 
there died above ten thousand a week for eil those 
weeks, one week with another, and a moportion for 
several weeks both before and after. The confusion 
among the people, especially within the city at that 
time, was inexpressible. The terror was so great at 
last that the courage of the people appointed to 
carry away the deadmgan to fail tnem ; nay, several 
of them died, although they had the distemper before 
and were recovered, and some of them dropped down

when they have heen carrying the bodies even at the 
pit side, and just ready to throw them in ; and this 
confusion was greater in the city, because they had 
flattered themselves with hopes of escaping, and 
thought the bitterness of death was past. One cart, 
they told us, going up Shoreditch was forsaken of 
the drivers, or Ming left to one man to drive, he died 
in the street, and tae horses going on, overthi'ew the 
cart, and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some 
there, in a dismal manner. Another cart was, it 
seems, found in the great pit in Finsbury Fields, the 
driver being dead, or having been gone and aban- 
doned it, and the horses running too near it, the 
cart fell in and drew the horses in also. It was 
euf^ested that the driver was thrown in with it, and 
that the cart fell upon him, by reason his whip was 
seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I 
suppose, could not be certain. 

In our parish of Aldsate the dead-carts were 
several times, as I have neard, found standing at 
the churchyard gate full of dead bodies, but neither 
bellman or driver or any one else with it ; neither in 
these or many other cases did they know what bodies 
they had in their cart, for sometimes they were let 
down with ropes out of balconies and out of windows, 
and sometimes the bearers brought them to the cart, 
sometimes other people ; nor, as the men themselves 
said, did they trotihle themselves to keep any ac- 
count of the numbers. 

The vigilance of the magistrates was now put to 
the utmost trial, and, it must be confessed, can 
never be enough acknowledged on this occasion also ; 
whatever expense or trouble they were at, two things 
were never neglected in the city or suburbs either — 

(1.) Provisions were always to be had in full 
plenty, and the price not much raised neither, 
hardly worth speaking. 

[208]

(S.) No dead bodies lay unburied or uncovered; 
and if one walked from one end of the city to 
another, no funeral or sign of it was to be seen in 
the daytime, except a little, as I have said above, 
in the three firet weeks in September. 

This last article perhaps will hardly be believed 
when some account which others have published 
since that shall be seen, wherein they say that the 
dead lay unburied, which I am assured was utterly 
false; at least, if it had been anywhere so, it must 
have been in houses where the living were gone from 
the dead, having found means, as I nave observed, to 
escape, and where no notice was given to the officers. 
All which amounts to nothing at all in the case in 
hand ; for this I am positive in, having myself been 
employed a little in the direction of that part in the 
parish in which I lived, and where as great a desola- 
tion was made in proportion to the number of in- 
habitants as was anywhere ; — I say, I am sure that 
there were no dead Dodies remained unburied ; that 
is to say, none that the proper officers knew of; none 
for want of people to carry them off, and buriers to 
put them into tbe ground and cover them ; and this 
IS sufficient to the ailment ; for what might lie in 
houses and holes, as in Moses and Aaron Alley, is 
nothing ; for it is most certain they were buried as 
soon as they were found. As to the firat article, 
namely, of provisions, the scarcity or deamess, 
though I have mentioned it before, and shall speak of 
it again^et I must observe here — 

(1.) Itie price of bread in particular was not 
much raised ; for in the beginning of the year, viz., 
in the first week in March, the penny wheaten loaf 
was ten ounces and a half; and in the height of the 
contagion it was to be had at nine ounces and a 
half, and never dearer, no, not all that season. And 
about the beginning of November it was sold ten

ounces and a half again ; the I Jke of which, I believe, 
was never heard of in any city, under so dreadful a 
visitation, before. 

(2.) Neither was there (which I wondered much at) 
any want of bakers or ovens kept open to supply the 
people with bread ; but this was indeed allied by 
some families, viz., that their maid-servants, going 
to the bakehouses with their dough to be baked, 
which was then the custom, sometimes came home 
with the sickness, that is to say, the plague upon 
them. 

In all this dreadful visitation there were, as I 
have said before, but two pest-houses made use of, 
viz., one in the fields beyond Old Street and one in 
Westminster; neither was there any compulsion 
used in carrying people thither. Indeed there was 
no need of compulsion in the case, for there were 
thousands of poor distressed people who, having no 
help, or conveniences, or suppUes but of charity, 
would have been very glad to have been carried 
thither and been taken care of, which, indeed, was 
the only thing that I think was wanting in the whole 

Eublic management of the city, seeing nobody was 
ere allowed to be brought to the pest-house but 
where money was given, or security for money, 
either at their introducing or upon their being 
cured and sent out, for very many were sent out 
again whole ; and very good physicians were ap- 
pointed to those places, so that many people did 
very well there, of which I shall make mention again. 
The principal sort of people sent thither were, as I 
have said, servants who got the distemper by going 
of errands to fetch necessaries to the families where 
they lived, and who in that case, if they came home 
sick, were removed to preserve the rest of the house ; 
and they were so well looked after there, in alt the 
time of the visitation, that there was but 156 buried 
[210]

in all at the London pest-house, and 159 at that of 
Westminster. 

By havine more pest-houses I am far from meaning 
a forcing all people into such places. Had the shut- 
ting up of houses been omitted and the sick hurried 
out of their dwellings to pest-houses, as some pro- 
posed, it seems, at that time as well as since, itwould 
certainly have been much worse than it was. The 
very removing the sick would have been a spreading 
of the infection, and the rather because that remov- 
ing could not effectually clear the house where the 
stcK peison was of the distemper, and the rest of the 
family, being then left at liberty, would certainly 
spread it among others. 

The methods also in private families, which would 
have been universally used to have concealed the 
distemper, and to have concealed the pei'sons being 
sick, would have been such that the distemper would 
sometimes have seized a whole family before any 
visitors or examiners could have known of it. On 
the other hand, the prodigious numbers which would 
have been sick at a bme would have exceeded all the 
capacity of public pest-houses to receive them, or of 
puoUc officers to discover and remove them. 

This was well considered in those days, and I have 
heard them talk of it often. The magistrates had 
enough to do to bring people to submit to having 
their houses shut up, and many ways they deceived 
the watchmen and got out, as I have observed. But 
that difficulty made it apparent that thev would 
have found it impracticable to have gone the othei' 
way to work, for they could never have forced the 
sick people out of their beds and out of their dwell- 
ings. It must not have been my Lord Mayor's 
officers, but an army of officers that must nave 
attempted it ; and the people, on the other hand, 
would have been enraged and desperate, and would

have killed those that should have offered to have 
meddled with them or with their children and rela- 
tions, Whatever had befallen them for it ; so that 
they would have made the people, who, as it was, 
were in the most terrible distraction , imaginable, 
— I say, they would have made them stark mad; 
whereas the ma^strates found it proper on several 
accounts to treat them with lenity and compassion, 
and not with violence and terror, such as dra^ng 
the sick out of their houses, or obliging them to 
remove themselves, would have been. 

This leads me again to mention the time when the 
plague fitst began, that is to say, when it became 
certain that it would spread over the whole town, 
when, as I have said, the better sort of people first 
took the alarm, and began to hurry themselves out 
of town. It was true, as I observed in its place, that 
the throng was so great, and the coaches, horses, 
wagons, and carts were so many, driving and drag- 
ging the people away, that it looked as ifall the city 
was running away ; and had any regulations been 
published uiat had been terrifying at that time, 
especially such as would pretend to dispose of the 
people otherwise than they would dispose of them- 
selves, it would have put both the city and suburbs 
into the utmost confusion. 

But the magistrates wisely caused the people to be 
encouraged, made very good bye-laws for the r^u- 
lating the citizens, keeping good order in the streets, 
and making everything as eligible as possible to all 
sorts of people. 

In the first place, the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs, 
the Court of Aldermen, and a certain number of the 
Common Council men, or their deputies, came to a 
resolution and published it, viz., that they would 
not quit the city themselves, but that they would be 
always at hand for the preserving good order in every

place and for the doing justice on all occasions; as 
also for the distributing the public charity to the 
poor ; and, in a word, for the doing the duty and 
dischat^ng the trust reposed in them by the citizens 
to the utmost of their power- 
In pursuance of these orders, the Lord Mayor, 
sheriffs, &c., held councils every day more or less, 
for making such dispositions as they found needful 
for preserving the civil peace ; and though they used 
the people with all possible gentleness and clemency, 
yet all manner of presumptuous rogues, such as 
thieves, housebreakers, plunderers of the dead or of 
the sick, were duly punished, and several declarations 
were continually published by the Lord Mayor and 
Court of Aldermen against such. 

Also all constables and churchwardens were en- 
joined to stay in the city upon severe penalties, or to 
depute such able and sufficient housekeepers as the 
deputy aldermen or Common Council men of the 
precinct should approve, and for whom they should 
give security ; and also security in case of mortality, 
that they would forthwith constitute other constables 
in their stead. 

'ITiese things re-established the minds of the peo- 
ple very much, especially in the flrst of their fngbt, 
when they talked of making so universala flight that 
the city would have been in danger of being entirely 
deserted of its inhabitants, except the poor, and the 
country of being plundered and laid waste by the 
multitude. Nor were the magistrates deficient in 
performing their part as boldly as they promised it ; 
for my Lord Mayor and the sheriffs were continually 
in the streets, and at places of the greatest danger, 
and though they did not care for having too great a 
resort of people crowding about them, yet in emer- 
gent cases they never denied the people access to 
them, and heard with patience all their grievances

and complaints. My Lord Mayor had a low gallery 
built on purpose in his hall, where he stood a little 
removed from the crowd whec any complaint came 
to be heard, that he might appear with as much 
safety as possible. 

Likewise the proper officers, called iny Lord 
Mayor's officers, constantly attended in their turns, 
as they were in waiting ; and if any of them were 
sick or infected, as some of them were, others were 
instantly employed to fill up and officiate in their 

filaces, till it was known whether the other should 
ive or die. 

In like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in 
their several stations and wards, where they were 
placed by office, and the sheriffs' officers or sergeants 
were appointed to receive orders from the respective 
aldermen in their turn, so that justice was executed 
in all cases without interruption. In the next place, 
it was one of their particular cares to see the orders 
for the freedom of the markets oliserved, and in this 
part either the Lord Mayor or one or both of the 
sheriffs were every market-day on horseback to see 
their orders executed, and to see that the country 
people liad all possible encouragement and freedom in 
their coming to the markets and going back again, 
and that no nuisances or Iriglitful objects should be 
seen in the streets to terrify them or make them un- 
willing to come. Also the Itakers were taken under 
particular order, and the Master of the Bakers' Com- 
pany was, with his court of assistants, directed to 
see the order of my Lord Mayor for their regulation 
put in execution, and the due assize of bread, which 
was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor, ol)served, 
and all the Ixakers were obliged to keep their ovens 
going constantly, on pain of losing the pHvil^es of 
a fr^man of the city of London. 

By this means bread was always to be had in plenty,

and as cheap as usual, as I said above; and pro- 
visions were never wanting in the markets, even to 
such a degree that I often wondered at it, and re- 
proached mjself with being so timorous and cautious 
. in stirring abroad, when the country people came 
freely and boldly to market, as if there had been no 
manner of infection in the city, or danger of catch- 
ing it- 
It was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in 
the said magistrates that the streets were k«)t con- 
stantly clear, and free from ail manner of frightful 
object, dead bodies, or any such things as were inde- 
cent or unpleasant, unless where anybody fell down 
suddenly or died in the streets, as I nave said above, 
and these were generally covered with some cloth 
or blanket, or removed into the next churchyard, 
till night. All the needfiil works that carriea ter- 
ror with them, that were both dismal and dangerous, 
were done in the night ; if any diseased bodies were 
removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected clothes 
burnt, it was done in the night ; and all the bodies 
which were thrown into the great pits in the several 
churchyards or burying-grounds, as has been ob- 
served, were so removed in the night, and everything 
was covered and closed before day. So that in the 
daytime there was not the least signal of the calam- 
i^ to be seen or heard of, except what was to be 
observed from the emptiness of the streets, and 
sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamen- 
tations of the people, out at their windows, and 
from the numbers of houses and shops shut up. 

Nor was the silence and emptiness of the streets 
so much in the city as in the out-parts, except just 
at one particular time, when, as I have mentioned, 
the pltu^ue came east and spread over all the city. 
It was indeed a merciful disposition of God, that as 
the plague began at one end of the town first, as

has been observed at large, so it proceeded progres- 
sively to other parts, and did not come on tab way, 
or eastward, tiU it had spent its fury in the west 
part of the town ; and so, as it came on one wav, it 
abated another. For example, it began at St. GileG''s 
and the Westminster end of the town, and it was in ' 
its height in all that part by about the middle of July, 
viz., in St. Giles-in-the-Fields, St Andrew's, Hol- 
bom, St. Clement Danes, St. Marti n-in-the-Fields, 
and in Westminster. The latter end of July it de- 
creased in those parishes ; and coming east it in- 
creased prodigiously in Cripplegate, St Sepulchre's, 
St James's, Oerkenwell, and St Bride's and Alden- 
gate. While it was in all these parishes, the city 
and all the parishes of the Southwark side of the 
water, and all Stepney, Whitechapel, Aldgate, Wap- 
ping and Ratcliff, were very little touched, so that 
people went about their business unconcerned, car- 
ried on their trades, kept open their shops, and con- 
versed freely with one another in all the city, the east 
and north-east suburbs, and in Southwark, almost as 
if the plague had not been among us. 

Even when the north and north-west suburbs were 
fully infected, viz., Cripplegate, Clerkenwell, Bishops- 
gate, and Shoreditch, yet still all the rest were toler- 
ably well. For example, from ^th July to 1st 
August the bill stood thus of all diseases ; —

So that, in short, there died more that week in the 
two parishes of Crippl^ate and St. Sepulchre by 
forty-eight than in all the city, all the east suburbs, 
and alt the Southwark parishes put together. This 
caused the reputation of the city s health to continue 
all over Endand, and especially in the counties and 
markets adjacenl^ from whence our supply of provi- 
sions chiefly came, even much longer than that health 
itself continued ; for when the people came into the 
streets from the country by Shoreditch and Bishops- 
gate, or by Old Street and Smithfield, they would 
see the out-streets empty and the houses and shops 
shut, and the few people that were stiiring there 
walk in the middle of the streets. But when they 
came within the citv, there things looked better, and 
the markets and snope were open, and the people 
walking about the streets as usual, tbou^ not quite 
so many ; and this continued till the latter em of 
August and the banning of September. 

But then the case altered quite; the distemper 
abated in the west and north-west parishes, and the 
weight of the infection lay on the aty and the east- 
em suburbs, and the Southwark side, and this in a 
frightful manner. 

Then, indeed, the city b^an to look dismal, shops 
to be shut, and the streets desolate. In the High 
Street, indeed, necessity made people stir abroad on 
many occasions ; and there would be in the middle 
of the day a pretty many people, but in the mornings 
and evenings scarce any to be seen, even there, no, 
not in Comhill and Chespside. 

These observations of mine were abundantly con- 
firmed by the weekly bills of mortality for those 
weeks, an abstract of which, as they respect the 
parishes which I have mentioned, and as they make 
the calculations I speak of very evident, take as 
follows.

Here is a strange change of things indeed, and a 

sad change it was, and had it held for two months 
more than it did, very few people would have been 
left alive. But then such, I say, was the merciful 
disposition of God, that when it was thus the west 
and north part, which had been so dreadfully visited 
at first, grew, as you see, much better ; and as the 
people disappeared here, they b^an to look abroad 
again there ; and the next week or two altered it

And now the misery of the city, and of the said 
east aiid south parts, was complete indeed ; for, as 
you see, the weight of the distemper lay upon those 
parts, ttiat is to say, the city, the eight parishes over 
the river, with the parishes of Aldeate, Whitechapel, 
and Stepney ; and this was the time that the bills 
came up to such a monstrous height as that I men- 
tioned before, and that eight or nine, and, as I believe, 
ten or twelve thousand a week, died; for it is my 
settled opinion that they never could come at any 
just account of the numbers, for the reasons which I 
have given already. 

Nay, one of the most eminent physicians, who has 
since published in Latin an account of those times, 
and of his observations, says that in one week there 
died twelve thousand people, and that particularly 
there died four thousand in one night ; though I da 
not remember that there ever was any such particular 
night so remarkably fatal as that such a number died 
in it. However, all this confirms what I have said 
above of the uncertainty of the bills of mortality, 
&c, of which I shall say more hereafter. 

And here let me take leave to enter again, though 
it may seem a repetition of circumstances, into a de- 
scription of the miserable condition of the city itself, 
and of thoee parts where I lived at this particular

time. The city and those other parte, notwith- 
standing the great numbers of people that were 
gone into the country, was vastly nil) of people, and 
perhaps the fuller because people had for a long time 
a strong belief that the plague would not come into 
the city, nor into Southwark, no, nor into Wapping 
or Ratdiff at all ; nay, such was the assurance oi the 
people on that head that many removed from the 
suburbs on the west and north sides, into those 
eastern and south sides as for safety, and, as I verily 
believe, carried the plague amongst them there, per- 
haps sooner than they would otherwise have had it. 

Here also I ought to leave a further remarii for 
the use of posterity, concerning the manner of peo- 
ple's infecting one another ; namely, that it was not 
the sick people only from whom the plague was im- 
mediately received by others that wfere sound, but 
the welL To esplain myself, by the sick people I 
mean those who were known to be sick, had taken 
their bedsi had been under cure, or had swellings and 
tumoura upon them, and the like ; these everybody 
could beware of ; they were either in their beds or 
in such condition as could not be concealed. 

By the well I mean such as had received the con- 
tagion, and had it really upon them, and in their 
blood, yet did not show the consequences of it in 
their countenances; nay, even were not sensible of it 
themselves, as many were not for several days. These 
breathed death in every place, and upon everybody 
who came near them; nay, their very clothes re- 
tained the infection, their hands would infect the 
things they touched, especially if they were warm 
and sweaty, and they were generally apt to sweat 
too. 

Now it was impossible to know these people, nor 

did tbey sometimes, as I have said, know themselves 

to be infected. These were the people that so often

dropped down and fainted in the streets ; for often- 
times they would go about the streets to the last, 
till KM a sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit 
down at a door and die. It is true, finding them- 
selves thus, they would struggle hard to get home to 
their own doors, or at other times would be just able 
to go into their houses and die instantly ; other 
times they would go about till they had the very 
tokens come out upon tbem, and yet not know it, 
and would die in an hour or two after they came 
home, but be well as long as they were abroad. 
These were the dangerous people ; these were the 
people of whom the well people ought to have been 
afraid ; but then, on the other side, it was impossible 
to know them. 

And this is the reason why it is impossible in a 
visitation to prevent the spreading of the plague by 
the utmost human vigilance, viz., that it is impos- 
sible to know the infected people from the sound, or 
that the infected people should perfectly know them- 
selves. I knew a man who conversed freely in Lon- 
don all the season of the plague in 1665, and kept 
about him an antidote or cordial, on purpose to take 
when he thought himself in any danger, and he had 
such a rule to know or have warning of the dangu* 
by AS indeed I never met with before or since. How 
far it may be depended on I know not He had a 
wound in his leg, and whenever he came among any 
people that were not sound, and the infection b^an 
to anect him, he stud he could know it by that signal, 
viz., that his wound in his leg would smart, and look 
pale and white ; so as soon as ever he fielt it smart it 
was time for him to withdraw, or to take care of 
himself, taking his drink, which he always carried 
about him for that purpose. Now it seems he found 
his wound would smart many times when he was in 
company with such who thought themselves to be

sound, and who appeared so to one another ; but he 
vould presently nse up and say publicly, " Friends, 
here is somebody in the room that has the pla^e," 
and BO would immediately break up the company. 
This was indeed a bithful monitor to all people that 
the plague is not to be avoided by those that con- 
verse promiscuously in a town infected, and people 
have it when they know it not, and that they litie- 
wise give it to others when they know not that they 
have It themselves ; and in this case shutting up the 
well or removing the sick will not do it, unless they 
can go back ana shut up all those that the sick had 
conversed with, even before they knew themselves to 
be sick, and none knows how far to carry that back, 
or where to stop ; for none knows when, or where, or 
how they may nave received the infection, or from 
whom. 

This I take to be the reason which makes so many 
people talk of the air being corrupted and infected, 
andf that they need not be cautious of whom they 
converse with, for that the contagion was in the air. 
I have seen them in strange agitations and surprises 
on this account. " I have never come near any in- 
fected body," says the disturbed person ; " I nave 
conversed with none but sound, h^tby people, and 
yet I have gotten the distemper ! " *' 1 am sure I 
am struck from Heaven," says another, and he falls 
to the serious part. Again, the first goes on ex- 
cluming, " I have come near no infection or any in- 
fected person ; I am sure it is in the air. We draw 
in death when we breathe, and therefore 'tis the 
hand of God ; there is no withstanding it," And 
this at last made many people, being liaidened to the 
danger, grow less concemM at it, and less cautious 
towards the latter end of the time, and when it was 
come to its height, than they were at first. Then, 
with a kind of a Turkish predestinarianbm, they

would say, if it pleased God to strike them, it was all 
one whetDer they went abroad or stayed at home ; they 
could not escape it, and therefore they went boldly 
about, even into infected houses and infected com- 
pany ; visited sick people ; and, in short, lay in the 
beds with their wives or relations when they were in- 
fected. And what was the consequence, but the 
same that is the consequence in Turkey, and in those 
countries where they do those things, namely, that 
they were infected too, and died by hundreds and 
thousands? 

I would be far from lessening the awe of the judg- 
ments of God and the reverence to His proviaence, 
which ought always to be on our minds on such oc- 
casions as these. Doubtless the visitation itself is a 
stroke from Heaven upon a dty, or country, or nation 
where it falls ; a messenger of His vengeance, and a 
loud call to that nation, or country, or city to hu- 
miliation and repentance, according to that of the 
prophet Jeremiah (xviii. 7, 8) : " At what instant I 
shaQ speak concerning a naUon, and concerning a 
kingdom, to pluck up, and to puU down, and to de- 
stroy it ; if that nation, against whom I have pro- 
nounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the 
evil that I thought to do unto them.^ Now to 
prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the 
minds of men on such occasions, and not to lessen 
them, it is that I have left those minutes upon 
record. 

I say, therefore, I reflect upon no man for putting 
the reason of those things upon the immediate hand 
of God, and the appointment Mid directioD of His 
providence ; nay, on the contrary, there were many 
wonderful deliverances of persons fi-om infection, and 
deliverances of persons when infected, which intimate 
singular and remarkable providence in the particular 
insbmces to which they refer, and I esteem my own

deliverance tx> be one next to miraculous, and do 
record it with thankfulness. 

But when I am speaking of the plague aa a dis- 
temper arising from natural causes, we must con- 
sider it as it was really propagated by natural means ; 
nor is it at all the leas a judgment for its being 
under the conduct of human causes and effects ; for, 
as the Divine Power has formed the whole scheme of 
nature and maintains nature in its course, so the 
same Power thinks fit to let His own actings with 
men, whether of mercy or judgment, to go on in the 
ordinary course of natural causes, and He is pleased 
to act by those natural causes as the ordinary means, 
excepting and reserving to Himself nevertheless a 
power to act in a supernatural way when He sees 
occasion. Now 'tis evident that in the case of an 
infection there is no apparent extraordinary occasion 
for supernatural operation, but the ordinary course 
of things appears suiBciently armed, and made capa- 
ble of all the efiects that Heaven usually directs 
by a contagion. Among these causes and efiects, 
this of the secret conveyance of infection, imper- 
ceptible and unavoidable, is more than sufficient to 
execute the fierceness of Divine vengeance, without 
putting it upon supematurals and miracle. 

The acute penetiating nature of the disease itself 
was such, and the infe^on was received so imper- 
ceptibly, that the most exact caution could notsecure 
us while in the place. But I must be allowed to 
believe — and I have so many examples fresh in my 
memory to convince me of it, that I think none can 
resist their evidence — I say, I must be allowed to 
believe that no one in this whole nation ever received 
the sickness or infection but who received it in the 
ordinary way of infection from somebody, or the 
clothes, or toudi, or stench of somebody that was 
infected before,

The manner of its coming first to London proves 
this also, viz., by goods brought over &oni Holland, 
and brought thither from the Levant, the firet break- 
ing of it out in a house in Long Acre where those 
goods were carried and first opened, its spreading 
from that house to other houses by the visible unwary 
conversing with those who were sick, and the infect- 
ing the parish officers who were emploved about tlie 
persons dead, and the like. These are known author- 
ities for this great foundation point, that it went od and 
Eroceeded froqi peraon to person and from house to 
ouse, and no otherwise. In the first house that was 
infected there died four persons. A neighbour, hear- 
ing the mistress of the first house was sick, went to visit 
her, and went home and gave the distemper to her 
family, and died, and all her household. A minister, 
called to pray with the first sick person in the second 
house, was said to sicken immediately, and die with 
several more in his house. Then the physicians 
began to consider, for they did not at first dream of 
a general contagion. But the physicians being sent 
to inspect the bodies, they assured tbe people that 
it was neither more or less than the plague, with all 
its terrifying particular, and that it threatened an 
universal infection, so many people having already 
conversed with the sick or distempered, and having, 
as might be supposed, received infection from them, 
that it would be impossible to put a stop to it 

Here the opinion of the pnysidans agreed with 
my observation afterwards, namely, that the danger 
was spreading insensibly, for the sick could infect 
none out those that came within reach of the sick 
person, but that one man who may have really re- 
ceived the infection and knows it not, but goes 
abroad and about as a sound person, may give the 
plague to a thousand people, and they to greater 
numbers in proportion, ana neither the person giv-

ing the infection or the persons receivioe it know 
anything of it, and perhaps not feel the dffects of it 
for several days after. 

For example, many persons in the time of this 
visitation never perceived that they were infected till 
they found, to tneir unspeakable surprise, the tokens 
come out imon them ; after which they seldom lived 
six hours, for those spots they called tne tokens were 
really gangrene spots, or mortified fiesh in small 
knoK as broad as a little silver penny, and hard as a 
piece of c^us or horn ; so that, when the disease 
was come up to that length, there was nothine could 
follow but certain deatn, and yet, as I said, they 
knew nothing of their being infected, nor found 
themselves so much as out of order, till those mortal 
marks were upon them. But everybody must allow 
that they were infected in a high degree before, and 
must have been so some time, and consequently their 
breath, their sweat, their veiy clothes, wctc conta- 
gious for many days before. 

This occasioned a vast variety of cases, which 
physicians would have much more opportunity to 
remember than I; but some came within the com- 
pass of my observation or hearing, of which I shall 
name a few. 

A certain citizen who had lived safe and untouched 
till the month of September, when the weight of the 
distemper lay more in the city than it bad done be- 
fore, was mighty cheerful, and something too bold, 
as I think it was, in his talk of how secure he was, 
how cautious he had been, and how he had never 
come near any sick body. Savs another citizen, a 
neighbour of nis, to him one aay, " Do not be too 

confident, Mr ; it is hard to say who is sick 

and who is well, for we see men alive and well to 

outward appearance one hour, and dead the next." 

" That is tnie,'" says the first man, for he was not a

oian presumptuously secure, but bad escaped a loug 
while, and men, as I said above, especially in the 
city, b^au to be over-easy upon that score. " Tliat 
is true, says he ; " I do not think myself secure, but 
I hope I have not been in company with any pereon 
that there has been any danger in.'" " No F says 
his neighbour. " Was not you at the Bull Head 

Tavern in Gracechurch Street with Mr. the 

night before last ? " " Yes," says the first, " I was ; 
but there was nobody there that we bad any reason 
to think dangerous." Upon which his neighbour 
said no more, Being unwilliEg to surprise him ; but 
this made him more inquisitive, and as his neighbour 
appeared backward, he was the more impatient, and 
in a kind of warmth says he aloud, "Why, he is not 
dead, is he?" Upon which his neighbour still was 
silent, but cast up his eyes and said something to 
himself; at which the first citizen turned pale, and 
said no more but this, " Then I am a dead man too," 
and went home immediately and sent for a neigh- 
bouring apothecary to give him something preven- 
tive, for he had not yet found himself ill ; but the 
apothecary, opening nis breast, fetched a sigh, and 
said no more but this, " Look up to God ; " and the 
man died in a few hours. 

Now let any man judge irom a case like this if it 
is possible for the reflations of magistrates, either 
by shutting up the sick or removing tbem, to stop 
an infection which spi-eads itself from man to man, 
even while they are perfectly well and insensible of 
its approach, and may be so for many days. 

It may be proper to ask here bow long it may be 
supposed men might have the seeds of the contagion 
in them before it discovered itself in this fatal manner, 
and how long they mi^t go about seemingly whole, 
and yet be contagious to all those that came near 
them. I believe the most experienced physicians

cannot fuswer this question directly any more than 
I can ; and something an ordinary observer may t^e 
notice of, which may pass their observation. Ttie 
opinion of physicians abroad seems to be that it may 
lie dormant in the spirits, or in the blood-vessels, a 
very considerable time. Why else do they exact a 
quarantine of those who come into their narbours 
and ports from suspected places? Forty days is, 
one would think, too long for nature to struggle 
with such an enemy as this, and not conquer it or 
yield to it But I could not think, by my own ob- 
servation, that they can be infected so as to be con- 
tagious to others above fifteen or sisteen days at 
furthest; and on that score it was, that when a 
house was shut up in the city, and any one had died 
of the plague, but nobody appeared to be ill in the 
family for sixteen or eighteen days afler, they were 
not so strict but that they would connive at their 
going privately abroad ; nor would people be much 
afraid of them afterward, but rather think they were 
fortified the better, having not been vulnerable 
when the enemy was in their own house ; but we 
sometimes found it had lain much longer concealed. 

Upon the foot of all these obscrvstions I must 
say, that though Providence seemed to direct my 
conduct to be otherwise, yet it is my opinion, and I 
must leave it as a prescription, vir-, that the best 
physic against the plague is to run away from it. I 
know people encourage themselves by saying Ciod is 
able to keep us in the midst of danger, ana able to 
overtake us when we think ourselves nut of danger ; 
and this kept thousands in the town, whose carcasses 
went into the great pits by cartloads, and who, if 
they had fled fcim the danger, had, I believe, been 
safe from the disaster ; at feast 't is probable they 
had been safe. 

And were this very fundamental only duly con-

sidered by the people on any future occasion of this 
or the hke nature, I am persuaded it would put 
them upon quite diSerent measures for managing the 
people from those that they took in 1665, or than 
any that have been taken abroad that I have heard 
of. In a word, they would consider of separating 
the people into smaller bodies, and removing them 
in time farther from one another, and nut let such a 
contagion as this, which is indeed chiefly dangerous 
to collected bodies of people, find a million of people 
in a body together, as was very near the case before, 
and woiud certainly be the case if it should ever 
appear again. 

rhe plague, like a great lire, if a few houses only 
ai'e contiguous where it happens, can only bum a few 
houses ; or if it begins in a single, or, as we call it, a 
lone house, can only bum that lone house where it 
b^ns. But if it ti^ns in a close-built town or 
city and gets s head, there its fury ina'eases, it rages 
over the whole place, and consumes all it can reach. 
I coutd propose many schemes on the foot of which 
the government of this city, if ever they should be 
under the apprehensions of such another enemy (God 
forbid they should), might ease themselves of the 
greatest part of the dangerous people that belong to 
them ; I mean such as the begging, starving, labour- 
ing poor, and among them chiefly those who, in case 
of a ai^e, are called the useless mouths, who being 
then prudently and to their own advantage disposed 
of, and the wealthy inhabitants disposing of them- 
selves, and of their servants and children, the city 
and its adjacent parts would be so effectually evacu- 
ated that there would not be above a tenth part of 
its people left blether for the disease to take hold 
upon. But suppose them to be a fifth part, and that 
two hundred and fifty thousand people were left, and 
if it did seize upon them, they would, by their living

so much at large, be much better prepared to defend 
themselves against the infection, and be less liable to 
the effects of it than if the same number of people 
lived close tt^ther in one smaller dty, such as Dub- 
lin or Amsterdam, or the like. 

It is true hundreds, yea, thousands of families fled 
away at this last plague, but then, of tbem, many 
fled too late, and not only died in their flight, but 
carried the distemper wiUi them into the countries 
where they went, and infected those whom they went 
among for safety ; which confounded the thing, and 
made that be a propagation of the distemper which 
was the best means to prevent it ; and this too is an 
evidence of it, and bnngs me back to what I only 
hinted at before, but must speak more fiilly to here, 
namely, that men went about apparently well many 
days after they had the taint of the disease in their 
vitals, and after their spirits were so seized as that 
they could never escape it, and that all the while 
they did so they were dangerous to others ; I say, 
this proves that so it was ; for such people infected 
the very towns they went through, as well as the 
families they went among ; and it was by that means 
that almost all the great towns in England had the 
distemper among them, more or less, and always 
they would teli you such a Londoner or such a 
Londoner brought it down. 

It must not be omitted that when I speak of those 
people who were really thus dangerous, I suppose 
them to be utterly ignorant of their own condition ; 
for if they really knew their circumstances to be such 
as indeed they were, they must have been a kind of 
wilfiil murderers if they would have gone abroad 
among healthy people, and it would have verifled 
indeed the suggestion which I mentioned above, and 
which I thoi^ht seemed untrue, viz., that the in- 
fected people were utterly careless as to giving the

infection to others, and rather forward to do it than 
not ; and I believe it was partly from this very thing 
that they raised that m^;estion, which I hope was 
not really true in foct. 
I confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a 

feneral, but I could name several people witnin the 
nowledge of some of their neighbours and families 
yet living who showed the contrary to an extreme. 
One man, a master of a family in my neighbourhood, 
having had the distemper, he thought he nad it given 
him by a poor workman whom he employed, and 
whom ne went to his house to see, or went for some 
work that he wanted to have finished, and he had 
some apprdiensions even while he was at the poor 
workman^s door, but did not discover it fully ; but 
the next day it discovered itself, and he was taken 
very ill, upon which he immediately caused himself 
to be earned into an outbuilding which be had in 
his yard, and where there was a chamber over a 
workhouse, tbe man being a brazier. Here he lay, 
and here he died, and would be tended by none of 
his neighbours, but by a nurse from abroad; and 
would not suffer his wife, nor childi-en, nor servants 
to come up into the room, lest they should be in- 
fected, but sent them his blessing and prayeis for 
them by the nurse, who spoke it to them at a dis- 
tance, and all this for fear of giving them the dis- 
temper, and without which he knew, as they were 
kept up, they could not have it. 

And here I must observe also that the plague, as I 
suppose all distempers do, operated in a aiflerent 
manner on differing constitutions ; some were im- 
mediately overwhelmed with it, and it came to 
violent fevers, vomitings, insufferable headaches, 
pains in the back, and so up to ravings and ragings 
with those pains ; others with swellings and tumouis 
in the neck or groin, or armpits, which till they could

be broke put them into insuflerable aeonies and tor- 
ment ; while others, as I have observea, were silently 
infected, the fever preying upOn their spirits in- 
sensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell 
into swooning, and faintings, and death without 
pain. 

I am not physician enough to enter into the par- 
ticular reasons and manner of these differing elTects 
of one and the same distemper, and of its dillering 
operation in several bodies ; nor is it my business 
here to record the observations which I rrally made, 
because the doctors themselves have done tliat part 
much more effectually than I can do, and because 
my opinion may in some things dilfer from theirs. 
I am only relating what I know, or have heard, or 
believe of the particular cases, and what fell within 
the compass of my view, and the different nature of 
the infection, as it appeared in the particular cases 
which I have related ; but this may be added too, 
that though the former sort of those cases, namely, 
those openly visited, were the worst for themselves 
as to pain — I mean those that had such fevers, 
vomitings, headaches, pains, and swellings, because 
they died in such a dreadful manner — yet the latter 
had the worst state of the disease ; ^or in the former 
they frequently recovered, especially if the swellings 
brolce, but the latter was inevitable death ; no cure, 
no help could be possible, nothing could follow but 
death. 

And it was worse also to others, because, as above, it 
secretly, and unperceived by others, or by themselves, 
communicated death to those they conversed withh 
the penetrating poison insinuating itself into their 
btowl in a manner which it is impossible to describe, 
or indeed conceive. 

This infecting and being infected without so much 
as its being known to either person is evident from

two sorts of cases which frequently happeDed at that 
time ; and there is hardly anybody living who was in 
London during the infection but must have known 
several of the cases of both sorts. 

1. Fathei? and mothers have gone about as if 
they had been well, and have believed themselves to 
be so, till they have insensibly infected and been 
the destruction of their whole families, which they 
would have been far from doing if they had the least 
apprehensions of their being unsound and dangerous 
themselves. A femily, whose story I have heard, 
was thus infected by the father ; and the distemper 
began to appear upon some of them even before he 
found it upon himself. But searching more narrowly, 
it appeared he had been affected some time, and as 
soon as he found that his family had been poisoned 
by himself he went distracted, and would have laid 
violent hands upon himself, but was kept from that 
by those who looked to him, and in a few days died. 

S. The other particular is, that many people hav- 
ing been well to the best of their own judgment, or 
by the best observation which they could make of 
themselves for several days, and only finding a decay 
of appetite, or a light sickness upon their stomachs ; 
nay, some whose appetite has been strong, and even 
craving, and only a light pain in their Tieads, have 
sent for physicians to know what ailed them, and 
have been found, to their great surprise, at the brink 
of death, the tokens upon them, or the plague grown 
up to an incurable height. 

It was vety sad to reflect how such a person as this 
last mentioned above had been a walking destroyer

and often has been, and I could give many particular 
cases where it has been so. If ^en the blow is thus 
insendbly striking; if the anxiw flies thus unseen, 
and cannot be discovered, to what purpose ore all 
the schemes for shutting up or removing the sick 
people ? Those schemes cannot take place but upon 
those that appear to be sick, or to be infected ; 
whereas there are among them at the same time 
thousands of people who seem to be well, but are all 
that while carrying death with them into all com- 
panies which they come into. 

This frequently puzzled our physicians, and espe- 
cially the apothecaries and surgeons, who knew not 
how to discover the sick from the sound ; they all 
allowed that it was really so, that many people had 
the plague in their very blood, and preying upon 
their spirits, and were in themselves but walking 
putrefiM carcasses, whose breath was infectious and 
their sweat poison, and yet were as well to look on 
as other people, and even knew it not themselves ; I 
say, they all allowed that it was really true in fact, 
but th^ knew not how to propose a discovery. 

My friend Dr. Heath was of opinion that it might 
be known by the smell of their breath ; but then, as 
he said, who durst smell to that breath for his 
information? since, to know it, he must draw the 
stench of the plague up into his own brain, in order 
to distinguish the smeD ! I have heard it was the 
opinion of others that it might be distinguished by 
the party''s breathing upon a piece of glass, where, 
the breath condensing, there might living creatures 
be seen by a microscope, of strange, monstrous, and 
frightful shapes, such as dragons, snakes, seipents, 
and devils, horrible to bebud. But this I very 
much question the truth of, and we had no micro- 
scopes at that time, as I remember, to make the 
experiment with.

It was the opinion also of another teamed man, 
that the breath of such a person would poison and 
instantly kill a bird ; not only a small bird, but even 
a cock or hen, and that, if it did not immediately 
kill the latter, it would cause them to be roupy, as 
they call it ; particularly that if they had laid any 
eg^ at any time, they would be all rotten. But 
th^ ai-e opinions which I never found supported 
by any experiments, or heard of others that had seen 
it ; so I leave them as I lind them, only with this 
remark, namely, that I think the probabilities are 
very strong for them. 

Some have proposed that such pei-sons should 
breathe hard upon warm water, and that they would 
leave an unusual scum upon it, or upon several other 
things, especially such as are of a glutinous substance 
and are apt to receive a scum and support it. 

But from the whole I found that the nature of 
this contagion was such that it was impossible to 
discover it at all, or to prevent its spreading from 
one to another by any human skill. 

Here was indeed one difficulty which I could never 
thoroughly get over to this time, and which there is 
but one way of answering that I know of, and it is 
this, viz., the first person that died of the plague 
was on December SO, or thereabouts, 1664, and in 
or about Long Acre ; whence the first person had 
the infection was generally said to be, from a parcel 
of silks imported from Holland, and first opened in 
that house. 

But after this we heard no more of any person 
dying of the plague, or of the distemper "being in 
that place, till tlie 9th of February, which was about 
seven weeks after, and then one more was buried out 
of the same house. Then it was hushed, and we 
were perfectly easy as to the public for a great 
while ; for there were no more entered in the weekly

bili to be dead of the plague till the SSnd of April, 
when there was two more buried, not out of the 
same bouse, but out of the same street ; and, as near 
aa I can remember, it was out of the next bouse to 
the first. This was nine weeks asunder, and after 
this we had uo more till a fortnight, and then it 
broke out in several streets, and spreul every way. 
Now the question seems to lie thus : Where lay the 
seeds of the infection all this while? How came it 
to stop so long, and not stop any longer ? Either the 
distemper did not come immediately by contagion, 
from body to body, or if it did, then a body may be 
capable to continue infected without the disease dis- 
covering itself many days, nay, weeks tt^ther; even 
not a quarantine of days only, but soixantitie ; not 
only forty days, but sixty days or longer. 

It is true there was, as I observed at first, and is 
well known to many yet living, a very cold winter 
and a long frost, which continued three months, and 
this, the doctors say, might check the infection ; but 
then the learned must allow me to say, that if, ac- 
cording to their notion, the disease was, as I may 
say, only frozen up, it would, like a frozen river, 
have returned to ib usual force and current when it 
thawed, whereas the principal recess of this infection, 
which was from February to April, was after the 
frost was broken and the weather mild and warm. 

But there is another way of solving all this diffi- 
culty, which I think mv own remembrance of the 
thing will supply ; and that is, the fact is not granted, 
namely, that there died none in those long intervals, 
viz., from the SOth of December to the 9th of Feb- 
ruary, and from thence to the SSnd of April. Ihe 
weekly bilb are the only evidence on the other side, 
and uiose bills were not of credit enough, at least 
with me, to support an hypothesis or determine a 
question of such importance as this ; for it was our

received opinion nt that time, and I believe upon 
very good grounds, that the fraud lay in the parish 
officers, searchers, and persons appointed to give 
account of the dead, and what diseases they died of; 
and as people were very loth at first to have the 
neighbours believe their nouses were infected, so they 
gave money to procure, or otherwise procured, the 
dead persons to be returned as dyine of other dis- 
tem^rs ; and this I know was practised afterwards 
in many places, I believe I might say in all places 
where the distemper came, as will be seen by the 
vast increase of Uie numbers placed in the weekly 
hills under other articles of diseases during the time 
of the infection. For example, in the months of 
July anS August, when the plague was coming on to 
its highest pitch, it was very ordinary to have from 
a thousand to twelve hundred, nay, to almost fifteen 
hundred a week of other distempers. Not that the 
numbers of those distempers were really increased to 
such a degree, but the great number of bmilies and 
bouses where really the infection was, obtained the 
favour to have their dead be returned of other dis- 
tempers, to prevent the shutting up their houses.

There were several other articles which bore a 
proportion to these, and which, it is easy to perceive, 
were increased on the same account, as aged, con- 
sumptions, vomitings, imposthumes, gripes, and the 
like, manv of which were not doubted to be infected 
people ; but as it was of the utmost consequence to 
families not to be known to be infected, if it was 
possible to avoid it, so they took all the measures 
they could to have it not believed, and if any died 
in their houses, to get them returned to the exam- 
iners, and by the searchers, as having died of other 
distempera. 

This, I say, will account lor the long interval 
which, as I have said, was between the dying of the 
first persons that were returned in the bill to oe dead 
of the plague and the time when the distemper 
spread openly and could not be concealed. 

Besides, the weekly bills themselves at that time 

evidently discover this truth ; for, while there was 

no mention of the plague, and no increase after it

had been mentioned, yet it was apparent that there 
was an increase of those distempers which bordered 
nearest upon it; for example, there were eight, 
twelve, seventeen of the spotted fever in a week, when 
there were none, or but very few, of the plague ; 
whereas before, one, three, or four were the ordinarv 
weekly numbers of that distemper. Likewise, as I 
observed before, the burials increased weekly in that 
particular parish and the parishes adjacent more 
than in any other parish, although there were none 
set down of the plague ; all which tell us, that the 
infection was handed on, and the succession of the 
distemper really preserved, though it seemed to us 
at that time to oe ceased, and to come again in a 
manner surprising. 

It might oe, also, that the infection mi^t remain 
in other parts of the same parcel of goods which at 
first it came in, and which might not be periiaps 
opened, or at least not fully, or in the clothes of the 
first infected person ; for I cannot think that any- 
body could be seized with the contagion in a fatal 
and mortal d^ree for nine weeks together, and sup- 
port his state of health so well as even not to discover 
it to themselves ; yet if it were so, the argument is 
the stronger in favour of what I am saying, namely, 
that the infection is retained in bodies apparently 
well, and conveyed from them to those they converse 
with, while it is known to neither the one nor the 
other. 

Great were the confusions at that time upon this 
very account, and when people began to be convinced 
that the infection was received in this surprising 
manner from persons apparently well, they b^an to 
be exceeding Miy and jealous of every one that came 
near them. Once, on a public day, whether a Sab- 
bath-day or not I do not remember, in Aldgate 
Church, in a pew full of people, on a sudden one

fiincied she smelt an ill smell. Immediately she 
&Dcies the pU«ue was in the pew, whispers her 
notion or suspicion to the next, then rises and goes 
out of the pew. It immediately took with the next, 
and so to them all ; and every one of them, and of 
the two or three adjoining pews, got up and went 
out of the church, nobody knowing what jt was 
of^ded them, or from whom. 

This immediately filled eveiTl3ody''s mouths with 
one preparation or other, such as the old women 
directed, and some perhaps as physicians directed, in 
order to prevent infection by the breath of others, 
insomuch that if we came to go into a church when 
it was anything full of people, there would be such 
a mixture of smells at the entrance that it was much 
more strong, though perhaps not so wholesome, than 
if you were going into an apothecary^s or druggisfs 
shop. In a worc^the whole church was like a smell- 
ing-hottie ; in one comer it was all perfumes ; in 
another, aromatics, balsamics, and variety of drugs 
and herbs ; in another, salts and spirits, as every one 
was furnished for their own preservation. Yet I 
observed that after people were possessed, as I have 
said, with the beliei, or rather assurance, of the in- 
fection being thus carried on by persons apparently 
in health, Uie churches and meeting-houses were 
much thinner of people than at other times before 
that they used to be. For this is to be said of the 
people of London, that during the whole time of the 
peatilence the churches or meetings were never wholly 
shut up, nor did the people decline coming out to the 
public worship of God, except only in some parishes 
when the violence of the distemper was more particu- 
larly in that parish at that time, and even then no 
longer than it continued to be so. 

Indeed nothing was more strange than to see with 
what courage the people went to the public service

of God even at that time, when they were afrud to 
stir out of their own houses upon any other occasion ; 
this, I mean, before the time of desperation, which I 
have mentioned already. This was a proof of the 
exceeding populousness of the city at the time of the 
infection, notwithstanding the great numbers that 
were gone into the country at the first alarm, and 
that fled out into the forests and woods when they 
were further terrified with the extraordinaty increase 
of it For when we came to see the crowds and 
throngs of people which appeared on the Sabbath- 
days at the churches, and especially in those parts of 
the town where the pl^ue was abated, or where it 
was not yet come to its height, it was amazing. But 
of this I shall speak again presently. I return in the 
meantime to the article of infecting one another 
at flrst, before people came to right notions of 
the infection, and of infecting one another. People 
were only shy of those that were really sick, a man 
with a cap upon his head, or with clothes round his 
neck, which was the case of those that hod swellings 
there. Such was indeed frightful ; but when we saw 
a gentleman dressed, with his band on and his gloves 
in his hand, his hat upon his head, and his hair 
combed, of such we had not the least apprehensions, 
and people conversed a great while freely, especially 
with their neighbours and such as they Knew. But 
when the physicians assured us that the danger was 
as well from the sound, that is, the seemingly sound, 
as the sick, and that those people who thought them- 
selves entii-ely free were oftentimes the most fatal, 
and that it came to be generally understood that 
people were sensible of it, and of the reason of it ; 
then, I say, they began to be jealous of everybody, 
and a vast number of people locked themselves up, 
so as not to come abroad into any company at all, 
nor suffer any that had been ahn»d in promiacuous

company to come into their houses, or near them, at 
least not so near them as to be within the reach of 
their breath or of any smell from them ; and when 
they were obliged to converse at a distance with 
strangers, they would always have preservatives in 
their mouths and about their clothes to repel and 
keep off the infection. 

It must be acknowledged that when people b^an 
to use these cautions they were less exposed to dan< 
ger, and the infection did not break into such houses 
so furiously as tt did into others before ; and thou- 
sands of Cunilies were preserved, speaking with due 
reserve to the direction of Divine Providence, by 
that means. 

But it was impossible to beat anything into the 
heads of the poor. They went on with the usual 
impetuosity of their tempers, full of outcries and 
lamentations when taken, but madly careless of 
themselves, foolhardy and obstinate, while they were 
well. Where they could get employment they pushed 
into any kind ot business, the most dangerous and 
the most liable to infection ; and if they were spoken 
to, their answer would be, " I must trust to God for 
that ; if I am taken, then I am provided for, and 
there is an end of me," and the like. Or thus, 
" Why, what must I do ? I can't starve. I had as 
good have the plague as perish for want. I have no 
work ; what coula I do ? I must do this or b^." 
Suppose it was burying the dead, or attending uie 
sicK, or watching infected houses, which were all 
terrible hazards; but their tale was generally the 
same. It is true, necessity was a very justinable, 
warrantable plea, and nothing could be bettor ; but 
their way of talk was much the same where the 
necessities were not the same. This adventurous 
conduct of the poor was that which brought the 
plague among them in a most furious manner, and

this, joined to tlie distress of their circumstances 
when taken, was the reason why they died so by 
heaps ; for I cannot say I could observe one jot of 
better husbandry among them, I mean the labouring 
poor, while they were all well and getting money 
than there was before, but as lavish, as extravagant, 
and as thoughtless for to-morrow as ever; so that 
when they came to be taken sick they were im- 
mediately in the utmost distress, as well for want 
as for sickness, as well for la^^k of food as lack of 
health. 

This miseiy of the poor I had many occasions to 
be an eye-witness of, and sometimes also of the 
charitable assistance that some pious people daily 
gave to such, sending them relief and supplies both 
of food, physic, and other help, as they found they 
wanted ; and indeed it is a debt of justice due to the 
temper of the people of that day to take notice here, 
that not only great sums, very great sums of money 
were charitably sent to the Lord Mayor and alder- 
men for the assistance and support of the poor dis- 
tempered people, but abundance of private people 
daily distnbuted laige sums of money for their relief, 
and sent people about to inquire into the condition 
of particular distressed and visited families, and re- 
lieved them ; nay, some pious ladies were so trans- 
ported with zeal in so good a work, and so confident 
in the protection of Providence in discharge of the 
great duty of charity, that they went about in per- 
son distriouting alms to the poor, and even visiting 
poor families, though sick and infected, in their very 
nouses, appointing nurses to attend those that wanted 
attending, and ordering apothecaries and surgeons, 
the first to supply them with drugs or plaisters, and 
such things as they wanted ; and the last to lance 
and dress the swellings and tumours, where such were 
wanting ; giving their blessing to the poor in sub-

stantial relief to them, as well as hearty prayers for 
them. 

I will not undertake to say, as some do, that none 
of those charitable people were suffered to fall under 
the calamity itself ; but this I may say, that I never 
knew any one of them that miscarried, which I men- 
tion for the encouragement of others in case of the like 
distress ; and doubtless, if they that give to the poor 
lend to the Lord, and He will repay them, those that 
hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort 
and assist the poor in such a misery as this, may hope 
to be protected in the work. 

Nor was this charity so extraordinary eminent 
only in a few, but (for I cannot lightly quit this 
point) the charity of the rich, as well in the city 
and suburbs as from the country, was so great that, 
in a word, a prodigious number of people who must 
otherwise inevitably have perished for want as well 
as sickness were supported and subsisted by it ; and 
though I could never, nor I believe any one else, 
come to a full knowledge of what was so contributed, 
yet I do believe that, as I heard one say that was a 
critical observer of that part, there was not only 
many thousand pounds contributed, but many hun- 
dred thousand pounds, to the relief of the poor of 
this distressed, afflicted city ; nay, one man afflnned 
to tne that he could reckon up above one hundred 
thousand pounds a week, which was distributed by the 
church wardens at the several parish vestries by the 
Lord Mayor and aldermen in the several wards and 
precincts, and by the particular direction of the court 
and of the justices respectively in the parts where 
they resided, over and above the private charity dis- 
tributed by pious hands in the manner I speak of; 
and this continued for many weeks together. 

I confess this is a very great sum ; hut if it be true 

that there was distributed in the parish of Crippl&-

gate only, ^17,800 in one week to the relief of the 
poor, as I heard reported, and which I really believe 
was true, the other may not be improbable. 

It was doubtlesH to be reckoned among the many 
signal good providences which attended this great 
city, and of which there were many other worth re- 
cording, — I say, this was a very remarkable one, 
that it ideased God thus to move the hearts of the 
people ID all parts of the kingdom so cheerfully to 
contribute to the relief and support of the poor at 
London, the good consequences of which were felt 
many ways, and particulaiiy in preserving the lives 
and recovering me health of so many thousands, 
and keeping so many thousands ot tamilies from 
perishing and starving. 

And now I am t«ilkmg of the merciful disposition 
of Providence in this time of calamity, I cannot but 
mention again, though I have spoken several times 
of it already on other accounts, I mean that of the 
progression of the distemper ; how it began at one 
end of the town, and pro^eded gradually and slowly 
from one part to another, and like a dark cloud that 
passes over our heads, which, as it thickens and over- 
casts the air at one end, clears up at the other end ; 
so, while the plague went on raging from west to 
east, as it went forwards east, it abated in the west, 
by which means those parte of the town which were 
not seized, or who were left, and where it had spent 
its fuiy, were (as it were) spared to help and assist 
the other ; whereas, had the distemper spread itself 
over the whole city and suburbs at once, raging in 
all places alike, as it has done since in some places 
abroad, the whole body of the people must have 
been overwhelmed, and there would have died twenty 
thousand a day, as they say there did at Naples ; 
nor would the people have been able to have helped 
or assisted one another.

For it must be observed that where the plague was 
in its full toivG, there indeed the people were very 
miserable, and the consternation was inexpressible. 
But a little before it reached even to that place, or 
presently after it was gone, they were quite another 
sort of people ; and I cannot but acknowledge that 
there was too much of that common temper of man- 
kind to be found among us all at that time, namely, 
to forget the deliverance when the danger is past. 
But I shall come to speak of that part again. 

It must not be fot^t here to take some notice of 
the state of trade during the time of this common 
calamity, and this with respect to foreign trade, as 
also to our home tmde. 

As to foreign trade, there needs little to be said. 
The trading nations of Europe were all afraid of us ; 
no port of Fi-ance, or Holland, or Spain, or Italy 
would admit our ships or correspond with us ; indeed 
we stood on ill terms with the Dutch, and were in 
a fiirious war with them, but though in a bad con- 
dition to fight abroad, who had such dreadful ene- 
mies to struggle with at home. 

Our merchants were accordingly at a full stop ; 
their ships could go no^there, that is to say, to no 
place abroad ; their manufactures and merenandise, 
tliat is to say, of our growth, would not be touched 
abroad. They were as much afraid of our goods 
as they were of our people ; and indeed they had 
reason, for our woollen manufactures are as retentive 
of infection as human bodies, and if packc-d up by 
persons infected, would receive the infection, and be 
as dangerous to touch as a man would be that was 
infected; and therefore, when any English vessel ar- 
rived in foreign countries, if they did take the goods 
on shore, they always caused the liales to be opened 
fuid aired in places appointed for that purpose. But 
from London they would not suffer tnem to come 
[2«]

into port, much less to unlade their goods, upon any 
trams whatever; and this strictness was especially 
used with them in Spain and Italy. In Turkey, ima 
the islands of the .AJches indeed, as they are called, 
as well those belonging to the Turks as to the Vene- 
tians, they were not so very rigid. In the first there 
was no obstruction at all ; and four ships which were 
then in the river loading for Italy, that is, for Leg- 
horn and Naples, being denied product, as they call 
it, went on to Turkey, and were freely admitted to 
unlade their cargo without any difficulty, only that 
when they arrived there, some of their cargo was not 
(it for sue in that country, and other parts of it 
being consigned to merchants at L^hom, the cap- 
tains of the ships had no right nor any orders to 
dispose of the goods; so that great inconveniences 
followed to the merchants. But this was nothing 
but what the necessity of affairs required, and the 
merchants at L^hom and Naples having notice 
given them, sent again from thence to take care of 
the effects, which were particularly consigned to 
those ports, and to bring back in other ships such 
as were improper for the markets at Smyrna and 
Scanderoon. 

The inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were 
still greater, for they would by no means suffer our 
ships, especially those from London, to come into 
any of their ports, much less to unlade. There was 
a report that one of our ships having by stealth de- 
livered her cargo, among which was some bales of 
English cloth, cotton, kerseys, and such-like goods, 
the Spaniards caused all the goods to be bum^,and 
punisned the men with death who were concerned in 
canying them on shore. This, I believe, was in part 
true, though I do not affirm it ; but it is not at all 
unlikely, seeing the danger was really very great, the 
infection being so violent in London.

I heard, likewise, that the plague was carried into 
those countries hy some of our ships, and partictdarly 
to the port of Paro, in the kingdom of Algarve, be- 
longing to the King of Portugal, and that several 
persons died of it there, but it was not confirmed. 

On the other hand, though the Spaniards and 
Portuguese were so shy of us, it is most certain that 
the plague, as has been said, keeping at first much 
at that end of the town next Westminster, the mer- 
cfaandising part of the town, such as the city and 
the water-side, was perfectly sound till at least the 
beginning of July, and the ships in the river till the

the same thing abroad, for the bad news was gone 
over the whole world that the city of London was 
infected with the plague, and there was no inquiring 
there how the infection proceeded, or at which part of 
, the town it was begun or was reached to. 

Besides, after it began to spread it increased so 
fast, and the bills grew so high all on a sudden, that 
it was to no purpose to lessen the report of it, or 
endeavour to make the people abroad think it better 
than it was ; the account which the weekly bills gave 
in was sufficient ; and that there died two thousand 
to three or four thousand a week was sufficient to 
alarm the whole trading part of the world, and the 
following time being so dreadful also in the very 
city itself put the whole world, I say, upon their 
guard against it. 

You may be sure, also, that the report of these 

things lost nothing in the carriage. The plague 

was itself very terrible, and the distress of the people 

very great, as you may observe of what I have said.

But the rumour was infinitely greater, and it must 
not be wondered that our &iends abroad, aa my 
brother''s correspondents in particular were told 
tbere, namely, in Portugal and Italy, where he 
chiefly tradeo, fsaid] that in London tbere died 
twenty thousand in a week ; that the dead bodies 
lay unburied by heaps ; that the living were not suf- 
ficient to bury the dead or the sound to look after 
the sick ; that all the kingdom was infected likewise, 
so that it was an universu malady, such as was never 
heard of in those parts of the world ; and they could 
hardly believe us when we gave them an account 
how things really were, and how there was not above 
one-tenth part of the people dead ; that there was 
500,000 left that lived all the time in the town ; 
that now the people b^an to walk the streets again, 
and those who were fled to return, there was no miss 
of the usual throne of people in the streets, except 
as every family might miss their relations and neigh- 
bours, and the like. I say they could not believe 
these things ; and if inquiry were now to be made in 
Naples, or in other cities on the coast of Italy, they 
would tell you that there was a dreadful infection in 
London so many years ago, in which, as above, there 
died twenty thousand in a week, &c.,just as we have 
had it reported in London that there was a plague in 
the city of Naples in the year 1656, in which there died 
90,000 people in a day, of which I have had very 
good satisfaction that it was utterly false. 

But these extravagant reports were very prejudicial 
to our trade, as well as unjust and injurious in them- 
selves, for it was a long time after the plague was 
Quite over before our trade could recover itself in 
those parts of the world ; and the Flemings and 
Dutch, but especially the last, made very great ad- 
vantages of it, having all the market to themselves, 
and even buying our manufactures in several parts

of England where tlie plague was not, and carrying 
them to Holland ana Flanders, and from thence 
transporting them to Spain and to Italy, as if they 
had been of their own making. 

But they were detected sometimes and punished, 
that is to say, their goods confiscated, and ships also ; 
for if it was true that our manufactures as weU as 
OUT people were infected, and that it was dangerous 
to touch or to open and receive the smell of them, 
then those people ran the hazard by that clandestine 
trade, not only of carrying the contagion into their 
own country, but also of infecting the nations to 
whom the^ traded with those goods, which, con- 
sidering bow many lives might be lost in consequence 
of such an action, must be a trade that no men of 
conscience could suffer themselves to be concerned in. 

I do not take upon me to say that any harm was 
done, I metm of that kind, by Uiose people. But I 
doubt I need not make any such proviso in the case 
of our own country ; for either by our people of 
London, or by the commerce which made tneir con- 
versing with all sorts of people in eveiy county and 
of every considerable town necessary, I say, by this 
means the plague was first or lost spread all over the 
kingdom, as well in London as in all the cities and 
great towns, especially in the trading manufacturing 
towns and seworts ; so that, fiist or last, all the 
considerable places in England were visited more or 
less, and the Kingdom of Ireland in some places, but 
not so universally. How it fared with the people in 
Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire. 

It is to be observed that while the plague con- 
tinued so violent in London, the outports, as they 
are called, enjoyed a very great trade, especially to 
the adjacent countries and to our own plantations. 
For example, the towns of Colchester, Yarmouth, 
and Hull, on that side of England, exported to

Holland and Hamburg the manufactures of the ad- 
jacent counties for several months after the trade 
with London was, as it were, entirely shut up ; like- 
wise the cities of Bristol and Exeter, with tne port 
of Plymouth, had the like advantage to Spain, to 
the Canaries, to Guinea, and to the West Indies, 
and particularly to Ireland ; but as the plague 
spread itself every way after it had been in London 
to such a d^ree as it was in August and September, 
so all, or most of those cities and towns, were in- 
fected first or last, and then trade was, as it were, 
under a general embargo, or at a full stop, as I shall 
observe further when I speak of our home trade. 

One thing, however, must be observed, that as to 
ships coming in from abroad, as many you may be 
sure did, some who were out in all parts of the world 
a considerable while before, and some who when they 
went out knew nothing of an infection, or at least of 
one so terrible ; these came up the river boldly, and 
delivered their cargoes as they were obliged to do, 
except just in the two months of August and Sep- 
tember, when the weight of the infection lying, as I 
may say, all below Bridge, nobody durst appear in 
business for a while. But as this continued but for 
a few weeks, the homeward-bound ships, especially 
such whose cargoes were not liable to spoil, came to 
an anclior for a time, short of the Pool,^ or fresh- 
water part of the river, even as low as tlie river 
Medway, where several of them ran in, and others 
lay at the Nore, and in the Hope below Gravesend. 
So that by the latter end of October there was a very 
great fleet of homeward-bound ships to come up, sucn 
as the like had not been known for many years. 

^ That port of the river where the ships lie up when thev 
come home It called the Pool, and takes in all the river on both 
sides of the water, from the Tower to Cuckold's Point and 
Limehoiue.

Two particular trades were carried on by water- 
carriage all the while of the infection, and that with 
little or no interruption, very much to the advan- 
tage and comfort of the poor distressed people of the . 
city, and those were the coasting trade for com and 
the Newcastle trade for coals. 

The first of these was particularly carried on by 
small vessels from the port of Hull and other places 
on the Humber, by which great quantities or com 
were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. 
The other part of this corn-trade was from Lynn, in 
Norfolk, from Wells and Bumham, and from Yar- 
mouth, all in the same county ; and the third branch 
was from the river Medway, and from Milton, Fever- 
sham, Mai^te, and Sandwich, and all the other 
little places and ports round the coast of Kent and 
Essex. 

There was also a very good trade from the coast of 
Suffolk with com, butter, and cheese ; these vessels 
kept a constant course of trade, and without inter- 
mption came up to that market known still by the 
name of Bear Key. where they supplied the city 
plentifully with com when land-camage b^an to 
fail, and when the people began to be sick of coming 
from many places in the country. 

This also was, much of it, owing to the prudence 
and conduct of the Lord Mayor, who took such care 
to keep the roasters and seamen from danger when 
they came up, causing their com to be bought off at 
any time they wanted a market (which, however, was 
very seldom), and causing the com-fectors immedi- 
ately to unlade and deliver the vessels loaden with 
com, that they had very little occasion to come out 
of their ships or vessels, the money being always car- 
ried on board to them, and put into a pail of vinegar 
before it was carried. 

The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle- 
[«52] .

upon-iyne, without which the city would have been 
greatly distressed ; for not in the streets only, but in 
private houses and families, great quantities of coals 
were then burnt, even all the snmnier long, and when 
the weather was hottest, which was done by the 
advice of the physicians. Some indeed opposed it, 
and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot 
was a means to propagate the distemper, which was 
a fermentation and neat already in the blood ; that 
it was known to spread and increase in hot weather, 
and abate in cold ; and therefore they allq^ed that 
all contagious distempers are the worse for heat, 
became the contagion was Nourished and gained 
strength in hot weather, and was, as it were, propa- 
gated in heat. 

Others said they granted that heat in the climate 
might propagate infection, as sultry, hot weather fills 
the air with vermin and nourishes innumerable num- 
bers and kinds of venomous creatures, which breed in 
our food, in the plants, and even in our bodies, by 
the very stench of which infection may be propa- 
gated ; also, that heat in the air, or heat of weather, 
as we ordinarily call it, makes bodies relax and faint, 
exhausts the spirits, opens the pores, and makes us 
more apt to receive infection, or any evil influence, 
be it from noxious pestilential vapours, or any other 
thing in the air ; but that the heat of fire, and es- 
pecially of coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, 
had a quite different operation, the heat being not of 
the same kind, but quick and fierce, tending not to ' 
nourish but to consume and dissipate all those nox- 
ious fumes which the other kind of heat rather ex- 
haled and stagnated than separated imd burnt up. 
Besides, it was alleged that the sulphurous and nitrous 
particles that are often found to be in the coal, with 
that bituminous substance which bums, are all as- 
sisting to- clear and purge the air, and render it 
[253]

wholesome and safe to breathe in, after the noxious 
particles, as above, are dispersed and burnt up. 

The latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as 
I must confess, I think with good reason, and the 
experience of the citizens confirmed it, many houses 
which had constant fires kept in the rooms having 
never been infected at all ; and I must join my ex- 

Crience to it, for I found the keeping good fires 
pt our rooms sweet and wholesome, and I do verily 
believe made our whole family so, more than would 
.^herwise have been. 

But I return to the coals as a trade. It was with 
no little difficulty thaf this trade was kept open, and 
particularly because, as we were in an open war with 
the Dutch at that time, the Dutch capers at first 
took a great many of our collier-ships, which made 
the rest cautious, and made them to stay to come in 
fleets together. But after some time the capers were 
either afraid to take them, or their masters, the 
States, were afraid they should, and forbade them, 
lest the plague should be among them, which made 
them fare we better. 

For the security of those northern traders, the coal- 
ships were ordered by my Lord Mayor not to come up 
into the Pool above a certain numoer at a time, and 
ordered lighters and other vessels, such as the wood- 
mongers, that is, the wharf-keepers or coal-sellers, 
furnished, to go down and take out the coals as low as 
Deptford ana Greenwich, and some farther down. 

Others delivered great quantities of coals in par- 
ticular places, where the ships could come to tlie 
shore, as at Greenwich, Blackwall, and other places, 
in vast heaps, as if to be kept for sale, but were then 
fetched away, after the ships which brought them 
were gone, so that the seamen had no communication 
with the river-men, nor so much as came near one 
another.

Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent 
the distemper getting among the colliery, that is to 
say, among the ships, by which a great many aeamen 
died of it ; and that which was still worse was, that 
they carried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and other places on the coast, 
where, especially at Newcastle and at Sunderland, it 
carried on a great number of people. 

The making so many lires, as above, did indeed 
consume an unusual auantity of coals ; and that upon 
one or two stops of tne ships coining up, whether by 
contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies 
I do not remember, but the price of coals was ex- 
ceeding dear, even as hieh as £i a chalder ; but it 
soon abated when the ships came in, and as after- 
wards they had a freer passage, the price was very 
reasonable all the rest of that year. 

The public fires which were made on these occa- 
sions, aa I have calculated it, must necessarily have 
cost the city about SOO chalders of coals a week, if 
they had continued, which was indeed a very great 
quantity ; but as it was thought necessary, nothing 
was spared. Howev^, as some of the physicians 
cried them down, they were not kept alight above 
four or five days. The fires were oraered thus : — 

One at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, 
one at Queenhithe, and one at the Three Cranes ; one 
in Blackfriars, and one at the gate of Bridewell ; 
one at the comer of Leadenhall Street and Grace- 
church ; one at the north and one at the south gate 
of the Royal Exchange ; one at Guild Hall, and one 
at Blackwell Hall gate ; one at the Lord Mayor's 
door in St Helen's, one at the west entrance into St. 
Paul's, and one at the entrance into Bow Church. I 
do not remember whether there was any at the city 
gates, but one at the Bridge-foot there was, just by 
St. Magnus Church.

I know some have quarrelled since that at the 
experiment, and said that there died the more people 
because of those fires ; but I am persuaded those that 
say so ofier no evidence to prove it, neither can I 
believe it on any account whatever. 

It remains to give some account of the state of 
trade at home in England during this dreadful time, 
and particularly as it relates to the manufactures and 
the trade in the city. At the first breaking out of 
the infection there was, as it is easy to suppme, a 
very great fright among the people, and consequently 
a general stop of trade, except in provisions and 
necessaries of life ; and even in those things, as there 
was a vast number of people fled and a very ereat 
number always sick, besides the number which died, 
so there could not be above two-thirds, if above one- 
half^ of the consumption of provisions in the city as 
used to be. 

It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of 
com and fruit, but not of hay or grass, by which 
means bread was cheap, by reason of the plenty of 
com. Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity of 
grass ; but butter and clieese were dear, for the same 
reason, and hay in the market just beyond White- 
chapel Bars was sold at £i per load. But that 
afiected not the poor. There was a most excessive 
plenty of all sorts of fruit, such as apples, pears, 

CIS, cherries, grapes, and they were the cheaper 
use of the want of people ; but this made the 
poor eat them to excess, ana this brought them into 
fluxes, griping of the guts, surfeits, and the like, 
which often precipitated them into the plague. 

But to come to matters of trade. First, foreign 
exportation being stopped or at least very much in- 
terrupted and rendered difficult, a general stop of 
all those manufactures followed of course which were 
usually brought for exportation ; and though some-

times mercbaDts abroad were importunatie for goods, 
yet little was sent, the passages beine so generaUy 
stopped that the English ships wouM not be ad- 
mitted, as is said alrrauly, into their port. 

This put a stop to the manufactures that were for 
exportation in meet parts of England, except in 
some out'ports ; and even that was soon stopped, for 
they all had the plague in tbeir turn. But though 
this was felt all over England, yet, what was still 
worse, all intercourse of tirade for home consumption 
of manufactures, especially those which usually cir- 
culated through the Londoners' hands, was stopped 
at once, the trade of the city being stopped. 

All kinds of handicrafts in the city,«c, tradesmen 
EUid mechanics, were, as I have said before, out of 
employ, and this occasioned the putting off and dis- 
missing an innumerable number of journeymen and 
workmen of atl sorts, seeing nothing was done relat- 
ing to such trades but what might be scud to be 
absolutely necessary. 

This caused the multitude of single people in Lon- 
don to be unprovided for, as also of families whose 
living depended upon the labour of the heads of those 
families ; I say, this reduced them to extreme misery ; 
and I must confess it is for the honour of the city of 
London, and will be for many ages, as long as this is 
to be spoken of, that they were able to supply with 
charitable provision the wants of so many thousands 
of those as af^rwards fell sick and were distressed, so 
that it may be safely averred that nobody perished 
for want, at least that the magistrates had any notice 
given them of. 

This stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the 
country would have put the people there to much 
greater difficulties, but that the master-workmen, 
clothiers and others, to the uttermost of their stocks 
and strength, kept on making their goods to keep the

poor at work, believing that as soon as the sickness 
should abate they would have a auick demand in pro- 
portion to the decay of their trade at that time. But 
as none hilt those masters that were rich could do 
thus, and that many were poor and not able, the 
manufacturing trade in England suffered greatly, 
and the poor were pinched (ul over England by the 
calamity of the city of London only. 

It is true that the next year made them full amends 
by another terrible calamity upon the city ; so that 
the city by one calamity impoverished and weakened 
the countiy, and by another calamity, even terrible 
too of its kind, enriched the country and made them 
again amends ; for an infinite quantity of household 
stuff", wearing apparel, and other things, besides 
whole warehouses filled with merchandise and manu- 
factures, such as come from all parts of England, 
were consumed in the fire of London the next year 
after this terrible visitation. It is incredible what a 
trade this made all over the whole kingdom, to make 
good the want and to supply that loss ; so that, in 
short, all the nianubcturing hands in the nation were 
set on work, and were little enough for several years 
to supply the market and answer the demands. All 
foreign markets also were empty of our goods by the 
stop which had been occasioned by the plague, and 
before an open trade was allowea again ; and the 
prodigious demand at home falling in, joined to 
make a quick vent for all sorts of goods ; so that 
there never was known such a trade (ul over England 
for the time as was in the first seven years after the 
plague, and after the fire of London. 

It remains now that I should say something of the 
merciful part of this terrible judgment, llie last 
week in September, the plague being come to its 
crisis, its fury b^an to assuage. I remember my 
friend Dr. Heath, coming to see me the week before 
[SS8]

told me he was sure that the violence of it would 
assuage in a few days; but when I saw the weekly 
bill of that week, which was the highest of the whole 
year, being 8297 of all diseases, I upbraided him 
with it, and asked him what he had made his judg- 
ment from. His answer, however, was not so muoi 
to seek as I thought it would have been. "Look 
you," says he, '* by the number which are at this 
time sick and infected, there should have been twenty 
thousand dead the last week instead of eight thou- 
sand, if the inveterate mortal contagion had been as 
it was two weeks ago ; for then it ordinarily killed 
in two or three days, now not under eight or ten ; 
and then not above one in £ve recovered, whereas I 
have observed that dow not above two in five mis- 
carry. Aud, observe it from me, the next bill will 
decrease, and you will see many more people recover 
than used to do; for though a vast multitude are 
now everywhere infected, and as many eveiy day fall 
sick, yet there will not so many die as there did, for 
the malignity of the distemper is abated ;^ adding 
that he Began now to hope, nay, more than hope, 
that the injection had passed its crisis and was going 
off; and accordingly so it was, for the next week 
being, as I said, the last in September, the bill de- 
creased almost two thousand. 

It is true the plague was still at a frightful height, 
and the next bill was no less than 6460, and the next 
to that, 5720 ; but still my friend's observation was 
just, and it did appear the people did recover &ster 
and morein number than they used to do ; and indeed, 
if it had not been so, what had been the condition 
of the city of London ? For, according to my friend, 
there were not fewer than 60,000 people at that 
time infected, whereof, as above, 20,477 died, and 
near 40,000 recovered; whereas, had it been as it 
was before, 50,000 of that number would very prob-

ably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more 
would have sickened ; for, in a word, the whole mass 
of people began to sicken, and it looked as if none 
would escape. 

But this remark of mj friend's appeared more evi- 
dent in a few weeks more, for the decrease went on, 
and another week in October it decreased 1843, so 
that the number dead of the plague was but 2665 ; 
and the next week it decreased 1413 more, and yet 
it was seen plainly that there was abundance of 
people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and 
abundance fell sick every dav, but (as above) the 
malignity of the disease abated. 

Such is the precipitant disposition of our people 
(whether it is so or not all over the world, that's 
none of my particular business to inquire), but I saw 
it apparently here, that as upon the first ftightof the 
infection, they shunned one another, and fled from 
one another's houses and from the city with an un- 
accountable and, as I thought, unnecessary fright, so 
now, upon this notion spreading, viz., that the dis- 
temper was not so catching as formerly, and that if it 
was catched it was not so mortal, and seeing abund- 
ance of people who really fell sick recover again daily, 
they took to such a precipitant courage, and grew so 
entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, 
that tncy made no more of the plague than of an 
ordinary fever, nor indeed so much. They not only 
went boldly into company with those who had 
tumours and carbuncles upon them that were run- 
ning, and consequently contagious, but ate and 
drank with them, nay, into Sieir houses to visit 
them, and even, as I was told, into their very cham- 
bers where they lay sick. 

This I could not see rational. My friend Dr. 

Heath allowed, and it was plain to experience, that 

the distemper was as catchmg as ever, and as many

fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of those 
that fell sick did not die ; out I think that while many 
did die, and that at best the distemper itself was 
very terrible, the sores and swellings very torment- 
ing) BJid the danger of death not left out of the cir- 
cumstance of sickness, though not so frequent as 
before ; all those things, to^ber with the exceed- 
ing tediousness of the cure, uie loathsomeness of the 
disease, and many other articles, were enough to de- 
ter any man living from a dangerous mixture with 
the sick people, and make them as anxious almost to 
avoid the infection as before. 

Nay, there was another thing which made the 
mere catching of the distemper irightful, and that 
was the terrible burning of the caustics which the 
surgeons laid on the sweUings to bring them to break 
and to run, without which the danger of death was 
very great, even to the last Also, the insufferable 
torment of the swellings, which, though it might not 
make people raving and distracted, as they were be- 
fore, and as I have given several instances of already, 
yet they put the patient to inexpressible torment ; 
and those that fell into it, though they did escape 
with life, yet they made bitter complaints of those 
that had told them there was no danger, and sadly 
repented their rashness and folly in venturing to run 
into the reach of it 

Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end 
here, for a great many that thus cast on their cau- 
tions sufiered more deeply still, and thoueh many 
escaped, yet many died; and at least it bad this 
pubuc mischief attending it, that it made the de- 
crease of burials slower than it would otherwise have 
been. For as this notion ran like lightning through 
the city, and people's heads were possessm with it, 
even as soon as the first great decrease in the bills 
appeared, we found that the two next bills did not 
[261]

decrease in proportion ; the reason I take to be the 
people^s running so rashly into danger, giving up all 
their former cautions and care, and all the shyness 
which they used to practise, depending that the 
sickness would not reach them, or that if it did, they 
should not die. 

llie physicians opposed this thoughtless humour 
of the people with all their might, and gave out 
printed directions, spreading them all over the citv 
and suburbs, advising the people to continue reserveo, 
and to use still the utmost caution in their ordinary 
conduct, notwithstanding the decrease of the dis- 
temper, terrifying them with thedangerof bringinga 
relapse upon the whole city, and telling them how such 
a relapse might be more iatal and dangerous than the 
whole visitation that had been already ; with many 
arguments and reasons to explain and prove that 
part to them, and which are too long to repeat here. 

But it was all to no purpose ; the audacious creat- 
ures were so possessed with the first joy and so sur- 
prised with the satis&ction of seeing a vast decrease 
in the weekly bills, that they were impenetrable by 
any new terrors, and would not be persuaded but 
that the bitterness of death was past ; and it was to 
no more purpose to talk to them than to an east 
wind ; but they opened shops, went about streets, 
did business, and conversed with anybody that came 
in their way to converse with, whether with business 
or without, neither inquiring of their health or so 
much as being apprehensive of any danger from 
them, though they knew them not to be sound. 

This imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many 
their lives who had with great care and caution shut 
themselves up and kept retired, as it were, from all 
mankind, and had by that means, under Grod's provi- 
dence, been preserved through all the heat of that 
infection.

This rash and foolish conduct, I say, of the people 
went BO far that the ministers took notice to them of 
it at last, and laid before them both the folly and 
danger of it ; and this checked it a little, so that 
they grew more cautious. But it had another effect, 
which they could not check; for as the first rumour 
had spread not over the city only, but into the coun- 
try, it hod the like effect, and the people were so 
tired with being so long from London, and so eager 
to come back, Sat they flocked to town without fear 
or forecast, and began to show themselves in tlie 
streets, as if all the danger was over. It was indeed 
surprising to see it, for though there died still from 
1000 to 1800 a week, yet the people flocked to town 
as if all had been well. 

The consequence of this was, that the bills in- 
creased again 400 the very first week in November ; 
and if I might believe the physicians, there was 
above 3000 lelt sick that weelc, most of tliem new- 
comers, too. 

One John Cock, a barber in St Martin's-le-Grand, 
was an eminent example of this ; I mean of the hasty 
return of the pemle when the plague was abated. 
This John Cock had left the town with his whole 
family, and locked Up his house, and was gone in the 
countiy, as many others did ; and finding the pU^e 
so decreased in November that there died but w5 
per week of all diseases, he ventured home again. 
He had in his family ten persons ; that is to say, 
himself and wife, Ave children, two apprentices, and 
a maid-servant. He had not been returned to his 
house above a week, and began to open his shop and 
cany on his trade, but the distemper broke out in 
bb family, and within about five days they all died, 
except one ; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his 
Ave children, and his two apprentices ; and only the 
maid remained alive.

But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than 
we had reason to expect ; for the malignity, as I 
have said, of the distemper was spent, the contagion 
was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on 
apace, and the air was clear and cold, with some 
sharp frosts ; and this increasing still, most of those 
that had fidlen sick recovered, and the health of the 
city beean to return. There were indeei) some re- 
turns of the distemper even in the month of Decem- 
ber, and the bills increased near a hundred ; but it 
went ofT again, and so in a short while things began 
to return to their own channel. And woimerfia it 
was to see how populous the city was again all on a 
sudden, so that a stranger could not miss the num- 
bers that were lost Neither was there any miss 
of the inhabitants as to their dwellings, few or no 
empty houses were to be seen, or if there were some, 
there was no want of tenants for them. 

I wish I could say that as the city had a new face, 
so the manners of tne people had a new appearance. 
I doubt not but there were many that retained a 
sincere sense of their deliverance, and that were 
heartily thankful to that Sovereign Hand that had 
protected them in so dangerous a time ; it would be 
very uncharitable to jut^ otherwise in a city so 
populous, and where the people were so devout as 
they were here in the time of the visitation itself; 
but except what of this was to be found in particular 
liimilies and faces, it must be acknowledged that the 
general practice of the people was just as it was 
before, and very little difference was to be seen. 

Some, indeed, said things were worse ; that the 
morals of the people declined from this very time ; 
that the people, hardened by the danger they had 
been in, like seamen after a storm is over, were more 
wicked and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in 
their vices and immoralities than they were before ;

but I will not carry it so far neither. It would take 
up a history of no small length to give a particular 
of all the gradations by which the course of things 
in this city came to be restored again, and to run in 
their own channel as they did before. 

Some parts of England were now infected as vio- 
lently as London had been : the cities of Norwich, 
Peterborough, lincoln, Colchester, and other places 
were now visited; and the magistrates of London 
began to set rules for our conduct as to correspond- 
ing with those cities. It is true we could not pre- 
tend to forbid their people coming to London, 
because it was impossible to know them asunder, so, 
after many consultations, the Lord Mayor and Court 
of Aldermen were obliged to drop it All they 
could do was to warn and caution the people not 
to entertain in their houses or converse with any 
people who they knew came from such infected 
places. 

But they might as well have talked to the air, for 
the people of London thought themselves so plague- 
free now that they were past aU admonitions ; they 
seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored, 
and that the air was like a man that had had the 
small-pox, not capable of being infected again. This 
revived that notion that the infection was all in the 
air, that there was no such thing as contagion from 
the sick people to the sound ; and so strongly did 
this whimsy prevail among people that they ran all 
together promiscuously, sick and well. Not the 
Mahometans, who, prepossessed with the principle 
of predestination, value nothing of contagion, let it 
be in what it will, could be more obstinate than the 
people of London ; they that were perfectly sound, 
and came out of the wholesome air, as we cafl it, into 
the city, made nothing of going into the same 
houses and chambers, nay, even into the same beds,

with those that had the distemper upon them, and 
were not recovered. 

Some, indeed, pud for their audacious boldness 
with the price of their lives ; an infinite number fell 
sick, and the physicians bad more work than ever, 
only with this difference, that more of their patimts 
recovered ; that is to say, they generally recovered, 
but certainly there were more people infected and 
fell sick now, when there did not die above a thou- 
sand or twelve hundred in a week, than there was 
when there died five or six thousand a week, so 
entirely negligent were the people at that time in 
the great and dangerous case of health and infection, 
and so ill were they able to take or accept of the ad- 
vice of those who cautioned them for their good. 

The people being thus returned, as it were, in 
general, it was very strange to find, that in their in- 
quiring after their friends, some whole families were 
so entirely swept away that there was no remem- 
brance of them left, neither was anybody to be found 
to possess or show any title to that little they had 
left ; for in such cases what was to be found was 
generally embezzled and purloined, some gone one 
way, some another. 

It was said such abandoned effects came to the 
king, as the uuivereat heir, upon which we are told, 
and I suppose it was in part true, that the king 
granted all such, as deodands, to the Lord Mayor 
and Court of Aldermen of London, to be applied to 
the use of the poor, of whom there were very many. 
For it is to be observed, that though the occasions 
of relief and the objects of distress were very many 
more in the time of the violence of the plague than 
now after all was over, vet the distress of me poor 
was more now a great deal than it was then, because 
all the sluices of general chanty were now shut. 
People supposed the main occasion to be over, and

so stopped their hands; whereas particular objects 
vere still very moving, and the distress of those that 
were poor was very great indeed. 

Though the healui of the city was now very much 
restored, yet foreign trade did not begin to stir, 
neither would foreieners admit our ships into their 
ports for a great while. As for the Dutch, the mis- 
understandings between our court and them had 
broken out into a war the year before, so that our 
trade that way was wholly interrupted ; but Spain and 
Portugal, Italy and Barbanr, as also Hamburg and 
all the ports in the Baltic, tJiese were all shy of us a 
great while, and would act restore trade with us for 
m^iy months. 

Ine distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as 
I have observed, many if not all the out-parishes were 
obliged to make new burying-grounds, besides that 
I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields, some of which 
were continued, and remain in use to this day. But 
others were left off, and which, I confess, I mention 
with some reflection, being converted into other 
uses or built upon afterwams, the dead bodies were 
disturbed, abused, dug up again, some even before 
the flesh of tliem was penshed from the bones, and 
removed like dung or rubbish to other places. Some 
of those which came within the reach of my obser- 
vation are as follow : 

1. A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near 
Mount Mill, being some of the remains of the old 
lines or fortifications of the city, where abundance 
were buried promiscuously from the parishes of 
Aldei-sgate, Clerkenwell, and even out of the city. 
This ground, as I take it, was since made a physic 
garden, and after that has been built upon. 

3. A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, 
as it was then called, at the end of Hollowav Lane, 
in Shoreditch parish. It has been since oiadea yard

for keeping ht^s, and for other ordinary uses, but 
is quite out of use as a burying-ground. 

3. The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate 
Street, which was then a green field, and was taken 
in particularly for Bishopsgate parish, though many 
of the carts out of the city Drought their dead 
thither also, particularlyout of the parish of St. All- 
hallows on the Wall. This place I cannot mention 
without much regret It was, as I remember, about 
two ot thi-ee years after the j^ague was ceased that 
Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of the 
ground. It was reported, how ti-ue I know not, that 
it fell to the king for want of heirs, all those who 
had any right to it being carried ofT by the pesti- 
lence, and that Sir Robert Clayton obtained a grant 
of it from King Charles H. But however he came 
by it, certain it is the ground was let out to build 
on, or built upon, by his order. The fii-st house 
built upon it was a urge fair house, still standing, 
which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley, 
which, though called an alley, is as wide as a street. 
The houses in the same row with that house north- 
ward are built on the very same ground where the 
poor people were buried, and the bodies, on opening 
the ground for the foundations, were dug up, some 
of Uiem remaining so plain to be seen that the 
women's skulls were diKtinguished by their long hair, 
and of others the flesh was not quite perished; so 
that the people h^an to exclaim loudly against it, 
and some suggested that it might endanger a return 
of the contagion ; after which the bones and bodies, 
as fast as they came at them, were carried to another 
part of the same ground and thrown all together into 
a deep pit, dug on purpose, which now is to be known 
fn that it is not built on, but is a passage to another 
house at the upper end of Rose Alley, just against 
the door of a meeting-house, which has been built

there many years since ; and the ground is paliaadoed 
off from the rest of the passage, in a little square ; 
there lie the bones and remaias of near two thousand 
bodies, carried by the dead carts to their grave in 
that one year. 

4. Besides this, there was a piece of ground in 
Moorfields, hy the going into the street which is now 
called Old Bethlem, which was enlaiged much, though 
not wholly taken in on the same occasion. 

[iV. B. — The author of this journal lies buried in 
that very ground, being at hb own dexire, his sister 
having been buried there a few years before.] 

5. Stepney parish, extending itself Irom the east 
part of London to the north, even to the very edge 
of Shoreditch Churchyard, had a piece of ground 
taken in to bury their dead close to the said church- 
yard, and which for that very reason was left open, 
and is since, I suppose, taken into the same church- 
yard. And they had also two other burying-places 
m Spitaltields, one where since a chapel or tabernacle 
has Deen built for ease to this great parish, and 
another in Petticoat Lane. 

There were no less than five other grounds made 
use of for the parish of Stepney at that time, one 
where now stands the parisn church of St. Paul, 
Shadwell, and the other where now stands the parish 
church of St. John's at Wapping, both whicn had 
not the names of parishes at that time, but were 
belonging to Stepney parish. 

I could name many more, but these coming within 
my particular knowledge, the circumstance, I thought, 
made it of use to record them. From the whole, it 
may be observed that they were obliged in this time 
. of distress to take in new nurjing-groiinds in most of 
the out-parishes for laying the prodigious numbera 
of people which died in so short a space of time ; hut 
why care was not taken to keep tht^e places separate

from ordinary uaes, that so the bodies might rest un- 
disturbed, that I cannot answer for, and must confess 
I think it was wrong. Who were to blame I know 
not 

I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at 
that time also a burying-ground set apart to their 
use, and which they still make use of; and they had 
also a particular dead-cart to fetch their dead from 
their houses ; and the famous Solomon Eagle, who, 
as I mentioned before, had predicted the plague as a 
judgment, and ran naked through the streets, telling 
the people that it was come upon them to punish 
them for their sins, had his own wife died the very 
next day of the plague, and was carried, one of the 
first in the Quakers^ dead-cart, to their new burying- 
ground. 

I might have thronged this account with many 
more remarkable things which occurred in the time 
of the infection, and particularly what passed between 
the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was then at 
Oxford, and what directions were from time to time 
received from the Government for their conduct on 
this critical occasion. But really the Court con- 
cerned themselves so little, and that little they did 
was of so small import, that I do not see it of much 
moment to mention any part of it here, except that 
of appointing a monthly fast in the city and the 
sending the royal charity to the relief of the poor, 
both which I have mentioned before. 

Great was the reproach thrown on those physicians 
who left their patients during the sickness, and now 
they came to town again nobody cared to employ 
them. Iliey were csJled descrtei-s, and frequently 
bills were set up upon their doors and written, 
" Here is a doctor to be let,^ so that several of 
those physicians were fain for a while to sit still and 
look about them, or at least remove their dwellings, 
[870]

and set up in new places and among new acquain- 
tance. The like was the case with the clergy, whom 
the people were indeed very abusive to, writing verses 
and scandalous reflections upon them, setting upon 
the church-door, " Here is a pulpit to be fct, or 
sometimes, "to be sold," which was worse. 

It was not the least of our misfortunes, that with 
our infection, when it ceased, there did not cease the 
spirit of strife and contention, slander and reproach, 
which was really the great troubler of the nation's 
peace before. It was said to be the remwns of the 
old animosities, which bad so lately involved us all 
in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of In- 
demnity had laid asleep the quarrel itself, so the 
Government had recommended family and personal 
peace upon all occasions to the whole nation. 

But it could not be obtained, and particularly 
after the ceasing of the plague in London, when any 
one that had seen the condition which the people 
bad been in, and how they caressed one another at 
that time, promised to have more chari^ for the 
fiiture, and to raise no more reproaches ; 1 say, any 
one that had seen tbera then would have thought 
they would have come together with another spirit 
at last. But, I say, it could not be obtained. The 
quarrel remained ; the Chureh and the Presbyterians 
were incompatible. As soon as the plague was re- 
moved, the Dissenting ousted ministers who had 
supplied the pulpits which were deserted by the in- 
cumbents retired ; they could expect ao other but 
that they should immediately fall upon them and 
harass tnem with their penal laws, accept their 
preaching while they were sick, and persecute them 
as soon as they were recovered again ; this even we 
that were of the Church thought was veiy hard, and 
oould by no means approve of it 

But it was the Government, and we could say

nothing to hinder it; we could only sav it was not 
our doing, and we could not answer for it. 

On the other hand, the Dissenteis reproaching 
thoee ministers of the Church with going away and 
deserting their charge, abandoning the people in 
their danger, and when they had most need of com- 
fort, and the like, this we could by no means ap- 
prove, for all men have not the same faith and the 
same courage, and the Scripture commands us 
to judge toe most favourably and according to 
charity. 

A plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with 
terrors that every man is not sufficiently fortified to 
resist or prepared to stand the shock against It is 
very cerbun that a great many of the derey who 
were in circumstances to do it withdrew and ned for 
the safety of their lives ; but 't is true also that a 
great many of them stayed, and many of them 
fell in the calamity and in Uie discharge of their 
duty. 

It is true some of the Dissenting turned-out minis- 
ters stayed, and their courage is to be commended 
and highly valued, but these were not abundance ; it 
cannot be said that they all stayed, and that none 
retired into the country, any more than it can be said 
of the Church clergy that they all went away. Neither 
did all those that went away go without substituting 
curates and otheis in their places, to do the oiTices 
needful and tu visit the sick, as £u- as it was practi- 
cable ; so that, upon the whole, an allowance of 
charity might have been made on both sides, and we 
should have considered that such a time as this of 
1665 is not to be paralleled in history, and that it is 
not the stoutest courage that will always support 
men in such cases. I liad not said this, but nad 
rather chosen to record the counu^ and religious 
zeal of those of both sides, who did hazard tnem-

selves for the service of the poor people in their dis- 
tress, without remembering that any failed in their 
duty on either side. But the want of temper among 
us has made the contrary to this necessary, some 
that stayed not only boasting too much of them- 
selves, but reviling those that fled, branding them 
with cowardice, desertine their flocks, and acting the 
part of the hireling, and the like. I recommend it 
to the charity of all good people to look back and 
reflect duly upon the terrors of the time, and who- 
ever does so will see that it is not an ordinary strength 
that could support it. It was not like appearing tn 
the head of an army or charging a body of horse in 
the field, but it was charging Death itself on his 
pale horse ; to stay was indeed to die, and it could 
oe esteemed nothing less, especially as things ap- 
peared at the latter end of August and the oegin- 
ning of September, and as there was reason to expect 
them at that time : for no man expected, and I dare 
say believed, that the distemper would take so sud- 
den a turn as it did, and fall immediately 2000 in a 
week, when there was such a prodigious number of 
people sick at that time as it was known there was ; 
and then it was that many shifted away that had 
stewed most of the time beiore. 

Besides, if God gave strength to some more thiui 
to others, was it to boast of their ability to abide 
the stroke, and upbraid those that had not the same 
gift and support, or ought not they rather to have 
been humble and thankful if they were rendered more 
useful than their brethren f 

I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of 
such men, as well clergy as physicians, surgeons, 
apothecaries, magistrates, and officers of every kind, 
as also all iiseful people who ventured their fives in 
discharge of their duty, as most certainly all such as 
stayed aid to the la^it degree, and several of aU these

kinds did not only venture but lose their lives on 
that sad ctccasion. 

I was once making a list of all such, I mean of all 
those professions and employments who thus died, as 
I call it, in the way of their duty ; but it was impos- 
sible for a private man to come at a certainty in the 
parUculars. I only remember that there died six- 
teen clergymen, two aldermen, five physicians, thir- 
teen suigeons, within the city and liSerties before 
the beginning of September. But this being, as I 
said before, tlie great crisis and extremity of the in- 
fection, it can be no complete list As to inferior 
people, I think theie died six-and-forty constables 
and head-boroughs in the two parishes of Stepney 
and Whitechapel ; but I could not carry my list on, 
for when the violent rage of the distemper in Sep- 
tember came upon us, it drove us out of all measures. 
Men did then no more die by tale and by number. 
They might put out a weekly bill, and call them 
seven or eight thousand, or what they pleased ; 't is 
certain they died by heaps, and were buned by heaps, 
that is to say, without account. And if I might be- 
lieve some people, who were more abroad and more 
conversant with those things than I — though I was 

Sublic enough for one that had no more business to 
o than I had, — I say, if I may believe them, there 
was not many less buried those first three weeks in 
September than S0,000 per week. However the 
others aver the truth of it, yet I rather choose to 
keep to the public account ; seven and eight thou- 
sand per week is enough to make good all that I 
have stiid of the terror of those times ; and it is 
much to the satisfaction of me that write, as well as 
those that read, to be able to say that everything is 
set down with moderation, and rather within com- 
pass than beyond it 

Upon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when

we were recovered, our conduct had been more dis- 
tinguished for charity and kindness in remembrance 
of the past calamity, and not so much a valuing 
ourselves upon our boldness in staying, as if all men 
were cowards that fly from ihe hand of God, or that 
those who stay do not sometimes owe their courage to 
their ignorance and despising the hand of their 
Maker, which is a criminal kind of desperation, and 
not a true courage, 

I cannot but leave it upon record that the civil 
officers, such as constables, head-boroughs. Lord 
Mayor's and sheriifs'-men, as also parish-officers, 
whose business it was to take charge of the poor, did 
their duties in general with as much courage as any, 
and perhaps with more, because their work was at- 
tended with more hazards, and lay more among the 
poor, who were more subject to be infected, and in 
the most pitiful plight when they were taken with 
the infection. But then it must be added to that a 
great number of them died ; indeed it was scarce 
possible it should be otherwise. 

I have not said one word Here about the physic 
or preparations that we ordinarily made use of on 
this terrible occasion — I mean we that went fre- 
quently abroad up and down street, as I did ; much 
of this was talked of in the books and bills of our 

?uack doctors, of whom 1 have said enough already, 
t may, however, be added, that the College of Physi- 
cians were daily publishing several preparations, 
which they had considered of in the process of their 
practice, and which being to be had in print, I avoid 
repeating them for that reason. 

One thing I could not help observing, what befell 
one of the quacks, who published that he had a most 
excellent preservative against the plague, which who- 
ever kept about them should never be infected or 
liable to infection. This man, who, we may reason-

ably suppose, did not go abroad without some of 
this excellent preservative in his pocket, yet was 
taken by the distemper, and carried off in two or 
three days. 

I am not of the number of the physic-haters or 
physic-despiseiB : on the contrary, I have often men- 
tioned the r^ard I had to the dictates of my partic> 
ular friend Dr. Heath ; but yet I must acknowledge 
I made use of little or nothing, except, as I have 
observed, to keep a preparation of strong scent to 
have ready, in case I met with anything of ofiensive 
smells, or went too near any burying-place or dead 
body. 

Neither did I do, what I know some did, keep the 
spirits always high and hot with cordials and wine, 
and such things, and which, as I observed, one learned 
physician used himself so much to as that he could 
not leave tliem off when the infection was quite gone, 
and BO became a sot for all his life after. 

I remember my Iriend the doctor used to say that 
there was a certain set of drugs and preparations 
which were all certainly good and useful in the case 
of an infection, out of which, or with which, phy- 
sicians might make an infinite variety of medianes, 
as the ringers of bells make several hundred different 
rounds of music by the changing and order of sound 
but in six bells, and that all these preparations shall 
be really very good : " Therefore, said he, *' I do 
not wonder that so vast a throng of medicines is 
offered in the present calamity, and almost eveiy 
physician prescribes or prepares a different thing, as 
his judgment or experience guides him ; but," says 
my friend, *' let all the prescriptions of all the phy- 
sicians in London be examined, and it will be found 
that thev are all compounded of the same things, 
with sucn variations only as the particular fancy of 
the doctor leads him to ; so that, says he, " every

man, judging a little of his own constitution and 
manner of hia living, and circumstances of his being 
infected, may direct his own medicines out of the 
ordinary drugs and preparations. Only that,^ says 
be " some recommend one thing as most sovereiKni 
and some another. Some," says he, "think that 
piil. ruff., which is called itself the antipestilential 
pill, is the best preparation that can be made ; 
others think that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself 
to resist the contagion ; and I," says he, " think as 
both these think, viz., that the last is eood to take 
beforehand to prevent it, and the last, if touched, to 
expel it." According to this opinion, I several times 
took Venice treacle, and a sound sweat upon it, and 
thought myself as well fortified against the infection 
as any one could be fortified l^ the power of 
physic. 

As for quackery and mountebanks, of which the 
town was so fiill, I listened to none of them, and 
have observed often since, with some wonder, that 
for two years after the plague I scarcely saw or' 
heard of one of them about town. Some &ncied 
they were all swept away in the infection to a man, 
and were for calling it a particular mark of God's 
vengeance upon them for leading the poor people 
into the pit of destruction, merely for the lucre of a 
little money they got by them ; but I cannot go that 
length neither. ^Hiat abundance of them died is 
certain ; many of them came within the reach of my 
own knowledge ; but that all of them were swept off 
I much question. I believe rather they fled into the 
country, and tried their practices upon the people 
there, who were in apprehension of the infection 
before it came among them. 

This, however, is certain, not a man of them ap- 
peared for a great while in or about London. There 
were, indeed, several doc-tors who published bills rec-

cleansing Uie body, as they call it, after the plague, 
and needful, as they said, for such people to take who 
bad been visited and had been cured ; whereas, I 
must own, I believe that it was the opinion of the 
most eminent physidans at that time that the plague 
was itself a sufficient pume, and that those who 
escaped the infection neet^ no physic to cleanse 
their bodies of any other things, the running sores, 
the tumours, &c., which were oroke and kept open 
by the directions of the physicians, having sufficiently 
cleansed them ; and that all other dis^mpers, and 
causes of distempers, were effectually carriea off that 
way ; and as the physicians gave this as their opinions 
wherever they came, the quacks got little business. 

TTiere were, indeed, several Tittle hurries which 
happened after the decrease of the plague, and which, 
whether they were contrived to fnght and disorder 
the people, as some imagined, I cannot say, but 
sometimes we were told the plague would return by 
such a time ; and the famous Solomon Eagle, the 
naked Quaker I have mentioned, prophesied evil 
tidings eveiy day ; and several others telling us that 
London had not been sufficiently scourged, and that 
sorer and severer strokes were yet behind. Had they 
stopped there, or had they descended to particulars, 
ana told us that the city should the next vear be 
destroyed by fire, then, indeed, when we had^seen it 
come to pass, we should not have been to blame to 
have paid more than a common respect to their 
prophetic spirits ; at least we should have wondered 
at tnem, and liave been more serious in our inquiries 
after the meaning of it, and whence they had the 
foreknowledge. But as they generally told us of a 
relapse into the plague, we have had no concern since 
that about them ; yet by those frequent clamours, 
we were all kept with some kind of apprehensions

constantly upon us ; and if any died suddenly, or if 
the spotted fevers at any time increased, we were 
preseutlv alarmed ; much more if the number of the 
plague increased, for to the end of the year there 
were always between 300 and 300 of the plague. 
On any of these occasions, I say, we were aJarmed 
anew. 

Those who remember the city of London before 
the fire must remember that there was then no such 
place as that we now call Newgate Market, but that 
in the middle of the street which is now called Blow- 
bladder Street, and which had its name from the 
butchers, who used to kill and dress their sheep there 
(and who, it seems, had a custom to blow up their 
meat with pipes to make it look thicker and fatter 
than it was, and were punished there for it by the 
Lord Mayor) ; I say, mm the end of the street to- 
wards Newgate there stood two long rows of shambles 
for the selling meaL 

It was in those shambles that two persons falling 
down dead, as they were buying meat, gave rise to a 
rumour that the meat was all infected, which, though 
it might affright the people, and spoiled the market 
for two or three days, yet it appeared plainly after- 
wards that there was nothing of truth in tne sug- 
gestion. But nobody can account for the possession 
of fear when it takes hold of the mind. 

However, it pleased God, by the continuing of the 
winter weather, so to restore the health of the city 
that by February following we reckoned the dis- 
temper quite ceased, and then we were not so easily 
frif^ted again. 

There was still a question among the learned, and 
at first perplexed the people a little, and that was in 
what manner to purge tne house and goods where 
the plague had been, and how to render them habi- 
table again, which had been left empty during the

time of the plague Abundance of perfumes aud 
preparations were prescribed by physicJAns, some of 
one kind and some of another, in which the people 
who listened to them put themselves to a great, and 
indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary expense ; 
and the poorer people, who only set open their win- 
dows night ana day, burned brimstone, pitch, and 
gunpowder, and euch things in their rooms, did as 
well as the best ; nay, the eager people, who, as 1 
said above, came home in haste and at all hazards, 
found little or no inconvenience in their houses, nor 
in the goods, and did little or nothing to them. 

However, in general, prudent, cautious people did 
enter into some measures for airing and sweetening 
their houses, and burned perfumes, incense, ben- 
jamin, rosin, aiid sulphur, in their rooms close shut 
up, and then let the air cany it all out with a blast 
of gunpowder ; others caused large fires to be made 
all day and all night for several days and nights ; by 
the same token that two or three were pleased to set 
their houses on fire, and so effectually sweetened 
them by burning them down to the ground ; as par- 
ticularly one at Ratcliff, one in Holbom, and one at 
Westminster; besides two or three that were set on 
fire, but the fire was happily got out again before 
it went far enough to bum down tbe bouses ; and 
one citizen's servant, I think it was in Thames Street, 
carried so much gunpowder into hb master's house, 
for clearing it of the infection, and managed it so 
foolishly, that he blew up part of the roof of the 
house. But the time was not fully come that the 
city was to be purged by fire, nor was it far off; 
for within nine months more I saw it all lying in 
ashes ; when, as some of our quacking philosophers 
pretend, the seeds of the plague were entirely de- 
stroyed, and not before ; a notion too ridiculous to 
speak of here, since, had the seeds of the plague

remained in the houses, not to be destroyed but by 
tire, how has it been that they have not since broken 
out, seeing all those buildings in the suburbs and 
liberties, all in the great parishes nf Stepney, White- 
chapel, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Cripple- 
gate, and St. Giles, where the tire never came, and 
where the plague raged with the greatest violence, 
remain still in the same condition they were in 
before? 

But to leave these things just as I found them, it 
was certain that those people who were more than 
ordinarily cautious of their health, did take par- 
ticular directions for what tliey called seasoning of 
their houses, and abundance of costly things were 
consumed on thiit account, which I cannot out say 
not only seasoned those houses, as they desired, but 
filled tlie air witli very grateful and wholesome 
smells, which others had the share of the benefit of 
as well as those who were at the expenses of them. 

And yet after all, though the poor came to town 
very precipitantly, as I have said, yet I must say the 
rich made no sucn haste. The men of business, in- 
deed, came up, but many of them did not bring 
their families to town till the spring came on, and 
that they saw reason to depend upon it that the 
plague would not return. 

The Court, indeed, came up soon after Christ- 
mas, but the nobility and gentry, except such as 
depended upon and had emjuoymeDt umler the ad- 
ministration, did not come so soon. 

I should have taken notice here, that notwith- 
standing the violence of the plague tn London and 
in other places, yet it was very observable that it 
was never on board the fleet, and yet for some time 
there was a strange press in the river, and even in 
the streets, for seamen to man the fleet. But it was 
in the banning of the year, when the plague was

scarce begun, and not at all come down to that 
part of the city where they usually press for seamen ; 
and though a war with the Dutch was not at all 
grateful to the people at that time, and the seamen 
went with a kind of reluctancy into the service, and 
many complained of being dragged into it by force, 
yet it proved in the event a happy violence to several 
of them, who had probably perished in the general 
calamity, and who, after the summer service was 
over, though they had cause to lament the desolation 
of their families, who — when they came back, were 
many ofthem in their graves — yet they had room 
to be thankful that they were carried out of the 
reach of it, though so much against their wills. 
We indeed had a hot war with the Dutch that year, 
and one very great engagement at sea, in which the 
Dutch were worsted, but we lost a great many men 
and some ships. But, as I observed, the plague was 
not in the fleet, and when they came to lay up 
the ships in the river tlie violent part of it began to 
abate. 

I would be glad if I could close the account of 
this melancholy year with some particular examples 
historically ; I mean of the thankfulness to God, our 
preserver, for our being delivered from this dreadful 
calamity. Certainly the circumstance of the deliver- 
ance, as well as the terrible enemy we were delivered 
from, called upon the whole nation for it. The cir- 
cumstances of the deliverance were indeed very re- 
markable, as I have in part mentioned already, and 
particulaHy the dreadful condition which we were 
all in, when we were, to the surprise of the whole 
town, made joyful with the hope of a stop of the 
infection.

but omnipotent power, could have done it The

every comer ; and had it gone on as it did then, a 
few weeks more would have cleared the town of all, 
and everything that had a soul. Men everywhere 
began to despair ; every heart failed them for fear; 
people were made desperate through the anguish of 
their souls, and the terrors of death sat in Uie very 
faces and countenances of the people. 

In that very moment, when we might very well 
say, "Vain was the help of man," — I say, in that 
very moment it pleased God, with a most agreeable 
surprise, to cause the fury of it to abate, even of 
itself; and the malignity declining, as I have said, 
though infinite numbers were sick, yet fewer died, 
and the very first week's bill decreased 1843 ; a vast 
number indeed I 

It is impossible to express the change that ap- 
peared in the very countenances of the people that 
Thursday morning when the weekly bill came out. 
It might have been perceived in their countenances 
that a secret surprise and smile of joy sat on every- 
body's face. They shook one another by the hands 
in the streets, who would hardly go on the same side 
of the way with one another before. Where the 
streets were not too broad, they would open their 
windows and call from one house to another, and 
ask how they did, and if they had heard the good 
news that the plague was al»ted. Some would re- 
turn, when they said good news, and ask, "What 
good newsP" and when they answered that the 
plague was abated and the bills decreased almost 
SOOO, they would cry out, " God be prMsed," and 
would weep aloud forjovi telling them they had 
heard nothing of it ; and such was the joy of the 
people that it was, as it were, life to them from the 
grave. I could almost set down as many extrava- 
gant things done in the excess of their joy as of their 
grief; but that would be to lessen the value of it.

I must confess myself to have beea very much de- 
jected just before this happened ; for the prodigious 
number that were taken sick the week or two before, 
besides those that died, was such, and the lamenta- 
tions were so great everywhere, that a man roust 
have seemed to have acted even against bis reason if 
he had so much as expected to escape ; and as there 
was hardly a house but mine in all my neighbour- 
hood but what was infected, so had it gone on it 
would not have been long that there would have 
been any more neighbours to be infected. Indeed 
it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc the last 
three weeks had made, for if I might believe the 
person whose calculations I always found very well 
grounded, there were not less than 30,000 people 
dead and near 100,000 fallen sick in the three weeks 
I speak of; for the number that sickened was sur- 
prising, indeed it was astonishing, and those whose 
courage upheld them all the time before, sank under 
it now. 

In the middle of their distress, when the condition 
of the city of London was so truly calamitous, just 
then it pleased God, as it were, by His immediate 
hand to disarm this enemy ; the poison was taken 
out of the sting. It was wonderful ; even the phy- 
sicians themselves were surprised at it Wherever 
they visited they found their patients better ; either 
they had sweated kindly, or the tumours were broke, 
or the carbuncles went down, and the inflammations 
round them changed colour, or the fever was gone, 
or the violent headache was assuaged, or some good 
symptom was in the case ; so that in a few days 
everybody was recovering, whole families that were 
infected and down, that had ministers praying with 
them, and expected death every hour, were revived 
and healed, and none died at all out of them. 

Nor was this by any new medicine found out, or

new method of cure discovered, or by any experience 
in the operation which the physicians or surgeons 
attained to ; but it was evidently from the secret in- 
visible hand of Him that had at first sent this disease 
as a judgment upon us ; and let the atheistic part of 
mankina call my saying what they please, it is no 
enthusiasm ; it was acknowledged at that time by all 
mankind. I^e disease was enervated and iis malig- 
nity spent ; and let it proceed from whcneesoever it 
will, let the philosophers search for reasons in nature 
to account for it by, and labour as much as they will 
to lessen the debt they owe to their Maker, those 
physicians who had the least share of religion in them 
were obliged to acknowledge that it was all super- 
natural, that it was extraurdinaty, and that no 
account could he eiven of it. 

If 1 should say that this is a visible summons tons 
all to thankfulness, especially we that were under 
the terror of its increase, perhaps it may be thought 
by some, afler the sense of the thing was over, an 
officious canting of religious things, preaching a 
sermon instead of writing a history, making myself 
a teacher instead of giving my observations of 
things ; and this restrains me very much from going 
on here, as I might otherwise do. But if ten ^pera 
were healed, and but one returned to give thanks, I 
desire to be as that one, and to be thankful for 
myself. 

N«r will I deny but there were abundance of peo- 
ple who, to all appearance, were very thankful at 
that time ; for their mouths were stopped, even the 
mouths of those whose hearts were not extraordinary 
long afiected with it But the impression was so 
strong at that time that it could not be resbted, no, 
not by the worst of the people. 

It was a common thing to meet people in the street

of, expressing their surprise. Going one day through 
Aldgate, and a pretty many people being passing 
and repassing, there comes a man out of the end of 
the Minories, and looking a little up the street and 
down, he throws his hanck abroail, " Lord, what an 
alteration is here ! Why, last week I came along 
here, and hardly anybody was to be seen.^ Another 
man, I heard him, adds to his words, "Tis all 
wonderiid ; 't is all a dream," " Blessed be God," 
says a third man, "and let us give thanks to Him, 
for ''t is all His own doing, human help and human 
skill was at an end." These were all strangers to one 
another. But such salutations as these were frequent 
in the street every day ; and in spte of a loose be- 
haviour, the vety common people went along the 
streets giving God thanks for their deliverance. 

It was now, as I said before, the people had cast 
off all apprehensions, and that too fast ; indeed we 
were no more afraid now to pass by a man with a 
white cap upon his head, or with a cloth wrapt round 
his neck, or with his I^ limping, occasioned by the 
sores in his groin, all which were frightful to the last 
d^ree but the week before. But now the street was 
full of them, and these poor recovering creatures, 
give them their due, appeared very sensible of their 
unexpected deliverance; and I should wrong them 
very much if I should not acknowledge that 1 oelieve 
many of them were really thankful. But I must 
own, that for the generality of the people, it might 
too justly be said of them as was said of the children 
of Israel, after their being delivered Irom the host 
of Pharaoh, when they passed the Red Sea, and 
looked back, and saw the Egyptians overwhelmed 
in the water, viz., that they sang His praise, but they 
soon forgot His works.

censorious, and perhaps unjust, if I should enter into

I and having, as it were, got master of all, made a 
most terrible slaughter, so that three, four, or 
6ve thousand died in a week, and once eight 
thousand. Who can express the calamities of such 
times ? The whole British nation wept for the miseries 
of her metropolis. In some houses carcasses lay waiting 
for burial, and in others, persons in their last agonies; 
in one room might be heard dying groans, in another 
the ravingB of a delirium, and not far off, relations and 
friends bewailing both their toss and the dismal prospect 
of theirownsudden departure ; death was the sure mid- 
wife to all children, and infants passed immediately from 
the womb to the grave. Who would not burst with 
grief to see the stock for a future generation hang upon 
the breasts of a dead mother ? Or the marriage-bed 
changed the first night into a sepulchre, and the un- 
happy pair meet with death in their first embraces? 
Some of the infected ran about staggering like drunken 
men, and fall and expire in the streets ; while others 
lie half dead and contatose, hut never to be waked but 
by the last trumpet; some lie vomiting as if they had 
drunk poison ; and others fall dead in the market, while 
they are buying necessaries for the support of life."

"In the begiimiiig of September, snch was the vio- 
lence of the disease, that more than twelve thousand 
were carried off weekly. At len^h the presiding 
magistrates (the Court having removed to Oxford) in 
this terrible time, that nothing might be lelt untried, 
urged bj the extreme peril, determined on lighting 
fires in all the streets for three dajrs together. When 
this was in agitation, we, the physicians, opposed it 
with all our authoritjr, alleging tlutt the air itself re- 
mained uninfected, and that the scheme therefore 
would be alike useless and expensive. But the magis- 
trates, over-anxious for the health of the citj, and pre- 
ferring the authority and example of our celebrated 
Hippocrates, notwithstanding our expostulations, caused 
fires everywhere to be hghted. Alas ! the dispute that 
had arisen was superseded by the event : the three days 
had scarcely elapsed when the mourning heavens, as if 
weeping for the innumerable funerals, or rather bewail- 
ing the noxious errors that had been committed, ex- 
tinguished the flames by profuse showers. I leave it to 
others to decide whether these fires were to be regarded 
as ominous preludes of the future conflagration or of the 
burning fimeral piles; but whether through the suffo- 
cative effluvia of the coals or of the dampness of the 
rainy atmosphere immediately following, that night 
brought unheard-of destruction, for truly more than 
four thousand perished before the morning. Hence- 
forth may those in authority act more cautiously, and 
from our misfortune posterity take warning, and not 
attempt cures after the manner of quacks by following 
mistaken analogies." 

From Vmcaat " Godt Terrible Voice in the Cily." 

"It was in the year of our Lord 166S that the plague 
began in our city of London, after we were warned by 
the great plague in Holland in the year l664, and the 
beginning of it in some remote parts of our land in the 
same year^ not to speak anything whether there was

any ragnEficfttion and influence in the blazing star not 
long before that appeared in the view of London, and 
struck some amaseinent upon the spirits of many. It 
was in the month of May that the plague was first taken 
notice of; our bill of mortality did let us know but of 
three which died of the disease in the whole year be- 
fore ; but in the beginning of May the bill tells us of 
nine which fell by the plague — one in the heart of the 
city, the other eight in the suburbs. This was the first 
arrow of warning that was shot from heaven amongst 
us, and fear quickly begins to creep upon people's 
hearts; great thoughts and discourse there is in the 
town about the plague, and they cast in their minds 
whither they should go if the plague should increase. 
Yet when the next week's bill signifieth to them the 
decrease from nine to three their minds are something 
appeased, discourse of that subject cools, fears are 
hushed, and hopes take place that the black cloud did 
but threaten and give a few drops ; but the wind would 
drive it away. But when in the next bill the number 
of the dead by the plague is mounted from three to 
fourteen, and in the next to seventeen, and in the next 
*to forty-three, and the disease begins so much to in- 
crease and disperse, sinners begin to be startled." 

" The plague is so deadly, it kills where it comes 
without mercy; it kills, I had almost said ceriaialy ; 
very few do escape, especially upon its first entrance 
and l>efore its malignity be spent Few are touched by 
it but they are killed by it, and it kills tuddenlu. As it 
gives no warning before it comes, suddenly the arrow 
is shot which woundeth unto the heart, so it gives little 
time for preparation before it brings to 5ie grave. 
Under other diseases men may linger out many weeks 
and months, under some divers years ; but the plague 
usually killeth within a few days, sometimes within a 
few hours after its first approach, though the body 
were never so strong and free from disease before." 

" Now [June] the citizens of London are put to a 

stop in the career of their trade ; they begin to fear

whom they converse withal and deal withal, lest they 
should have come out of infected places. Now roses 
and other sweet flowers wither in the gardens, are dis- 
regarded in the markets, and people dare not offer them 
to their noses lest with their sweet savour that which is 
infectious should be attracted. Rue and wonnwood are 
taken into the hand, myrrh and sedoaiy into the mouth, 
and without some antidote few stir abroad in the morn- 
ing. Now many houses are shut up where the plagne 
(Mimes and the inhabitants shut in, lest coming abroad 
they should spread the infection. It was very dismal 
to behold the red crosses, and read in great tetters, 
' Lord, have mercy upon us,' on the doors, and watch- 
men standing before them with halberts ; and such a 
solitude about those places, and people passing by them 
so gingerly and with such fearful looks, as if they had 
been lined with enemies in ambush that waited to de- 
stroy them." 

"The plague increaseth [July] and prevaileth exceed- 
ingly ; the number of 470 which died in one week 
by the disease ariseth to 725 the next week, to 1089 
the next, to 1843 the next, and to SOlO the next 
Now the plague compasseth the walls of the city like a' 
flood, and poureth in upon it. Now most parishes are 
infected, both without and within [the walls]; yea, 
there are not so many houses shut up by the plague as 
by the owners forsaking them for fear of it, and though 
the inhabitants be so exceedingly decreased by the de- 
parture of so many thousands, yet the number of dying 
persons doth increase fearfully. Now the countries 
keep guards lest infectious persons should from the 
city bring the disease unto them. Most of the rich are 
now gone, and the middle sort will not stay behind ; 
but the poor are forced through poverty to stay and 
abide the storm. The very sinking fears they have had 
of the plague hath brought the plague and death upon 
many. Some by the sight of a coffin in the streets 
have fallen into a shivering, and immediately the disease 
has assaulted them ; and Sergeant Death bath arrested

" It would be endlesfi to speak of what we have seen 
and heard of some in their frenzy rising out of their 
beds and leaping about their rooms ; others crying and 
roaring at their windows ; some coming forth almost 
naked, and running into the streets. Strange things 
have others spoken and done when the disease was 
upon them ; but it was very sad to hear of one who, 
being sick and alone, and, it is like, frantic, burnt him- 
self in his bed." 

" In August how dreadful is the increase ! Now the 
cloud is very black, and the storm comes down upon us 
very sharp. Now Death rides triumphantly on his pale 
horse through our streets, and breaks into every house 
almost where any inhabitants are to be found. Now peo- 
ple fall as thick as the leaves in autumn, when they are 
shaken by a mighty wind. Now there is a dismal soli- 
tude in London streets ; every day looks with the face 
of a Sabbath-day, observed with greater solemnity than 
it used to be in the city. Now shops are shut in, people 
rare and very few that walk about, insomuch that the 
grass begins to spring up in some places, and a deep 
silence almost in every place, especially within the 
walls ; no prancing horses, no rattling coaches, no call- 
ing in customers, nor offering wares ; no London cries 
sounding in the ears. If any voice be heard, it is the 
groans of dying persons, breathing forth their last, and 
the fiineral knells of them that are ready to he carried 
to their graves. Now shutting up of visited houses 
(there being so many) is at an end, and most of the well 
are mingled among the sick, which otherwise would 
have got no help. Now in some places, where the 
people did generally stay, not one house in an hundred 
but what is infected ; and in many houses half the 
family is swept away; in some the whole, frcan the 
eldest to the youngest : few escape but with the death 
of one or two. Never did so many husbands and wives

to buiy the dead : the whole day, though at so great a 
length, is hardly sufficient to light the dead that fall 
thereon into their graves. We could hardly go forth 
but we should meet many cotRns, and see many with 
sores and limping in the streets." 

"Now [September] the grave doth open its mouth 
without measure. Multitudes ! multitudes in the valley 
of the shadow of death, thronging daily into eternity. 
The churchyards now are stuifed so full with dead 
corpses that they are in many places swelled two or

"The wind blowing westward so long together (from 
before Christmas unttl July) was the cause the plague 
began first at the west end of the city, as at St. Giles's 
and St. Martin's, Westminster. Afterwards it gradually 
insinuated and crept down Hotbomand the Strand, and 
then into the city, and at last to the east end of the 
suburbs ; so that it was half a year at the west end of 
the city before the east end and Stepney were infected, 
which was about the middle of July. Southwark, being 
the south suburb, was infected almost as soon as the 
west end," 

" The disease spread not altogether by contagion at 
first, nor began only at one place, and spread farther 
and farther, aa an eating and spreading sore doth all 
over the body, but fell upon several places of the city 
and suburbs like rain even at the first — as St. Giles's, 
St. Martin's, Chancery Lane, Southwark, Houndsditch, 
and some places within the city, as at Proctors' Houses." 

" Almost all that caught the disease with fear died 
with tokens in two or three days. About the beginuing

most men got the diseAse with friddling, surfeiting] ovkt-

" The plague is a most acute disease, for though some 
died eight, ten, twelve, or twenty days after Mey had 
been sick, yet the greatest part died before five or six 
days, and in the summer about half that were sick died, 
but towards winter three parts in four lived ; but none 
died suddenly, as though stricken with lightning or an 
apoplexy, as authors write in several countries, and 
Diemerbroek seems to believe ; but I saw none die 
under twenty or twenty-four hours." 

" One friend growing melancholy for another was oue 
main cause of its going through a family, especially when 
they were shut up, which bred a sad apprehension and 
consternation on their spirits, apeciallif oeing ihtU tip m 
dark cellars. ... As soon as any house is infected, all 
the sound people should be had out of it, and not shut 
up therein to be murdered." 

" Of all the common hackney prostitutes of Lutener's 
Lane, Dog Yard, Cross Lane, Baldwin's Gardens, Hat- 
ton Garden, and other places ; the common criers of 
oranges, oysters, fruit, &c, ; all the impudent, drunken, 
drabbing baylea and fellows, and many others of the 
Rouge Route, there are but few missing." 

" Those that die of the plague, die a very easy death 
generally : first, because it was speedy ; secondly, be- 
cause they died without convulsions. ITiey did but of 
a sudden fetch their breath a little thick and short, and 
were presently gone, — just as you squeeze wind out of 
a bladder. So that I have heard some say, ' How much 
am I bound to God, who takes me away by such an 
easy death t ' And commonly they say they are not 
sick when death is just at hand, and talk fiuniliarly with 
you when they are ready to ^e, and expect no other 
themselves." 

" Though at first I was much baffled in giving judg- 
ment, yet afterwards by use and long observation of the 
particulars I arrived at a greater skill ; for I rendered 
myself familiar with the disease, knowing that the

means to do any good muEt be not to be fearfiil ; where- 
fore I commonly dressed forty sores in a day, held the 
pulse of patients sweating in their beds half a quarter 
of an hour together, let blood, administorcd clysters to 
the sick, held them up in their beds to keep them from 
strangling and choking, half an hour together commonly, 
and suffered their breathing in my face several times 
when tbey were dying ; eat and drank with them, 
especially those that bad sores ; sat down by their bed- 
sides and upon their beds, discoursing with them an 
hour together. If I had time I stayed by them to see 
them die, and see the manner of their death, and closed 
up their mouth and eyes ; for they died with their 
mouth and eyes very much open and staring. Then if 
people had nobody to help them (for help was scarce 
at such a time and place), I helped to lay them forth 
out of the bed, and afterwards into the coffin ; and, 
last of all, accompanied them to the ground." 

"Some would sift them [letters] in a sieve, some 
wash them first in water, and then dry them at the fire ; 
some air them at the top of a house, a hedge, or a pole, 
two or three days before they opened them ; some 
would lay them between two cold stones two or three 
days ; some set them before the fire like a toast. Some 
would not receive them but on a long pole ; a country- 
man delivered one thus to my wife, at the shop-door, 
because be would not venture near her." 

" People in the country were so apprehensive of 
danger from everything coming from London that they 
kept watch and ward as if they would have kept the 
wind out of towns, forcing some to lie and dJe in ditohes 
and under hedges and trees, and to lie unburied for a 
prey to dogs and fowls of the air. At Gloucester, the 
Mayor of the city, being an apothecary, would not suffer 
pipes of wine to be brought into the city that came from 
London, but being brought in, would have had them 
drawn through the river to wash off the infection ; but 
at last it was agreed they should be excused by pourin.i 
water on them: so the vintner's man took a dish of

From Pepyt't " Diary." 

» Jtme llh. — The hottest day that ever I felt in my 
life. This day, much against my will, I did in Drury 
Lane see two or three houses marked with a red cross 
upon the doors, and ' Lord, have mercy upon us,' writ 
there ; which was a sad sight to me, being the first of 
the kind that to my remembrance 1 ever saw." 

" Jtme nik. — It struck me very deep this afternoon 
going with a hackney coach from [the] Lord Treasurer's 
down Holbome, the Coachman I found to drive easily 
and easily, at last stood still, and came down hardly 
able to stand, and told me that he was suddenly struck 
veiT sick, and almost bhnd, he could not see ; so I light 
and went into another coach, with a sod heart for the 
poor man, and for myself also, lest he should have been 
struck with the Plague." 

" Jime 20th. — This day I informed myself that there 
died four or five at Westminster, of the Plague, in sev- 
eral houses upon Sunday last, in Bell Alley, over against 
the Palace-gate." 

"Jime i\ti. — I find all the town going out of town, 
the coaches and carriages being all full of people going 
into the country." 

" Jvne %Sth. — The Plague increases mightily, I this 
day seeing a house, at a bitt-maker's over against St. 
Oement's Church, in the open street, shut up ; which 
is a sad sight." 

"June 28M. — In my way to Westminster Hall I ob- 
served several Plague houses in King's Street and the 
Palace."

of waggons and people ready to go out of town. This 

end of the town every day grows very bad of the Plague.

doors of him [in Covent Garden] being shut up: and 
Lord ! the number of houses visited, which this day I 
observed through the town, quite rmmd in my way by 
Long Lane and London Wall." 

" Julif iSnd. — I by coach home, not meeting with but 
two coaches, and but two carts from Wliite Hall to my 
own house, that I could observe, and the streets migh^ 
thin of people." 

"M^ igjA- — Walked to Redriff, where 1 hear the 
sickness is, and, indeed, it is scattered ahnost eveiy-

bottle of Hague water home with me." 

" Augud SOtk. — I went forth and walked towards 
Moorfields to see (God forgive my presumption !)whether 
I could see any dead corpse going to the grave ; but, as 
God would have it, did not. But Lord 1 bow every- 
body looks, and dis(X>ur6es in the street of death, and 
nothing else, and few people going up and down, that 
the town is like a place distressed and forsaken." 

" September 6lh. — To London, and there I saw fires 
burning in the streets, through the whole city, by the 
Lord Mayor's order. Thence by water to the Duke of 
Albemarle's (at WhitebaD) .* all the way fires on each 
side of the 'Thames : and strange to see in broad day- 
light, two or three burials upon the Bankside, one at the 
very heels of another : doubtless all of the Plague ; and 
yet at least forty or fifty people going along with every 
one of them." 

"September XVh. — And Lord! to see how I did 
endeavour all I could to talk with as few as I could, 
there being now no observation of shutting up of houses 
infected, that to be sure we do converse and meet with 
people that have the Plague upon them."

wretches in the streets ! And what is worst of all, the 
Duke (of Albemarle) showed us the number of the 
Plague this week, brought in last night Irom the Lord 
Mayor ; that it is increased about 600 more than the 
last, which is quite contrary to our hopes and expecta- 
tions, from the coldness of the late season." 

" OcttAer \6th.— Walked to the Tower ; but Lord ! 
how empty the streets are and melancholy, so many 
poor sick people in the streets full of sores ; and so 
many sad stories overheard as 1 walk, — everybody 
talking of this dead, and that man sick, and so many in 
this place, and so many in that. And they tell me 
that in Westminster, there is never a physician, and but 
one apothecary left, all being dead ; yet there are great 
hopes of a great decrease this week. God send it ! " 

" December 1 Sth. — The Plague is increased again this 
week, notwithstanding there oath been a long day or 
two great frosts ; but we hope it is only the effects of 
the late close warm weather, and if the frost continue 
the next week, may fall again ; but the town do thicken 
so much with people, that it is much if the Plague do 
not grow again upon us." 

" December Sltt. — Many of such as I knew very well, 
are dead ; yet to our great joy the town fills again, and 
shops begin to be open again. Pray God continue the 
Plague's decrease, for that keeps the Court away from 
the place of business, and so all goes to wrack as to 
public matters." 

" Jauvary igth, l666. — It is a remarkable thing how 
infinitely naked all that end of the town, Covent Guden, 
is at this day, of people ; while the city is again almost 
as fiiU of people as ever it was."

sage, and dangerous to see so many coffins exposed in

alt in mournful silence, as not knowing whose turn it 
might be next: there perishing nearly 10,000 poor 
creatures weekly. I went to ye Duke of Albemarle

not a few." 

"October lllh. — Went through the whole city, when

pestiferous creatures, begging alms: the shops uni- 
versally shut up, a dreadful prospect."
