HE Succefs the former Part of this 
Work has met with in the Worlds 
has yet been no other, than is ac-- 
knowledgdto be due to the furprifing 
Variety of the SubjeSi^ and to ih^ 
agreeable Manner of the Perfonnance. 

ALL the Endeavours of envious People to re- 
proach it with being a Romance, to fearch it for 
Errors in Geography, Inconfijlency in the Relation^ 
and Contradiflions inthe FaEl, have proved abor-- 
iive, and as impotent od malicious. 

T'HE jufl Application of every Incident, the 
religious and ufeful Inferences drawn from every 
Part, are fo many Teflimonies to the good Deftgu 
of making it publick, and muB legitimate aU tlm 
Part that may be caWd Invention, or Parable in 
the Story, 

T'HE Second Part, if the Edito/s Opinion 
may pafs, is (contrary to the Ufage of Second 
Parts,) every IVay as entertaining as the Firff, 
domains asfirange and furpriz^ing Incidents^ and 

A 2 m- 



The Pre f; ACE. 

as great a Variety of them ; nor is the Application 
lefs Je) iGUSy or fuitable ; and doubtlefs will^ to the 
fiber ^ as iJcelUu ingenious Reader, be every ivay a5 
profitable and diverting ; and this makes the a- 
bridging this W o R k, as fcandalous^ as it is 
hnavijJo and ridiculous ; feeing, zvhile to jl)orten 
the Bock, that they may feem to reduce the Value, 
theyftrip it of aU thofe RefleElions, as well religi^ 
ous cu moral, which fre not only the greateft 
Beauties of the Work, but are calculated for 
the infinite Advantage of the Kb avek. 

BT this they leave the Work naked of its 
brightefi Ornaments ; and yet they would, at the 
fame- time pretend, that the Author hasfupplfd 
the Story out of his Invention, they take from it 
the Improvement, which alone recommends that In- 
vention to wife and good Men. 

T'HE Injury thefe Men do to the FKOVKinroK 
of this Work, is a PraSiice all honefi Mm 
abhor ; and he believes he may challenge them to 
Ojhw the Differeace between that and Robbing on the 
Highway, or Breaking open a Houfe, 

IF they cant Jhew any Difference in the Crime, 
they will find it hard to /hew why there fbould,^ 
any Diffcrenco in the Ptmijhment : And he mil 
atjfwer for it, that nothing Jhall be wanting on 
his Party to do them Jufiice,

Robinson Crusoe, 6"^. 



HAT hoir.cly Proverb iifed on 
fo many Occalioriv*; in Engbnd, 
'VIZ.. That vrhat is bred m the Bone 
will not go out of the FlefJ}, v.'as 
never more vaify'd, than in the 
Story of my L i f e. Any one 
would think, that after thi^ ty-five 
Years Afflidlion, and a Vaiiety 
of unhappy Circumflanccs, which 
few Men, if any ever, went thro' 
before, and after near feven Years 
of Peaceand Enjoyment in the Fulncfs of ail Things ^ gro\va 
old, and when, ^ ever, it might be allowed me to have 
had Experience of every State ot .middle Life, and to know 
which was moil: adapted to make a Man complca^ly hap- 
py : I fay, after all this, any one would have thought that 
the native Propcnlity to rambling, which I gavtj an Ac- 
count of in my firll Setting out into the World, to have 
been lb predominate in my Thoughts, fhould be worn 
out, the Volatile Part be fully evacuated, or at lead con- 
densed, and I might at 6i Years of Age have been a little 
A 3 inclined 




kiclin'd lo ftay at Home, and have donie venturing Life 
and Fortune any more. 

Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Adven- 
tures v^^as taken away in me 5 for I had no Fortune to 
make, I had nothing to feek : If I had gain'd ten thoufand 
Pound, I had been no richer 5 for I had already lufficient 
for me, and for thofe I had to leave it to 5 and that I had was 
vitibly incrcaiing j for having no great Family, I could not 
fpcnd the Income of what I had, unleft I would fet up for 
anexpenfive Way of Living, fuch as a great Family, Servants, 
Equipage, Gayety, and the like, which were Things I had 
no Notion ofi or Inclination to 5 & that I had nothing 
indeed to do, but to fit ftill, and fully enjov what I had 
got, and fee it increaie daily upon my Hands. 

Y E T all thefe Things had no effedl: upon me, or at leafl: 
not enough to refill the ftrong Inclination I had to go A- 
feroad again, which hung about me like a chronical Di- 
ii-emperj particulaj ly the Defire of feeing my new Planta- 
tion in the Ifland, and the Colony I left there, run in my . 
Head continually. I dream'd of it all Night, and my 
Imagination run upon it all E^y j it wa^ uppermofl in all 
my Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd Ibfteadily andftrong- 
ly upon it, that I talk'd of it in my Sleep 5 in il-.ort, no- 
thing could remove it out of my Mind 5 it even broke £0 
violently into all my Difcourfes, that it made my Con ver- 
lation tireibme^ for I <?ould talk of nothing elie, all mj 
Diicourfe run into it, even to Impertmence, and I faw it 
my felf. 

I HAVE often heard Peribns of good Judgment ^y. 
That all the Stir People make in the World about Ghofts 
^nd Apparitions, is owing to the Strength of Imagination* 
and the powerful Operation of Fancy in their Minds j that 
there is no fiieh Thing as a Spirit appearing, or a Ghoft 
walking, and the like: That Peoples poring affe^Honately 
upon the paft Convcrfation of their deceasM Friends, io 
realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying up- 
on fbme extraordinary Circumftances, that they fee tnem j 
talk to them, and are anfwered by them, when, in Truth, 
there is nothing- but Shadow and Vapour in the Things 
and they really know nothing of the Matter. 

For my Part, I kiK>w not, to thi* Hour, whether tl^re 
arc any fiichTHngs as real Apparitions, Spe^es, or walk- 
ing 



(7) 

ing of People after thej are d^, or whether there is mf 
Thing in the Stories they teB us of that kind, more thaa 
the Produd of Vapours, ficfc Minds, and wandring Fan- 
cies j But this I know, that my Imagination work*d up 
to fuch a Height, and brought . me into fuch Exccefs of 
Vapours, or what eHe I may call it, that I a^hially fup- 
bos'd my felf. Oftentimes upon the Spot, at my oldCaftle 
behind the Trees j faw my old Spaniard, Iridafs Father, 
and the reprobate Sailors who I left upon the Ifland,- nay, I 
fency'd I talk'3 with them, and look'd at them fo fteadi- 
ly, tho' I was broad awake, a5 at Peribns juft befoie mei 
and this I M, tiH I often frighted my felf with the Images 
my Fancy represented to me: One Time in my Sleep I had 
the ViUany of the three Pyxate Sailors, ib lively related to me 
bythefirftSM»/Wr^andFr/<i^/s Fatha:-, that it wasfurpriz* 
ing j they told me how they barbaroufly attempted to murder 
all the Spaniards, and that they fet Fire to the Provifions they 
had laid up, on purpofe to diftrefs and ftarve them i Things 
that I had never heard of, and that yet were all of them 
trueinfa<a- And it was lb warm in my Imagination, 
and fo realizi'd to me, that to the Hour I iaw them, 
I could not be perfuaded, but that it was or would be 
truci alio how I refented it, when the Spaniards com- 
plained to me, and how I brought them ^ to Juftice, try*d 
them befofe me, and ordered them all three to be hang'd; 
What there was really in this, fball be feen in its Pkce: 
For however, I came to form fuch things in my Dream, 
and what fecret Converfe of Spirits injeSed it, yet tl^e 
was, Ifay^ very much of it true. I own, tliat this Dream 
had nothing in it litei-ally and fpecifically trucj but the ge- 
neral Part was fo true, the bale and villanous Behaviour 
of theie three harden'd Rogues was fuch, and had been ib 
much worfe than ail I can describe, that the Dream had[ 
too much Similitude of the Fadi, and as I would after- 
wards have punifhed them* Severely ^ fb if I had hang'd 
them all, I had been much in the Right, and fliould W 
been juftified both by the Laws of God and Man. 
, B u T to return to my Story , in this kind of Temper 
I had liv'd fbme Years, I had no Enjoyment of my Life, 
no pkafant Hours, no agreeable Diverfion, but what had 
fomething or other of this in itj fo that my Wife, 
who ^w my mind fo wholly bent upon it, told me vay 
A 4 fcrioufly 



(8) 

foioufly one Night, That fhe believ'd there was fome ^- 
Cict powei'fiil I mpulie of Providence upon me, which had 
determined me to go thither again,- and that il:e found no- 
.thing hindered my going, but my being engaged to a Wife 
and Children. She told me, that it was true, ll:e could 
not think of parting "^ith me j but as Ihe was afTur'd, that 
if {he was dead, it would be the foil thing I would do : 
'^o as it j[eemM to her, that the thing was determined a- 
bove, fhe would not be the only Obfbu^tion : For if I 

thought fit, and Tcfdlv^d to go— — ^ Here fhe found me 

very intent upon her Words, and that I look'd very ear- 
'neftiy at her,- lb that it a little difbrder*d her, and flie 
topp'd. I ask'd her, Why Hie did not go on, and fay 
©ut what fhe was going to fay ? But I perceived her Heart- 
was too full, and fbme Tears flood in her Eyesi Speak out 
jny Dear, faid I, Are you willing I fliould go ? No, fa^s 
Jhe, 'Very fi'ffeBionately, I am far uova willing : But if you 
are refolv'd to go, fays flie, and rather than I will be the 
only Kindvance, I will go with you ^ for tho* I think it 
a mofl prepoflerous thing for one of your Years, and in 
your Condition, yet if it mufl be, faid H^e agaia weeping>. 
I ,wcn't leave you j for if it be of Heaven, you mud do 
it, th.cre is no reijfling it j, and if Heaven makes it your 
Duty to go, he wiU alio make it mine to go vs^ith you, 
or otherwiie difpolc of me, tJiat I may not otirrud: it. 

This affecStionate Behaviour of my Wife's bi ought me a 
little out of the Vapours, and I began to conlidcr what I 
was a doii7gj Icorrcdcd my wandeiing Fancy, and began 
to argue with my felf fedately, what buiineis I had alter 
.threclcorc Years, and after ilich a Life of tedious Suffer- 
ings and Difailers, and clofed in £o happy and eafy a Man- 
, ner, I fay, what Bullnef^ had I to rufli into new Ha^ards;, 
, and put my fclf upoa Adventures, fit only for Youth and 
. Poverty to run into^ 

With thofe Thoughts, I confidered my new Engagc- 
rnent, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and my Wife 
then great with Child of another i that J had all the World 
could giYC me, and had no need to feek Hazards for Gain ^ 
that I was declining in Years, and ought to think rather 
• of leaving what I had gain'd, than of iceking to increaic 
it i. that as to what my Wife had faid, of its being an Im- 
julfe from Heaven, aiid that it fliould be my Duty to gp, 

i had 



(9) 

I had no Notion of that,- £o after many of thefe Cogita- 
tions, I ftru^Ied with the Power of my Imagination, 
reafon'd rny lelf out of it, as I Relieve People may dwstp 
do in like Cafe, if they willy and, in a Word, I conquered 
It i compos'd my fclr with flich Arguments as occur \i to 
my Thoughts, and which my prefent Condition furnilhU 
me plentitully with, and particularh':, as the mofl effedual 
Method, I reiblv'd to divert my fclf with other Things, 
and to engage in fome Bulinefs that „ might effe£lually tie. 
me up &om any more Excurfions of this Kind^ for I 
found the Thing. returnM upon mc chiefly when I was 
idle, lud nothing to do, or any thing of Moment imme- 
diately before me. 

To this Purpofe I bought a little Farm in the County 
. o^ Bedford, and refblv'd to remove my £-iF thither, thai 
\ a little convenient Houfc upon it, and the I.and about it I 
i found was capable of great Improvement, and that it was 
[ jiiany ways fuited to my Inclination, which delighted in 
'[ Cultivating, Managing, Planting, and I n^ proving of Land i 
[ and particukrly, being an Inland Country, I was r emov 'd fi om 
. converling among Ships, Sailors, and Things relating to 
the remote Parts of the Woi Id. 

I N a Word, I went down to my Farm, {cttkd my Fa- 

* mily, bought me Ploughs, Harrcvx^s, a Cart, Waggon,. Hor- 

fes. Cows, Sheep i arid fetting ferioufly to Work, became 

in one half Year, a mecr Country Gentleman i my Thoughts 

; were intirely taken up in managing my Servants, cultivat- 




' directing, or that a Man always 
was capable of being repeated to. 

I farm'd upon my own L.aud, I had no Rent to pay, 
was limited by no Articles^ I could pull aip or cut down 
as I plcalcd: What I jplantcd, was for my fclf, and what f 
improved', was for.my Family 5 and having thus left oft" 
the Thoughts of Wandeiing, I had not the ieafl Difcom- 
fort in any p^it of my Lite, as to this World/ Now 
I thought indeed, that I enjoyed that Middle State of Life, 
which my Father £0 earneflly rccommendai to m<; :: A 
kind of heavenly Life, ibmething like v/hat is deicrkicdby 
the Poet lipon the Subjed of a Country Life.

B u T in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow firoi% 
imleen Providence unhing'd me at once,* and not only made 
a Breach upon me inevitable, and incurable f but drove me, 
by its Coniequcnce, upon a deep Relapfe into the wander- 
ing Dii^lition, which, as I may fay, being born in my 
irery Blood, fbon recover'd its Hold of me, and like the 
Returns of a violent Diftempcr, came on with an irreli- 
fiftible Force upon me, fo that nothing could make any 
Miorc Impreffion upon me^ This Blow was the Lofs of 
»y Wife. 

I T is not my Bufinefs here to write an Elegy upon mj 
Wife, give a Ofiara^ter of her particular Virtues, and make 
«iy Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a Funeral Ser- 
inon^ She was^ in a few Words, the Stay of all my Af- 
feirSr the Center of all my Enterprises j the Engine, that 
Jy her Prudence reduc'd me to that happy Compafs I was 
m„ fiom the moft extravagant and ruinous Project that 
fbitmr'd in m^r Head; as above,- and did more to guide my 
lamWing Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Famer's In- 
flEru^ions, a Friend's Counfel, or all my own reafbning 
PbvTcrs- C€mld do. I was happy in liftening to her Tears, 
and in being moved by her Ehtreaf ics, and to the lad degree 
;^>late and diilocatcd in the World by the Lofs of her. 

Whi:n ihc wzs gone^ the Workl looked aukwardly 
round me y I was as much a Stranger in it, in my Thoughts, 
as I was in the Brafils, when I went firfl on Shore there j 
and as much alone, except as to the Affiflance of Servants, 
as I was in my Tfland. I knew neither what to do, of 
what not to doi I faw the World bufy round m«, one 
Fart labouring for Bread, and the other fquandering it^ iifc 
icile Exceflcs or empty Pleaflires; equally miferaSe, be- 
cauie the End they proposed ftill fled from themj for the 
Men of Plealurc every Day furfeited of their Vice, and 
Reaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance i and the Men. 
©f Labour ipent their Strength in daily Strugglings for 
Bread to mointan the vital Strength they kibour'd with ;. 
£b living in a daily Circulation of Sorrow, living but to 
work,, and working but to iive^. u if daily Bread weie the 

only 



enfy End of weari&rHeLife, and a weari&me Life the on- 
ly Occafion of daily Bread. 

This put me in mind of the Life I lived in my King- 
dom, the Ifland j where I fufFerM no more CcM-n to grow, 
bccaufe I did not want it j and bred no more Goats, Be* 
caufe I had no more Ufe for them : Where the Money 
lay in the Drawer till it grew mill-dew*d, and had (carce 
the Favour to be look'd upon in 20 Years. 

All thele Things, had I improved them as I ought to 
have donc> and as Realbn and Religion had dictated to me> 
would have taught me to learch tarther than human En- 
joyments for a full Felicity, and that there was Jfbmething 
which certainly was the Reafbn and End of Life, fiiperioiT 
to all thefe Things, and which was either to be pofle6'4 
or at leaft hop'd for on this fide the Grave. 

B u T my lage CounfelTor was gone v^ I was like a Ship 
without a Pilot, "that could only run ajSre the Wini< My 
Thoughts run all away again into the old Affair 5 myHcacf 
was quite tum'd with theWhimfies of foreign Adventures,, 
and ail the pleafing innocent Amufements of my Farm, and 
my Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which before en-^ 
tirely poileft me, were nothing to me 5 had no Relifh, and 
were like Mufick to one that has no Ear, or Food to one 
that has noTafte: In a Word, Irefolv'd to leave off Houfe- 
keepin^, ktt my Farm, and return to Lmdm j and in % 
few Months after, I did £0, 

When I came to London^ I was flillasuneafyas I wa* 
before 5 I had no Relifh to the Place, no Employment irf 
it, nothing to do but to faunter about like an idle Perlbn, 
of whom it may be faid, he i* perfed^ly uielefs in God's 
Creation, and \t is not one Farthing matter to the refl of 
his^ Kind, wheth^ he be dead or alive. This alfb was 
the Thing, which of all Circumfknces of Life was the 
moft my Averfion, who had been aU my Days uied to an 
aftive Life 5 and I would often fay to my felf, A State 
if Idlenefs is the very Dregs of Life 5 and indeed I thought 
I was much more fuitably employ'd, when I was 16 
Days a making me a Deal Board. 

It was now the Beginnidg of the Year i<^93> when 
my Nf'phewi who as I have obferu'd before, I liad brought 
up to the Sea, and had made him Commander of a sfip, 
waa comp -Home from a ihort Voyage to Bilboat being 

the 



1 l^} 

the firfl: he had made: He came to me, and told rrfe, that 
ibme Merchants of his Acquaintance had been propofing 
to him, to. go a Voyage for them to the Baft-Mies, and 
,to China, as private Traders : And now Uncle, fajs he, // 
yoHT^il{go to^Sea with me, r 11- engage fe land you ufon yonr 
old Habitation in the If^and, for we are to touch at the^x^iis, 

J^Q THING can be a greater Dcmonftration of a fu- 
ture State, and of theExiftence of an invifible Wojld, than 
the Concurrence of iecorid Caules, with the Ideas of 
Tilings, which. we form in- our Minds, perfe<Slly refer v'd, 
suid not comnaunicated to any, in the Woild. 

M Y Nephew knew nothing how far my Diflemper of 
wandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of 
what he had in his Thoughts to fay j when that very 
Morning before he came to me, I had in a great deal of 
CbnSaiion of Thought, and revolving every Part of my 
CncumfhmGCS in my Mind, come to. this Reiblution, ^/^. 
TMt 1. would go to Lis^bon, and confult with my old Sea- . 
Captcin 5 and fo if it was rational and pra6licable, I would 
go asd fee the I/land again, andfeewliat was become of my 
Fccqple there : I had pleas'd my feif aHb with the Thoughts 
^f peopling.the Place, and carrying Inhabitants from hence, 
getting X Patent for the PoflHTioOr and I know not 
whatj when in the Middle of all this, in comes my Ne- 
|^w^,as I. hoye faid,,with his Project of carrying- me tlij- 
ther, in his Way to the Eafi-Indies, 

I FA «•&.* i> a while at his Words, and looking fteadily 
at- hjm, M^atDe'vil, UidI, fent you of this unlucky Erram^? 
My Nepliew llartrd as if he had been frighted at fir ft j 
but perceiving I was not much ^liipleaied with the Pro- 
pofai, he recovered himfclf. I. hope it may not be an un- 
lucky Propofal,. Sir, fays he, I dare fay you would be 
pkas'd, t9 fee- your new Colony there, where you once 
r-eigned with more Felicity^ than mofl of your Brother 
Monarchs in the. World.. 

In a Word, the Scheme hit fb exadlly with my Tem- 
per^ thatiis^tp fay, with the PrepcnefTion I was under, and 
of which i have faid fa much, that I told him in fev/ 
Words, if he agpred'with the Merchants, I would go with 
him : But I told hiny, I would not promife to go any far- 
ther than my own'Iflandi IVhy, Sir,, iaj^s he, yoU donf 
ip^f to keleftth^e a^fun^ ihpfei.Whyj faid I, cpnyouMt 

tak^' 



(n) 

not takd me up again m yom Return ? He told me, it 
could not be poiTible to do ib, that the Merchants would 
never allow him to come that Way with a loadcn Ship of 
fucli: Valite, it being a Month's Sail out of his Way, and 
might M ihree or tour : Bejides, Sir, if I jhould mifcarry, 
faid he, aftd not return at ally then you -would he jufi re- 
duced to the Condition yon were in before, 

Tii I s was very rational > but we both found out aRcr 
medy for it, which was to carry a framed Sloop on board 
the Ship, which being taken in. Pieces, and ihipp'd on 
board the Ship, might by the Help-of fome Carpenters 
who we agreed to carry with us, be fet up again in the 
Ifland, and finiHi'd, .fit. to go to Sea in a few Days. 

I w AS not long reiblvingj for indeed the Importunities 
of my Nephew join'd in, fo efi'edirually with my Inclina- 
tion, that nothing could oppofe me : On the other hand, 
my Wife being dead, I had no body that concerned them^ 
felves £o muc^ /or me, as a^o peiiuade me one way or 
other, except my ancient good Friend the Widow, who 
earneflly flruggled with me to conjfider my Years* my ea- 
fy Ciieuiinflances, and^the needlefs Hazard of a long Voy- 
age j and abo^e all my young Children: But it was all to 
no Purpofe, I had an iirefillible Deiire to the Voyage; 
and I told her, I thought there was ibmething £o uncom- 
mon in the ImprelTions I had upon my Mind for the 
Voyage, that it would be a kind of relifting Providence, 
if I inould attempt to flay ajt Home 5 after which,, il^e 
\ceas'd her Expoftulations, and join'd with me>. not on- 
. Ij in making Piovifion for my Voyage, but alio in fetr 
tling my Family Af/airs for my Abfence, and providing 
for the Education of my Children. 

I N Order to this, I made, my Will, and fettled the E- 
flate I had, in fuch a Manner for my Childien, and pla- 
ced in fuch Hands, that I was peifcdiy eafy and iarisfVd 
they would have Juilice done them, whatever might be- 
fal mcj and for their Education, I left it wholly to my 
Widow, with a fufficient Maintenance to her £(A£ £ox her 
€are: All wj^iich fie richly defer v'di for no Mother eould 
have taken more Caic \n xhm Education, or underftood 
it better j and as jn]e iiY*d till I came Home, I alio liv'd 
tp tkink her for it. 

My Kef hew w;is ready, to fail ^ouL the Beginnings of 

yantiary 



Jmmarj i^p^-f, afid I with my Man Widay went cm 
boftrd m the X^imns the %thi having befides that Sloop 
wMch I menticm'd above, a very confiderable Cargo o^ 
all Kinds of necefl^y Things for my Colony, which if I 
did not find in good Condition, I reiblv'd to lea^ fb. 

First, I carried with me feme Servants, who I purpos'd 
to place there, as Inhabitants, or at leaft to fct on Wwk 
there Hpcm mv ©wn Acccmnt while I ftay'd, and cither 
to leave them tnere, or carry them forward as they fhould ap* 
pear willing \ particularly, I carry'd two Carpenters, a Smithy 
and a very handy ingenions Fellow, who was a Cooper 
by trade, but was alS> a general Mechanickj for he was 
dextrous at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to griixt 
Corn, was a good Tumtr, and a good Pot-Maker 3 he 
alio made any Thing that was proper to make of Earth, 
or of "Woodi in a Word, we caH'd him Our J^Mk of all 
Trades. 

With thefe I carry'd a Taylor, who had of&r'd himfelf 
to go Pailenger to the Eafi-Indies with my Nephew, but 
afterwards con&nted to fby on cmr New Plantation, and 
proved a moft necellary handy Fellow, as could be defir*d, 
m many other Builnefles, befides that of this Trade; for as 
I obferv'd ftwmerly, Neceffity arms us for all Employments. 

M y Cargo, as near as I can colk6t, for I have not kept 
^n Account of Particulars, coniifted of a fufficicnt Quan- 
tity of Linnen, and fbme tlan Englifh Stuffs for cloating 
the Spaniardf that I expected to find there j and enough of 
them, as by my Calculation might comfortably fupply 
them for,ihpi Years ; if I remember right, the Materi- 
als which I carry'd for cloathing them, with Gloves, 
Hats, Shoes, Stockings, and all &lSl Things as they could 
w^t for wearing; amounted to above 200 Pounds, in- 
cluding fi>mc Beds, Bedding, and Houfhold- Stuff, par- 
ticularly Kitchen- Utei^s, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter,. 
Brafs, (^e, befides, near a hundred Pounds more in Iron- 
Work, Nails, To<^ of evety Kii^, Staples, Hooks Hinges, 
and every neceflary Thing I couW think of. 

I carry'd alfb an hunSed^are Arms, Muskets and Pu- 
rees, befides fbme Piflols, a confiderable Quantity of Shot 
of all Sizes, three or four Ton of Lead, and two Pieces 
of Bi afs Cnnnon ; and becaufe I knew not v^hat Time, 
and what Extemttics I was j^oviding fcM*, I carry*d an 

hundred 



hmnixti Barrels of Fowdcr, befides Sworcfe, and Cutlafle^i 
and the Iron Part of fbme Pikes, and Halbcrts, fo that in 
fhort, we had a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores j and 
I made my Nephew carry two fmall Quarter-Deck Guns 
more than he wanted for his Shipj to leave behind, if 
there was Occafion 5 that when we came there, we might 
build a Fort, and man it againflraU Sorts of Enemies: And 
indeed, I at firft thought there would be Need enough for 
it all, and much more, if we hop'd to maintain our ?o& 
fclFion of the Ifland, as fhall be feen in the Courfe of the 
5tory. 

I H A D not flich bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had been 
afed to meet with 5 and thwefbre ftiall have thelefs Occa- 
fion to interrupt tte Reader, who pr^ps may be impai- 
cnt to hear how Matters wait witihi my Colony 5 yet 
Ibme odd Accidents ^ aofs Winds , and bad Weather mp« 
pen'd, on this firft letting out, which made the Voyage 
longer than I expe<9:ed it at firftj and I who had never 
made but one Voyage, (viz,) my firft Voyag$ ro Guinea^ m 
which I naight be mi tp come fcackajgain, as the Voya^ 
was at firft dcfign'd, began to think the fame ill Fate^ ftilt 
attended me } and that I was born to be never contaitoJ 
with my own Shore, and yet t® be always unfortunate 
at Sea. 

Contrary Winds firft put us to the Norttiward, and we 
wcreobiig'd to put in at Galwm in Irelandy where we lay 
Win4-bound two and twenty Days 5 but we had this Sa? 
tisla<9:ion with theDiiaftcr, that rrovifions were here ex- 
ceeding cheap, and in the utmoft Plentvj ib that whiie 
we lay here, we never touch'd the Snip's Stores, but 
rather added to them > here alfo I took feveral live Hogs, 
and two Cows with their Calves, which I refblv'd, iff 
had a good PaHi^, to put on Shore in my Ifland, but we 
found Occafion to diQ>ofe otherwife of them. 

W E fet out the ph of February firom Ireland and had 
a very lair Gale of Wind for fbme Daysj as I remembcx, 
it ought be about the 10th of February in the Evening 
late, when the Mate having the Watcn, came into the 
Round-houfe, and told us, he faw a Flafii of Fire, and 
heard a Gun fir'd, and while he was telling us of it, a Boy 
came in, and told us the Boatfwain heard another. This 
made m aH run out upon the Quarter-Deck, where for a 

while 



C 16 ) 

whik we heard nothing, but in a few Minutes we fiw a 
'very great Light, and found that there wasibme very ter- 
rible Fire at a Diflance 5 immediately we had recourle to 
our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there could 
be no Land that Way, in which the Fire fhew^d it fclf, 
no not for j-oo Leagues, for it appeared at W. ^N. W, 
Upon this we concluded, it muft be ibme Ship on Fire at 
Seaj and as by our hearing the Noife of Guns juft before, 
we concluded it could not be far off: We flood directly 
towards it, and were preiently fatisfy'd we ilioulddifcover 
it, becaufe the farther we failed, the gieater the Light ap- 
peared, tho' the Weather being haizy, we could not per- 
ceive any Thing but the Light for a while : In about half 
an Hour's Sailing, the Wind beine fair for us, tho' not much 
of it^and the Weather clearing up a little, wg could plainly diJ?- 
cern that it was a great Ship on fire in the Middle of the Sea. 

I was moft ienfibly touched with this Difafler tho' not 
at all acquainted with the Pcrlbns cngag'd in it, I present- 
ly recolle^led my formed Circumftanccs, in what Condi- 
tion I was in, when taken up by the Tortugal Captain j 
and how much, more deplorable the Circumftances of the- 
poor Creatures belonging to this Ship muft be, if they 
had no other Ship in Company with them : Upon this, 
I immediatlyorder'd, that five Guns fliould be hr'd, oi)e 
loon after another, that, if pollible, we might give No- 
tice to them, that theie v^as Help for them at hand, and 
that they might endeavour to iave themfelves in their 
' Boat 5 for tho* we could lee the Flame of the Ship, yet 
they, it being Night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by ibrae Time upon this, only driving as the 
-burning Ship drove, waiting for Day-light j when on a 
fudden, to our g- cat Tenor, though we had Reafbn to 
expert it, the Ship blew up in the Air 3 and immediatly, 
that is to fay, in a few Minutes, all the Fire was out,/ 
that is to fay, the reft of the. Ship funk : This was 
a Terrible, and indeed an afilicfling Sight, for the Sake of 
the poor Men, v/ho, I conckicied, muft be either all de- 
ftroy'd in the Ship, or be in the utmoft Difticfs in their 
Boats in the Middle of the Ocean, which at prelent, by 
Reaibn it was dark, I could not iee : Howeva , to diieA 
them as well as I cculd, I caufed Lights to be hung out 
iix. all the Parts of the Ship whe;e we couki, and wliich 

wc;.

(i'7) 

vCre had Lantliorns for, and kept firing Guns all the Ni<Tht 
long, letting them know by this, that there was a Ship 
not far off. 

About 8 a-Clock in the Morning we difiroverM the 
Ship's Boats, by the Help of our Pei'ipeaive GLiffes, found 
there were two of them, both throng'd with People, and 
deep in the Water: We peccived they row'd, the Wind 
being againfl them, that ihey faw our Ship, and did the 
utmofl to make us ice them. 

We immediately fpiead cur Ancient, to let them know 
we :£iw them, and hung a Waft out as a Signal for them 
to come en Board, and then made more Sail, Handing di- 
re6tiy to them. In Imk more than half an Hour vx 
came lip witli them, and in a v;ord, took tliem all in, 
being no leis than ii^ty ibiir Men, Women, and Children j 
tor there vv-eic a great many Paflengei?. 

U p o N tlie wlicle, we found it v/as a French Mer- 
chant Ship of 500 l\^n, homeward ^GLlnd from ^.eh'ck, 
in the River of Cm^aU. TJie Maftcr gave us a long Ac- 
count of the Diilreis of his Ship, hov/ the Fi^c began in 
the Steerage, Ly tlie Negligence of the Steerimanj i^ut oij 
his crying out ic;r Melp, was, as every Body thought, 
entirely put out : But they focn found, that fomc Sfo.i ks 
of tjie firil Fire had gotten into ionic Patt of tlie Sliip, 
fo di.^icult to come at, that they could not efiefhially 
quench it -, and aftevwards getting in between the Tim- 
bers, and v/ithin tlie Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into 
■the Hold, and inafiei'd all the Skill, and all the Application 
. th^y vrcrc al le to cxei t, > 

T H E Y had no more to do then, but to get into their 
Boats, which to their great Comfoit were pretty laige, 
being their Long-Boat, and a great Shaltoup, beiides a 
fmall SkitT w^hich was of no gicat Service to them, other 
than to get Icme f efli Water imd Provifions into her, 
after they had fecur'd there Lives fiom the F-ii*e. They 
Jiad indeed imall Hope of their Lives by getting intotliele 
Boats at tjiat Di (lance from any Land, only, as they laid 
well, that tJiey wq^c eicap'd fiom the Fire, and had a Pof^ 
libiiity that ibme Ship might happen to be at Sea, and 
. might take them in. They had Sails, Oars, and a Cont- 
pais,.' and were preparing to make the befl of their Waf 
pack to Nevpfofi'?ul4md, xh^. Wind blpwing pretty fair, loiv 



(i8) 

it blew an eafy Gale at S. E. by E. They bad as mucli 
ProvHions and Water, as witb faring it fo as to be next 
door to ftarving, might fiipport them about 1 2 Days j in 
which, if they had no bad Weather, and no contrary 
Winds, the Captain faid, he hop'd he might get the Banks 
of Newfound-land, and might perhaps take lome Fiih to 
fuftain them till they might go on Shore. But there were 
fo many Chances againfl them in all theie Calcs; fuch as 
Storms to overfet and founder them j Rains and Cold to be- 
numb and periih their Limbs, contrary Winds to keep 
them out and ftarve them 5 that it muft have been next 
to miraculous, i^ they had efcap^'d. 

In the midft of their Conmltations, every one being 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the Captain with Tears in 
his Eyes told me, they were on a Hidden iurpriz'd with: 
the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and after that four morej 
theie were the five Guns, which I caulcd to be fired at 
firft feeing the Light : this revived their Hearts, and gave 
them the Notice, which, ds ab&ve, 1 defir'd it fhould, 
{viz,.) that there was a SBip at hand for their Help. 

I T was upon the hearing thefe Guns, that they took 
down their Mails and Sails 5 and the Sound coming firom the 
Windward, they reiblv'd to lie by tiU Morning. Some 
Time after this, hearing no more Guns, they nr'd three 
Muskets, one a confiderable while after another j but 
thefe, the Wind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some Time after that again, they were ilill more 
Agreeably furpriz'd with feeing our Lights, and hearing 
the Guns, which as I have faid, I caus'd to be fir'd aU 
the reil of the Night 5 this fet them to work with their 
Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at leail, fthat we might 
tlie fboner coftie up with tlrcm ; and at laft, to their in- 
expreffible Joy, they found we iaw them. 

I T is impolTible for me to exprefs the feveral Geilures, 
the ib-ange Extafies, the Variety of Poilures which theie 
poor delivered People run into, to exprefs the Joy of their 
Souls afib unexpedled a Deliverance 5 Grief and Fear are 
eaiily deicribedj Sighs, Tears, Groans, and a very few 
Motions of Head and Hands make up the Sum of its 
Variety : But an Excefs of Joy, a Surprize of Joy has a 
Thousand Extravagances in it 5 there were fbme in Tears j 
^fome raging and tearing themfeives, as if they had bcea 

m 



(19) 

in the greateft Agonies of Sorrow j fbme ftark-raving and 
down-right Lunatickj ibme ran about the Ship flamping 
with their Feet, others wringing their Hands 5 ibme were 
dancing, fbme finging, fome laughing, more crying 5 many 
quite dumb, not able to fpeak a Word 5 others iick and 
Tomiting 5 feveral fwooning, and ready to faint ; and a 
few, were Croffing themfelves, and giving God Thanks. 

I WOULD not wrong them neither -, there might be 
many that were thankful afterward, but the PafTion was 
too flrong for them at firil, and they were not able ta 
mailer it, they were thrown into Extafies and a kind of 
Frenzy, and fo there wee but a very few who were com- 
pos'd and ferious in their Joy. 

Perhaps alio the CaJe may have fbme Addition to it. 
Bom. the particular Circumftance of the Nation they be- 
longed to, I mean the French 5 whofe Temper is allow'd 
to be more volatile, more paiTionate, and more iprightly, 
and their Spirits more fluid than in other Nations. I am 
not Philoibpher enough to determine the Caufe, but no- 
thing I had ever feen before came up to it : The Extafies 
poor Friday, my trufty Savage^ was in when he found his 
Father in the Boat, came the ncareil to \ty and the Sur- 
prize of the Mailer and his two Companions, who I de- 
livered from the Villains that fet them on Shore in the 
Ifland, came a little Way towards it, but nothing was tg 
compare to this, either that I faw in Friday, or any whiere 
elic in my Life. 

I T is firther oblervable, 3hat theie Extravagancies did 
not fhew thcmfelves in that different Manner I have men- 
tioned, in different Perfons only: But all the Variety 
would appear in a fhort Succellion of Moments, in one 
and the lame Peribn, A Man that we faw this Minute 
dumb, and as it were fbpid and confounded, Ibould the 
next Minute be dancing and hallowing like an Antick 5 
and the next Moment & tearing his Hair, or pulling his 
Clothes to Pieces, and ftampmgl them under his Feet, like 
a Madman j a few Moments after that, we fhould have 
him all in Te^s, then fick, then fwooning; and had not 
immediate Help been had, would, in a few Moments 
more, have been dead; and thus it was not with one or 
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greateft Part of 

themi 



(20) 

tKeni 3 and if I remember right, our Surgeon was oblig'd 
to let above thirty of them blood, 

• T H E R E were two Prieils among them, one an old 
Man, and the other a young Man^ and that which was 
ftrangefl was, that the oldeft Man was the worft. 

A s foon as he fct his Foot on board our Ship, and faw 
himfelf iate, he dropt down flone-dead, to all Appeara?ice, 
not the leaft Sign of Life could be perceived in him ; our 
Surgeon immediately apply \i proper Remedies to recover 
him, and was the only Man in tlie Ship that believ'd he 
was not dead 3 at length he open 'd a Vein in his Arm, 
having firfc chaf 'd and rubb'd the Pai t fb as to \^7arm it 
as much as polllblc; Upori this the Blood, which only 
dropp'd at firfl:, flow'd fomething freely 5 in three Minutes 
ag:er, the Man open'd his Eyes, and about a quarter of an 
Hour after that he ipoke, grew better, and in a little 
time quite wcllj- after the Blood v/as fcopp'd he walk'd 
about, told us he was perfe6lly well, took a Diam of 
Cordial w^hich the Surgeon gave him, and v^ras what we 
cali'd. Came to himfelf 5 about a quarter of an Hour after 
this, they came running into the Cabin to the Su geon, 
who was bleeding a French Woman, that had fainted 3 and 
told him, the Prieil was gone ilark-mad 5 it leems he had 
begun to revolve the Change of his Circumdlance in his 
Mind, and this put him into an Extaly of Joy, his Spi- 
rits whir I'd about failer than the Vellels could convey 
them 5 the Blood giew hot and feverifh, and the Man was as 
fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that ever w^as in it : The 
Surgeon would not bleed him again in that Condition, but 
give him ibmething to dofe and put him to fleep, which 
after fome Time operated upon him, and he wak'd next 
Morning perfecSWy compos'd, and ^a^cIL 

The younger Prieil behav'd him fclf with great Command 
of his Paffion, and was really an Example of a ierious 
•well-govern'd Mind 3 at his firfl coming on board the Ship, 
he tlircw him^-lf fiat on his Face, pioflrating himfelf in 
Thankfulnefs for his Deliverance, in which I unhappily 
and unleaibnably diilurb'd him, really thinking he had been 
in a Swoon 3 but he fpake calmly, tliank'd me, told me, 
he was giving God Thanks for. his Diliverancc ; begg'd 
•me to leave him a few Moments, and that^ next to his 
Maker, he would give me Thanks alio. 

I WAS 



( 21 ) 

I w A s heartily {brrv, that I dirturb'd him, and not only- 
left him, but kept otters from interrupting him alio j he 
continued in tliat Poilure about three Minutes, or a little 
more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had iaid 
he would, and with a great deal of Serioufnefs and Affec- 
tion, but with Tears in his Eyes thank'd me that had, un- 
der God, given him and fb many miierable Creatures their 
Lives: J told him, I had no Room to move him to thank 
God for it, ratiier than me: For I had feen that he had 
done that already: But I addedy That it was nothing but 
what Reaibn and Humanity dic^-atcd to all Men, and that 
we had as much Reafbn a.s he to give Thanks to God, who 
had blcfs'd us fo far as to make us the Inftiuments of his 
Mercy to fb many of his Creatures. 

After this, the young Piieif apply 'd himfclf to his 
Country- Folks, laboured to compole them 3 perfiiaded, en- 
treated, argued, reaibn'd, with them, and did his utmoft to 
keep them within the Exercife of their Reafon j and with 
fome he had Succefs, tho' others were for a Time out of 
all Government of themfelves. 

I CANNOT help committing this to Writting, as per- 
haps it may be ufeful to thofe into whofe Hands it may 
fail, in the guiding themfelves in all the Extravagances of 
their Pailions ; for if an Excefs of Joy can carry Men out 
to fuch a Length beyond the Reach of their Reafbn, what 
will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, and a provoked 
Mind carry us to? and indeed here I law Reafbn for keeping * 
an exceeding Watch over our Paflipns of every Kind, as 
well thofe of Joy and Satisfadion, as thoie of Sorrow and 
Anger. 

W E were Ibmething diforder'd by theie Extravagances 
among our new Guefts for the f rib Day i but when they 
had been rctir'd, Lodgings provided for them as well as our 
Ship would allow, and they had ilept heartily, as mofi: of 
them dAi\, being fatigu'd and frighted, they were quite 
another Sort of People the next Day, 

Nothing of good Manners or civil Acknowledgments 
for the Kindnefs Ihewn them wos wanting ; the French, 
'tis known, arc naturally apt enough to czicc^d that Way : 
The Captain and one of the Pdclbs came to me the next 
Day, and deiiring to fpeak with me and my Nephe^v, the 
Commander, began to confult with us wliat flrould be 

done 



done with them 5 and firft they told us, that as we ha'd 
iaved their Lives, £o all they had was little enongh for a 
Return to us for the Kindneis received. The Captain faid, 
they had ikved ibme Money and fbme Things of Value in 
their Boats, catch'd haftily out of the Flames, and if we 
would accept it, they were ordered to make an Offer of it 
all to us J they only defir'd to befeton Shore Ibme where in 
our Way, where it poffible they might get Paflage to Frmce. 

My Nephew was for accepting their Money at firft 
Word, and to con£der what to do with them afterwards} 
but I over-rurd him in that Part, for I knew what it was 
to be fet on Shore in a ftrange Country j and if the Por- 
tugal Captain, that took me up at Sea had lerv'd me fb, 
and took all I had for my Deliverance, I muft haveilarv*d, 
or have been as much a Slave at the Brafih, as I had been 
in Bar^ary, the being fold to a Mahometan only excepted; 
and perhaps a fortuguefe is not much a better Mailer than a 
Turky if not in £oxaG Cafes a much worfe, 

Itherefore told the Trench Captain that we had ta- 
ken them up in their Difbrefs, it was true; but that it was 
our Duty to do £o, as we were Fellow-Creatures, and as 
we would delire to be fb delivered if we were in tlie like 
or any other Extremity ; that we had done nothing for 
them but what we believed they would have done for us, 
if we had been m. their Cafe, and they in ours ; but that 
we took them up to:&ve them, not to plunder them; and it 
would be a moft barbarous Thing to take tliat little from 
them which they had faved out of the Fire, and then fet 
them on Shore and leave them ; that this would be firfi to 
fave them from Death, and then kill them our fcives; fave 
them from drowning, and abandon them to ftarving; and 
thei'efore I would not let the leaft Thing be taken from 
them : As to fettin^ them on Shore, I told them indeed, 
that was an exceeding Difficulty to us, for that the Ship 
was bound to the Eaft-Indies-, and tho' we were driven out 
of our Courfe to the Weflward a very great Way, which 
perhaps was diredled by Heaven on purpoie tor their De- 
Uvcrance, yet it was impoffibie for us wilfully to change 
fmx Voyage on this particular j^ccount; nor could my Ne- 
phew, the Captain, anfweritto the Freighters, with whom 
he was under Charter-Farty to pursue his Voyage by the Way 
of Brafili and all I knew we could do for mem, was to 

put 



(23) 

put our felves in the Wav of meeting with other ShipS 
homeward bound from the Weft-Indies, and get them Pal^ 
i^ge, if poflible, to England or France. 

The firil Part of the Propoial was fo generous and kind, 
they could not but be very thankful for it j but they were 
in a very great Conftemation, eipecially the Paflengers, at 
the Notion of being carnr'd away to the Eaft-Indies^ they 
then intreated me, that ieeing I was driven £o far to the 
Wcftward, before I met with them, I would at leaft keqp 
on the iiime Courfe to the Banks of Newfound -Land^ 
where it was probable I might meet with fbme Ship or 
Sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Cana* 
da^ from whence they came. 

I THOUGHT this was but a reaibnable RequeH: on their 
Parti and therefore I inclined to agree to it 5 for indeed I 
confider'd, that to carry this whole Company to the Maft- 
Indies, would not only be an intolerable Severity to the 
poor People, but would be ruining our whole Voyage by 
devouring all our Provi£onsj £q I thought itpo Breach of 
Charter-party, but what an unforcfeen Accident made ab- 
fblutely neceflary to us, and in which no one could J&y we 
were to blame 5 for the Lav/s of God and Nature would 
have torbid, that we fhould refufe to take up two Boapts 
full of People in fiich a diftrefi'd Condition, and tlie Nature 
of the Thing as well reipcfting our felves as the poor Peo- 
ple, obliged us to fet them on Shore ibme where or other, 
for their JDeliverance 5 £0 I confented that we would carry 
them to Newfound-Land, if Wind and Weather would per- 
mit, and if not, tiiat I would carfythem to Marmicom 
the Weft-Indies, 

The Wind continued frefh Eafterly, bi5t the Weather pret- 
ty good, and as it had blowed continually in the Points be- 
tween N. E. and S.E. a long time, we mifled leveral Op- 
portunities of {knding them to France -, for we met feveral 
Ships bound to Europe, whereof two wece French from St. 
Chriftafher*s, but they had been £0 long beating up againft 
the Wmd, that they durfl: take in no Paflengers for fear of 
Wanting Provifions for the Voyage, as well for themfelves 
^ for thofe they fhould take in j ib we were obliged to go 
^n. It was about a Week after this that we made tfte 
Banks of Newfound-Land, where, to fhorten my Story, we 
jput all our French People on board a Bark, which tl^y 

hir'd 



( 24 ) 

hir'd at Sea there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards 
to carry them to France, if they could get Provifion to . 
vidual themfelveswith: When, I. lay, all the Fr^w^^ went on 
Shore, I fhould remember that the young Priell I Ipoke of, 
hearing we were bound to the Eaft-Indiesy delir'd to go the 
Voyage with us, and to be fet oh Shore on theCoall: of Ct?- 
Yommdel : I readily agreed to that, for I wonderfully lik'd 
the Man, and had very good Realbn. as will appeal after- 
wards y alfo four of the Seamen entered themfelves on our 
Ship, and proved very uieful Fellows. 

Fro m hence we direfted our Courfe for the Weft-Indies, 
fteeriflg away S. and S.by E. for about 20 Days together, fome- 
times little or no Wind at aU, when we met with another 
Subjed for our Humanity to work pon, almoft as deplo- 
rable as that before. .'T 

It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees f Minutes N. 
and the 19th Day of March 16^ \.-f, when we 'fyj'd a 
Sail, our Courfe S. E. and by S. We fbon perceiv'd it was 
a large Veflel, and that flie bore up to us, but could not at firll 
know what to make of her, till after coming a little nearer, 
we found fhe had loft her MainTop-maft, Fore-maft and Bolt- 
iprit, and prefently fhe fires a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs -, 
the Weather was pretty good. Wind at N. N. W. a frefh- 
Gale, and w^e foon came to fpeak with her. 

We found her a Ship of BriftoU bound home from Bar* 
badoes, but had been blown out of the Road at Bar If adder 
a few Days before fhe was ready to fail, by a terrible Hur- 
ricane, while the Captain and Chief-Mate were both gone 
on Shores £0 that, befide the Terror of the Storm, rhey 
were but in an indifferent Cafe for good Artifts to b^ing 
the Ship home: "fhcy had been already nine Wecrks at Sea, 
and had met with another terrible Srorm after the Hurrir. 
cane was over, which had blown them quite out of their 
Knowledge to the Wcftward, and in which they loft their 
Mafts, as above \ they told us they ty.^Q.Oi.Q.^ to have fcen 
the Bahama Illands, but were then driven away again ■ 
to the South-Eaft, by a flrong Gale of Wind at N, N. W. 
the fame that blew now, and having no Sails to work the ' 
Ship with, but a Main-Courfe, and a kind of fquare S^jl ; 
upon a Jury-Fore-Maft, which they had fet up, they Q^y^^^ I 
not lie near the Wind, but were endeavouring to ftarid ,^- \ 
way for the C/if»^w. ■- ' " 

^ But 



(23) 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they were 
almofl ftarv'd for want of Provilions, befides the Fatigues 
they had undergone ; their -Bread and Flelh was quite gone, 
th*ey had not one Ounce left in the Ship, and had had none for 
II Days 5 the only Relief they had, was^ their Water was 
not all ipent, and they had about half a Barrel of Flower 
left j they had Sugar enough , fome Succades or Sweet- 
Meats they had at firft, but they were devoured, and they 
had feven Casks of Rum. 

There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid-Ser- 
vant on board, who were going Paflengers, and thinking 
the Ship was ready to fail, unhappily came on board the E- 
vcning before the Hurricane began, and having no Provilions 
of their own kftjthey WjCrein a nwred^lorable Condition than 
the refl: j for the Seamen, being reduc'd to fuch an extreme 
Ncceility themiHves, had no (5)mpaflion, we may be furc, 
for the poor PafTengersj, nd they were indeed in a Condi- 
tion that their Miiery is^very hard to defcribe. 

I H A D, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curiofity had 
not led me, the Wither being fair and the Wind abated, to 
go onboard the Ship: The Second Mate who upon this Oc- 
cafion commanded the Ship, had been on board our Ship, 
and he told me indeed, that they had three Paflengers in 
the great Cabin, that they were in a deplorable Condition; 
nay, fays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard no- 
thing of them for above two Daysj and I was afraid to en- 
quire after them, iaid he, for I had nothing to reHeve them 
with. 

W E immediately apply *d our felves to give them what 
Relief he could iparej and indeed I had lo far over-ruled 
Things with my Nephew, that I would have vi<ftuall*d 
them, tho* we had gone away to Virginia^ or any Part of 
theCoafl: ofuimerica, to have lupply'd our ielvesj but there 
was no NeceiTity for that. 

But now they were in a aicw Danger j for they were 
afraid of ^ting too much, even of that little we gave them s 
the Mate or Q>mmander brought fix Men with him in his 
Boat, but thefe jpoov Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and 
were fo. weak, they could hardly fit to their Oars: The 
Mate himfelf was very HI and half flai-ved v for he de- 
clared he had referv*d nothing from the Men, and went 
B Share 



( ^6 ) 

'Share and Sliare alike with tlifim, in erery Bit they 
eat. , ^ 

I c A u T I o N ' D him to eat fparingly, but fet Meat be- 
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three Mouth- 
fuls before he began to be iick, and out of order j ib he 
flopt a while, and our Surgeon mix'd him up fomething 
with Ibme Rroath, which he faid would be to him both 
Food and Phylick , and after he had taken it he gi ew bet- 
ter: In the mean Time, I forgot not the Mcnj I ordered 
Victuals to be given them, ai2 the poor Creatures rather 
devoured than eat iti they were ib exceeding hungry, that 
they were in a kind ravenous, and had no Command of 
themfelves 5 and two of them eat with fo much Greedi- 
nefs, that they were in Danger of their Lives the next 
Morning, 

The Sight of theie People's Diftrefs was very moving 
to me, and brought to fnind what I had a terrible Profpe6t 
of at my firil coming on Shore in my Ifland, where I had 
not the leaft Mo\ith&l of Food* or any Profped of pro- 
curing any* befid^s the hourly Apprehenfion I had of being 
made the Food of other Creatures : But all the while the 
Mate was thus relating to me the miierable Condition of 
the Ship*s Company, . I could not put out of my Thought 
the St<»y he had told rtie of the three poor Creatures ia 
the great Cabin, ('v'tTL,) the Mother, her Son, and the Maid- 
Servant, who he had heard nothing of for two or three 
Daysj and who he feem'd to confejS they had wholly neg- 
lected, their own Extremities being £0 great ; by which I 
underftood, that they had really given them no Food at all, 
and that therefore tney muft be perifh*d, and be all lying 
dead perhaps on the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin. 

A s I therefore kept the Mate, who we then called Cap- 
tain, on board with his Men to refiefli them, fo I alfo for- 
got not the ftarving Crew that were left on boai d, but or- 
dered my own Bo^t to goon.board the Ship, and with my 
iMate and -twelve Men to carry them a Sack of Bread, and 
four or five Piecejs of Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd 
the Men to caufc the Meat to be boil*d while they ftayU and 
to keep Gaurd in the Cook-Room, to prevent the Men 
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the Pot before it 
was welirboird. and then to give every Man but a little at 
ft time j and by" this Caution he preferv'd the Men, who 

would 



( ^7 ) 

would otherwifc ha' kill'd themfeves, with that very Focxr 
that was given them on Purpofe to fave their Lives. ^ 

A T the fame Time, I ordered ths Mate to go into the 
great Cabin, and fee what Condition the poor Paflengers 
were in, and if they were alive, to comfort them, and give 
them what Refrefhment was proper ,• and the Surgeon gave 
him a large Pitcher with ibme of the prepared Broth which 
he had given the Mate that was on Board, and which he 
did not queilion would reftore them gradually. 

I w A s not Satisfied with this, but, as I faid above, hav- 
ing a great Mind to fee the Scene of Miicry, which I knew 
the Ship it ielf would prefent me with, in a more lively 
Manner than I could have it by Report, I took the Captain 
of the Ship, as we nowcall'd him, with me, and went my 
i^if a little after in their Boat. 

I F o u N D the poor Men on board almofl: in a Tumult 
to get the Viduals out of the Boiler before it was ready: 
But my Mate oblerv'd his Order, and kept a good Guard at 
the Cook-Room Door, and the Man he plac d there, after 
uling all poflible Perfuafion to have Patience, kept them off 
by Force : However, he caufed fome Bisket Cakes to be 
dipp'd in the Pot, and fbften'd them with the Liquor of the 
Meat, which they call Brewes, and gave them every one 
One, to ftay their Stomachs, and told them it was for their 
own Safety that he was obligd to give them but a link %t 
a time : But it was all in vain, and had I not comeon board, 
and their own Commander and Officers with me, and with 
good Words, and fbme Threats alfoof giving them no more, 
I believe they would have broke into the Cook-Room by 
Force, and tore the Meat out of the Furnace : For Words 
are indeed of very fmall Force to a hungry Belly : However 
we pacify d them, and ted them gradually and cautioufly for 
the firfl Time, and the next Time gave them more, and at 
laft filld their Belies, and the Men did well enough. 

But theMifery of the poor Paflengers in the Cabin wa^ 
of another Nature, and tar beyond the reft ^ for asfirji, the 
Ship's Company had fo little for themfelves, it was but too 
true that they had at firft kept them very low, and at laft 
totally negle6J:ed them,- fb that for fix or feven Days, it 
might be faid, they had really had no Food at all, and for 
ieveral Days before, very little. The poor Mother, who, as 
th^ firft Mate reported, was a Woman of good Sence and 
B, I, good 



( 28 ) 

gootl Breeding, had fpar'd ail flie could get fb affedionate!/ 
for her Son, that at laft ilje entirely funk under it : An J 
■when the Mate of Ship went in, ilie £it upon the Floor or 
Deck, with her Back up againft the Sides, between two 
Chairs, which were lafh'd mft, and -her Head funk in be- 
tween her Shoulders, like a Corpfe, tho' not quite dead. 
My Mate iaid all he could to revive and encourage her, and 
with a Spoon put ibme Broth into her Mouthy fhe open-* 
cd her Lips, and lifted up one Hand, but could not fpeak ; 
yet il e udner flood what he ikidy and made Signs to him, 
intimating, that it was too late for her, but pointed to her ' 
Child, as if Hie would have faid, they fhould take Care of 
him. 

However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd 
with the Sight, endeavoured to get ibme of the Broth in- 
'to her Mouth i and, as he faid, got two or thijec Spoonfuls 
€own, tho* I queftion whether he could be fuie of it or 
net : But it was too late, and ilie dy'd the fame Night. 

The Youth, who was prcferv'd at the Price of his moft 
afiedrionate Mother's Life, was not fo far gone, yet he lay 
in a Cabin-bed as one ilretchd out, with hardly any Life 
left in Mm, he had a Piece of an old Glove in his Mouth, 
having eaten up the reil of it,- however, being young, and 
having more Strength than his Mother, the Mate got fome- 
thing down his Throat, and he began fcnfibly to revive, 
though by giving him ibme time after but two or three 
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very fick, and brought it 
up again. 

B u T the next Care was the poor Maid, fl e lay all along 
upon the Deck, hard by her Miflrefs, and juft like one that 
had Men down with an Apoplexy, and ftruggled for Life: 
Her Limbs were diftorted, one of her Hands was clafp d 
round the Frame of the Chair, and ilie grip'd it fo haid, 
tiiat we could not eafily make her let gp i her other Arm 
Jay over lier Head, and her Feet lay both together, fet faft 
againft the Frame of the Cabin-table i in fhovt, fb.elayjufl 
like one in the iaft Agonies of Death 5 and yet fl.e was 
alive toe. * 

The poor Creature was not only flarv'd with Hunger, 
and terrify d with the Thoughts of Death, but, as the Men 
told ns afterwards, was broken-heaited for her Miftrefs 

who 



(29) 

who fl:c faw dying two of three Days before, and whofli* 
iov'd^mofl: tenderly. 

W E knew not v/hcit to do with this poor Girl, for 
when our Saigeon, who was a Man of very great Know- 
ledge and Experience, had with great Appiicat ion recover'd 
iTer, as to Lifej he had her upon his Hand as to her Senfes, 
for lie was little lels than diftra(fted for a confidei able Tim« 
'*irftCT, as fliall appear prefcntly. 

W H o E V E R il all read thefe MemormdHms muft be de- 
/i^'d to confider, that Vifits at Sea are not like a fourney 
into the. Country, vvheie Ibmetimes People Hay a Week or 
a Fortnight a^ a Place. Our Bufinefs was to relieve this 
difbelTed Ship's Crew, but not lie by for them i and tlio' 
they were willing to fleer the fame Courie with us for 
fome Days, yet we could carry no Sail to keep Pace v/ith 
a Ship that had no Mafts -, however, as their Captain hig- 

f'd of us to help him to let up a Main-Top-Maft, and^a 
ind of Top-Maft to his Jury-Fore-Maft. We did, as it 
were lie by him for tin ee or four Days, and then having 
given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork, two Hog- 
fl eadsof Bisket, and a Porportion of Peas, Flowr, and what 
other Things vve could fpa-cj and taking three Ca^ks of 
Sugar, fbme Rum, and fome Pieces of Eight of them ibr 
Satisfa6tion, we left them, taking on board with us, at their 
own carneft Requeft, the Youth, and the Maid, and all their 
Goods. 

The young Lad was about feventecn Years of Age, % 
pretty, well-bred, modeft, and fenlible Youth i greatly de- 
jected with the Lofs of his Mother, and, as it ieenis, had 
loft his Father but a few Months before at Barbacloes. He 
begg d of the Surgeon to fpeak to me, to take him out of 
the Ship, for he faid the cruel Fellows had murthcr'd his 
Mother j and indeed fo they had, that is to fay pijjlicly ; for 
they might ha' fpar'd a imail Suftenance to the poor help- 
lefs Widow, that might have prefov'd her Life, tho' it had 
been but juft to keep her alive. But Hunger knows no 
Friend, no Relation, no Juftice, no Right, and theierbre is 
remorfelefs, and capable of no Compaflion. 

The Surgeon told him how far we were going, ami 

how it woufi carry him away fi om all his Friends, and put 

him pei'haps in as bad Circumftances almofl as we found 

them in ^ that is to fay, ftarving in the World. He faid he 

Bj mat- 



C3o) 

fttiatter*d not whether lie went, if he was but deliver 'd from 
tjie terrible Crew, that he was among : That the Captain 
Ihy which he meant me, for he could know nothing of 
my Nephew) had iav'd his Life, and he was fure would 
iior hurt him , and as for the Maid, he was fure if fl'C 
cajne to her ielf, flie would be very thankful for it, let 
us cany them v/herc wc would. The Surgeon reprefcnt* 
«tl the Cafe fo affe(ffionately to me, that I yielded, and wc 
took them both on board with all their Goods, except eleven 
Ilogflxads of Sugar, which could not be removed or come 
at, and as the Youth had a Bill of Lading for them, I 
made his Commander lign a Writing, obliging himfelf to 
go as foon as he came to Brijlol, to one Mr. Rogers aMer- 
cliant there, to whom the Youth faid he was related, and 
to deliver a Letter which I wrote to him, and all the 
Goods he had belonging to the deceafed Widow ,• which I 
. ilippofe was not done, for I could never learn that the Ship 
came to Brijioly but was, as is moft probable, loft at Sea, 
^ing in {o difabled a Condition, and to far from any Land, 
that lam of Opinion, the firfl Storm flic met with after- 
wards, fhe might founder in the Sea, for (he was leaky, 
and had Damage in her Hold when we met with her. 

I W'AS now in the Latitude of 19 Deg. ^1 Min. and 
tad hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, though 
at fir ft the Winds had been contraiy. I fliall trouble no 
body with the little Incidents of Wind, Weather, Currents, 
t^c. on the reft of our Voyage j but ftiortning my Story 
for the fake of what is to rollow, ftiafl obfcrve that I came 
to my old Habitation, the Ifland, on loth of uiprit, i6c^f. 
It was with no fmall Difficulty that I found the Place; 
for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the South 
and Eaft Side of the I])and, as coming from the Braj Is, fo 
now coming in between the Main and thellland, and hav- 
ing no Chart for the Coaft, nor any Land-Mark, I did 
not know it v/hen I faw it, or know whether I j[aw k 
or no. 

W E beat about a great while, and went on Shore on fe^ 
Veral Iflands in the Mouth of the great River Oronooque, 
but none for my Purpoife. Only this I learn'd by my 
Coafting the Shore, that I was under one great Miftake be- 
fore, vtz, that the Continent which I thought I iaw, from 
the IQmd I liv'd in, was really no Continent, but a long 

Wand, 



( 31 ) 

Ifland, or rather a Ridge of lilands, reaching from one to 
the other Side of the extended Mouth of that great River, 
and that the Sav&ges who came td my liland, were not 
properly thoie which we call Cari&Sees, but I (landers and 
other Barbarians *of the fame Kind, who inliabitcd {bme- 
thing nearer to our Side than the reft. 

I N Jl:iort> I villted feveral of theie lilarids to no Parpofe -, 
fome I found were inhabited, and ibme were not. On one 
ot them I found ibme Spaniards, and thought they hadliv'd 
there, but fpeaking with them, found they had a Sloop lay 
in a fmall Creek hard by, and they came thither to make 
Salt, and to catch fome Pearl Mufcles if they could, bur 
that they belonged to the Me de Tr'midud, which lay farther 
North, in the Latitude of i o and 1 1 Degrees. 

Thus coafting from one Ifiand to another, fbmetimes 
with the Ship, Ibmetimes with the French Man's Shalloup* 
(which we had found a convenient Boat, and therefore kept 
her with their ver}^ good Willi) at length I came fair on 
the South Side of my Ifland, and I prefently knew the ve- 
ry Countenance of tihe Place j ib I brought the Shipfefe to 
an Anchor, Broadlide with the little Creek where was my 
old Habitation. 

^ As ibonas I faw the Place, I call'd for Friday, and ark d 
him if he knew where he was? He lookd about a liitJe, 
and prefently, clapping his Hands, cryxi j O yes, O there, 
O yes, O there, pointing to our old Habitation, and fell a 
dancing and capering like a mad Fellow, and I had mucH 
ado to keep him from jumping into the Sea, to fwim a^ 
iliore to the Place. 

Well, Friday, fays I, do you think we fhall find any bo*' 
dj here or no,? And what do you think, fbail we fee your 
Father ? The Fellow flood mute as a Stock a good while, 
but when I nam'd his Father, the poor affectionate Ci en tu re 
lookd dejedled, and I could fee the Tears run down his 
Face vay plentifoUv. What is the matter, Fridpy, lays I ? 
Are you troubled oecaufe you may fee your Father ? No, 
no. Jays hey fhaking his Head, no fee him more, no ever 
more fee again ,• V^f&y flid I, Friday, hon0 do you kf:otp 
that? O no, O no, fays Friday, he long ago die; long ago, 
he much old Man. Well, well, fays I, Friday, y^u don't 
knovy^l but fhall we fee any one elfc tHdif The Fellow, it 
^ms, had better Eyes than I, and he points jufl: to the Hill 
B 4 above 



ai-ove my old Houfcj and tho' we lay half a League off, ht 
cries out> me fee I meiee! yes, yes, mefee much Man there, 
and there, and there. I look'd, but I could fee no body, 
no not with a Porfpeaive GhB i which was, I fuppofe, 
tecaufe I could not hit the Place, for the FeUow was right, 
as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and there was five 
or fix Men altogether, flood to look at the Ship, not know- 
ing what to think of us. 

A s foou as Friday had told me he faw People, I caus'd 
the EngUj^ Ancient to be fpread, and fir'd tluec Guns, to 
give them notice we were Friends, and in about half a 
Quarter of an Hour after, we perceiv'd a Smoak rife fiom 
the Side of the Creek, ib I immediately order 'd a Boat out, 
taking Friday with me, andhanging out a white Flag, or 
a Flag of Truce, I went dire£lly on Shore, taking with me 
the young Fryer I mentioned, to whom I had told the 
whole Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, and 
every Piffticidar both of my felf, and thofe that I left there; 
and who was on that Account extremely delirous to go 
with me. - We had befides about fixteeo Men very well 
aurmd, if we had found any new Guefts there which we 
iid not know of, but we had no need of W^pons, 

As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood, near 
high Water, JVC row'd dh^dly into the Creek, and the firflf 
Man, I fix'd my Eye upon, was the Sfmiard whofe Life I 
had 0v'd, and whio I knew by his Face perfectly well j as 
to his Habit I fl all defcribe it afterwards. I order 'd no bo- 
dy to go on Shore at firft but my {df, but there was no 
keeping Friday in tlie Boat ; for the aflfe^lionate Creature 
liad ffyd his Father at a Diilance, a good way off of the 
Spaniards, where indeed I iaw nothing of him j and if* they 
had not let him go on $hore, he would have jump d into 
the Sea. He was no foona- on Shore, but he flew away 
to his Father like an Arrow out of a Bow. It would have 
made any Man have fhed Tears in fpight of the firmeft Re- 
solution, to have fcen the firff Traniports of this poor Fel- 
low's Joy when he came to his Father j how he embrac d 
him, kifs'dhim,. fkokd his Face, took him up in his Arms, 
fet him down upon a Tree,^ and lay down by him ; then 
flood and look'd at him, as anyone v^ould look at a ftrange 
Pi^urejt for a Quarter of m Hour together i tJienlye down 

on 



(Si) 

on the Ground, and stroke his Legs, and kiCs them, an^I 
then get up again, and flare at him 3 one would ha' thought 
the Fellow bewitch'd : But it would have made a 
Dog laugh to iee how the next Day his Pafllon run 
out another Way : In the Morning he walk'd along the 
Shore, to and again, with his Father fever al Hours, always 
leading him by the Hand, as ii he had been a Lady i and 
every now and then would come to fetch fomcthing or 
other for him to the Boat, either a Lump of Sugar, or at 
Dram, a Bisket, or fbraething or other that was good. 
In the Afternoon his Fi clicks run another Way 3 fo then 
he would fet the old Man down upon the Ground, and 
dance about him, and made a Thoufand antick Poftures 
and Gefturesj and all the while he did this, he vi'^ould be 
talking to him, and telling him one Story or another of 
his Travel, and of what had happen'd to him Abroad, to 
divert him. In Hiort, if the fame filial AfIc(£lion v/as to 
be found in Chriilians to their Parents, in our Parts of the 
World, one would be tempted to iay, there wouki liardly 
ha' been any Need of the fiftth Commandment. 

But this is a Digreflion j I return to my Landing. 
It would be endlefs to ake Notice of all the Ceremonies 
and Civilities that the Spaniards receiv'd me with. The 
fivft SpmtarJ, who, as I faiJ, I knew very well, was 
he whole Life I had lav'dj he came towards the Boat, 
attended by one more, carrying a Flag of Truce alibi and he 
did not only not know me atiirft, but he had no Thoughrs, 
no Notion of its being me that was come, till. I fpokc to 
him : Seignior, faid I, in Tortugmfcy Do you not know 
me? At which he ipoke not a Wordj but giving his Mu- 
sket to the Man that was with him, threw his Arms a- 
broad, andiayingfbmethinginy/>^w}^, that I did not p:rfed:- 
ly hear, came forward, and embrac'd me, telling me he 
was inexcufablc, not to know that Face again, that he had 
once feen, as of an Angel f om Heaven,, fent to faye Ms 
Life : He fiid Abun«iance of very bandibmc Things, as a 
^'ell-bred Spm'uirJ always knows how j and then beckon- 
ing to tlic Perl<>n that attended him, bad Iiim go and call 
out his Comeradcs. He then ask'd me, if I "\^7ou]H ^v-ilk 
to my old Habitation, where he would ^2;ive me Pcir.iricM 
of my own Hoiife again, and wlic' c I ilould fee tlv.rc !iad 
been but mean Improvements 5 fb I walk'd deny with 
Bj ^'himi 



C H ) 

but alas ! l could no more find the Place again, than if f 
had never been there > for they had planted ib many Trees, 
end plac'd them in fuch a Pofhire, £o thick and clofe to 
one another j and in ten Year's Time they were grown fb 
big, that injhon the Place was inacceflible, except by fuch 
Windings and blind Ways, as they themfelves only, who 
made them, could find. 

I A s K ' D them what put them upon all theie Fortifica- 
tions ? He told me, I would fay there was need enough 
of it, when they had given me an Account how they had 
pafs*d their Time fince there Arriving in the Ifland, efpe- 
cially after they had the Misfortune to find that I was 
gone: He told me, he could not but have fbme Satisfadii- 
on in my good Fortune, when he heard that I was gone 
in a good Ship, and to my Satisfadion j and that he had 
often-times a ftrong Perfualion, that one Time or other he 
fbould lee me again : But nothing that ever befel him in 
his Life, he faid, was fb furprifimg and affli£ting to him at 
firft, as the Difappointment he was under when he came 
back to the Ifland, and found I was not there. 

A s to the thxQt Barbarians (ib he call*d them) that wer« 
left behind, and of whom he faid he had a long Story to 
tell me 3 the SfamarJs all thought themfelves much better 
among the Savages, only tliat their Number was £0 fmajl. 
And, fays he, Iiad they been f^rong enough, we had been 
aillong ago in Pur^tory; and with that he crofs'd him- 
^fclf on the Breafl : But, Sir, fays he, I hope you will not 
be difpleafed, when I iball tell you how, forc'd by Necef- 
ikjy we were oblig'd, for our own Prcfervation, to dilarm 
them, and making them our Subje£^s, who would not be 
content with being moderately our Maf^ers, but would be 
our Murtherers. I anfwer'd, I was heartily afraid of it 
' when I left them there j and nothing troubled me at my 
^f)arting from the liland, but that tliey were not come 
back, that I might have put them in Poflefiion of every 
Thing firfl, and left the other in a State of Subjed:ion, as 
they deferv'd : But i£ they had reduced them to it, I 
was very glad, and fliould be very far from iinding any 
Fault with it ^ for I knew they were a Parcel of refrac- 
tory, unrovera'd Villains, apd weie fit for any Manner of 
mthkC 

While 



(35) 

WnitE I was faying this, came the Man whom te 
had fent back, and with him eleven Men more: In the 
Dreis they were in, it was impofllble to guefs v/hat 
Nation they are of : But he made all clear both to them 
and to me. Firft he turned to me, and pointir^ to them, 
{aid, Thefe, Sir, arefbme of the Gentlemen who owe their 
Lives to youj and then turning to them, and pointing to 
me, he let them know who I was j upon which they ail 
came up one by one, not as if they had been Sailors and 
ordinary Fellows, and I the like, but really, as if they had 
been Amballadors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or a 
great Conqueror 5 their Behaviour was to the kdl Ikgr ee 
obliging and courteous, and yet mix'd with a manly, ma- 
jcflick Gravity, which very well became them j and in 
fhort, they had fo much more Manners than I, that I fcarcc 
Icnew how to receive their Civilties, jnuch lefs how to re- 
turn them in kind.

Mand, after my going away, is fb very remarkable, and 
has lb many Incidents, which the former Part of my Re- 
lation will help to underlland, and which, will, in moH of 
the Particulars, refer to that Account I haye already given, 
that I cannot but commit them with great Delight to the 
reading of thoie that come after me. 

I flail no longer trouble the Story with a Relation in 
the firft Perfbn, which will put me to the Expence of ten 
ThonQind /aid tsy znd /aid he's, and he told fftfi's and I told 
him's, and the like, but I fliall coiled the. Fa<fis Hiftorical^y, 
as near as I can gather them out of m,y Memory li om 
what they related to me, and from what I met with in 
my converling with them, and with the Place. 

I N order to do this fuccindtly, and as intelligibly as I 
can, I muft go back to the Circumftance in v/hich I left 
the Ifland, and which the Peribnswerein, of whom I am 
to ipeak. And fii ft it is neceflary to repeat^ that I had ient 
away Friday's Father and the Spamardy the two whole 
Lives I hail refcued from the Savages 5 I lay, I had lent , 
them away in a laige Canoe to the Main, as I then thought 
itt to fetch over the Spaniard's Companions Avhom he had 
left behind him, in order to lave them from the like Ca- 
lamity that he had been in ; and in order to fuccour tlicm for 
the prcicnt, and that if polTible, we might together fini 
fome V/ay for our Deliverance aftei wai d# When 



Xt6) 

Whe-r relent them away, I had no vilible Appearance 
of, or the leaft Room to hope for my own Deliverance 
any more than I had twenty Year before, much lefs had 
I any E©re*knOwledgeof what after happened, I mean of art 
Mngli/hShii> coming on Shore there to fetch me offj and it 
could not but be a very great Surprize to them when they 
came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find 
three Strangers left on the Spot, pofleis'd of all that I had 
left behind me, whicK wouM otiierwife have been their 
©wn. 

The firfl Thing, however, which I enquir'd into, that 
I might hcgin where I left off, was of their own Part ;, 
and I defir^ h^ would give me a particular Account of 
his Voyage back to his Countrymen with the Boat, when 
i ient him to fetch them over. He told me there Was 
Ettle Variety in that Part, for nothing remarkable happened 
to them on the Way, they having very calm Weather, and* 
a fmooth Sea j for his Countrymen it could not be doubted 
he faid, but that they were over joy 'd to ice him: It ieems- 
he was the principal Man among them, the Captain of the 
Vcflel they had been Shipwrecked in (having been Dead 
ibme Time) they were, he fat d, the more Surprized to lee 
h'm, becaufc they knew that he was fallen into the Hands of 
tl;e Savages, w^ho, they were Satisfy 'd, would devour hinv 
ar. rhey did all the reft of their Prif bnei s 5 that when they told 
them the Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner 
he was furnifh^d' for carrying them away, it was like 
a Dream 4io them / and their Aftoniflimxent, they faid, wa^ 
ibmethittgKkethatof y^jtj/^'s Brethren, when he toldthem- 
who he was, and told them the Story of his Exaltation 
in Pharoah's Coiirt: But when he flic wed them the Arms, 
t^he Powder, the Ball, and the Provifions that he brought 
them for their ) our ncy or Voyage, they were leftor'd^td 
themlelves, took a ;uft Share or the Joy of their Delive- 
rance,, and immediately prepai-'d to come away with him. 

Their iirft Bulinefs was to get Canoes,- and in this 
thty were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the honeft 
Part of it, but to trelpafs upon their friendly Savages, and to 
feonow two lai ge Canoes or Periagua's, on pretence of go- 
ffig out a Fifiiing, or for Pleafure. 



(37) 

I N thefe they came away the next Morning; it fceflis thcf 
wanted no Time to get themfclves leady, for they had no 
^^^g^g^y neitheir Clothes or Provifions, or any Thing in 
the ^^'orid, but what they had on them, and a few Roots- 
to eat, of which they uied to make their Bread. 

They were in all three Weeks abfent, and in that 
Time,^ unluckily for them, I had the Occafion oflfer'd for 
my Efcapc, as I mentioned in my other Part, and to get ofip 
from the lilandj leaving three of the mofi: impudent^ 
hardened, ungovern'd, diiagi eeable Villains beliind me, that 
any Man could defire to meet with, to the poor Sfanmrds^ 
great Grief and Dfi^ppointment, you may be foe. 

The only juft Thing the Rogues did, was, That\vhen 
the Spaniards came on Shore, they gave my Letter to them, 
and gave them Provifions and other Relief, as I had or- 
dered them to do ; alio they gave them the long Paper of 
Direcftions which I had left with them, containing the 
Particular Metho(is which I took for miaraging every Part 
of my Ijfe theie, the Way how I baked my 'Bread, 
bred up my tame Goats, and planted my Corn, how I 
cur'd iTiy GrapeJT, made my Pots, and, in a Word, every 
Thing I did, all this being Written down, tliey gave 
to the Spaniards y two of whom underfiand En^hih wcH 
enough i nor did they rcfufe to accomodate the Spaniards 
with any Thing elfc, for they agreed very well tor fomc 
Timej they gave them an equal Admiflion into theHoule; 
or Cave, and they began to live very Ibcinblyi and the Head 
Spaniard, who had feen pretty much cf my Method, and 
Fridays Father together, manng'd all their Aflaiisj for, as 
tor the Engli/hmen they did nothing but Ramble about 
the Illand, flroot Panots, and catch To toiics, and when 
they came Home at Night, the Spaniards provided their 
Suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatifsy'd with this, 
would the other but have let \^m aloncwhich^ however .they 
could not find in their Hearts to do long^butjike the Dog in 
the Manger, they would not cat theirjfelvcs, and wouM 
not let others eat neither : The Difierences, neverthelels, 
were at fir ft but trivial, and fiich as are not worth relating^ 
but at liaCI it broke out into open W^ar, and it begun Vvdth 
all the Rudenefsand Iniblence that can be imagined, v/itl> 
otit Reafon> without Provocation, contraiy to Natuie,ar.d in- 
deed^ 



(38) 

deed, fo common Senfe j and tho* it is true the firil: Re- 
lation of it came from tlie Span'mrds themfelves, who I 
"fnay call the Accufers, yet when I came to examine the 
Fellows, they could not deny a Word of it. 

But before I come to the Particulars of this Part, I 
muft iiipply a DefeiSl in my former Relation, and this was, 
that I forgot to let down among the reft, that juft as we 
were weighing the Anchor to let Sail, there, happened a 
Httle Quarrel on board our Ship, which I was afraid once 
would have turned to a iecond Mutiny j nor was it ap- 
peased, till the Captain routing up his Courage, and taking 
us all to his Afliftance, parted them by Force, and making 
two of the moft reta^tory Fellows Priibners, he laid them 
in Irons, and as they had been a6i:ive in the former Dilbr- 
ders, and let fall ibme ugly dangerous Words the iecond 
Time, he threatn'd to carry them in Irons to Englandy and 
have them hang'd there for Mutiny, and running away 
with the Ship. 

This, it feems, tho* rhe Captain did not intend to do 
it, frighted Ibme other Men in the Ship, and ibme of 
them had put it into the Heads of the reft, that the Cap- 
tain only gave them good Words for the prefent, till they 
Ihould come to fbme Engli/h Port, and that then they 
fliould be all put into a Jayl, and try'd for their Lives. 

The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted us 
with it 5 upon which it was delir'd, tlmt I, who ftill pafs'd 
for a great Man among them, fliould go down with the 
Mate, and fatisfy the Men, and tell them, that they might 
be allured, if they behav'd well the reft of the Voy^e, all 
they liad done for the Time paft fhould be pardon'd. So 
1 went, and after ipaffmgmy Honour's Word to them, they 
appeared eafyj and the more fo, when I caufed the two 
Men, who were in Irons, to be relealed and forgiven. 

But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for that 
Night, the Wind alfo falling calm, next Morning we 
found, that our two Men who had been laid in Lons, had 
ftcle each of them a Musket, and ibme other Weapons, 
what Powder or Shot they had, we know not •■> and had 
taken the Ship's Pinnace, which wa^? not yet hal'd up, and 
ran away with her to their Companions, in Rogury, on 
Shoie. 

As 



C 3P ) 

A s Coon as we found this, I ordered the Long-Boat on 

Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and away they 
went to feekthe Rogues, but they could neither find them, 
or any of the reft j for they all fled into the Woods when 
they iaW the Boat coming on Shore. The Mate was once 
reiblv'd in Juftice to their Rogery, to have deftroy'd their 
Plantations, burnt all their Houfliold-StufF and Furniture, 
and left them to fliift without it j but having no Order, 
he let all alone, left every Thing as they found it, and 
bringing the Pinnace away, came on Board without 
them. 

These two Men made their Number ^ve, but the o- 
ther three Villains were fo much wickeder than thefe, that 
after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they turned 
their two New-Comers out of Doors to fhift for them- 
lelves, and would have nothing to do with them, nor 
could they for a good while be perfiiaded to give them 
any Food j as for the Spaniards they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came firft on Shore, the Bufinefs 
began to go forward 5 the Spaniards would have perfuad- 
ed the tfiee Englijh Brutes to have taken in their two 
Countrymen again, that, as they faid, they might be all 
one Family j but they would not hear of it : So the two 
poor Fellows liv'd by themfelf es, and finding nothing but 
Induftry and Application would make them live comfort- 
ably, they pitched their Tents on the N^rr^-fliore of the 
Illand, but a little more to the Wefi, to be out of the 
Danger of the Savages, who always landed on the J^afl 
Parts of the Ifland. 

Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, and 
the other to lay up their Magazines and Stores in, and the 
Spaniards having given them ibme Corn for Seed, and ei^ 
pecially {bme of the Peas which I had left them, they dug 
and planted, and enclofed; after the Pattern I had ^t for 
them all, and began to live pretty well j their fii ft Crop of 
Com was on the Ground, and tho' it was but a little bit 
of Land which they had dug up at firft, having had but a 
little Time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find 
them with Bread and other Eatables j and one of the Fel- 
lows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship, was very ready 
at making Soup, Puddings, and fuch other Preparations, 

as 



(40 

as the Rice, and the Milk, and fuch little Flefli as they 
got, furnifh'd him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving Pofhire,when 
the three unnatural Rogues, their own Countrymen too, 
in mere Humour, and to iniult them, came and bully'd 
them, and told them, the Ifiand was theirs -, that the Go- 
vernour, meaning me, had given them PofTeflion of it, 
and no Body elfe had any right to it, and damn 'em, they 
fhould build no Houfes upon their Ground, unlefs they 
would pay them Rent for them. 

T H E two Men thought they had jelled at firfl: 5 
ask'd them to come and lit down, and fee what fine 
Houle's they were, that they had built, and tell them what 
Rent they demanded, and one of them merrily told them., 
if they were Ground- Land lords, he hoped, if they built 
Tenements upon the Land, and made Improvements, they 
would, according to the Cuftom of all Landlords, grant 
them a long Leafe, and bid them go fetch a Sciivener to 
draw the Wiitings. One of the three damning and rage- 
ing, told them, they f! ould fee they weic not in Jeil, 
and going to a little Place at a Difiance, wliere the honell 
Men had made a Fire to drefs their Vi<f)tunls, he takes a 
Fire-biand, and ch'ps it to the Cut-lide of their Hut, and 
very fairly let it on Fire, anJi it woujd have been all burnt 
down in a few Minutes, if one of the two had not run to 
the Fellow, thruft him axvay, and trod the Fire out with 
his Feet, and that not without fome Difficulty too. 

The Fellow was in fuch a Rage at the honeft Man's 
thruiling him away, that he turn'd upon him with a Pofe 
he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoided the Blow 
very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he had ended his Days 
at once 5 his Comrade ieeing the Danger they were both 
in, run in after him, and immediately they came both 
out with their Muskets, and the Man that was fiifl ftruck 
at with the Pole, knock'd the Fellow down, who begun 
the Quarrel, with the Stock of the Musket, and that be- 
fore the otlier two could come to help him, and then lee* 
ing the reft come at them, they flood together, and pre- 
fenting the other Ends of their Pieces to tnem, bad them 
iland off. 

The other had Fit e- Arms with them too, but one of 
the two honeft Men, I older than his Comrade, and made 



( 41 ) . 

defpcrate by his Danger, told tliem, if tliev offer^'d to 
move Hand or Foot they were dead Mai, ooidly com- 
manded them to lay down their Arms. They did not 
indeed lay down their Arms, but feeing him refblute, it 
brought them to a Parley, and they conienfed to take their 
wounded Man with them, and he gone j and indeed itfeems 
the Fellow was wounded fufficicntly with the Blowj 
however, they weie much in the wrong, iince they had 
the Ad /antage, that they didnotdifaim them effedtually, as 
they might have dore, and have" gone immediately to the 
Spani/iKds, and given them an Account hov/ the Rogues had 
treated them j for the three Villains ftudied nothing but 
Revenge, and every Day gave them Ibme intimation that 
they did ib, 

But not to crow'd this Part with an Account of the 
leflcr Part of their Roguries, fuch as treading down their 
Corn, fliooting three young Kids, and a She-Goat, which 
the poor Men had got to breed up Tame for their Store j 
and, in a Word, plaguing them Night and Day in this 
Manner, it forceti the two Men to fuch a Delperation, that 
they reCoh'd to tight them all three the firft Time they 
had a fair Opportunity i in order to this they refolv*d 
to go to the Callle, as they called it, that was my old 
Dwelling whiare the three Rogues and the Sfaniards all 
liv*d together, at that Time 5 intending to have a fair Bat- 
tle, ^ndxh.cSpaniardsd^.ould fland by to fee fair Play 5. fb they 
got up in the Morning before Day, and came to the Place, 
and call'd the Engliflymen by their Names, telling a Sfani" 
-^rf/ that anlwer'd, that they wanted to fpeak with them. 

It happened that the Day before two Of the Spaniards • 
having been in the Woods, had feen one of the two Eng- 
UJhmen, who, for Diftin6tion, I call the Honeft Men-, and 
he had made a fad Compkint to the Spmiards, of the 
barbarous Ulage they had met with from their three Country- 
men, and how they had ruin'd their Plantation, and dell:roy*d 
their Corn, that they had laboured £0 hard to bring for- 
ward, and kiWd the Miltch-Goat, and their three Kids, 
which was all they had provided for thdr Suftenance, and 
that if he and his Friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not 
aflfift them again, they fhould be f&rved. When the Spa-- 
niards Qzmt; Home at Night, and they were all at Supper, > 
he took the Freedom to reprove the three En^Hfrmm^ tho* 

n 



( 40 1 

in gentle and mannerly Terms, and ask*d them, Ho^ they 
could be £o cruel, they being harmlefs inoffeniive Fellows, 
md that they were putting themfelves in a Way to iLibliil: 
by their Labour, and that it had coft them a great deal oF 
Pains to bring Things to fuch a Perfe<ftion as they had ? 

O N E of the EngUJhmen return'd very briskly, what h?A 
they to do there? That they came on Shoje wirJiout 
Leave, and they fhould not Plant or Build upon the Jlland, 
it was none of their Ground. Why, fays die Sp^fiiarJ 
very calmly, Seignior Ingleie, they muji not fiarve ? The 
'Engl'ifl^mm reply d like a true rough-hewn Tarpaulin, they 
might fiarve and be damn'd, they fliouid not Plant nor 
Build in that Place. But what mufl they do then, Seig- 
Bor, fays the Spanmrd i Another of the Brutes return'^d, 
do ! D--^-m 'em, they fhould be Servants and work for 
them. But how can you expe<9: that of them, they are 
not bought with your Money j you have no Right to 
make them Servants ? The Englijhmen anfwer'd, the^Ifland 
Was theirs, the Governour had given it to them, and no 
Man had anv thing to do there but themfelves j and with 
that fwore oy his Maker, that they would go and burn 
dl their new Hutsi they fliould build none upon their 
Land, 

W H Y, Sei^ior, fays the Spaniard, by the fame Rule 
"we mufi be your Servants too? Ay, fays the bold Dog, 
and £o you fhall too, before we have done with you, mix- 
ing two or three G— d Damme s in the proper Intervals of 
his Speech i the Spaniard only fmild at that, and made him 
noAnfwer: However, this little Difcourfe had heated them, 
and flatting up, one fays to the other, I think it was he 
they call d Will, Atkins, Conie Jack, let us go and have the 
t'other Brufli with themj \vell demolifli their Caflle, 
111 warrant you 5 they fliall plant no Colony in out Domi- 
nions. 
. Upon this, they went all Trooping away, with every 
Man a Gun, a Pifloi, and a Sword, and mutter 'd fbme in- 
folent Things among themfelves, of what they would do 
to the Spaniards too, when Opportunity offer d j but the 
Spaniards, it feems, did not £0 perte<9:ly underfland them, 
as to ;know all the Particulars, only, that in general, they 
threatncd them h^d for taking the two JEngUjhmms Part. 

Whethei. 



( 45 ) 

"Whether tliey went, or how they beflow'd their 
Time that Evening, the Spaniards {kid, they did not know j 
but it feems they wander 'd about the Country, pait of the 
Night, and then hing down in the Place which / uied to 
call my Bower, they were weary, and ovcr-flcpt tliem^ 
Iclves. The Cafe was thir,, they had rcfol'/'d to i!ay till 
Mid-night, and {b to take the poor Men when tiiey v/ere 
afleep, and as they acknowledged it afterwards, intended 
to fct Fire to their Huts while they were in tlicm, and ei- 
ther burn them in them, or murder them as they came 
out : and as Malice £*ldom Heeps very found, it was veiy 
iliangc they fliculd not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two Men had aifb a Defigii upon 
them, as I have iaid, tho' a much fairer one than that of 
Burning; and Murdering, it happen d, and very luckily for 
them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before the 
bloody-minded Rogues came to their Huts. 

When they came there and found the Men gone, At* 
kins, who it leems was the forwardell Man, cairdt)ut to 
his Comrades, ha' yack, here's the Neft, but, D-— n 'em, 
the Birds aie flown : They muled a while to think what 
ftould be the Occaiion of their being gone abroad ib foon, 
and fuggcfted presently that the Sfama^ris had given them 
Notice of it, and with that they fnook Hands, and fworc 
to one another that they would be reveng'd of the Sfani* 
firds. As fbon as they had made this bloody Bargain, they 
fell to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they did not 
fct Fire indeed to any Thing, but they puU'd down both 
their Houfes, and pulld them fb Limb from Limb, that 
they left not the leaft Stick (landing, or fcarce any Sign on 
the Ground where they flood j they tore all their little col- 
ledled Houfliold Smff in pieces, and threw every thing a- 
bout in fuch a Manner, that the poor Men found afterward s 
ibine of their Things a Mile off from their Habitation. 

When they hacf done this, they pulld up all the young 
Trees which the poor Men had planted j pulld up the En- 
clofiirethey had made to fecure then* X^ttle and their Corn; 
and, in a Word, fack'd and plundered every thing, as com- 
pleatly as a Hoard of Tartars would have done. 

The two Men were at this Jundure gone to find them 
out, and had refolv'd to fight them where-ever they had 
been, tho* they were but two to three: So that had they 

met. 



(44) 

met, thcie certainly would have been Blood "flicd among 
them, tor they weie all very ftout icfolute Fellows, to give 
them their due. 

But Providence took more Ca'e to keep them afiinder, 
then they them Ic Ives could do to meet j for, as if they had 
dcgg'd one another, when the three were gone thither, 
the two were hete^ and aftei wards when the two went 
back to find them, the thiee wee come to the old Habi* 
tation again i -we flail lee their difreriiig Condu6l piefcnrly. 
V/hen the three came back, like furious Creatures, fiufh d 
with the Rage which the Work they had been about put 
them into, they came up to the* Sparmrasy and told thciTi 
what they had done, by way of Scoff and Bravado ; and 
one of them fiepping up to one of the Spamardsy as if they 
had letn a couple of Boys at play, takes hold of his Hat, as 
it was upon his Head, and giving it a Twirl about, fleer- 
in his Face, lays he to him, AndyoUi Seignior, Jack Spani- 
ard, fhall have the fame Sauce y if you do not ?mnd your Man- 
ners: the Spaniard, who tho' a quiet civil Man, was as 
brave, as a Man could be delired to be, and withal a ftrong 
well-m.ade Man, look d fteadily at him for a good while, 
and then, having no Weapon in his Hand, ftept gravely up 
to him, and with one Blov/ of his Fiftknock'd him down, 
as an Ox is fell d with a Pole-Ax j at which one of the 
Rogues, infolent at the firft, fir'd his Piflol at the Spaniard 
immediately i he mifs'd his Body indeed, for the Bullets 
went thro* his Hair, but one of them touch d the tip of his 
Ear, and he bled pietty muck ' The Bbod made the Spa- 
niard believe, he was more hurt than he really was, and 
that put him into ibme Heat, for before, he aAed all in a 
perfect Calm i hit now reiblving to go thro' his with Work, 
he ftoop'd and tooktheFellow's Musket whom Itehad knock "d 
down, and was juft going to fhoot the Man who had fird 
at him, when the reft of the Spaniards being in the Cave 
come out, and calling to him not to flioot, they ftept in, 
iecur'd the other two, and took their Arms from them. 

When they we e thus difmarm'd, and found they had 
made all tbe Spaniards thdt Enemies, as well as their own 
Countrymen, they began to cool, and giving the Spaniards 
better Wdrds, would have had their Arms again j but the 
Spaniards ccHiiidering the Feud that was between them and the 
other two Englifhmm, and xhxt it wouW be the beft Method 

they 



( 45 ) 

they could take, to keep them from one another, told them 
they would do them no harm, and if they would Uvq 
[■jeaccably, they would be very willing to alTifl and ibciate 



with them, as they did before, but that they could not 
think of giving them their Arms again, wliile they appear 'd 
fo refblvd to do MilcJiief with them to their own Country- 
men, and had even threatned them ail, to make them their 
Servants. 

The Rogues were now more capable to hear Reaibn, 
than to a6l: Reafbn, but being reflisd their Aims, they went 
raving away, and raging Hkc Madmen, threatning what 
they would do, tho' they had no Fire-Ai ms : But the Spa- 
niards defpiiing thek Threatning, told them they fiiculd 
take care how they ofter'd any Injury to their Plantation 
or Cattle, for if they di J, they would {hoot them as they 
would do ravenous Beads, where-evcr they found them j 
and if they Ml into their Hands alive, they fliould certainly 
be hang d. However, this was far from cooling them } 
but away they went raging and fwearingUke Furies of Hell. 
As foon as they were gone, came back the two Men in 
PalTion and Rage enough alio, tho' of another kind^ for 
having been at their Plantation, and finding it all demoiifh'd 
and defboyd, as above, it will eafily be liipposd they had 
Provocation enough ; they could fcarce have room to tell 
their Tale, the Sfm'mrds were £o eager to tell them theirs ? 
and it was flrange enough to find that Three Men fhould 
thus bully Nineteen, and receive no Punifhment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and elpecially hav- 
ing thus difarm'd them, made light of all their Threat- 
nings 5 but the two EngUJJjmen relolv'd to have their Re- 
medy again il them., what Pains fbever it coH to find them 
out. 

But the Spaniards interpos'd here too, and told them, 
that as they were already difarm'd, they could not confent 
that they (the Two) fhould purfue them with Fire- Arms, 
• and perliaps kill thenij but, &id the grave Spaniard, who 
was their Governour, we will endeavour to make them do 
you Juflice, if you will leave it to us,* for as there is no 
doubt but they will come to us again when their Paffion 
is over, being not able to fublifl without our Affiftancej 
we promiic you to make no Peace with them, without 
having a full Satisfadlion for you j and upon this Condi- 

XlQXX 



C40 

tion we hope you will prcmiie, to ufe no Violence with 
them, other than in your own Defence. 

The two Englijhmen yielded to this very awkardly, and 
with great Rclu<3:ance, but the Sfaniards protefted, they 
did it only to keep them from blood fhed, and to make all 
cafy at iaft 5 fe> ^^^^ they, we are not fo many of us, here 
is Room enough for us all, and it is great Pity we fhould 
not be all good Friends j at length they did conient, and 
Waited for the Iffue of the Thing, living for fbme Days 
with the Sfmtards, for their own Habitation was dev 
ftroyed. 

I N about five Days Time the th; ee Vagrants, tir'd with 
wandring, and almoft flavy'd with Hunger, having chiefly 
liv'd on Turtles Eggs all that while, came back to the 
Grove; and finding my Sf^niara, who, as I have frndy 
was ths. Governour, and two more wirh him walking by 
the Side of the Creek ; they came up in a very fubmilTive 
humble Manner, and begg'd to be receiv'd again into the 
Family. The Sfarmrds ufcd them civilly^ but told them, 
they had a<5>tcd 10 unnaturally by their Countrymen, and fb 
very grofsly by them ( the Spaniards ) that they could 
not come to anv Conclufion, without confulting the two 
l£.nglijhment and the reft j but however, they would go to 
them and difcourfe about it, and they fliould know in half 
an Hour. It may be guefs'dj that they were very hard 
put to it, for it feems, as they were to wait this halt Hour 
For an Anfwer, they begg'd he would iend them out fbme 
Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and ieht them at 
the fame Time a large Piece of Goat's Flefli, and a bolFd 
Parrot, which they eat very heartily, for they v/ere hungry 
enough. 

After half an Hour's Confultation they were call'd in, 
and a long Debate had about them, their two Countrymen 
charging them with the Rum of all their Labour, and A 
Defign to murther them j all which they own*d before, 
and therefore could not deny now 5 upon the whole, the > 
Spaniards aded the Moderators between them, and as they 
had oblig'd the two Englijljmen not to hurt the three while 
they were naked and unarmed, fo they now obliged the 
three to go gaid rebuild their Fellows two Huts, one to be 
of the fame pimeniions, and the other larger than they 
were before i alio to fence their Ground again, where 

they 



C 47 ) 

they had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees in the Ropm 
of thole pull'd up, dig up the Land again for planting 
Corn,, where they had fpoil'd it; and in a Word, to re^ 
ftore every Thing in the fame State as they found it, as 
near as they could, for entirely it could not be, the Seaibn 
for the Corn, and the Groi^th of the Trees and Hedges,, 
not being polTible to be ]"ccove.\L 

Well, they fubmitttd to lui diis; and as they had 
Plenty of Piovifors given them all the while, they grew 
very orderly, and ch: whole Society began to live pleaiant- 
[y, and agreeably together again ; only that theie three Fel- 
lows could never be pe.fuaded to work j I mean not for 
themfelves, except now and then a little, juft as they plea- 
fed 3 hov/ever, tlie Sp^tn'mrds told them plainly, that if they 
would but live fociably and friendly togetherj and ftudy in 
the whole the Good of the Plantation,* they would be con- 
tent to work for them, and let them walk about and be 
as idje as they pleas'd; and thus having iiv'd pretty well 
together for a Month or two, the SfMnmrds gave them 
Arms again, and gave them Liberty to go abroad with 
them as before. 

It was not above a Week after they had thefe Arms, 
and went abroad, but the ungrateful Creatures began to 
be as infolent and troublefbme as before 5 but however, 
an Accident happening prelently upon this, which endan- 
gered the Safety of them all, they were oblig'd to lay by 
all private Reiientments, and look to the Prefervation of 
their Lives. 

I T happened one Night, that the Spariard Governnour, 
as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard whoCe Life I had 
iav'd, who was now the Captain, or Leader, or Govern-* 
nQur of the reil, found himtelf very uneafy in the Night, 
and could by no Means get any Sleep : He was perfeSrly 
well in Body, as he told m^ the Story^ only found his 
Thoughts tumultuous 5 his Mind run upon Men fighting* 
and killing one another, but was broad awake, and 
and could not by any Means get any Sleep > in fhort, he 
lay a great while, but growing more and more uneafy, he 
refblv'd to rife; As they lay, (Beingfb many of them, upon 
Goat^skins, laid thick upon fuch Couches, and Fads, as they 
made for themfelves j and not in Hammocks and Ship- 
Beds, gs I did, who was but one, fo they had iittle to d% 

wktt 



( 48 ) 

whti they were willing to riie, but to get up upon their 
Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, fuch as it was, and tlaeir 
Pumps, and they were ready for going any Way that their 
Thoughts guided them. 

Being thus gotten up, he looked out, but being dark, 
he could fee little or nothing, and belides, the Trees which 
I had planted, as in my former Account is deicribed, and 
which v/ere now grown tall, intercepted his Sight, {bthat 
he could only look up, and fee that it wt*s a clear Star- 
light Night, and hearing no Noiie, he returned and laid 
him down again ; but it was all one, he could not fleep, 
nor could he compofe himlclf to any thing like Reft, but 
his Thoughts weve to the laft Degree uneafy, and yet he 
knew not for what. 

Having made fbme Noiie with rifmg and walking 
about, going out and coming in, another of them wak'd, 
and calling, ask'd. Who it was that was up ^ The Goveinour 
told him, how it had been with him : Say you ib, fays, 
the other Spaniard, fuch Things arc not to be flighted, I 
allUre you f there is certainly fome Mifchief working, f^ys 
he, near us, and prefently he asked him, where are the 
Englijhtnen? They are all in their Huts, fays he, fafe enough. 
It fcems, the SMniards had kept PoiTeflion of the main 
Apartment, and had made a Place, where the three Eng- 
lUhmen, lince their laft Mutiny, always quartered by them- 
ielve^y and coxM not come at the refl. Well, £^y& the Sfa^ 
n'mrdi there is fbmething in it, I am perfuaded from my 
own Experience i I am Btisfy'd our Spirits embodied have 
a Converfe with, and receive Intelligence from, the Spi- 
rits unem bodied, and inhabiting the invifible World, and 
this friendly Notice h given for our Advantage, it we know 
how to make ufe of it. Come, fays he, let us go out miA 
look abroad, and i^ we fiid nothing at all in it to iuftify 
the Trouble, V\\ tell you a Story to the Purpofe, that lliail 
convince you of the Juftice of my propofmg it. 

Ins Word, they went out to go to the Top of the i 
Hill, where I u^ to go, but they being flrong and in 
good Company, not alone, as I was, usd none of my 
Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then "pulling it 
up after them, to go up a fecond Stage to the Top, but 
were going round through the Grove unconcerned and un- 
wary, when they were iurprii'd with feeing a Light, as 

of 



<A9) 

•of Fire a very little Way off from them, and hearing ths 
Voices of Men, not of one, or two, but of a great Num- 
ber. 

I N all the Difcoveries I had made of the Savages land- 
ing on the Ifland, it was my conflant Care to prevent 
them making the leaft Difcovery of there being any Inha- 
bitant upon the Place -, and when by any Neceifity they 
came to know it, they felt it £o effectually, that they that 
got away, were fcarce able to give any Account of it j 
for we difappear'd as ibon as poffible, nor did ever any 
that had feen me, efcape to tell any one tKc, except it was 
the three Savages in our laft Encounter, who jumped into 
the Boat, of whom I mentioned, that I was afraid they 
(liould go Home and bring more Help. 

Whether it was the Coniequence of the Eicape of 
thofe Men, that £o great a Number came now together j 
or whether they came ignorantly and by -Accident on their 
ufual bloody Errand, the Spaniards could not it feems un- 
derhand ,' but whatever it was, it had been their Buiinefs, 
either to have conceal'd themfelves, aijd not to have feen 
them at all j much Icis to have let the Savages have feen 
that there were any Inhabitants in the Place : But to have 
fallen upon them fo effedrually, as that not a Man of them 
ihould have efcap'd, which could only have been by get- 
ting in between them and their Boats j but this Pi elencc 
of Mind was wanting to them, which was the Ruin of 
their Tranquility for a great while. ^ 

W E need not doubt, but that the Governour and the 
Man with him, furpriz-'d with this Sight, ran back im- 
mediately, and rais'd their Fellows, givingthem an Account 
of the imminent Danger they were all in-, and they again 
as readily took the Alarm, but it was impofllble to per- 
iuade them to flay dole within where they were, but that 
they muff run all out to fee how Things flood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, 
• and they had Opportunity enough for fbmc Hours to view 
them by the Light of three Fires they had made at feme 
Diflance from one another, what they were doing they 
knew not, and what to do themfelves they knew noti 
for, firfl, the Enemy were too many j and iecondly, they 
did not keep together, but were divided into fevciai Par- 
ties, and were on Shore in feveral Places. 

C The 



( 50 X 

The Spaniards were in no fmall Conllemation at this 
Sight i and as they found that the Fellows ran ftragglin^ 
all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, but firft or laft, 
Ibnie of them would chop in upon their Habitation, or 
upon ibme other Place, where they would iee the Tokens 
of inhabitants, and they were in great Perplexity alio for 
tear of their Flock of Goats, which would have been lit- 
tle lefs tlian ftarving them, if they fhould have been de- 
flroy d j fo the firft Thing they reiolv'd upon, was to diiP 
patch three Men away before it was light, viz, two Spa- 
niards and one Engli/hman, to drive all the Goats away to 
the great Valley where the Cave was, and if Need were, 
to diive them into the very Cave it felf. 

Could they have feen the Savages altogether in one 
■ Body, and at any Diftance from their Canoes, they refolv'd, 
if they had been an hundred of them, to have attacked 
them i but that could not be obtain 'd, for they were fbme 
of them two Miles off from the other, and, as it appeared 
afterwards, were of two different Nations. 

After having mufed a great while on the Courle 
they Ihould take, and beaten their Brains in confidering 
their preient Circumftances j they refolv'd at laft, while it 
was dark, to fend the old Savage, (Fridays Father) out, as 
a Spy, to learn if poftible, ibmething concerning them, as 
what they came for, and what they intended to do, and 
the like ; the old Man readily undertook it, and ftxipping 
him felf quke naked, as moft of the Savages were, away 
he went : After he had been gone an Hour or two, he 
brings Word, that he had beeti among them undifcover'd, 
that he found they v^^ere two Parties, and of two feveral 
Nations who had War with One another, and had Lid 
a great Battle in their own Country, and tJiat both 
Sides having had feveral Prifoners taken in the Fight, they 
were by meet Chance landed all in the iame Ifland, for the 
devouring their Prifoners, and making merry j but their 
conrlr.g lb by Chance to the fame Place had fpoifd all their .; 
Mirthj that they vv^erein a g eat Rage atone another, and 
that (o nciir, timt he leiicv'd they would fight again, 
as foon as Day-light began to appear i but he did not per- 
ceive that they had any Notion of any body's b^eing on the 
liland but themfelves. Me, liad hardly made an End of tel- 
ling His Story, when they could perceive, by the unufual 

Nolle 



Noife they made, that the two littfe Armies were engag'd 
in a bloody Fight. 

Friday's Father uled all the Arguments he could to per- 
iiiade our People to lie cloie, and not be feenj he told them 
thmr Safety conlifted in it, and that they had nothing to 
do but to lie ftill, and the Savages would kill one another 
to their Hands, and the refl would go away 5 and it was 
fb to a Tittle. But it was invpoflfible to prevail, eipecialiy 
upon the EngUJhmen'y their Curiofity was £0 importunate 
upon their Prudentials, that they muft run out and fee the 
Battle: However, they ufed fbme Caution too, (vix.,) 
they did not go openly, juft by their own Dwelling, but 
went farther into the Woods, and plac'd themielves to Ad- 
vantage, where they might fecurely fee them manage the 
Fight, and, as they thought, not be feen by them i but it 
fcems the Savages did lee them, as we fliall find here- 
after. 

The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the 
B?igli/hmen, one of them iaid, he could perceive, thatfome 
of them were Men of great Bravery, of invincible Spirits* 
and of great Policy in guiding the Fight. The Battle, 
they faid, held two Hours, before they could guefs which 
Party would be beaten j but then that Party which was 
neareft our People's Habitation began to appear weakefl, and 
after fome Time more, fome of them oegan to fly ; and 
this put our Men again into a great Confternation, left any 
of tliofe that fled fliouldrun into the Grove, before their 
Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby involuntarily difcover 
the Place,- and that by Confequence the Purfuers ihould do 
the like in Search for them. Upon this they refblv'd that 
they would iland arm'd within the Wall, and whoever came 
into the Grove, they fhould ially out over the Wall and 
kill them i fo that, if pofiQble, not one fhould return to 
give an Account of it 5 they ordered alfb, that it fliould be 
^ done with their Swords, or by knocking them down with 
the Stock of tlie Musket, but not by Ihooting them, for 
fear of raifmg an Alerm by the Noifc. 

A s they expeded, it Ml out,- three of the routed Army 

fled for Life, and, crofTmg the Creek, ran dhc&y into 

the Place, not in the leaft knowing whether they went, 

but running as into a thick Wood for Shelter j tlie Scout 

C 2 they 



( y^ ) 

they kept to look Abroad, gave Notice of this within, 
with this Addition, to our Mens great Satisfa6lion, (viz.) 
That the Conquerors had not purfued them, or ieen which 
Way they were gone 5 upon this, the Spaniard Goveinour, 
a Man of Humanity, would not fliffer them to kill the 
three Fugitives, but fending three Men out by the Top of 
the Hill, order'd them to go round and come in behind 
them, Air prife and take 'em Prisoners, which was done j the 
Refidue of the conquered People fled to their Canoes and 
got off to Sea j the Vi6lors retir'd, and made no Purfuit, 
or very Httie, but drawing themfelves into a Botly toge- 
ther, gave two great skreaming Shouts, which they fup- 
pos'd was by Way of Triumph, and ib the Fight ended : 
And the iame Day, about three a Clock in the Afternoon, 
they alfb marched to their Canoes. And thus the Spani- 
ards had their Ifland again free to themfelves, their Fright 
was over, and they faw no Savages in feveral Years 
after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of 
their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they found 
about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot ^ fome 
were kill'd with great long Arrows, ibme of which were 
found flicking in their Bodies 5 but moft of them were 
kill'd with their great wooden Swords, iixteen or feven- 
teen ot which they found in the Field of Battle, and as 
many Bows, with a great many Arrows : Thefe Swords 
were fliange great unweildy Things, and they mufl: be 
very ftrong Men that ufed them : Moft of thofe Men that 
were kill'ct with them, had their Heads mafli*d to pieces, 
as we may fay, or, as we call it in Englijh, their Brains 
knocked out, and feveral their Arms and Legs broken 5 
fo that 'tis cvMent they fight with inexprefTible Rage and 
Fury : They found not one wounded Man that was not 
ftone-dead j for either they flay by their Enemy till they 
have quite kiU'd him, or they carry all the wounded Men, 
that aie not qutedead, away with them. 

This Deliverance tam'd our EngUJljtnen for a great 
while ; the Sight had filled them with Horror, and the 
Confequences appear'd terrible to the laft Degree, efpeci- 
ally upon fuppoling that ibme Time or other they iliould 
fall into the Hands of thoie Creatures, who would not on • 
ly kill them as Enemies, but kill them for Food, as we 

kill 



( 53 ) 

kill our Cattle. And they profefs'd to me, that the 
Thoughts of being eaten up like Beef or Mutton, though 
it was flippos'd it wsls not to be, till they "were dead, had 
fbmething in it {o horrible, that it naufcated their very 

^Stomachs, made them lick when they thought of it, and 
fill'd their Minds with flich unuflial Terror, that they were 
not themfelves for fome Weeks after. 

This, as I fald, tamd even the three Englijh Brutes, I 
have been fpeaking of j and for a great while after, they 
were very tra6lable, and went about the common Buii- 
nefs of the whole Society well enough : planted, fo^vd, 
reapd, and began to be all naturaliz-d to the Country; 
But fbmetime after this, they fell all into flich limple 
Meafures again as brought them into a great deal o£ 
Trouble. 

They had taken three Prifbners, as I had obferv.d, and 
thefe three being lufty ftout young Fellows, they made 
them Servants, and taught them to work for them i and, 
as Slaves, they did weU enough ; but they did not take 
their Measures with them, as I did by my Man FriaaVy, 
'viz,, to begin with them upon the Principle of having fa- 
ved their Lives, and then inftru£t them in the ratior al 
Principles of Life, much kfs of Religion, civilizing sud, 
reducing them by kind Ufage and affe<ftionate Arguirgsj 
but as they gave them their Food every Day, fo they >riv'e. 
them their Work too, and kept them fully employ i in 
Drudgery enough j but they fail'd in this, by it, that they 
never had them to alTift them and fight for them, as I had 
my Man Friday, who was as true to me as the very Fleil^ 
tipon my Bones. 

But to come to the Family Part, being all now good 
Friends 5 for common Danger, as I 4id above, had effe£lu- 
ally reconcil d them, they began to confider their general 
Circumftances ,• and the firft Thing that came under their 
Conlideration was. Whether, ieeing the Savages p;irticularly 

^ haunted that Side of the Ifland, and that there v/ere more 
remote and retir'd Parts of it equally adapted to their Way 
of Living, and manifeftly to their Advantage, they ihould 
not rather remove their Habitation, and plant in fbme more 
proper Place for their Safety, and efpeciallj for the Secu- 
rity of their Cattle and Com ? 

C 3 Upon 



(54) 

Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded. That 
they would not remove their Habitation 5 becauie that {bme 
Time or other, they thought they might hear from their 
Governour again, meaning me; and if I fhould lendanyone 
to Seek them, I IhouM be fure to dired them to that Side, 
where if they fliould find the Place demoiiih'd, they would 
conclude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were gone,, 
and fo our Supply would go away too. 

But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to remove 
them into the Valley where my Cave was, where the 
Land was as proper to both, and where indeed there was 
Land enough : However, upon iecond Thoughts, they 
altered one Part of their Refolution too, and refolv'd 
only to remove Part of their Cattle thither, and plant 
Part of their Corn there 5 and fo if one Part was deili oy 'd 
the other might be iav'd : And one Part of Prudence they 
ufcd, which it was very well they did, viz. That they 
never trufted thefe three Savages, which they had taken 
PriibnerS;, with knowing any Thing of the Plantation they 
had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they had there 5 
much lefs of the Cave there, which they kept in Cafe of 
Keceflity, as a fafe Retreat, and thither they carried alfb 
the two Barrels of Powder, which I had fent them at 
my coming away. 

b V T however they refolv'd not to change their Habi- 
tatii'Hi,fyet they agreed, that as I had carefully cover'd it firfl 
with a Wall or Fortification, and then with a Grove of 
Treesj fb, ieeing their Safety confifted entirely in their be- 
ing conceal'd, of which they were now fully cpnvinc'd j they 
fet to v/ork to cover and conceal the Pkce yet more ef- 
feduali'y than before: To this Purjpoie, as I had planted 
Trees, (or rather thruH in Stakes, which in Time aU grew 
up to lie Trees) for feme good Diilance before the En^ 
trance into my Apartment, they went on in the fame Man- 
ner, and fiird up the reil of that whole Space of Ground,, 
from the Trees I had fet, quite down to the Side of the 
Creek, where, as I faid, I landed my Floats, and even in- " 
to the very Ouze where the Tide flowed, not fb much as 
feaving any Place to land, or any Sign that there had b^n 
any landing thereabout: Thele Stakes alfo, being of a Wood 
very forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took 
Care to have generally very much larger and taller than 

tllQfe 



(55 ) 

thofe which I had planted, and placed them £o very thick 
and clofe that when they had been three or four Years 
grown, there was no picrcmg with the Eye any conlide- 
rable Way into the Plantation : As for that Part which 
Ihad planted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man's 
Thigh j and among them they placed fo many other fhort 
ones, and £o thick, that, in a Word, it flood like a Pallifa- 
do, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it was next to irnpof- 
fible to penetrate it, but with a little Army to cut it all 
down; for a little Dog could hardly get bet ween the Trees, 
they flood ib clofe. 

But this was not all ? for they did the fame by all the 
Ground to the right Hand, and to the Left, and round e- 
ven to the Top of the Hill; leaving no Way, not fo much 
as for themfelves to come out, but by the Ladder placed 
up to the Side of the Hill, and then lifted up, and placed 
again fiom the firfl Stage up to the Top j which Ladder, 
when it was taken down, nothing but what had Wings 
or Witchcraft to afTifl it, could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived : Nor was it kis 
than what they afterwards found Occafion fotj which 
ferv'd to convince me, that as human Prudence has Au- 
thority of Providence to juflify it, fo it has, doubtleis, the 
Diredlion of Providence to fet it to Work j and would we 
liHen carefully to the Voice of it, I am fully perfiiaded wc 
might prevent many of the Difaflers which our Lives are 
now, by our own Neligence, flibjedcd to. But tliis by 
the Way. 

I return to the Story. They liv'd two Years after this 
in perfe6l Retirement, and had no more Vifits from the 
Savages: They had, indeed, an Alarm given them one 
Morning which put them into a great Conllernation -, for 
fome of the Spaniards being out early one Morning on the 
Wefl Side, or rather End of the Ifland , which by the Way, was 
that End where I never went, for fear of liing diicover'd, 
they were furpriz'd with feeing above twenty Canoes of 
Indians, jufl coming on Shore. 

They made the befl of their Wa;^ Home, in Hurry 
enough, and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, they 
kept clofe all that Day and the next, going out only at 
Night, to make Obiervation: But they had the good Luck 



to be mill aken j for, where-ever the Sava^s went, they 
did not Land at that Time on the Ifland, but purfued 
ibme other Dcfign. 

A N D now they had another Broil with the three I^ng-^ 
UJIjmen -, one of which, a niofl turbulent Fellow, being irt 
a Rage atone of the three Slaves, which I mentioned they 
had taken, beeaule the Fellow had not done fbmething right 
which he bid them do, and feem'd a little untraceable in hil 
ihowing him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog-Belt, in which 
he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage, not 
to corre£i: him, but to kill him, One of the Spaniards, 
who was by, feeing him give the Fellow a barbarous Cut 
with the Hatchet, which he am*d at his Head but ftruck 
into his Shoulder, £q that he thought he had cut the poor 
Creature's Arm off, ran to him, and Entreating him not 
to Murder the poor Man, clajpt in between him and the 
Savage, to prevent the Michief._ 

The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, flruck at 
the Sfanittrd with his Hatchet, and fwore he would iervc 
him as he intended to ierve the Savage j which the SfH' 
nmrd perceiving, avoided the Blow, and with a Shovel 
which he had in his Hand, (for they were working in 
the Field about their Corn-Land) knocked the Brute down : 
Another of the EngUJIjmen running at thje fame Time to 
help his Comrode, knock'd th& Spaniard down ; and then 
two Sjmiards more came to help their Man, and a 
third E77gli(hman feD upon them. They had none of thera 
any Fire- Arms, or any other Weapons but Hatchets and 
other Tools, except this third Engtijhman j he had one of 
my old ruily Cutlaihes, with which he made at the laft Spani-^ 
Ards, and wounded them both : This Fray fet the whole 
Family in an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they 
took the three EngUJhmen Prilbners. The next Queftion 
was, What ihould be done with them ? they had been fo 
often mutinous, and were £o furious, ib defperate, and ib 
idle whithal, that they knew not what Courie to take 
VTitlx them 'y for they were mifchievous to the heigheft 
Pegiee, and valued not what Hurt they did any Man j 
£o that, in fhort, it was not fafe to Vivt with them. 

The Spaniard, who was Governour, told them in fo 
many Words, That if they had been his own Country he 
,Would have lang'd them. all. j for all Laws and all Gover- 

gours 



( n ) 

aours were to prelerve Society 5 and thoie who were dan- 
gerous to the Society, ought to be expell'd out of it > but 
as they were Engl/Jhmen, and that it was to the generous 
Kindnefs of an Englijhman thzt they all ow^d their Pre* 
fervation and Deliverance, he would ufe them with all poi- 
iible Lenity, and would leave them to the Judgment of 
the other two BngUJhmen, who were their Countrymen. 

One of the two honeil Englijhmen ftood up, and faid, 
they deiir'd it might not be left to them j for, fays he, I 
am fure we ought to Sentence them to the Gallows ,• and 
with that gives an Account how William Atkins^ one of 
the three, had propofed to have all the ^^c Engllfljmen 
join together, and Murther all the ^^/JWMr^/xwhen they were 
in their Sleep. 

When the Sfanijh Governour heard this, he calls toW/lL 
Ackinsy How, Seignior Atkins, lays he, would you Mur- 
ther us all ? What have you to fay to that ? That hardened 
Villian was £0 far from denying- it, that he laid it was 
true, and G~d d-mn him they would doit flil before they 
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins^ fays 
the Spaniard, What have we done to you, that you will 
kill us ? And what would you get by killing us ? And 
what mufl we do to prevent your killing us ? Mufl we 
kill you, or you will kill us ? Why will you put us to the 
Neceffity of this, Seignior Afkins f fays the Spaniard very 
calmly, and fmiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a Rage at the Spant- 
ard's making a Jeft of it, that had he not been held by 
three Men, and withal had no Weapons with him, it was 
thought he would have attempted to have kili'd the Spa* 
niard in the middle of all the Company. 

This hair-brain'd Carriage obliged them to conlider 
lerioufly what was to be done. The two Englijhmm and 
the Spaniard who fav'd the poor Savage, was of the 0~ 
pinion, that they ihould hang one of the three for an Ex- 
ample to the reft, ami that, Particularly, itfhould be he that 
had twice attempted to commit Murder with his Hatchet j 
and indeed there was fbme Realbn to believe he had done 
it, for the poor Savage was in fuch a miierable Conditi- 
on with the Wound he had received, that it was thought 
Jfe. could not live. 



B V! T the Governour Spaniard flill Md No, it was an 
MngUJhman that had fiv'd ail their Lives, and he would 
never Confent to put an Engli/hm^nito Death, the' he had 
muither'd half of them j nay , he faid, if he had been kilFd 
himfeif bj an Englifhman, mid had Time left to Speak, it 
Ihould be, that thzj fiiould pardon him. 

This was ib politively infifted on by the Governour 
Sfamard, that there was no gainfaying it ? and as merci- 
ful Councils are moft apt to prevail where they are £0 
carnellly pre:&*d> £0 they all came into it -, but then it was to 
fee Gonnder*d, whatfhouidbe done to keep them from doing 
the Mifchief they Jeiign'di for all agreed, Governour and aU, 
thsO: Means were to be ufed for preierving the Society 
&om Dan^rj after a long Debate it was agreed, Firft,. 
That they iiould be difarm'd, and not permitted to have 
dtiffir Gun». or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any Wea- 
foir» andt &0uM be turn'd out of the Society, and left to 
Ivc where they would, and Iwjw they would hj them- 
&€S^ but that none of the refl, either Sprniards or Mg- 
J^ ffiotiM eonvcrfe with them, ipeak with them, or have 
mf TMag to dJo with them 5. that they fliould be forbid' 
to- come -within a certain Diftance of the Place where the 
fdl dwelt j and that if they offered to commit any Difbr- 
Jsr, fb as to ipoil^ burn, kill, or deflroy any of the Corn,. 
Fikatmgy,. BuiBings,.Fmces, or Cattle belonging totheSo- 
-ciety, that they fhould die without Mercy, and they fhouE 
fioot them wnere-ever they could find them. 

The Governour, a Man of great Humanity, muling 
©pon tht Sentence, confider'd a httle upon it^ and turning 
to the two honeft 'EngUfhmm iaid. Hold i you muft refled, 
that it wiE be loilg e'er they can raiie Com and Cattle of 
thefr own. and they muft not llarvej We muft therefore 
alfow them Provilions, fb hecaus'd to be added. That they 
ii©uM have a Proportion of Corn given them to laft them 
eight Months, and for %ttA to fbw, by which Time they 
^ight be ilippos'd to raife fome of their own-f that they 
IhoukI have fix Milch-Goats, four He-Goats, and £ai Kids 
given them, as well for preient Subfiftcnce, as for a Store 5 
and that they fhould have Tools given them for their Work 
in the Fields 5 §ick as, fix Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and the 
Ike: But they Ihould have none of thefe Tools or Piovi- 
-ions, mld£ they would i^ear fblemnly , that they would 

not 



mVlmvtof! injune anyof the Sfmkrds with them, or of 
their Fellow Englijhmen, 

Thus they difmifs'd them the Society, and tiirn*d them 
out to fhift for themfelves. They went away fullen and 
refractory, as neither contented to go away, or to ftay ,• 
but, as there was no Remedy, they went, pretending to 
go and chufe a Place where they would fettle them- 
selves to plant and live by themfelves ; and fbme Pro- 
vifions were given them, but no Weapons. 

About four or five Days after, they came again for 
fbme Victuals, and gave the Governour an Account where 
they had pitched their Tents, and marked thcmfelves out 
an Habitation and Plantation , and it was a very conveni- 
ent Place indeed, on the remoteH Part of the Ifland, N. E. 
much about the Place where I providentially landed in my 
firft Voyage, when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord 
alone knows whether, in my foolifh Attempt to iurround 
thelfland. 

Here they built themfelves two handlbme Hu*-s, and 
cpntriv'd them, in a Manner, like my firft Habitation, 
being dole under the Side of a Hiil, having fbme Trees 
growing already on the three Sides of it, fb that by plant- 
ing others, it would be very eafily covered from the Sight, 
xinlefs narrowly fearch'd for j they delir'd fome dry 'd Goats- 
skins for Beds and Covering, which were given them ^ 
and upon giving their Words, that they would notdifturb 
the reft, or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them 
Hatchets, and what other Tools they could fpare; ibme 
Peas, Barley, and Rice, for fbwing, and, in a Word, any 
Thing they wanted, but Arms and Am munition. 

Th.ey liv'dinthis operate Condition about fixMonthsy 
and had gotten in theit firft Harveft, tho' the Quantity Was 
but fmaC the Parcel of Land they had plante3 being hut 
little 3 for indeed, having all their Plantation to form, they 
had a great deal of Work upon their Hands j and when 
they came to make Boards, and Pots, and fuch Thing*;, 
they were quite out of their Element, and could make 
nothing of ity and when the rainy Seafbn came on. For 
want of a Cave in th^ Earth, they could not keep their 
Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of fpoiling : And 
this humbled them muchi Co they came and hcfr^d the 
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily didi and 



5i four Days work'd a great Hole m the Side of tlte- Hllt 
for them, big enough to ifcure their Corn, and other Thing* 
from tlic Ram 3 but it was but a poor Place, atbeft, com- 
par'd to miuci and efpeciallj as mine was then, for the 
$-pxh'iards kxi greatly enlarged it, and made feveral new 
Apa' IT icnts in it., 

A BOUT three Quarters of a Year after this Separati- 
on, a nc'vv Trolkk took the ^e Rogues^ which, together with 
rl'ic forpjer Vji]:^ry they had committed, brought Mifchief 
f . ■.oii;-:li.. i.7r'Oi tiicm, and had very near been the Ruin of 
tuev^Ko^e"Cc•k^T5y: The three new Sociates began, itfeemi 
to le V, cary of the. laborious Life they led, and that 
^vii.hc'.u Koj-e of bettering, thdr Circumflances j and a 
Wfiur. ttA^k tlitm, that they would make a Voyage to the 
Uo^itircr.t fom whence the Savages came, and would

fci^undcT a BLifl frcm Heaven, for i^ we will. not allow

Burl feave,oI)fcrvin|^ and retura to the Story : The 
ih'ree Fellows came dovv^n to the Spaniards one Morning, 
ak.ia.vcry' h«iaxbfc.Teiaj5 defir'dto beadnaitted to fpe3c

( 61 ) 

with them : The Sfmiards very readily heard what they 
had to iay, which was this. That they were tk'd of li- 
ving in the Manner they diA ; that they were not handy 
enough to make the Necefiaries they wanted 5 and that 
having, no Help,, they found they ihould be ftarv'd: But 
if the SfoniarJs would give them Leave to take one 
of the Canoes which they came over in, and give them 
Arms and Ammunition, proportioned for their Defence, 
they would go over to the Main, and ieek their Fortune, 
and fo deliver them from the Trouble of fupplying them 
with any other Provifions. 

The Sfanmrds were glad enough to be rid of them> 
but yet very honeilly reprefented to them the certain De- 
ftrudion they were running into 3 told them, they had 
fuffer'd fuch Hardfhips upon that very Spot, that they 
could, without any Spirit of Prophecy, tell them, that 
tliey would be ftarv'd, or murther'd, and bad them con-- 
fider of it. 

The Men reply*d audaciouOy, they fhould be flarv'd if 
they ftay'd here, for they could not work, and would not. 
work 5 and they could but be flarv'd Abroad, and if 
they were murther'd, there was an End of them, they had 
no Wives or Chileren to cry after themj and in fliort, 
infilled importunately upon ^eh' Demand, declaring, that 
they would go, whether they would give them any Arms 
or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great Kindnefs, that if 
they were reiblv'd to gOy they Hiould not go like naked 
Men, and be in no Condition to defend themltlvesj and that 
though they could ill ipare their Fire-Arms, having not 
enough for themfclves, yet they would let them have two 
Muskets, a Piftol, and a Cutlafh, and each Man a Hatchet,, 
which they thought was fufHcient for them. 

In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having bakedl- 
them .Bread enough toierve them a Month, and given them 
as much Goats-Flelh as tjiey could eat while it was fweet, . 
and a great Basket full of dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of fieih 
Water, and a young Kid alive to kill, they boklly fet out 
in a Canoe for a Voyage over the Sea, where it was at- 
leafl 40 Miles broad. 

The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have- 
Ymj^ wellcaiTy'd fifteen oj twenty Men 5 and, . theicfore, 

waS'. 



Was ratRer too big for them to manage: But as they Bad 
a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with them, they did 
well enough : They had made a Maft of a long Pole, and 
a Sail of fiur large Goat-skins dry'd, which they had Ibw'd 
or he'd together : and away they went merrily enough 5 
the Spaniards call'd after them, Bon Veyajo -y and no Man 
ever thought of feeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often fay one to another, and 
the two honeft EngUJhmen who remain d behind, how 
<|uietly and comfortably they liv'd now thoie three tur- 
bulent Fellows were gone j as for their ever coming again, 
that was the remoteft Thing from their Thoughts that 
could be imagined 5 when behold, after two ancf twenty 
DlysAbfence, one of the Engli/hmen being abroad upon his 
Planting- Work, fees three flrange Men coming toward him 
at aDiftance, two of them with Guns upon their Shoulders, 

Away runs the Englrjhman, as if he was bewitched, 
and came frighted and amaz'd to the Governour Spaniards. 
and tells him they were all -undone, for there were Strangei's 
landen upon the Ifland, he could not teH who : The Spa^ 
niard, paufing a while, fays to him. How do you mean,- 
you cannot teU who ? They are the Savages to be furej 
No, no, fays the Bnglijhmani they are Men in Cloaths 
with Arms : Nay, then, fay^ the Spaniard, why are you 
concerned? If they are not Savages they muft be Friends* 
for there is no Chriftian Nation upon Earth but will do 
us Good rather than Harm. 

While they' were debating thus, comes the three "Eng^ 
Vtjhmen, and Handing without the Wood, wfiich was new 
planted, hallb'd to them j they prefently knew their Voiees, 
and fb all the wonder of that kind ceas'd. But now the 
Admiration was turned Upon another Queftion, ( viz, ) what 
could be the Matter, and what made them come back 
again ? 

I T was not long before they brought the Men in, and 
enquiring where they had been, and what they had been , 
doing, they gave them a full Account of their Voyage in 
a few Words, ( viz.) That they reached the Land in two 
Days, or fbmething Jefs, but finding the People alarm'd at 
their coming, and preparing with Bows and Arrows ta 
light them, they durilnotgo on Shore, butlail'd on to the 
Northwj^d fut'or fevea Hours, tit they came to a great 

Opening, 



(63) 

^ening, by whicBitliey perceiv'd, tliat the Land they faW 
from our Ifland was not the Main, but an Ifland, that en- 
tring that Opening of the Sea, they faw another Ifland oa 
the Right Hand. North, and ieveral more Weft j and being 
reiblv'd to land {bmewherey they put over to one of the 
I£lands which lay Welt, and went boldly on Shore , that 
they found the People very courteous and friendly to them, 
and they gave them feveral Roots and ibme drj'd Fifli, 
and appeared very fbciable i and the Women, as well as the 
Men, were very forward to fupply them with any thing 
they could get jfor them to eat, and brought it to them a 
great Way upon their Heads. 

They continued here four Days, and enquir'd, as wdl 
as they could of them, by Signs, what Nations were this 
Way, and that Way ; and were told of ieveral fierce 2nd 
terrible People that liv'd almoft every Way ; who, as they 
made known by Signs to them, uied to eat Men j but as 
for themfelves, they faid that they never eat Men or Wo- 
men, except only fuch as they took in the Wars, and 
then they own'd that they made a great Feaft, and eat 
their Priloners. 

The EngUfhmen enquir'd when they had a Feaft of 
that Kind, and they told them two Moons ago, pointing 
to the Moon, and then to two Fingers 5 and tlmt their 
great King had two hundred Prifbners now, which he had 
taken in his War 3 and they were feeding them to make 
them fat, for the next Feaft. The "EngUjhmm ieem'd 
mighty defirous to fee thofe Prifoners, but the other mi- 
ftaking them, thought they were deiirous to have ibme of 
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they 
beckon'd to them, pointing to the Setting ot the Sun, and 
then to the Riiing, which was to fignity, that the next 
Morning at Sun-riiing they would bring fome for them 5 
and accordingly the next Morning they brought down five 
Women and eleven Men, and gave them to meEngUjhmerh 
to carry with them on their Voyage, juil as we would 
bring fb many Cows and Oxen down to a Sea-Port Town^ 
to victual a Ship. 

As brutifh and barbarous as theie Fellows were at home, 
their Stomachs turn d at this Sight, and thev did not know 
what to do 5 to refufe the Pri&nei's, would have been the 
Mghefl Mront to the favage Gentry that offer 'd them 5 

and 



.C ^4 ) 

mid wHat to do with them, they knew not ; howevc!^, 
upon fome Debates, they refolved to accept of them, and 
in Return, they gave the Savages that brought them, one 
of their Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and fix or feven 
of theii* Bullets, which, though they did not underfland, 
they feem*d extreamly pleased with: And then, tying the 
poor Creatures Hands behind them, they ( the People ) 
dragg'd the Prifoners into the Boat for our Men. 

The Englijhmen were oblig'd to come away as ibon 
as they had them, or elfe they that gave them this noble 
Prefent, would certainly have expe&d that they fliould 
have gone to work with them, have kill'd two or three 
©f them tiie next Morning, and perhaps have invited the 
Donors to Dinner. 

But having taken their Leave with all the Relpedts, 
and Thanks that could well pafs between People, where 
on either Side they underflcod not one Word they could 
fay, they put off with their Boat, and came back towaids 
the firft Ijlandi where when they arriv'd, they fet eight of 
their Piijfonerl at Liberty, there being too many ot themk 
for theit Occafions. 

In their Voyage, they endeavour'd to have fome Com- 
munication with their Prifoners, but it was impofTible to 
make them underfland any Thing j Nothing they could 
lay to them, or give them, ordorar them, but was look d 
upon as going about to murther them : They firft of all un- 
bound them, but the poor Creatures skream*d at that, 
efpecially the Women, as if they had jufl felt the Knife at 
their Tnroats j for they immediately concluded, they were 
unbound on Ptirpofe to be kilM. 

I F they gave them any Thing to eat, it was the fame 
Thing 5 then they concluded it was for Fear they fliould 
fink in Flefb, and {o not be fat enough to kiU : If they 
look'd atone of them more particulailv, the Party pre- 
fently concluded, it was to fee whether he or fhe was fat- 
eft, and fitteft to kill firft , Nay, after they had brought 
them quite over, and began to uie them kindly, and treat 
diem well, ftill they expected every Day, to make a Din- 
ner or Supper for their new Mafters. 

When the three Wanderers had given this unaccounta- 
fik Hiftory, or Journal of their Voyage, th^ Sfmi^rd ask'd 

ithei»3. 



C ^5 ) 

tliem. Where their new Family was ? An3 being told thaf 
they had brought them on Shore, and put them into one of 
their Huts, and were come up to beg forae Vi6hials for them 5 
they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englifhmen, that is 
to lay, the whole Colony, reiblv'd to go all down to thfi 
Place and fee them, and did £0, and JFridajs Father with 
them. 

Whe^ they came into the Hut, there they fate all 
bound j for when they had brought them on Shore, they 
bound their Hands that they might not take the Boat and 
make their Eicape j ,there, I fiy, they iate, all of them 
ilark naked : 'E'lrft, There were three Men, lufty comely 
Fellows, well-iliap'd, ftraitand fair Limbs, about 30 to thirty 
five Years of kgQy and £iYt Women, whereof two might 
be from thirty to forty, two more not above four or five 
and twenty, and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden about fix- 
tcen or Seventeen : The Women were well-favoured agree- 
ble Perfons, both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and 
two of them, had they been perfect White> would have 
pafe'd for very handfome Women, even in London it felf j 
having very plcafant agreeable Countenances, and of a very 
model: Behaviour, especially when they came afterwarcts 
to be cloath'd, and drefs'd, as they call d it, tho' that Drefe 
was very indifferent it muft be confefs'd ,• of which her©- 
after. 

The Sight, you may be £ire, was fomething uncouth 
to our Spaniards^ who were (to give them a juft Character) 
Men of the beft Behaviour j of the moft calm, fedate Ten*- 
pers, and perfect Good-humour that ever I met with ; 
and in particular, of the moft Modefty, as will prefently ap- 
pear : I fay, the Sight was very uncouth, to fee two naked 
Men, and ^ve naked Women, all together bound, and in the 
mofl miferable Circumflances that human Nature could be 
fuppos'd to bcj 'viz,. to be expelling every Moment to be 
dragg'd out, and have their Brains knock'd out, and 
then to be eaten up like a Calf that is kill'd for a 
Dainty. 

The firft Thing they did, was to caufe the old Tndmn, 

Friday's Father, to go in and fee firft if he knew any 

of them i and then , if he uriderftood any of their 

Speech : As foon as the old Man came in, he look'd 

' feiojufly at the^m, but Igiew none of them i neither could 

any 



(66) 

any of them underftand a Word heiaid, or a Sign he couM 
make, except one of the Women. 

Ho w E V E R, this was enough to answer the End, which 
was to iatisfy them, that the Men into whofe Hands they 
were fallen, were Chriftians , that they abhorr'd eating of 
Men or Women, and that they might be iiire they would 
not be kiird i As fbon as they were allxir'd of this, they 
difcover'd fuch a Joy, and by fuch aukward, and feveia! 
ways, as is hard to deicribej for it feems they were of fe- 
veral Nations. 

The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was bid it!, 
the ne^^t Place to ask them. If they were willing to be 
Servants, and to work for the Men who had brought them 
away, to £ave their Lives ? at which they all fell a Danc- 
ing i and prefently one fell to taking up this, and another 
that, any Thing that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders, 
to intimate that they were wiUing to work. 

The Governoiir, who found, that the liaving Women 
among them would prefently be attended with Ibme In- 
convenience, and might occailon fbme Strife, and perhaps 
Blood J ask'd the tfiee Men, what they intended to do 
with theie Women, and how they intended to nfe them y 
whether as Servants, or as Women ? One of the Englifi^ 
men anfwer'd very boldly and readily. That they would 
life them as both. To which the Governour faid, I am 
not going to reftrain you from it, you are your own 
Mafters as to that: But this I think is but juft, for avoid- 
ing Diibrders and Quarrels among you -y and I deiire it of 
you, for that Realbn only, viz. That you will all engage, 
that a any of you take any of theie Women, as a Wo- 
man or Wife, that he H^all take but one 5 and that having 
taken one, none ehefliould touch herj for tho' we cannot 
marry any of you, yet 'tis but reafbnable, that while you 
ilay here, the Women any of you takes, fl ould be maintained 
by the Man that takes her, and {"hould be his Wife j I mean, 
^js he, while he continues here, and that none elie fhould 
have any thing to ,do with her : All this appeared £0 juil-, 
that every one agreed to it without any Difficulty. 

Then th^ 'EngUJhmen zsk^d the Spaniards, If they de- 
fign'd to take any of them ? But every one anfwer'd 
KO: Some of them faid, they had Wives in 5f /f/;?, arid 
aad the others did not liJcc Women that were not Chrifti- 



{6J) 

ans; and altogether dcclar'd, that thef Would not toucli 
one of them 5 which was an Inflance of fuch Virtue, as 
I have not met with in all my Travels ; On the other 
Hand, X.o be fhort, the five Engl'tfhmen took them every 
one a Wife, that is to iay, a temporary Wife j and £0 they 
ict up a new Form of Living j for the Spaniards and Friday's 
Father ]iv'd in my old Habitation, which they had enlarged ex- 
ceedinglv within ; the three Servants whicli they had taken 
in the late Battle of the Savages, liv'd witli themj and 
thefe carried on the main Part of the Colony, fupplying 
all the reft with Food, and affiiiing them in any THng as 
they could, or as they found Necellity required. 

But the Wonder of this Story was, Jhow five fiich re* 
fradtory ill-match'd Fellows fliould agree, about thefe Wo* 
men, and that two of them fliould not pitch: upon the 
^me Woman, efpecially feeing two or three of them were, 
without Comparifbn, more agreeable than the other : But 
they took a good Way enough to prevent quarrellingamong 
themfelves j for they fet the ^-^c Women oy themielves in 
one of their Huts, and they went all into the other Hut, 
and drew Lots among them, who fhould chufe firft. 

H E that drew to chufe firft, went away by himfelf t0 
the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, and fetched 
out her he chofej and it was worth obferving, that he 
that chofe firfl took her that was reckoned the homelief!:, 
and the oldeft of the five, which made Mirth enough 
among the refi , and even the Spaniards laugh'd at it : but 
the Fellow confider'd better than any of them, that it was 
Application and Bufinefs tliatthey were to expe<^ Afliflance 
in, as much as any TMng elfe^ and fhe proved the befl 
Wife of all the Parcek 

W ME N the poor Women faw themfelves fet in a Rovr 
thus, and fetched out one by one, the Terrors of their Con- 
dition returned upon them again y and they firmly believ'd 
that they were now a going to be devoured : Accordingly, 
when tne ^nglijh Sailor came in and fetched but one of 
them, the reft ikx up a moft lamentable Cry, and hung 
about her, mxd took their Leave of her with fuch Agonies 
and fuch Aflfedion, as would have griev'd the hardeft Heart 
in the World j nor was it poffible for the MngUJhmen to fa- 
tisfy them, that they wa-e not to be immediately mur- 
tter'd, till they fetch'd the old Man, Iriday's Father* who 



( 68 ) 

^mccliately let them know, that the five Men, who had 
fetch'd tliem out one by one* had chofen them for their 
Wives, 

When they had done this, and the Fright the Women were 
in was a iitt-le over, the Men went to work, and the Spa^ 
ninrds came and helped them ; and in a few Hours they had 
built them every one a new Hut or Tent for their Lodging 
apart 5 for thole they had already, were crowded with their 
Tools, Houfhold-Stuff, and Provifions : The three wicked 
Ones had pitch'd fartheil off, and the two honeft Ones 
Hearer, but both on the North Shore of the Ifland, fo that, 
they continued ieparate as before : And thus my Mand was 
peopled in three Places , and as I might fay. Three Towns 
were begun to be planted . 

And here 'tis very well worth obferving. That as It 
often happens in the World (what the wife Ends of God's 
Providence are in fuch a Difpofition of Things, I cannot 
iay) the two honeft FeUov/s had the two worft Wives, 
and the three Reprobates, that were icarce worth hanging, 
that were fit for nothing, and neither £QQxn'd born to So 
tliemfelves Good, or any one elfe, had three clever, dili-^ 
gent, careful, and ingenious Wives j not that the two firfl 
were ill Wives, as to their Temper or Humour j for all the 
five were moil willing, quiet, paffive, and fubje6ted Crea- 
tures, rather like Slaves than Wives , but my Meaning is, 
they were not alike capable, ingenious, or induftrious, or 
alike cleanly and neat. 

Another Obfervation I muft make, to the Honour of 
a diligent Application on cMie Hand, and to the Di^race of 
a flothful, negligent, idh Temper, on the other, that when 
I came to the Place, and viewed the ieveral Improvements, 
Plantings, and Management of the feveral little Colonies; 
the two Men had lb far out-^ne the three, that there was 
no Comparilbn , they had indeed both of them as much 
Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted; and the Reafon 
was, becauie, according to my Rule, Nature dictated, that 
it was to no Purpole to low more Corn than they want- 
ed, but the Difference of the Cultivation, of the Planting, 
of the Fences, and indeed every Thing elie was eafy to be: 
fecn at firft Viw. 

The two Men had innumerable young Trees planted 
abom: their Huts, that whea ycni came to the Place, no- 
thing, 



(69) 

thing was to be ieen but a Wood, and tho* they had 
twice their Plantation demolijflr'd, once hj their own 
Countrymen and once by the Enemy, as fi;all be fhcwn 
in its Place i yet they had refloi'd all again, and every 
Thing v/as thriving and flourifbing about them*; they 
had Grapes planted in Order and manag'd like a Vine- 
yard, tho' they had themfelves never Ieen any Thing of 
that Kind ; and by their good ordering their Vines, their 
Grapes Vv^ere as good again as any of the others. They 
had alio found themfelves out a Retreat in the thickeil 
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a natu- 
ral Cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incef- 
flmt Labour of their Hands, and where when the Mifchief 
which follow 'd happen d, they fecur'd their Wives and 
Children, £o as they could never be found ,• they having by 
flicking innumeiable Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which 
as I faid, grew fb ealily, made the Grove unpaflable, except 
in om.e Places, where they climb'd up to get overtheout- 
fide Partj and then went in by Ways of their own leaving* 
A s to the three Reprobates, as I juflly call them, tho* 
they were much civili2.'d by their new Settlement, com- 
pared to what they were before, and were not fb quaiel- 
Ibme, having not the fame Opportunity; Yet one of the 
certain Companions of a proflagate Mind never left them, 
and that was their Idleneis : It is true, they planted. Corn, 
and made Fences,- but Solomon's Words were never better 
verified than in them : I went by the Vineyard of the Sloath" 
fuh mid it rpm all over-grown with Thorns ; for when the 
Sfmiards came to view their Crop, they could not fee it 
in fbme Places for Weeds; the Hedge had feveral Gaps 
in it, where the wild Goats had gotten in, and eaten up 
the Coi n, ; perhaps, here and there , a dead Bufh was 
cramm'd in, to flop them out for the prefent, but it was 
only fliuttin^ the Stable Door after the Steed was floln. 
Whereas, when they look'd on the Colony of the other 
two, there was ithe very Face of Induflry and Succefs 
upon all they did ; there was not a Weed to be fecn in all 
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges; And they 
on the other Hand verify d Solomon's Words in another 
Place, That the diligent Hand makes rich ; for every Thing 
grew and thrived, and they had Plenty within and with- 
out; they hyad more tame Cattle tlian the other, more 

Utenfils 



( 70 ) 

Utenfils and Ncceflaries witliin Doors •, and yet niorc 
Pieafure and Diverfion too. 

I T it true, tlie Wives of the three, were very handy 
and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the JEnglip 
Ways of Dreffing and Cooking from one of the other 
Engliflomeny who, as I laid, was Cook's-Mate on board 
the Ship, they drefs*d their Husbands Victuals very nicely 
and well f whereas the other could not be brought to 
underftand it i but then the Husband, who, as I faid, had 
been Cook's-Mate, did it himfelf i but as for the Husbands of 
the three Wives^ they loitered about, fetched Turtels Eggs, 
and caught Fifh and Birds, in a Word, any Thin? but. La- 
bour, and they far'd accordingly. The Diligent iiv'd well 
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and beggarly j 
and {b I believe, generally fpeaking, it is all over the 
World. 

But now I come to a Scene, different from all that 
had happen'd before, either to them, or to me 3 and the 
Original of the Story was this : 

Early one Morning there came on Shore five or fix 
Canoes of Indians^ or SMvages, call them which youpleafe; 
and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the 
old Errand of feeding upon their Slaves: But that Part was 
now fb familiar to the Spaniards, and to our Men too, 
that they did not concern themfelves about it, as I did ; 
but having been made fenfible by their Experiences, that 
their only, Bufinefs was to lie conceal'd, and that if they 
were not feen by any of the Savages, they would go off 
again quietly when their Bulinefs was done, having as yet 
not the leaft Notion of there bcin^ any Inhabitants in the 
lilandj I iay, having been made lenfible of this, they had 
nothing to do but to give Notice to ail the three Planta- 
tions, to keep within Doors, and not fhew themfelves, 
only placing a Scout in a proper Place, to give Notice 
when the Boat s^ went off to Sea again. 

This was without Doubt very right? but a Difafler 
ipoird all theie Meafures, and made it known among the 
Savages, that there were Inhabitants there, which was 
in the EndiheDefolation of almoft the whole Colony j after 
ithe Canoes with the Sava|>;es were gone off, the Spaniards 
peeped abroad again, and ibme of them had the Curiofity 
to go to the Place where they had been, to fee what they 

had 



( 71 ) 

had been doing: Here, to their great Surpizc, they found 
three Savages left behind, and lying fail afleep upon the 
Ground; it was flippos'd, they had either been £o gorged 
with their inhuman Feaft, that, libe Beafts, they were a- 
fleep, and would not ftir when the others went, or they 
were wander'd into the Woods, and did not come back 
in Time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly flirpriz'd at this Sight, 
and perfettly at a Lofs what to do 5 the Spaniard Gover- 
nour, as it happened, was with them, and his Advice was 
ask'd, but J^ profefs'd he knew not what to doj as for 
Slaves, they had enough already, and as to killing them, 
they were none of them inclined to that: The Spaniard Go- 
vernour told me, they could not think of fhedding inno- 
cent Blood, for as to them, the poor Creatures had done no 
Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and they thought 
they had no juil Quarrel againft them, to take away their 
Lives. 

And here I muft, in Juftice to thefe Spaniards, ob- 
ferve, that let the Accounts of Spanip Cruelty in Mexico 
and ?eru, be what they will, I never met with feventeen 
Men of any Nation whatfoever, !in any Foreign Country, 
who were fo univerfally Model!:, Temparate, Virtuous, 
fo very good Humour'd, and fb Courteous as thefe SfOr- 
niardsj, and as to Cruelty they had nothing of it in their 
very Nature j no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no outraga- 
ous Paffions, and yet all of them Men of great Coura^ 
and Spirit. 

Their Temper and Calmnefs had appear'd, in their 
bearing the unfufFerable Uiage of the three Englifljmeni 
and their Juftice and Humanity appear'd now in the Cafe 
of the Savages, as above : After fome Confultation, they 
rcfolv'd upon this, that they would lie iliil a while longer, 
'till, if poiTiblc, thefe three Men might be goncj but then 
the Governour Spaniard recolle<fied, that the three Savages 
* had no Boat, and tliat if they were left: to rove about the 
Tfland, they would certainly diicover that there were In- 
habitants in it, and fo they fhoald be undone that Way. 

U I' o N this, they went back again, and there lay the 
Fellows faft afleep flill, £b they relolv'd to waken them, 
and take them Prifejners, and they did fo j the poor Fel- 
bws were ftrangely frighted when they were feia'd upon 

and 



( 7^ ) 

and T^ound, and afraid, like the Women, that they Hiould 
be murther'd and eaten i for it feems thofe People think all 
the World do as they do, eating Mens Flefh j but they 
were foon made eafy as to that, and away they carry'd 
them. 

It was very happy to them that they did not carry 
them Home to their Caftle. I mean to my Palace under 
the Hilli but they carry d them firfl to the Bower, where 
was the chief of their Country-work, fuch as the keep- 
ing the Goats, the planting the Corn, c^f . and afterwards, 
they carried them to the Habitation of the two Engl'sjh^ 
men. 

Here they were iet to work, tho* it was not much 
they had for them to do: and whether it was by Negii- 

feace in guarding them, or that they thought the Pel- 
>ws couki not mend themfelves, I know 'not, but one 
of them run away, and taking into the Woods, they could 
never hear of him more, \ 

They had good Reafon to believe he got Home again 
loon after, in Ibme other Boats or Canoes of Savages, 
who came on Shore three or four Weeks afterwards, and 
who, carrying on their Revels as ufual, went off again in 
two Days time: This Thought terrify 'd them cxceed- 
' ingly^ for they concluded, and that not without good 
Cauie indeed, that if this Fellow came fafe Home among 
his Comrades , he would certainly give them an Ac- 
count that there were People in the Ifland, as alio how 
few and weak they were,- for this Savage, as I obierv'd 
before, had never been told, and it was verry happy he 
had not, how many they were, or where they liv'd -, nor 
had he ever leen or heard the Fire of any of their Guns, 
much left had they fhewn him any of their other retir d 
Places, fuch as the Cave in the Valley, ,or the new Re- 
treat which the two Englifhrnen had made, and the like. 

The firil Teftimony they had that this Fellow had gi- 
ven Intelligence of them, was, that about two Month'?' 
after this, fix Canoes of Savages, with about {even, or 
eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, came rowing along the 
North-lide of the Ifland, where they never uied to come 
before, and landed about an Hour after Sun-rife, at a con- 
venient Place, about a Mile from the Habitation of the two 
Mnglijhmen,whe^e this efcap'd Man had been kept : As the 

Spmmrds 



tn ) 

Spaniard Govemour faid, had they been all therCi the Da*, 
mage would not have been £o much, for not a Man of 
them would have efcap'd i but the Caie diflPer'd now very 
much, for two Men to fifty were too much Odds : The 
two Men had the Happinew to diicover them about a 
League off, fo that it was above an Hour before they 
landed, and as they landed about a Mile from their Hut% 
it was fbme time before they could come at them: Nov* 
liaving great Rcalbn to believe that they were betray 'd, 
the hrft Thing they did, was to bind the Slaves which 
Were left, and caufe two of the three Men, who they 
brought with the Women»who it feems prov'd very faithful 
to them, to lead them with theirtwo Wives, and whatever 
they could carry away with them, to their retir'd Place 
in the Woods, which I have ipoken of above, and therft 
to bind the two Fellows, Hand and Foot, tiU they heard 
farther. 

I N the next Place^ feeing the Savages were aU come oil 
Shore, and that they bent their Courfe dire6tiy that Way^ 
they open'd the Fences where their Milch-Goats were 
kept, and drove them all out, leaving their Goats to ftrag- 
gle into the Wood, whither they pleas'd, that the Sava- 
ges might think they were all bred wild j but the Rogu« 
who came with them was too cunning for that, and gave 
them an Account of it ail i for they went diredly to th«i 
Place. 

When the two poor frighted Men had.4ecur*d theic 
Wives and Goods, they fent the other Slave they had of 
the three, who came with the Women, and who wasf 
at their Place by Accident, away to the Spaniards, with 
all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and defire fpeedy Help i 
and in the mean Time they took their Arms, and what 
Ammunition they had, and retreated towards the Place in 
the Wood, where their Wives were fent, keeping at a 
Diflance, yet fo that they might fee, it poffible, which 
,,way the Savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a rifing Groimd^ 
they could fee the little Army of their Enemies come on 
diredly to their Habitation, and in a Moment more, could 
fee all their Huts and Houihold Stuff flaming up toge- 
ther, to their great Grief and Mortification j for they had 
,a very great Lofs, and to them irretrievable, atleafi; for ibme 
J> TmtA 



Time. Tliey kept their StatiQri fqr a while, 'till they 
found the Savages, like wild Beafts, fpread themfelves all 
over the Place, nimaging every Way, and every Place they 
could think of, in fearch for Prey, and in particular for the 
People, of whom it now plainly appeared they had Intelli- 
gence. 

The two 'Engl}fl}men feeing this, thinking themfelves 
not fecure where they /lood, becaufe as it was likely fbmc 
of tl^ wild People might come that Way, fb they might 
come too many together, thought it proper to make ano- 
ther Retreat atiout half a Mile farther, believing, as it af- 
terwards happened, that the farther they flroU'd, the few- 
er would be together. ' 

The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very thick 
grown Part of the Woods, and where an old Trunck of 
^ Tree flood, which was hollow and vaflly large j and in 
this Tree they both took their flanding, refolving to fee 
there what might offer. 

They had not flood there long, but two of the Sa- 
vages appeared running directly that Way, as if they had 
already had Notice wher<s they flood, and were coming up to 
attack them 5 and a little Way farther, they fpy'd three more 
comingafter them, and five more beyond them, all coming the 
iame Way j befides which, they faw feven or eight more at a 
Diflance, running another Way ; for in a Word, they ran 
every Way like Sportfmen beating for their Game. 

The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whether 
they fhould fland and keep their Pofture, or fly : But af- 
ter a very flbrt Debate with themfelves, they confiderM, 
that if the Savnges rang'd the Country thus befote Help 
came, they might perhaps find out their Retreat in the 
Woods, and then all would be loflj {o they refblv'd to 
(land them there 5 and if there were too many to deal with, 
then they would get up to the Top of the Tree, from 
whence they doubted not to defend themfelves, Tire except- 
ed, as long as their Ammunition lafled, tho* all the Sava- 
ges tbat were landed, which was near fifty, were to at- 
tack them. 

' Having rcfolv'd upon this, they next confider'd, . whe- 
*ther they fhould' fire at the firfl two, or wait for the three, 
and fo take middle Party, by which the two and the five 
that fbllow'd would be feparatcdi at length they refolv'd 

, to 



(75) 

to let the two firft pafs by, unlefs they fhould fyy them 
in the Tree, and come to attack them. The two firf!:- 
Savages alio confirm 'd them in this Rejfolution, by turn- 
ing a little from them towards another Part of the Wood ; 
but the three, and the five after them, came forwards di- 
rcUly to the Tree, as if they had known the Enillfimem 
were there. 

Seeing them come £o (Irait towards them, they x^ 
Iblv'd to take them in a Line, as they camcj and as thef 
refolvd to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the firil Shot 
might hit them all three j to which Purpofe, the Maft 
who "was to fire, put three or four Bullets into his Piec«i 
tnd having a feir Loop-hole, as it were, from a broken 
Hole in the Tree, he took a fure Aim, without being 
feen, waiting till they were within about thirty Yards (» 
the Tree, £o that he could not mifs. ^ 

While they were thus waiting, and the Savagel 
came on, they plainly iaw, that one or the three was the 
Run-away Savage that had efcap'd from them, and they 
both knew him diflin^tlv, and refblv'd, that if poflible, h« 
fliould not efcape, tho' tney ihould both fircj to the other 
ftood ready with his Piece, that if he did not drop at the 
firft Shot, he fhould be {lire to have a £econd. 

But the firft was too good a Markfman to mifs his 
Aim 5 for as the Savages kept near one another, a little be- 
hind in a Line; in a Word, he fir'd, and hit two of 'em 
dire<aiy: The foremoft was kill'd outright, being fiiot i* 
the Head : The i[econd, which was the run-away Indian^ 
was ftiot thro' the Body, and fell, but was not quite 
dead : And the third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder, 
perhaps by the fame Ball that went thro* the Body of the 
lecond, and being dreadfully frighted, tho* not much hurt^ 
fat down upon the Ground, skreaming and yelling in i 
hideous manner. 

The fire that were behind, more frighted with the 
Noife, than fenfible of the Danger, ftood ftill at firft,- for 
the Woods made the Sound a Thouiand Times bi^ei? 
than it really was 5 the Eccho's rattling from one Si<k to 
another, and the Fowls rifing from S\ Parts, skreaming. 
and making, every Sort, a ievoal kind of Noiie, according, 
^ their Kiad, juft as it was when I fir'd the firft Gun^ 
Da tkt 



f70 

that perliaps was ever fbot off in that Place ilnce it was 
an IfJand. 

However, all being filent again, and they not know- | 
ing what the Matter was, came on unconcern 'd, till they 
came to the Place where their Companions lay in a Con- 
dition mifeiable enough: And here the poor ignorant Crea- 
tures, not ieniible that they were within Reach of the 
fame Mifchief, flood all of a Huddle over the wounded 
Man, talking, and, as may be fijppos'd, enquiring of him 
how he came to be hurtj and who, 'tis very rational to 
believe, told them, that a Flafli of Fire firft, and imme- 
diately after that. Thunder from their Gods, had kill'd 
thofe two, and wounded him: This I fay, is rational; 
for nothing is more certain than that, as they faw no Man 
near them, fb they liad never heard a Gun in all their Lives, 
or fb much as heard of a Gmij neither knew they any thing 
of killing or wounding, at a Diftance, with Fire and Bul- 
lets j if they had, one might reafbnably believe, they would 
not have Kood fb unconcem'd, in viewing the Fate of 
their Fellows, without fbme Appreheniion of their own. 

Our two Men, tho* as they confefs'd to me, it grieved 
*em tobe cblig'd to kill fb many poor Creatures, who, at the 
fame Time, had no Notion of their Danger,- yet having 
them all thus in their Power, and the firit having loaded 
his Piece a^in; refolved to let fly both together among 
them^ and lingling out, by Agreement, which to aim 
at, they fhot together, and kiU'd or very much wounded 
four of them j the fifth, frighted even to Death, though 
not hurt, fell with the refti fo that our Men feeing them 
all fill together, thought they had kill'd them all. 

The Belief that the Savages were all kill'd, made our 
two Men come boldly out from the Tree before they 
had charg'd their Guns again, which was a wrong Step; 
and they were under fbme .Surprize when they came to the 
Place, and found no lefs than four of the Men alive, and 
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all: This 
oblig'd them to fall upon them with the Stocks of their 
Muskets; and firft they made fiire of the run-away Sa- 
vage, that had been the Caufe of all the Mifchief, and 
ofanothcr that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out 
of their Pain; then the Man that was not hurt at all, 
mmc and kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands 

held 



(77) 

held up, and made piteous Moan to them by Geflures and 
Signs, for his Life ^ but could not^iay one Word to them 
that they could underhand. 

However, they iign'd to him to fit down at the 
Foot of a Tree thereby , and one of the Znglifl^men, with 
a^Piece of Rope Twine which he had, by great ChancCj 
in his Pocket, ty'd his two Feet fail together, and his 
two Hands behind him, and there they left him 5 and> 
with what Speed they could, made after the other two, 
which were gone before j fearing they, or any more of 
them, fliould find the Way to their cover 'd Place in the 
Woods, where their Wives, and the few Goods they had 
left, lay: They came once in ^'i^t of the two Men, 
but it was a great Difiancej however, they had the Sa- 
tisfaction to fee them crofs over a Vallev towards the Sea, 
the quite contrary Way from that which led to their Re- 
treat, which they were afraid of i and being fatisfy'd with 
that, they went back to the Tree, where they left their 
Prifbner, who, as they fiippos'd, was deliver'd by his 
Comrades 5 for he was gone, and the two Pieces of Rope 
Yarn, with which they had bound him, lay juft at the 
Foot of the Tree. 

They were now in as great a Concern as before, no| 
knowing* what Courfe to take, or how near the Enemy 
might be, or in what Numbers \ £0 they refi>lv'd to go 
away to the Place where their Wives were, to ice if all 
was well Jthere, and to make them eafy, who were in 
Fright enough to be fiire i for tho' the Savages were tljeir 
own Country Folk, yet they were moll terribly afraid 
of them, and perhaps the more, for the Kjaowledge they 
had of them. 

When they come there, they found the Savages had 
been in the Wood, and very near that Place, but had not 
found it,- for it was indeed inacceffiblc, by the Trees 
fianding ib thick, As before , unleis the Perfbns fceking it 
• had been diredred by thofe that knew it, which thefe did 
noti they found therefore every Thing very fife, only 
the Women in a terrible fright : While they were here^ 
they had the Comfort of ieven of the Spmiards comeingto 
their AfTiftancej the other ten, with their Servants, and 
old Friday, I mean FrUay's Father were gone in a Body 
tfi defend their Bower, and the Corn, and Cattle that was 
D I kept 



C 78 ) 

Jtept there, in Cafe the Savages fhould have rov*d over fe 
that Side of the Country, but they did not fpiead fb far : 
"With the feven Sfan'mrds came one of the Savages, who, 
as I j&id, were their Priibners formerly, and with them 
alio came the Savage, who the EngUJJjrnen had left bound 
Hand and Foot at tSe Tree; for it ieems they came that 
Way, £iw the Slaughter of the ieven Men, and unbound 
tlie eighth, and brought him along with them 5 where 
however, they were obliged to bind him again, as they 
had the two others, who were left when the third run 
away. 

The Prifbners b^an now to be a Burthen to themj 
.and they were fb afraid of their efcaping, that they 
thought they were under an abfolute Neceflity to kill 
thicm, for their own Prefervation: However, the Sfa*- 
rmrd Governour would not confent to it, but orderM 
that they fhould be lent out of the Way, to my old Cave 
in the Valley, and be kept there with two Spaniards to 
guard them, and eive them Food, which was done; and 
they were bound there Hand and Foot for that Night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two JEngliJhmen\wexe 
lb encourag'd, that they could not Satisfy themfelvcs to 
ilay any longer there 5 but taking five of the Spaniards, 
and themfelves, with four Muskets and a Pijfloi among 
them, and two ilout Quarter-Starves, away they went in 
cjuefl: of the Savages j And fir ft they came to the Tree 
where the Men lay that had been killed 5 but it was eafy to 
iee, thatlibme more of the Savages had been there ^ for they 
had attempted to cirry their dead Men away, and had 
draggd two of them a good Way, but had given it over: 
From thence they advanc'd to the firft rifing Ground, 
where they had ftood, and feen tlieir Camp deftroyed, 
and where they had the Mortification ftiU to fee ibme of the 
Smoakj but neither could they here fee any of the Savages*. 
'They then relblvM, tho' with all pofllble CauticMi, to go 
forward towaids their ruin'd Planlation; But a little before* 
ihey came thither, coming in Sight of the Sea Shore, 
they law plainly the Savages all embraking again in their 
Canons, in order to be gone. 

They feem*d fbrry at firft that there was no Way to 
come at them, to give them a parting Blow : But upon 
the whole, were very well {ktisffi to be rid of them. 

Thi 



(7P) 

The poor Inglijfhmen being now twice ruiny, and al 
their Improvements deftroy'd, the reft all agreed to come 
and help them rebuild, and to aflift them with needful 
Supplies. Their three Countrymen, who were not yet 
noted for having the leaft Inclination to do any Good, yet 
as ibon as they heard of k (for they living remote Eafl- 
ward, knew nothing of the Matter 'till all was over^ 
came and offered their Help land Affiftance, and did very 
friendly work for leverai Days, to reilore their Habita- 
tion, and make Neceilaries for them : and thus, in a littk 
Time, they were let upon theh^ Legs again . 

About two Days after this, tney had the farther Sa» 
tisfa(ffcion of feeing three of the Savages Canoes com* 
driving on Shore, and at ibme Diftance from them, 
two drown'd Men 5 by which they had reafon to hdkvt^ 
that they had met with a Storm at Sea, and had overfet 
Ibme of them 3 for it had blown very hard the very Night 
after they went off. 

However, as Ibme might mifcarry, fb on the other 
Hand, enough of them eicap'd to inform the refl, as well 
of what they had done, as of wjiat liappen'd to them ; 
and to v^rhet them on to another Enterprizeof theiame Na-i 
ture, which they, it ieems, reiblv'd to, attempt, with fuf- 
ficJent Force to carry all before them, for except what th« 
fir ft Man had told them t>f Inhabitants, they could fay lit- 
tle to it of their o\ni\ Knowledge; for they never faw 
one Man, and the Fellow being kili'd that had affirm'd it, 
they had no other Witnefs to confirm it to them. 

I T was five or fix Months after this, before they heard 
any more of the Savages; in which Time our Men wer« 
in Hopes they had either forgot their former bad Luck, 
or given over the Hopes of better ,• when on a flidden 
they were invaded with a moft formidable Fleet, of no 
lefs than eight and twenty Canoes full of Savages, arm'd 
with Bows and Arrows, gr^t Clubs, wooden Swords, and 
fuch like Engines of War; and they brought fuch Num- 
bers with them, that, in fhort, it put all our People into 
the utmoft Confternation. 

As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at the 
Eafter-moft Side of the Ifland, our Men had that Night 
to confult and confider what to da; and, in the firfl: P ace, 
knowing that their being entirely conceal'd, was their onr

ly Safety before and would much tnort be £o now, WfiiTt 
liie Number of their Enemies was fb greatj they therefore 
refolv'd firft of all to take down the Huts which were 
built for the two EngUftjmen, and drive away their Goats 
to the old Cave ; becauie they fuppofed the Savages would 
go dire<5i:ly thither, as fbon as it was Day, to play the old 
Cam'e over again, though they did not now land within 
two Leagues of it. 

I N the next Place, they dmve away all the Flock of 
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I calFd it, which 
belonged to the Sfmiards j and, in ihort, \dt as little Ap- 
pearance of Inhabitants any where as was pofTiblej and 
the next Morning early they pofted themfelvcs with all 
their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, waiting 
for their coming: As they guefs'd, lb it happened ;^ theS 
new Invaders leaving their Canoes at the Eaft End of the 
Ifland, came ranging along the Shore dire£^ly tow-ids the 
Place, to the NumbS of two hundred and fifty, as near as 
our Men could judge. Our Army was but fiuall indeed i 
but tliat which was worie, they had not Arms for au

(8x) 

To their Slaves they did not give either Musket or Fii- 
zee, but they had every one a Halberd, or a long Staffjike 
a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of Iron faften'd intoieach 
End of it, and by his Side a Hatchet j alio every one of 
our Men had Hatchets: Twp of the Women could not 
be prevail'd upon, but they would come into the Fight, 
and they had Bows and Arrows, which the Spaniards had 
taken from the Savages, when the firft A61:ion happened, 
which I have ipoken of, where the Indians fought with 
one another, and the Women had Hatchets too. 

The Spaniard Governour, who I have delcrib*d lb of- 
ten, commanded the whole i and William Atkins, who, 
tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickednefs, was a moft da- 
ring bold Fellow, commanded under him. The Savages 
came forward like Lyons, and our Men, which was the 
worft of their Fate, had no Advantage in their Situation,- 
only that WilL Atkins, who now proved a moft uleful 
Fellow, with fix Men, was planted juil: behind a fmail 
Thicket of Bufhes, as an advanced Guard, with Orders to 
let the firft of them pafs by, and then fire into the mid- 
dle of them, and, as ibon as he had fir'd, to make his Re- 
treat as nimbly as he could round a Fart of the Wood, and 
fo come in behind the Spaniards where they ftood, having- 
a Thicket of Trees all before them. 

When the Savages came on, they run draggling about 
every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Order, and W^/- 
liam Atkins let about fifty of them pafs by him, then iee- 
ing the reft comd in a very thick Throng, he orders three 
ofhis Men to fire, having loaded their Muiquets with fix 
or leven Bullets a-piece, about as big as large Piilol Bullets.. 
How many they kilFd or wounded, they knew not, but 
the Confternation and Surprize was inexprefifiblc among 
the Savages i they were frighted to the Lift T3egrce, to hear 
iuch a dreadful Noiie, and iec their Men kill'd', and others 
hurt, but fee no Body that did VCp when in the middle of 
their Fright, William Atk'ns, and his other three, ht fiy 
again among the thickeft of them 5 and in lefs than a Mi- 
nute the firft three, being loaded again, gave them a third 
Volley. 

Had William Atkins and his Men rctir'd immediately, 

as £bon as they had fir'd, as they were order'd to do: or 

tadtthe reft of the Body been at Hand t© have pour *d in 

D % tkm 



tieir Shot continually, the Savages had been cffeAuaBf 
routed 5 for the Terror that was among them, came pin- 
cipally from this, (viz,,) That they were killM by the Gods 
with Thunder and Lightning, and could iee no Body that 
hurt them 5 but William jitkins flaying to load again, dii^ 
cover'd the Cheat : Some of the Savages who were at a 
Diftance, Q>ying them, came upon them behind, and tho' 
Atkins and his Men fir'd at them alio, two or three times> 
tnd kill'd above tvventy, retiring as faft as they could, yet 
they wounded Mkins himfelf, and kiU'd one of his Fel- 
iow Englishmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards 
one Spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves who came with 
the Women j this Slave was a moft gallant Fellow, and 
fought moft defperately, killing five of them with his 
©wia Hand* haying no Weapon, but one of the arm'd 
Staves and a HatcliJt. 

Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and 
two other Men kill d, retreated to a rifing Ground in the 
Wood I and the Spaniards, after firing three Vollies upon 
them retreated alio ^ for their Number was fb great, and 
iimj wer^ fo defperate, that tho' above Mty of them were ' 
Ikill d, and more than fb many wounded, yet they came 
. <m in tl^ Teeth of our Men, fearlefs of Danger, and fhot 
thm Arrows like a Cloud; and it was obfov'd, that their 
wounded Men, who were not quite difabkd, were made 
o^ttiagious by their Wounds, and fought like Madmen. 

When oui* Men retreatai, they left the Spaniard and 
the Bnglifljman that were killed behind them j and the Sa- 
vages, when they came up to them, kill d them over again 
.in a wretched manner, breaking their Arms, Legs and Heads, 
with their Clubs and wooden Swords, like true Savages : 
But finding our Men were gone, they did not feem to 
purfiie them, but drew them&ves up in a kind of a Ring, 
which is, it feems, their Cuilom, and fhouted twice m 
Token of their Victory: After which, they had the Mor- 
tification to fee ieveral of their wounded Men fuU, dying „ 
with the ^ere Lofs of Blood. 

The Spaniard Governour having drawn his little Body 
«ip together upon a rifing Ground, Atkins, tho' he was 
woumed, woukl have had him march d and charg'd them 
again altogether at once: But the Spaniards reply d, Seig' 
jKior AtkimtYon iee how their wounded Men fight, let 'ein 



(83) 

alone till Momingj all tliefe wounded Men will be (lifF and 
fore with their Wounds, and faint with theL^oisof Blood i 
arid ib we fliall have the fewer to engage. 

The Advice was good: But J^dL Atkins vt^lfd mer^ 
rily. That's true, Seignior, and fb fliall I tooj and that's 
the Rea&n I would go on while I am warm. Well, 
Seignior Atkins, fays the Spaniards, you have behav'd gal- 
lantly, and done your Part j we will fight for you, if you 
cannot come on, but I think it beft to flay till Morning 
fo they waited. 

But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they 
found the Savages in great Diforder about their dead and 
wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noife among them 
where they lay, they afterwards refblv'd to fall upon them 
in the Night, efipccklly if they could c®me to give them 
but one Volley before they were difcover'd : This they 
had a fair Opportunity to do, for one of the two Eng-^ 
liflomen, in whofe Quarter it was where tlie Fight began, 
led them round between the Woods, and the Sea-iide Weil- 
ward, and then turning flioit South, they came fb near where 
the thickefl: of them lay, that before they were feen or 
heard, eight of them fi?d in among them, and did dread- 
ful Execution upon themj in hall a Minute more, eight 
others fir'd after them, pouring in their fmall Shot in fuch 
a Quantity, that abundance were kiii'd and wounded i and 
all this while they were not able to fee who hurt them, 
or which Way to fly » 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmoft Expedi- 
tion, and then divided themielves into three Bodies, and 
refolv'd to fall in among them altogether : They had in 
each Body eight Perfons, that is to Sy, 24, whereof were 
2x Men, and the 2 Women, wl%o, by the Way, fought dc- 
fperately. 

They divided the Fire- Arms equally in each Party, 
and fb of the Halberds and Staves : They would feve md 
the Women keep back, but they faid they were refolv'd 
to die with their Husbands. Ha/ing thus form'd their lit- 
tle Army, they march'd out from among the Trees, and 
came up to the Teeth of the ^lemy, fhouting and 
- hollowing as loud as they could 5 tk$ Savages flood altoge- 
ther, but wej-e in the utmoft Confufion, liearing the Noiie 
of our Men Ihouting from three Qiiarters together 3 thev

^rould liave fought if they had feen us : And as Bon as vffi 
came near enough to be feen, fome Arrows were ihoti 
and; pool' M Frid^ V7as wounded, tho* not dangeroufly: 
But our Men gave them no Time -y but running up to 
theBi> firU among them three Ways, and then fell m with 
the Bu|:-«nd3 of their Muskets, their Swords, arm'd Staves-, 
and; Hatclietsj and^aM about them fowell, that, in aWord^ 
#tey &t up a difinal Skreaming and Howling, flying to' 
jfive rfieir Litres. which way fbever they could. 

OuR^ Menr.were t-ir'd. with the Execution j and kill'd 
or mortally woundedv. in the two Fights^ about i8o of 
ttoem?,- tho-reii;, being frighted out of their Wits, fcour'd 
%o> the: Woodsy and ovojc the Hills, with all the Speed and 
Mtm that nimbler Fcetcouid^ help them to do 3 and as we 
did: not? trouble- owrfilves much to purfuc them., they got 
sii^ogsther to. the. Sea-fide, where they landed, and where 
thm. Canoes lay :- But their Difafter was not at an End 
yq? 3: for it blew* 3 terrtble- Stoi m of Wind that Evening 
ft'om the ^ea-ward, fo that it was impolfible for them to 
gQ.Qffy mj} the Storm; continuing alFNi^ht, when the 
liide came up, their Canoes were moft of tnem driven by 
thejSurge^or the Sea fo high upon the Slioie, that it re- 
<5uir'd; infinite Toil to get them oif : and feme of them 
were: even daih*d to Pieces againft the Beach, ov againfl 
one another.. 

OuR^ Men, thV glad of their Vidiory, yet got little 
Reft' that Night j. but having refreflrd. tiiimielves as well 
as they could, they refolv'd to march to- that Part of the 
Ifland where- the Savages were fled, and fee what- Pc^fture 
they were in. This neceflarily led them over tJie Place 
w^lieie the Fight had been, and where they found icveral 
of the poor Creatures not quite dead, and yet pall rcrover- 
ing-Lifcj a Sight di{^igreeable enough to generous Minds; 
for a truly great Man, tho' oblig d by the Law of Bat- 
tle to deftroy his E'nemy, takes no Delight in his Mi- 

.firy.. 

However, there was no need to give any Orders 
in this Cafe y for their own Savages, who were thdr 
Servants,- di^atchti. thpie- poor Creatures with their 
Hatchets-. 

A T Icrgtii they came in View of the Place where the 
jnore jjiiferable Remains of. the Savages Army lay, where 

there: 



there appeared about an hundred ftilli theif Poihire was^ g§^ 
nerally fitting upon the Ground, with their Knees up to-' «fe-. 
wards their JVfcuth, and the Head put between the two 
Hands, leaning down upon the Xnees, 

When our Men came within two Musket- Shot of 
them, the Spaniard Governonr ordef'd two Muskets to be 
fir'd without Ball, to alarm them j this he did, that by their 
Countenance he might know what to expe6l, ziiz. Whe- 
ther they were ftill in Heart to fight, or were £o heartily 
beaten, as to be difpirited and difcourag'd, and lb he might 
manage accordingly. 

This Stratagem took , fer, as fbon as the Savages heard 
the fir ft Gun, andfaw the.Flafh of the fecond, they ftaited 
up upon their Feet in the greateft Coniler nation imagina- 
ble 5 and as our Men advanc'd fwiftly towards them, they 
all ran skreaming and yawling away, with a kind of a 
howling Nolle, which our Men did not under ftand, and 
had never heard before, and thus they ran up the Hills in- 
to the Country. 

A T firft, our Men had much rather the Weather had 
been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea : But they 
did not then conlider, that this might probably have been 
the Occalion of their coming again in iuch Multitudes, as 
not to be refifted, or, at Icafl:, to come ib many, and fi>- 
often, as would quite delblate the Ifland, and ftarve them : * 
Will, Atkins therefore, who, notwithftanding his Wound,, 
kept always with. them, proved the beft Cbunlellor in this 
Cale: His Advice was,, to take the Advantage that offered, 
and clap in between them and their Boats, and fo depriv^e 
them of the Capacity of ever returning any more to plague 
*thc Ifiand. 

They confuked long about this, and fome were againft 
it, for. fear of making rKe Wretches iTy to the Woods, and 
live there dclperatci and lb they ll)cald liav^e them to hutit 
like wild Beails, be afraid to Hir out about their Bufinefs, 
and have their Plantations continually uHed, all their tame 
• Goats deftroy'd, and, in lliort> be reduced to a Life of con- 
tinual Diftreis. 

JViiL Atkins told them, they had better have to do with 
an hundred Men, than with an hundred Nations: That as 
^X muft deftroy thcu' Boats, fo they mull deHroy the 

Men, 



. (S6) 

Men, or be all of them deftroy'd themfelves. In a Word, 
he fhcw'd them the Neccflity of it fo plainly, that they all 
came into it 5 lb they went to work immediately with 
the Boats, and getting "fome dry Wood together from a 
dead Tree, they try'd tofet fome of them on fire, but they 
were fowet, that they would not burn: however, the Fire 
fo burn'd the upper Part, that it foon made them unfit for 
fv/imming in the Sea as Boats. When the Indians faw 
what they were about, fome of them camce running out 
of the Woods, and coming as near as they could to our 
Men, kneel'd down and cry d, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and 
fome other Words of their Language, which none of the 
others underftood any thing of 5 but as they made pitiful 
.Geftures, and ftrange Noiles, it was eafy to underftand, 
they begg'd to have their Boats Ipar'd, and that they would 
be gone, and never come there again. 

But our Men were now (atished, that they had no Way 
to preferve themfelves, or to lave their Colony, but effec- 
tually to prevent any of theie People from ever going liome 
again j depending upon this, that if ever fo much as' one of 
them got back into their CoQntry to tell the Story, the 
Colony was undone j io that letting them know that they 
fbould not have any Mercy, they tell to work with their 
Canoes, and deftroy'd them every one, that the Storm had 
not deliroy'd before j at the Sight of which, the Savages 
rais'd a hedious Cry in the Woods, which our People heard 
plain enough j after which they ran about the Ifland like 
diftra£led Men j fo that, in a Word, our Men did not rea^ 
ly know at fir ft what to do with them. 

Nor did the SfaniarJs, with all their Prudence, conl> 
der, that while they made thofe People thus dei5>erate, 
tlaey ought to have kept good Guard at the fame Time 
upon their Plantations i for tho' it is true, they had driven 
away their Cattle, and the Indians did not find out their 
main Retreat, I mean my old Caftle at the Hill, nor the 
Cave in the Valley, yet they found out my Plantation at the „ 
Bower,and pull'd it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and Planting 
about it 5 trode all the Corn under Foot, tore up the Vinei 
and Grapes, being juft then almofl ripe, and did our Men an 
ineftijnahle Damage, tho' to thcmfeivea not one FarthingV 
worth of Service, 

Tho* 



( 87 ) 

T H o ' our Men were able to fight them upon afl Oc^ 
cafions, yet they were in no Condition to purfue them, or 
hunt them up and down, for as they were too nimble of 
Foot for our Men, when they found them fingle, fq. our 
Men durft not go about fingle, for fear of being fiirrounded 
with their Numbers : The beftwas, they had no Weapons,, 
for tho' they had Bows, they had no Arrows left, nor any 
Materials to make any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or 
Weapon among tliem. 

The Extremity and Diftrefs they were reduc'd to was 
great, and indeed deplorable j but at the fame Time, our 
Men were alio brought to very bad Circumflances by 
them j for tho' their Retreats were preferved, yet their Pro- 
vifion was deilroyed, and their Harveft ipoiled, and what 
to do, or which Way to turn themfelves, they knew not: 
The only Refuge they had now, was the Stock of Cattle 
they had in the Valley by the Cave, and feme little Cotn 
which grew there: The three Englijhmen, William At- 
kins and his Comrades, were now reduc'd to two, 
one of them being kill d by an Arrow which ftruck him 
on the Side of his Head, juft under the Temple, £b that 
he never fpoke more ; and it was very remarkable, that 
this was the fame barbarous Fellow wno cut the poor Sa- 
vage Slave with liis Hatchet, and who afterwards intend- 
ed .to have murther'd the Spaniards, 

I LOOKED upon their Cafe to have been worfe at this 
Time, than mine was at any TimxC, after I firfl difcover'd 
the Grains of ^Barley and Rice, and got into the Method 
of planting and railing my Corm, and my tame Cattle s 
for now they had, as I may fay, a hundrai Wolves upon 
the Ifland, which would devour every Thing they could 
come at, yet could very hardly be come at themfelves. 

The nrfL Thing they concluded, when they faw what 
their Circumfbnces were, was, that they would, if pofli- 
ble, drive them up to the fei ther Fart or the Ifland, Souths 
, Mafi, that if any more Savages came on Shore, they miglrt: 
not find one another : Then, that they would daily hunt 
and harafs them, and kill as many of them as they could 
come at, till they had reduc'd their Number ^ and if they 
could at bft tame them and bring them to any Thing, 
they would give them Corn, and teach them how to plant 
. and live upon their daily L^ur* 

In 



( 88 ) 

In order to this, they £o folIow*d them, andib terrify'd 
them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if any of them 
ired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he 
would fell down for Fear 5 and fb dreadfully frighted they 
were, that they kept out of Sight fartho- and farther, till 
at laft our Men following them, and every Day almoft 
killing and wounding lome of them, they kept up in the 
Woods and hollow Places fb much, that it reduc'd them to 
the utmoft Mifery for want of Food j and many were af- 
terwards found dead in the Woods, without any Hurt, but 
mecrly flarved to Death. 

When our Men found this, it made their Hearts re- 
lent, and Pity mov'd them ,• efpecially the Spaniard Gover- 
Eour, who was the moft Gentleman-like generous-minded 
Man that ever I met with in my Lifej and he proposed, if 
poilible, to take one of thcni alive, and bring him to un- 
derfiand what they meant, fo far as to be able to a£t a^- 
Intel pretcM", and to go among them, and lee if they might be 
brour,ht ro fome Conditions, that might be depended up- 
on, to ih'Q rhcif T -i.cs, and to do us no Spoil, 

It v/ai, fon>e vvbile before any of them could be taken; 
but being wtak nnd \rl- frjrv'd, one of them was at laft 
ilirpvi?. d nnd ri^aJe a Pj iic'ner j he was liillen at firft, and 
\v«.u1d neiihcr ear nor dnnk, but finding himfelf kindly 
"ufeti, and ViclrMl: given him, and no Violence offered him, 
^he iit laft gx'^v t-p-'^al-Ic, m^i came to himfelf. 

Tmily bi ought old Fridad to him, who talked often 
with xiim, jn-i told him how kind the other would be to 
thc:r-< :u ■ th^t they \' ^oi^ld not only five their Lives, but 
■ would gne tlirni a Pa-^ of the liland to livo, in, provided 
they would give Satisfa<ftion, that they womd keep 
in their o^vn ]xv.in:^s, and not come beyond them, to in- 
jure 01 prejudice others j and tliat they fliould have Corn 
given tlievn, to pknt and make it grow for their Bread, 
and feme F'-c.^d given tliem for their preient Subfiflance 5 
" and old Friday Lad the Fellow go and talk with the reft of 
his Countrymen, and lee what they £iid to it, ailuring " 
them, that if they did not agree immediately they fhould 
• be all deftjoy'd.

them ; upon which, twelve Spaniards, and two 'EngUJhmm 
well arm'd, and three Indian Slaves, and old Trtday, march- 
ed to the Place where they Vv^ercj the three /p^^kw Slaves 
carried thepi a large Quantity oiF Bread, and feme Rice 
boiled up to Cakes, and dry*d in the Sun, and three live 
Goats i and they were ordered to go to the SvdiC of a HiH, 
where they fat down, eat the Provilions, very thanktiilly, 
and were the mofl h>itM\xi Fellows to their Words that 
could be thought of j for except when they caitie to beg 
Victuals and Directions, they never came out of their 
Bounds j and there they lived when I came to the Ifland, 
tnd I went to fee them. 

T K E Y had taught them both to plant Corn, make 
Bread, breed tame Goats, and milk them 5 they wanted no- 
thing but V^'vft^^ and they foon would have been a Na- 
tion: They were confined to a Neck of Land, ground- 
ed with high Rocks behind them, and lying plain towards 
the Sea before them, on the South-Eaft Corner of the 
Ifland : They had Land enough, and it was very good and 
fruitful, for they had a Piece of Land about a Mile, and 
half broad, three or four Mile in Length. 

Our Men taught them to malie wooden Spades, £uch 
ts I made for my felf, and gave them among them twelve 
Hatchets and three or four Knaves > and there they liv*d 
the moft fubje<Sted innocent Creatures, that ever were 
heard of. 

After this, the Colony enjoy'd a perfe<ft Tranquility 
with rei^P^^ ^^ ^^^ Savages, till 1 came to revifit them, 
which was in about two Years : ^loXy but that no-w and 
then, fome Canoes of Savages came on Shore for their tri- 
umphal unnatural Fcafl;s,%but as they w^ere of ieveral Na- 
tions, and perhaps had never heard of thofe that came be- 
fore, or the Reaibn of it, they did not make any Search 
or Enquiry after their Countrymen ; and if they had, 
it would have been very hard for them to have found 
them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a fiill Account of all that 
happen 'd to them, to my Return, at leaft, that was wortJi 
Notice. The Indians or Savages were wonderfully civi- 
Xvz/d by them, and they frequently went among them, but 
forbid*, on Pain of Death, any one of the Indians coming to 

them^ 



tKem, becaufe they would not have their Settlement be* 
tray'd again. 

One Thing was very remarkable, viz, that they taught 
the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets i but they 
loon out-did their Mafters j for they made abundance of 
' mofl: ingenious Things in Wicker-work , paiticulaily, all 
Sorts oi Baskets, Sieves, Bird-Cages, Cup-boards, ^c, as 
alio Chairs to fit on, Stools, Beds, Couches, and abundance 
of other Things, being vet y ingenious at fuch Work, when 
they were once put in the Way of it. 

M y coming was a particular Relief to thefe People, be- 
caufe wefurnifli'd them with Knives, Sciilars, Spades, Sho- 
vels, Picfe-^es, and all Tilings of that Kind which they 
" could want. 

With the Help of thefe Tools they v/ere Co very han- 
dy, that they came at laft to build up their Huts, or Hou- 
fes, very handfbmely ,* raddling or working it up like Ba- 
sket-work all the Way round, which was a very extraor- 
dinary Piece of Ingenuity, and look'd very odd, but was an 
exceeding good Fence, as well againft Heat, as againfl ail 
Sorts of Vermine 5 and our Men were £0 taken with it, 
that they got the wild Savages to come and do the like for 
them i fb that when I came to fee the two Snglipjmen's 
Colonies, they look'd, at a Diflance, as IF they liv d all lik« 
Bees, in a Hiv^-^ and as for PTilL A.tk'ms^ who was now be- 
come a very induflrious, neceflky and fbber Fellow, he 
had made hxmkli fiich a Tent of^ Basket-work, "as I be- 
lieve was never feenj it was 120 Paces round in the out- 
• fide, as 1 meafur*d by my Steps i the Walls were as clofe 
work'd as a Basket in Pannels, or Squares of 5 2 in Num- 
ber, and very flrong, ftandhig *bout feven Foot high 5 in 
the. middle was another not above 22 Paces rouna, but 
built (Ironger, being Eight-fquare in its Form, and in the 
eight Comers flood eight very flrong Pofts, round the top 
ofwhich he laid flrong Pieces' pirin a together with woo- 
den Pins, from which he raifed a Piiamid for the Roof of 
eight Rafters, very handfbme, I afllire you, and joined to- 
gether very well, tho* he had no Nails, and only a few 
Iron-Spikes, which he had made himfelf too, out of the 
old Iron that I had left there j and indeed this Fellow il:ew'd 
abundance of Ingenuity In feverai Things, which he had 
HP Knowlede of,- he made himfelf a Forge, with a Pair 



(pi ) 

^ wooden Bellows to blo\v the Fire j he made himfelf 
Charcoal for his Work, and he form'd out of one of the 
Iron-Crows, a middling good Anvil to hammer upon 5 in 
this Manner he made many Things, but e^ecially Hooks, 
Staples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges : But to return to the 
Houfe j after he had pitched the Roof of his innermofl 
Tent, he worked it up between the Rafters with Basket- 
work, £0 firm, and thatch'd that over again £0 ingenioally 
with Rice-llraw, and over that a large Leaf of a Tree, whica 
cover'd the Top, that his Houle was as dry as if it had been 
til'd or flated. Indeed he own'd that the Savages made the 
Basket-work for him. 

The outer Circuit was cover'd, as a Lean-too, all round 
this inner Apartment, and long Rafter? lay from the two 
iind thirty Angles to the top Pofts of the inner Houfe, be- 
ing about twenty Foot diflant j fo that there was a Spac« 
like 5b. Walk, within the outer Wicker-wall, and witliout 
the inner, near twenty Foot wide. 

The inner Place he partitioned off with the fame Wick- 
er-work, but much fairer, and divided it into fix ApartF- 
ments, £0 that he had fix Rooms on a Floor ^ and out of evfl^ 
^ one of thefe there was a Door, firft into the Entry cnr 
Coming into the main Tent, and another Door into the 
Space or Walk that was round it -, £0 that Walk was aj^ 
divided into fix equal Parts, which ferv'd not only for R6^ 
treat, but to ftore up any Neceffaries which the Family had 
occafion for. Thefe fix Spaces not taking up the whole 
Circumference, what other Apartments the outer Circle 
had, were thus order 'd: As fbon you were in at the Door 
of the outer Circle, you had a fl^.ort Pafiage ftrait before 
you to the Door of the inner Houfe, but on either Side 
was a Wicker- Partition, and a Door in it, by which you 
wait, firft, into a large Room or Store-houle, twenty Foot 
wide, and about thirty Foot long, and thro' that Into an^ 
other not quite £0 longs fb that in the outer Circle was 
ten handibme Rooms, im of which were only to be come 
at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent, and ferv d as 
Clo%s or retired Rooms to the reipe<5iive Chambers of 
the inner Circle ,* and four large W^re-houfes or Bams, or 
what you pleafe to call them, which went in thro' one an- 
other, two on either Hand of thePaflage, that led thro' the 
outer Door to the inner Tent.

Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe,, was^ never feai i 
in the World ; nor a Houfe, or Tent, fo neatlj contrivU 
much Ms, fo built : In this great Bee-hive liv^d the thiee 
Families, that is to fay. Will. Atkins and his Companion j 
the third was kilFd, but his Wife remained with three j 
Children j for fhe was, it feems, big with Child when he 
dfd, and the other two were not at all backward to give 
the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean, as to 
their Corn, Milk, Grapes, ^d and when they kill'd a Kid, 
or found a Turtle, on the Shore ; fo that they all liv'd well 
enough, tho' it was true, they were not fo induftrious as 
the other two, as has been obierv'd already. 

One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. That as 
for Religion, I don't know that theie was any Thing of 
that kind among them ; they pretty often indeed put one 
another in Mind that there was a God, by the very com- 
mon Method of Seamen, viz. Swearing by his Name : 
Nor were their poor ignorant Savage Wives much the better 
for having been marry *d to^hriftians, as we muil- call them j 
for as they knew very Httie of God themfelves, fofhey were 
utterly uncapable of entring into any Difcourie with their 
Wives about a God, CHi to talk any thing to them cdncern- 
ing Religion. 

The utmofl: of all the Improvement which I can iay 
^ e Wives had made for them, was, that they had taught 
-nem to ipeak Englijh pretty well, and all the Children they 
had, which was near 20 in all, were taught to fpeak Eng- 
lift} too, from their firll learning to ipeak, tho' they atfirfl: 
fpoke it in a very broken Manna*, like their Mothers. 
There were none of thcle Children above fix 1 ears old 
when I came thither, for it was not much above feven 
Years that they had fetched thefe five Savage Ladies over, 
but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all Chil- 
dren, more or leis : I think the Ccok*s Mate's Wife was 
big of her fixth Child y and the Mothers were all a good 
Sort of well-govern'd, quiet, laborious Women, modcft and 
decent, helpml to one another, mighty oblervant and fub- 
je£!: to their Mailers, I cannot call them Husbands ^ and 
wanted nothing but to be well inftruded in theChriftian 
Religion, and to be h^^j marry'dj both which were hap- 
pily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, at leaft, 
oy the Cohfequencc of mj coming among them.

( 93 ) 

Having thus given an Account of the Colony in ge- 
neral, and pretty much of my five Runagate E'oglijhmen, I 
mufl iay K)mething of the Spaniards, who were the main 
Body of the Family ; and in whofe Story there are ibmc 
Inddents alio remarkable enough. 

I H A D a great many Difcourfes with them about their 
Circumftances, when they were among the Savages: They 
told me readily, that they had no Inftances to give of their 
Application or Ingenuity in that Country; that they were 
a poor miferable dejefted Handful of People; that it Means 
had been put into their Hands, they had yet £o abandoned 
themfelves to Deipair, and fo funk under the Weight of 
their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but Star- 
ving : One of them, a grave and very ienlibie Man, told 
me, he was convinc'd tney were in the wrong ; that it 
was not the Part of wife Men, to give up themfelves to 
their Mifery, but always to take hold of the Helps which 
Reafbn offered, as well for prefent Support, as for future 
Deliverance : He told me, that Grief was the mofl fenfelefs 
infignificant Paflion in the World ; for that it regarded only 
Things paft, which were generally impoffible to be recall'ds 
or to be remedy'd, but fed no View to Things to come, 
and had no Share in any Thing that look'd like Deliverance, 
but rather added to the Affliraon, than propofed a Reme- 
dy: And upon this, he repeated a Sfani/h Proverb^ which 
though I cannot rep^t in juil the fime Words that he 
fpoke it, yet I remember I made it into m J£>n^UJh Pro- 
verb of my own, thus: 

Jn Trouble to be troubfdy 

Is to have your Trouble doubled , 

He ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little Improve- 
ments I had made in my Solitude ,♦ my unweary'd Appli- 
cation, as he caird it, and how I had made a Condition, 
which in its Circumftances, was at fir ft, much worfethan 
theirs, a thoufand Times more happy than theirs was, even 
now, when they were all together : He told me, it was 
remarkable, that EngUpmen had a greater Prelenceof Mind 
in their Diilrefs, than any People that ever he met with} 
^t their unhappy Nation, and the Tprtugmfi, were the, 

worft' 



( P4 > 

worft Men In the World to flrugsjle with Misfortunes jfbr 
thpt their firft Step in Dangers, after common Efforts arc 
over, was always to defpair, lie <iown under it, and die, • 
without rouling their Thoughts up to proper Remedies 
for Efcape. 

I told him, their Cafe and mine diffsr'd exceedingly, that 
they were cait upon the Shore without Neceflaries, with- 
out Supply of Food, or of prefent Suftenance, 'till they 
could provide : That it is true, I had this Di/advantagc 
and Difcomfort, that I was alone j but then the Supplies I 
had providentially thrown into my Hands, bv the unex- 
pected driving or the Ship on Shore, was fiicn a Help as 
would have encourag'd any Creature in the World to have 
tpply'd himfelf as I have done : Seignior, fays the Spaniard, 
md we poor Spaniards been in your Cafe, we fhould ne- 
ver have gotten half thofe Things out of the Ship as 
you did : Nay iays he, we fliould never have found Means 
to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to have ^tten a 
Raft on Sliore without Boat or Sail j and how much lefs 
fhould we have done, faid he, if any of us had been alone ? 
Weil, I defir'd him to abate his Compliment, and go on 
with the Hiflory of their coming on Shore, where they 
landed j he told me, they unhappily landed at a Place where 
there were People without ProviJions > whereas had they 
had the common Senfe to have put off to Sea again, and 
g6ne to another Ifland a little farther, they had found Pro- 
viiions, tho' without People j there being an Ifland that 
Way, as they have been|told, where there was Provifions, 
tho* no People 5 that is to iay, that the Spaniards of Tri- 
nidad had frequently been there, and had fill'd the Ifland 
with Goats and Hogs at fevefal Times ; where they have 
bred in fuch Multitude, and where Turtle and Sea-Fowls 
were in fuch Plenty, that they could have been in no want 
of Flefh, tho* they had found no Bread ,• whereas here, 
they were only fuftain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, 
which they underflood not, and which had no Subilance 
in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them fparingly' 
enough, and who could treat them no better, unlefs they 
would turn Canibals, and eat Mens Flefh, which was the 
great Dainty of their Country. ' 

They ^avc me an Account how many Ways they 
ftrove to civiliic the Savages they were with, and to teach 

theiXfc 



{9yy 

them ratiooal Culloms in the ordinary V/ay of Living, but 
in vain i and how they' retorted it upon them, as unjuft,- 
that they wlio came there for Afliilance and Support, fliould 
attempt to fet up for Inilru6tors of thofe that gave them 
Bread ; intimating, it feems, that none fhould fet up for 
the Inftru6lors or others, but thofe who could live with- 
out them. 

They gave me difmal Accounts of the Extremities 
they were driven to ; how Ibmetimes they were many 
Days without any Food at allj the liland they were upon 
being inhabited by a Sort of Savages that Hved more indo- 
lent, and for that Reaibn were lefs iupplied with the Ne- 
ceilaries of Lite, than they had Reaibn to believe others 
were in the fame Part of the World j and yet they found, 
that thcfe Savages were lefs ravenous and voracious, tnan thofe 
who had better Supplies of Food. 

Also they added. That they could not but fee with 
what Demonflrations of WifHom and Goodnefs the gover- 
ning Providence of God diredls the Event of Things in 
the World i* which, they faid, appeared in their Circum- 
ftanccj for if pre/led by the Hardfliips thev were under, 
and the Barrennefs of the Country where tney were, they 
had fearch'd after a better Place to Hyc in 5 they had then 
been out of the Way of the Relief that happened to them 
by m.y Means. 

Then they gave me an Account, how the Savages, who' 
they liv'd among, e^pedlcd them to go out with them in- 
to their Wars j And it was true, that, as they had Fire- 
Arms with them, had they not had the Dilailer to lofe 
jtheir Ammunition, :jhey fhould not have been ferviceable 
only to their Friends, but have made themfelves terrible 
both to Friends and Enemies j but being without Powder 
and Shot, and yet in a Condition, that they could not m 
Reaibn deny to go out with their Landlords to their Wars 5 
when they came intb the Field of Battle, they wpre in a 
v/oife Condition than the Savages themfelves ,• for they 
" neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they ufe thoic 
the Savages gave them j Co that they could do nothing but 
ftand ftili, andbewbunded with Arrows, till they came up to 
the Teeth of their Enemy j and then indeed the three Hal- 
bards they had, were of Ufe to them j and they would of- 
ten drive a whole little Army before them, with thofe 



fialbards and fbarpned Sticks put into the Muzzles of thdr 
Muskets : But that for all this they were fbmetimes 
furrounded with Multitudes, and in great Danger from 
their Arrows 5 till at laft they found the Way to make 
themfelves large Targets of Wood, which they covered 
with Skins of wild Beafts, whofe Names they knew not ; 
and thefe covered them from the Arrows of the Savages 1 
that notwithftanding thefe, they were fometimes in great 
Danger, and were once five of them knocked down toge- 
ther with the Clubs of the Savages, which was the Time 
when one of 'em was taken Prifoner j that is to fay, >thc 
Spaniard, whom I had relieved: That at firfl they thought 
had been killed. But when afterwards they heard he was 
taken Prifoner, they were under the greatefl: Grief ima- 
^nable, and would willingly have all ventured their Lives 
to have rescued him. 

. They told me. That when they were fo knocked down, 
the refl of their Company refcu'd them, and flood over 
them, fighting till they were come to themfelves, all but 
him who they thought had been dead ; and then they made 
their Way with tlieir Halbards and Pieces, flandin^ clofe 
together in a Line, thro' a Body of above a thoufand Sa- 
vages, beating down all that came in their Way, got the 
Victory over their Enemies, but to their great Sorrow, be- 
cauic it was v/ith the lofs of their Friend 5 who, the other 
Party finding him alive, carry'd off with fome others, as I 
gave an Account in my former. 

They defcrib*d mofl afFedionatdy, how they were 
furprix'd with Joy at the Return of their Friend and Com- 
panion in Mifery, who they thought had been devoured 
By wild Beafts of the worfl Kind, (viz,) by wild Men 5 
and yet how more and more they were uirpriz'd with the 
Account he gave them of his ^ Errand, and that there was 
a Chriflian in any Place, near, much, more one that was 
able, and had Humanity enough to contribute to their De* 
liverancc. 

They defcrib'd how they were aflonifh'd at the Sight 
of the Relief I fent them, and at the Appearance of Loaves 
pf Bread, Things they had not feen flnce their coming to 
that miferable Pkcej how often they croffed it, and blcfTcd 
it AS Bread fent from Heavenj and what a reviving Cor* 
dial it was to their Spirits to tafte it) as alfo of the other 



(P7) 

Things I had ient for their Supply. And after alt, they would 
have told me fbmething of the Joy they were in, at the 
Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them away to the Perion 
and Place from whence all thefe new Comforts came, but 
they told me it was impofllble to exprefs it by Words, for 
their excelfive Joy, naturally driving them to unbecoming 
Extravagancies, they had no Way to deicribe them, but by 
telling me that they bordered upon Lunacy, having no 
Way to give Vent to their Pafl'ion, fuitable to the Senie 
that was upon themj that inlfome it v/orkcd one Way, 
and m feme another j and that fbme of them, thro' a Sur* 
prize of Joy, would burft out into Tears 5 others be half 
mad, and^ others immediately faint. This Difcourfe ex- 
treamly aflecfled me, and called to my mind Friday's Ex- 
tacy, when he met his Father, and the poor People's Ex- 
tacy, w^hen I took them up at Sea, after their Ship was 
on iire: The Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found him- 
felf delivered in the Place where lie expected to peiifn; 
and my own Joy when after 18 Years Captivity, I tbunrf- 
a good Ship ready to carry me to my own Country : All 
theie Things made me more ienlible of the Relation of 
thofe poor Men., and more affected with it. 
. Having thus given a View of the State of Things, 
as I found them, I muft relate the Heads of what I 
did . for theie People, and the Condition in which I left 
them. It was their Opinion and mine too, that they 
would be troubled no more with the Savages j or that if 
they were, they would be able to cut them off, iixhty 
were twice as many as before ,• £0 they had no Concern a-- 
bout that : Then I entred into a ferious Difcourfe with 
the Spaniard whom I call'd Governour, about their Stay in 
the lilandi for as I was not come to carry any of them 
off, lb it wpuld not be juft to carry off fbme, and leave 
others, whp perhaps would be unwilling to (lay, if their 
Strength was diminiflied. 

„ On the other Hand, I told them, I came to e/lablifli 
therd there, not to remove them 5 and then I let them 
know, that I had brought witlt me Relief of fundrr Kinds 
for them 5 That I had been at a great Charge to ihpply them 
with all Things neceilary, as well for their Convenience, 
as their Defence ; and that I had fuch md fuch particular 
Perfbns with me, as well to encreaie and recruit tlieir 
E NumLcr, 



(P8) 

Number, as by the particular neceflary Employments wliich 
tlicy were bred to, being Artificers, to aflift them in thofe 
Things, in which, at prefent, they were to feek. 

They were altogether when I talk'd thus to them; 
and before I delivered to *em the Stores I had brought, I ask'd 
them one by onejf they had entirely forgot,and bury'd the firft 
Animofities i-Hat had been among them^ and could fliake hands 
with one another, and engage in a ftridl Friend Ihip and Union 
of Intcreft, that fp there might be no more Mifiinderftandings 
orjealo'ifies. 

William Atkins, with abundance of Franknefs and good 
Humour, faid, They had met with Afflictions enough to 
make them all fbber, and Enemies enough to make them 
all Friends ,• that for his Part he would live and die 
with them ,• and was fo far from defigning any Thing 
againU: the Sfmvardsy that he own*d they nad done nothing 
•to him, but what his own mad Humour. made neceffary, 
and what he would have done, and perhaps much worfe 
in their Cafe i and that he would ask them Pardon, if I 
delired it, for the foolifli and brutifh Things he had done 
to them i and was very willing and dclirous of living in 
Terms of entire Friendfliip and Union with them ; and 
would do any Thing that lay in his Power to convince 
them of it j and as for going to England, he car'd not if 
he did not go thither theie twenty Years. 

The Spaniards iaid. They had indeed at firft difarm'd 
and excluded fVflL Atkins ana his two Countrymen for 
- their ill Condud:, as they had let me know j and they ap- 
peai'd to me. for the NecefTity they were under to do io: 
But tliat William Atkins had behav'd himfelf fo bravely in 
the great Fight they had with the Savages, and on ieveral 
Occalicns fmce j and had iliew'd himfelf ib faithful to,and con- 
cern'd for, the general Intereft of them all, that they had 
fbi gotten all that was paft, and thought he merited as much 
to be trufted with Arms, and fiipply*d with NecefTaries 
as any of them j ^nd that they had teftify'd their Satif- 
l^ittion in Kirn, by committing the Command to him, ' 
next to th^.'Govei|iour himfelf , And as they had an entire 
Cetnfidence 'in him and all Hs Countrymen, fb they ac- 
toowledge'd they -had nferited that Confidence by all the 
Methods that honeft Men could merit to be valued, and 
trufted i and they moft heartily cmbrac'd the Occafi- 

■ ■ on 



(99) 

on of giving me this AfilirancCi tliat they would nev^ 
have any Tntereft feperate from one another. 

Upon thefe frank and open Declarations of Friend- 
Hup, we appointed the next Day to dine all together j and 
indeed wc made a iplendid Feaft ; I caufed the Ship's Cook 
and his Mate to come on Shore, and drefs our Dinner j 
and the old Cook's Mate we had on Shore, affift- 
cd : We brought on Shore fix Pieces of good Beef, and 
four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's Provilion, with our 
Punch-Bowl, and Materials to fill it j and in particular, I 
gave them ten Bottles of ^French Claret, and ten Bottles of 
'EngliJIj Beer 5 Things that neither the Spaniards, or the 
BngliJJjmen had tafted for many Years j and which, it may 
be fiippoied, theywere exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our Feaft five whole Kids, 
which the Cooks roafted j and three of them were fent 
covered up dole, on Board the Ship, to the- Seamen, that 
they might Feaft on frefti Meat from on .Shore, as we did 
with their Salt Meat from on Board. 

After this Feaft, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, wherein, that 
there might be no Difpute about dividing, I ftiew'd them 
there was flifficient for them all ,* and defir'd that they might 
ail take an equal Quantity of the Goods that we^e for 
wearing j that is to fky, equal when made up ,• as firft, I 
diftributed Linnen flifficient to rrtake every one of them 
four Shirts } and at the Spaniards Keqncik afterwards, made 
them up fix ; thefe were exceeding comfortable to them, 
having been what, as I may {ay, they had long lince for- 
got the Uie of, or what it was to wear them. 

I allotted the thin Engiijlj Stuffs, which I mention'd be- 
fore, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, which 
I judged fitteft for the Heat of the Seilbn ; cool and loolc, 
and order'd, that whenever they decajed, they fhould 
make more, as they thought fit: The like tor Pumps, Shoes, 
Stockings and Hats, (^c, 

I cannot exprefs what PleaiUre, what Satisfaction, iat 
upon the Countenances of all thefe poor Men, when they 
faw the Care I had taken of them, and how v/ell I had 
furnifh'd them i they told me, I was a Father to theni, and 
that having fuch a CorreQ)ohdeat as I was, in fc remote 
a Part of Sic World, it would make them forget that they 

E i were 



( 100 ) 

were left in a defolate Place 5 and they all vokntarlly en- 
gag'd to mc not to leave the Place without my Confent. 

Then I prefented to them the People I had bi ought 
with me, paiticulaily the Taylor, the Smith, and the two 
Carpenters, all of them moH neccilary People j but a- 
bove all, my general Artificei% than whom they could not 
Name any Thing that was more ufeful to them 5 and 
the Taylor, to ll.ew his Concern for them, went to work 
imm.ediately, and, with my Leave, made them every one 
a Shnt the firfl Thing he did 5 and which was fllll more, 
he taught the Women, not only ihow to fow and ftitch, 
and uie the Needle, but made them affift to make the 
Shirts for their Husbands, and for all the reft. 

A s to the Carpenters, I fcarce need mention, how ufe- 
ful they were, for they took in Pieces all my clamfy, un« 
handy Things, and made them clever convenient Tables, 
Stools, Bcd-iieads, Cup-boards, Lockers, Shelves, and every 
thing they wanted of that Kind. 

B u T to let them fee how Nature made Artificers at 
flrii, I carried the Carpenters to fee PVill'mrn Atkhis's Ba- 
sket-houie, as I call'd it, and they both own'd they never 
iaw an Inflance of fuch natural Ingenuity before ; nor any 
Thing £0 regular, and fb handily built, at leaft of its Kind : 
And one of them, when he mv it, after mufing a good 
while, turning about to me, I am fure, ikjs he, that Man 
has no ncedot us, you need do nothing but give him Tools. 

Then I brougnt them out all my Store of Tools, and 
gave every Man a Digging Spade, a Shovel, and a Rake, 
for we had no Harrows or Plows h and to every feperatc . 
Place, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a broad- Ax, and a Saw 5 always 
appointing, that as often as any were broken, or worn out, 
tluy fl:ould be fupply'd without grudging, out of thege- 
nei al Stoi cs that I left behind. 

Nails, Sraj)les, Hinges, Hammers, ChifTcls, Knives, 
SciHars, and all Ibrts of Tools, and Iron-work, they had 
without Tale, as they required, for no Man would care to 
take more than they wanted, and he muft be a Fool that would ' 
waft or fpoil tliem, on any Account whatever j and for 
the Ufe ot the Smith, I left two Ton of unwrought Iron for 
a Supply. 

M Y Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I brought 
them, was fuch, even to Prt>fufion^ that they could not 

but 



( loi r 

but rcjoyce at them, for now they could march as I ufed 
to do, with a Musket jupon each Shoulder, if there was 
Occafion, and were able to fight a Thouiand Savages, if 
they had but fbrne little Advantages of Situation, which 
alfo they could not mifs of, if they had Occaiion. 

I cany d on Shore with me the youne Man, whofe 
Mother was flatv'd to Death,, and the Maid alfo, Oric was 
a ibber well Educated Religious young Woman, and be- 
hav 'dfb jnoffeniively^ that every one gave her a good Word; 
flie had indeed an unliappy Life with us, there being no 
Woman in the Ship but herfclf 3 but fix bore it with Pa- 
tience : After a while feeing Things fo well ordered, and 
in £0 fine a Way pf thriving Upon my Ifland, and conii^ 
dering that they had neither Bulinefs or Acquaintance in the 
lEafl-Indies, or Reaibnfor taking {o long a Voyage : I lay, con- 
M^dng all this, both of them came to me,. and deiired 1 
would give them Leave to remain on the Ifland, and be 
enter'd among my Family, as they call'd it. 

I AGREED to it readily, and they had, a little Plat pf 
Ground allotted to them, whTsre theyhad three Tents or 
Houfes fet up, fiirrounded with a Basket-work, Palliiado'd likd 
Atkins's, and adjoining to his Plantation : Their Tents were 
contriv'd, £0 that they had each of them a Room apart 
to lodge in, and a middle Tent like a great Store-houie to 
lay all their Goods in, and to eat aiid drink in^ and now 
the other two Englif^jmm'icmov'd their Habitation to the 
fame Place, and fo the Ifland -^as divided into three Colo- 
nies and no more, "viz the Spaniards with old Iridfty, and 
the firft Servants, at my old Habitation under the Hill 5 
which was, in a Word, the capital Cityj and where they 
had £0 enlargd and extended their Works, as well under 
as on the outfide of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho* perfe6lly 
conceafd, yet full at large -: Never was there fiicfe a little 
City in a Wood, and vo hid, I believe, in any Part of the 
World J for I verily believe, a thoufand Men might have 
* rang'd the Ifland a Month, and \£ they had not known thcic 
was fuch a Thing, and look'd on purpofe for it, they 
Would not have found it 4 for the Trees ftood fo thick and 
£0 clofe, and grew £0 f^ft matte 'd into one another, that 
nothing but cutting them down firli, could difcover the 
Place 5 except the tWo narrow Entrances, where they went 
ki and out, could be found, which was not Vi?ty eafyi one

0f them was juft down at the Water's Edge on the Side 
of the Creek, and it was afterwards above two hundred 
Yards to the Place j and the other was up the Ladder at 
twice, as I have already formerly deicrib'd iti and they load 
a large Wood thick planted alfo, on the Top of the Hill, 
which contained above an Acre, which grew apace, and 
cover d the Place from all Dilcovery there, with only one 
narrow Place between two Trees not eafy to be diicova'd> 
to enter on that Side. 

The other Colony was that of UllL uitk/ns's, where 
there were four Famines of EngUJhmeny I mean thofe I had 
kft there, with their Wives andf Children 5 three Sava^s 
that were Slaves j the Widow and Children of the Engl^- 
man that was kill 'd 5 the young Man and the Maidi and 
by the Way, we made a Wife, of her alio, before we went 
away: There* were alfo the two Carpenters and the Tay- 
lor, who I brought with me for them j alfo the Smitl^ 
who was a very neceflary Man to them, e^ecially as t 
Ganfmith, to take care of their Armsj and my other Man, 
'W'ho I call'd, fack of all Trades j who was in himfelf as 
good, almofl as twenty Men, for he was not only a verf 
ingenious Fellow, but a very merry Fellow, and before I 
went away» we marry'd him to thehoneft Maid that came 
with the Youth in the Ship, who I mentioned before. 

A K D now I ipeak of Marrying, it brings me naturally 
to £y fomething of the French Ecdefiaftic that I had brought 
with me out of the Ship's Crew, who I took up at Sea. 
It is true, this Man was a jR(?w/«», and perhaps it may give 
Offence to fome hereafter, if Heave ^y Thing extraordinary 
upon Record, of a Man, who, before I begin, I muil, (to fot 
liim out in juft Colours) repreient in Terms very much to his 
Difadvantage, in the Account of Proteftants ^ sLsfirJI, that 
he was zTafifl-y fecondl^, a Popifh Prieft j md thirdly yOL 
trench Popifh Prieft. 

But Juftice demands of me to give him a due Charac- 
ter j and I muft fay, he was a grave, fober, pious, and mod 
religious Perfon 1 exadi: in his Life, extenfive in his Chari- 
ty, and exemplar in almoft everv Thing he did j what 
tficn can any one lay, againfl my oeing veryienlible of the 
Value of fuch a Man, notwithilanding his Profeffion ? 
Though it may be my Opinion, perhaps, as well as the 
Opinion of others, who fliaU reaa this, that he was nii- 
Jtakcn. ; The 



The firil Hour that I began to converfe with him, ^ 
tcr he had agreed to go with me to the Eaft-Ind'tes, I found 
Rcafon to delight exceedingly in his Conver^tion 5 and he 
firfl began with me about Religion in the moft obliging 
Manner imaginable. 

S I R, {ays he, you have not only, under God, (and at 
that he aofsd his Breaft) fav'd my Life, but you have ad- 
mitted me to go this Voyage in your Ship, and by your 
obliging Civility have taken me into you Family, giving 
me an Opportunity of free Convei fation . Now Sir, fays 
he, you fe by my Habit, what my Profefllon is, andi^l 
guefs by your Nation what yours is : I may think it is my 
Buty, and doubtiefs it is fo, to ufe my utmoft Endeavours, 
on ail Occafions, to bring all the Souls I can to the Know- 
ledge of the Truth, and to embrace theCatholickDo6trinei 
but as I am here under your Permilfion, and in your Fa- 
mily, I am bound in Jujftice to your Kindnefs, as well as 
in Decency and good Manners, to be under your Govern- 
ment 5 and therefore I fliallnot, without your Leave, enter 
into any Debates on the Points of Religion, in which wc 
-may not agiee, farther than you Ihall give me Leave. 

I T o L D him, his Carriage was £0 modeft, that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we were £\xch 
People as they called Hereticksi but that he was not the 
firft Catholick that I had converse with, without falling; 
into any Inconveniencies, or carrying the Queftions to any 
Height in Debate; That he fliould not find himfelf the 
the worfe us'd for being of a different Opinion from us, 
and if we did not converfe without any Diflike on either 
Side upon that Score, it would be his Fault, not ours. 

H E reply'd, that he thought our Converfation might 
be eafily feparated from Difputes: That it was not his Bu- 
iineis to cap Principles with every Man he difcoursM with j 
and that he rather delir*d me to converfe with him as a 
Gentleinan, than as a Religieufci that if I would give him 
Leave at any Time to difcourfe upon religious Subjeds, 
he would readily comply with it j and that then, he did 
not doubt but I would allow him alfb to defend his own 
Opinions, as well as he could i . but that without my 
Leave, he would not break in upon me with any fuch 
Thing, 

E4 u^ 



( i04 ) 

II i told me farther, that he would not ceaic to do all 
tlrnt becanne him in his Office, as a Prieft, as well as a 
private Chriflian, to procure the good of the Ship, and the 
Safety of all that was in her 5 and though perhaps we 
would not join with him, and he could not pi ay n'ith us, 
he liop'd he might pray for us, which he would do upcn 
all Occalions : In this Manner we conversed, and as he 
was of a moft obliging Gentleman-like Bchaviovr ,• fo he 
v.'^as, if I may be allow'd to fvij £0, a Man of good Scnfe, 
and as Fbelieve, of great Learning. 

H E gave me a moft diverting Account of his Life, and 
of the many extraordinary Events of itj of many Adven- 
tures which had befallen him in the few Years that he had 
been abroad in the World, and particularly this was very 
remarkable, (viz,) That during the Voyage he was now 
cngag'd in, he had the Misfortune to be ^ve Times fliip'd 
and unfhip'd, and never to go to the Place whither any of 
the Ships, he was in, wore at firft defign'd : That his lirft 
Intent was to have gone to Marfinico, and that he went 
on board a Ship bound thither, at St. Mah j but being 
Ibrc'd into lisi^on, by bad Weather, the Ship received Tome 
Damage, by running a-ground in the Mouth of the River 
Tagus, and was oblig'd to unload her Cargo there ^ that 
finding a Tottuguefe Ship there botind to the Moderns, and 
tesAy to iail, suid {iipppfing he ihould eafily meet with 
t yclTel there bound to Mm-tmico 5 he went on board, in 
order to fail to the Maderas $ but the Mafter of the PortU" 
^uefe Ship being but an indiflfaent Mariner, had been out 
m his Reckoning, and they drove to Flalj where, howe- 
ver he happened to find a very good Market for his Car- 
go, which was Corn, and therefore refblv'd not to go to 
the Maderas, but to load Salt at the IJle of May, and to go 
away to Newfrnndlmd : He had no Remedy in this Exi- 

f?nce, but to go with the Ship, and had a pretty good 
oyage as ht as the Banks, £0 they call the Place where 
they catch the Fifh, where meeting with a French Ship, 
bound from Frmce to ^ehck, in tlie River of Canada, 
and from thence to Mart'mico, to carry Provifions, he 
thought he fliould have an Opportunity to compicat his 
firil: Defign: But when he came to^ehck, the Mafter of 
the Ship dy'dy and the Ship proceede3 no farther ^ £0 the 
mxt Voyage he difd himielf for France, in the Ship

that \^as burnt, when we took thpm up at Sea, and then 
fliip'd them with us for the Eaji-Indies, as I have already 
faid : Thus he had been difappointed in five Voyages, ail, 
as I may call it, in one Voyage, belldes what I fhall have 
Occafion to mention farther of the iame Perfon, 

B u T, I Ihall not make Digreflions into other Mens Sto- 
ries, which have no Relation to my own. I return to 
what concerns our Affair in the Ifland : He came to me 
one Morning, for he lodg'd among us, all the wMie v/e 
were upon the Ifland j and it happen'd to be juft when I 
was going to vilit the E?}glij%men's Colony, at the farthefl 
P-art of the Ifland j I fay, he came to me and told me, 
with a very grave Countenance, that he had for two or 
three Days delir'd an Opportunity of fome Difcourfe wirh 
me, which he hop'd fl;ouldnot be diipleafingto me, becauie 
he thought it might in fome Meafure corrclpond with my 
general Defign, which was the Profperity 61 my new Co- 
lony, and perhaps might put it, at lead more than he yet 
thought it was, in the VHy of God's Bleifing. 

I look'd a little furpriz'd at the lafl Part of his Dii- 
courle, and turning a little fliort, How Sir I laid I, can it 
Be faid, that we are not in the Way of God's BiefTmg, af- 
ter iiich vifible AJJiftances, and wonderful Deliverances a$ 
we have leen here, and of which I have given yoH large 
Account ? 

I F you had pleas'd Sir, faid he (with a World of Modcfly, 
and yet with great Read-mfs) to have heard me, you would 
have found no room to have been difplcafed, much lefs to 
think fo hard of me, that I fnould fuggeft, that you have 
not had wonderful AfTiflances and Deliverances j and I 
Hope, on your Behalf, that you are in the Way of God's 
Bleffing, and your De%n is exceeding good, and will proC- 
per : But Sir, faid he, tho' it were more fb, than is even 
pofTible to you, yet there may be fome among you that 
are not equally right in their Anions : And you knov/, 
that in the Story of Xfracl, one Achan in the Camp re-* 
mov'd God's Blefling from them, and turn'd his Hand £0 
againft them, that {f^ and thirty of them, though not con- 
ceui'din the Crime, were the Objedls of Divine Vengeance, 
and bore the Weight of that Punifhment. 

I WAS fenfibly touch d with his Difcourfe, and toli 

him hi$ Inference was fojuil:, and the whole Defign feem d

fb fincere, and was really fo religious in its own Nature, 
tlmt I was very foiTy I had interrupted him, and begg'd 
hini to go on j and in the mean Time, becauie it feem'd,- 
that what we had both to fay, might take upibme Time, 
I told him, I was going to the EngliJJjmen's Plantations, 
and ask'd him to go with me, and we might difcourle of 
it. by the Way: He told me, he would more willingly 
-wait on me thither, becauie there partly the Thing was 
adled, which he defir'd to Ipeak to me about j fo we walk'd 
on, and I prels*d him to be free and plain with me, in 
what he had to iay . 

Why then Sir, fays he, be plcas'd to give me Leave to. 
lay do^vn a few Propoiitions, as the Foundation of what I 
have to fay, that we may not differ in the general Principles^. 
tlio* we may be of fome differing Opinions in the Piac- 
tice of Particulars. Firfl:, Sir, tho' we differ in ibme of 
the Do6i:rinal' Articles of Religion i and it is very unhappy 
that it is fb, efpeciaily in the Cafe before us, as I fliall fhew 
afterwards : Yet there are fome general Principles in which 
wc both agree, f^/^i.) firft. That there is- a God j and- that 
this God naving given us Ibme flated general Rules for our 
Service and Obedience, we ought not willingly and know- 
ingly to offend him ,• either by negle<^ing to do what he 
has CQimmandcd, or by doing what he ixas exprefly forbid- 
den: And. let our different Religions be what they wilL 
this general Principle is readily own'd by us all,. That the 
BI 'fling of God: does not ordinarily folbw a prefumptuous 
f nning againfl his Command i and every good' Chriflian. 
will be a&dionately concerned to prevent any that are un- 
der his Care, living in z tot2\^ Ncgle<S!: of God and his 
^^ommmandsk It is not your Men being frot?fiantSy what- 
ever my Opinion may be of fuch, that difcharges me fiom 
being concerned for their Souls, and from endeavouring, if 
it lies before me,, that they fliould Xxmc in a.^ little Diflance- 
fyom and Enmity with their Maker, as pofftblfe j efpe- 
ciaily, if you give me Leave to meddle & far in your Cir- 
cuit. 

I r Chu L i> not yet imagine wl|at he aim*d at, and told 
hlra, I granted all he had faid, and thank'd hirn, that he 
v/ouid i> far concern himfclf for usf and begg'd he would 
i?;rjr.ui t]i<: Particulars of wllat he had obierv*d, that like 



(ro7) 

yojhua, to take his own Parable, I migiit put away tht 
accuried Thing from us. 

Why then. Sir, y^j he, I will take the Liberty you 
give mci and there are three Things, which, if I am rights 
mufl fland in the Way of God*s Blefling upon your En- 
deavours here, and which I fliould rejoice for your Sake, 
and their own, to iee rcmov'd. And, Sir, fays he, I pro-^ 
mife mjMiy that you will fuUy agree with me in tti^m 
all, as fbon as I name them j efpecially, becauic I flmll con- 
vince you, that every one of tbem may, with great Eaie^ 
and very much to your Satisfiidrion, be remedy'd. 

H E gave me no Leave to put in any more Civilities^ 
but went on. Firfi, Sir, fays he, you have here four Eng- 
Itfimeriy who have fetch'd Women from among the Sava- 
ges, and have taken them as their Wives, and have had 
many Children by them all, and yet are not marry'd ta 
them after any llated legal Manner, as the Laws of GoJ 
and Man require j and therefore are yet, in the Scnie oF 
both, no lefs than Adulterersy and living in Adultery, To- 
this, Sxv, fays he, I know vou will objciSi: $ that there was 
no Clergyman or Priell or any Kind, or of any ProfeiTion, 
to perform tlie Ceremony j nor any Pen and Ink, or Pa- 
per, or write down a Coiitracfl of Marriage, and have it 
i'gn'd between them. And I know alio, Sir, wRat the 
Spaniard Governour has told you j I mean of the Agree* 
ment rhat heoblig'd them to make, when they took thclg 
Women, (viz.,) That they iliould cliule them out by Cont 
fcnt, and keep feparately to them j which,, by the Way, 
is nothing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Wonici^, 
as Wives, but only an Agreement among thcmilives, to 
keep them from qaarrelling. 

1j u t, Sir, the Eilenceof the Sacrament of Matrimony 
(lb he call'd it, being a Roman) coniifts not only in the 
mutual Conient of the Parties to take one another, as Man 
and JVife, but in the formal and legal .Obligation, that there 
is \n the Contrail, to compel the Man and Womrn at all 
Times,, to own and acknowledge each other; o^^liging the 
Man to abf bin fom nil other W^omcn, to. tngz'iQ in no 
other Contract Vv'hile thcie fubiifl: ; zn^ on all OccabO:i% 
as. Ability allows, to provide honeilly for- them and rlvcir 
Children i and to o' lige the Woman to tiie lame, or like 
Conditions, m^taus rrmtandis^ on their Side. 



(lo8> 

Now, Sir, f/iyshe^ thefe Men may, when they pleafe, 
or when Occalion prefents, abandon thefe Women, dif- 
own their Children^ leave them to pei'ifli, and take other 
Women, and marry them whilft thefe are living. And 
here he added, with fome Warmth, How, Sir, is God ho- 
noured in this unlawful Liberty? And how flail aBleiTing 
;(ucceed your Endeavours in this Place, However good in 
them/eh es, and however fincere in your Bejigny while thefe 
Men, who at prelent are your Subje6i:s, under your abfb^ 
lute GovGnment and Dominion, are alio w'd by you to live 
in open Adultery ? 

I CONFESS, I was ftruck at the Thing it felf, but 
much more with the convincing Arguments he iiipported 
it with i for it was certainly true, that though they had 
no Clergyman upon die Spot, yet a formal Contia6i on 
both Sicks, made before Witncfles, and confirm 'd by any 
Token, which they had all agreed to be bound by, though 
it had been but the breaking a Stick between them, en- 
gaging the Men to own theie Women for their Wives, 
upon all Occafions i and never to abandon them or their 
Childien, and the Women to the fame with their Uuf- 
lands, had been an ci!e<5lual lawful Marriage in the 
Sight of God i and it was a great Negled that it was not 
done. 

B u t I thought to have gotten ofp with my young Priefl, 
by telling him, that all that Part was done when I was 
not here, and they had liv'd {q many Years with them 
now, that if it was an Adultery, it was pall Remedy, 
they could do nothing in it now. * 

S I R, fays he^ asking your Pardon for fuch F R E E - 
J) ,o M, you are right in this, that it being done in 
your Abiencc, you could not te cliarged witii that Part 
of the Crime : But I beieech you, flatter not your 
ielf, that you are not therefore under an Obligation 
to do your utmoft now, to put an End to it : How 
can you think, but that, let the Time paft lie on 
yj\\o it will, all the Guilt, for the Future, will lie 
entirely upon you ? Becaufe if is certainly in your 
Power now to put an End to it, and in no Body's 
Power bit yours. 

1 WAS fo dull ilil, that I dii^ not take him rights but I 
in'iagin'd, that by putting an End to it, he meant that I 

fl-ould 



( 109 ) 

fhould part them, and not fuffer them to live together any 
longer : And I faid to Um, I could not do that by any 
Means, tor that it would put the whole Illand into Con- 
fulion-. He feem'd furpriz'd that I fhould £o far miflake 
him. No, Sir, fays JI;e, I do not mean, that you fliould 
now fepaiate them, but legally and effectually marry them 
now 5 and as. Sir, my Way of marrying them may not be 
fo eafy to reconcile them to, tho' it will hq as eiTe£l:ual, 
even by your own Laws, lb your Way may be as well be- 
fore God, and as valid among Men j 1 mean, by a written 
Contrail:, fign'd by both Man and Woman, and by all the 
Witnefles prefent, which all the Laws of Europe would de- 
cree to be valid. 

I WAS amaz'd to fee fb much true Piety, and fo much 
Sincerity of Zeal, befides the unudial Impartiality in his 
Difcouiie, as to his own Party or Church j and flicha true 
W^armth for the preferving People that he had no Know- 
ledge of, or Relation to j I fay, for preferving them from 
tranfg; effing the Laws of God j the Kke of which, I had 
indeed not met with anywhere: But recollecting what he 
had laid, of marrying them by a written Contra£t, which 
1 knew would ffand too ; I returned it back upon him, and 
told him, I granted all that he had iaid to be juil, and on 
his Part very kind, tliat T would difcourfe with the Men upon 
the Point now, when I came to them : And I knew no 
Reafbn why they fliou'd fcruple to let him marry them all, 
which I knew well enough would be granted to be as au- 
tlientick and valid in England^ as if they were marry'd by 
one of our own Clergymen : Wliat was afterwards done 
in this Matter, I fhall fpeak of it by it felf. 

I THEN prefs'd him to tell me what was the fecond Com- 
plaint which he had to make, acknowledging, tliat I was 
very much his Debtor for thefirft, and thank d him hearti*. 
ly for it. He told me, he woald ufe the iame Freedom 
and Plainnefs in the fecond, and hop'd I would take it as 
^ well : And this was, that notwithftanding thefe Englijh 
Subjedls of mine, as he calld them, had lived with thole 
Women for alraoft levcn Years, and had taught them to 
ipeak Engli/h, and even to read it j and that they were, as 
he perceiv'd. Women of tolerable Underllanding, andxapa-^ 
ble of Inllru6lion i yet they had not to this Hour taught them 
any thing ojF the Chrillian Religion i no, not fo mueh as to 

know 



( fro ) 

Icnow that tfiere was a God, or a Worfhip, or in what Man- 
ner God was to be ierved, or that their own Idolatry, and 
worfliipping they knew not who, was falfe and abfurd. 

This, he laid, was an unaccountable Negle<5l, and what 
God would certainly call them to account for, and perhaps- 
at laft take the Work out of their Hands : He fpokc this 
very afie£i:ionately and warmly ^ I am perfwaded, Jnys he, 
had thofe Men lived in the favage Country, whence their 
Wives came, the Savages would have taken more Pains to- 
have brought them to be Idolaters, and to worfliip the De- 
vil, than any of theie Men, fo fi^r as he could fee^ had taken ■ 
with them to teach 4:hem the Knowledge of the true God : 
Now, Sivyf^id he, tho' I do not acknowledge your Reli- 
gion, or you mine, yetweHiould" be all glad to iee the De- 
vil s Servants, and the Subjc<9:s of his Kingdom, taught to 
knov/ the general Principles of the Chriilian Religion ,* that 
they iruglit, at leafl, hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and 
of the Reriirre£fion, and of a future State, Things which 
w^e all believe ,• they had at leafl: been fo much nearer com- 
ing into the Bofbm of the true Church, than they are now 
in the pubjick Profeflion of Idolatry, and Devil- worfhiip. 
I couLO hold no longer j I took him in my Arms, and 
cmbrar d him with an Excels, of Paflion : Horo far, laid I 
to him, have I lieen from underftanding the moil eflential 
Part of n Chriftian, (viz,,) to love the kitereft of theChri- 
ftian CI lurch, and the good of other Mens Souls? I Icarce 
have kn/^wn what belongs to being a Chriftian: O, Sir, 
do not fay fo, rcply'd he, this Thing is not your Fault : No, 
fnys J, biit vvhj did I never lay it to Heart as well as you ? 'Tis 
not too late yet,\/^/i/ he, be not too forward to condemn 
your ic]^: : But vvhat can be done now, faid /, you fee I 
am g'xing away? Will you give me Lc3.ve, faui he, to talk 
fvith tiioie poor Men about it? Yes, with all ray Heart, 
/aid ^, and will oblige them to give heed to what you fay 
too: As to that, /kfd he, we miift leave them to the Mer- 
cy of Chrilij but tis our Buiinefs to allift them, cocoa- " 
rage them, and iiiftiiufl: thenij and if you will give me 
fccive, and God his BleiTing,. f do not doubt but the poor

Thanks for it 5 What follow'd on this Account, I (haW 
mention alfo again in its Place. 

I NOW prefs'd him for the third Article, in which we 
were to blame j Why really, fays he, it is of the fame Na- 
ture, and I will proceed, asking your Lea^e, with the fame 
Plainnefs as before j it is about your poor Savages yonder, 
who are, as I may lay, your conquered Subje6ls : It is a 
Maxim, Sir, that isy or ought to be received among all Chri- 
ftians, of wlmt Church, or pretended Church foever, {viz..)- 
That Chrifiian Knowledge ought ta be fropagated hy ail fof- 
Jible Means y and on all pJpHe OccaJ-ons: Tis on this Prin-^ 
ciple that our Church fends Miffionai ies into Pe'tyia, India, 
and China, am.1 that our Clergy, even of the fuperior Sort, 
willingly engage in the moil hazardous Voyages, and the 
moil dangerous Refidence among Muvthei-ers and Barbari- 
ans, to teach them the Knowledge of the true God, and to 
bring them over to embrace the Chrifiian Faith : Now,^ 
Sir, you have iuch an Oppoitunity here, to have fix or fe- 
ven and Thiity poor Savages brought over horn Idolatry 
to the Knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that 
I wonder how you can pa£s fuchan Occalion of doing Good, 
which is really worth the Expence of a Man's whole Lite. 

I WAS now ftruck Dumb indeed, and had not one Word- 
to fay : I had here a Spirit of true Chrifiian Zeal for God 
and Religion before me, let his particular Principles be of 
what kind Ibever j as for me, I had not £0 mucn as enter- 
tain d a Thought of this in my Heart before, and I believe- 
flaould not have, thouglit of it> for T look'd upon thefe Sa- 
vages as Slaves, and People, who, had we any Work for 
them to do, we would ha' ufed as fuch, or would have 
been glad to Iiave traniportcd them to any other Part of 
the World; for our Buiinefs was to get rid of them, an<:l' 
we would all have lecn fatisfy^d, if they had been ient ta 
any Country, £0 they had never feen their own : But to the 
Oife, I fay, I, was confounded at his Difcoutfe, and knew, 
* not what Anfwcr to make him: He look'd earneflly at 
me, iceiog me in fome Diforder,- Sir, fays he, J (li^all be 
very forry, if what I have faid gives you any Oflence: 
No, no„/m I, I am ofiendtd with no Body but my 
felf j but 1 am perfe6lly onfounded, irot only to think 
that I ihould never take any Notice o£* this before, but 
witk rcfleding what Notice I am. able ta take .of it. 



now 



(m) 

now J You know, Sir, faU i, what Clrcumftanccs T am 
in, I am bound to the Eaft^lndies^ in a Ship freighted by 
Merchants, and to whom it would be an unflifferable piece 
of Injuftice to detain their Ship here, the Men lying all this 
while at Vi6luals and Wages upon the Owner's Account j 
It is true, I agreed to be ailow'd twelve Days here, and if 
I fray more, I muft pay 3 /, Sterling per Diem Demorage, 
nor can I flay upon Demorage above eight Days more, 
and I have been here thirteen Days already, fo that I am 
perfe<ftly unable to engage in this Work, unlefs I would 
fuficr my felf to be left behind here again, in which Cafe, 
if this fmgle Ship fhould mifcarry in any part of her Voy- 
age, I fhould be juft in the fame Condition that I was left 
in here at firft, and from which I have been £0 wonder- 
fully deHvered. 

H E own'd the Cafe was very hard upon me, as to my 
Voyage j but laid it home upon my Confcience, whether 
the Bleiring of faving feven and .thirty Souls, was not worth 
my venturing all 1 had in the World for? I was not fb 
fenfible of that as he was, and I returned upon him thus; 
Why, Sir, it is a valuable Thing indeed, to be an Inftru- 
ment in God's Hand to convert feven and thirty Heathens 
to the Knowledge of Chiift, but as you are an Ecclefia- 
ftick, and are given over to that Work, fb that it feems 
naturally to fall into the Way of your ProfeiTion ^ how is 
k then, that you do not rather ofier your felf to undertake 
it, than prefs me to it ? 

Upon this he fac'd about, jufl before me, aswewalk'd 
along, and putting rjie to a full Stop, made me a very low 
Bow ; I moft heartily thank God and you. Sir, fays he, 
for giving me fo evident a Call to fo bleiled a Work; and 
if you think your felf difcharg'd from it, and delire rrie 
to undertake it, I will mofl readily do it, and think it a 
happy Reward for all the Hazards and Difficulties of fuch 
a broken, difappointed Voyage as I have met witli, that I 
have dropt at lafl intofo glorious a Work. 

I DISCOVERED a kind of Rapture in his Face while he 
fpoke tliis to me; his Eyes fparkeld like Fire, his Face 
glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if he had been 
Falling into Fits ; in a Word, he was fir'd With the |oy of 
being embark'd in fuch a Work : I paus'd a confitlerabtc 
whifc, before I could tell- what to fay to him, for I was 

really 



( XI3 ) 

rcallv furpriz'd to find a Man of fucli Sincerity and Zeal, 
and carry 'd out in his 7.eai, teyond tlie or<^inary Rate of 
of Men, not of his Pjofeflion only, but even of any Pro- 
fclTion whritfoever : But after I had coniider'd it a while, 
I ask'd him ierioufly if he was in carncft, and that he 
would venture on the iinglc Conllderation of an Attemj^ 
on thofe poor People, to be lock'd up in an unplanted I- 
fland for, perhaps, his Lifcj and at laft might not know 
W'hctber he fl .ould be able to do them any good, or not ? 
I i E tiirn'd 11 ort upon me, and ask'd me wliat I call d a Ven- 
tuie ? Pray, Sir, faid he, Vv^hat do you think I conientcd 
to go in your Ship to the Efifi-Indies for ? Nay, fald /, that 
I know net, unleis it was to preach to the Indians : Doubt- 
lefs it was, /aid he 5 and do you think if I can convert thefe 
fevenand thirty Men to the Faith of Chrift, it is not worth 
my time, tho' I fhould never be fetch'd off the liland a- 
gain ? Nay, is it not infinitely of more Worth to fave (q 
many Souls, than my Life is, or the Life of twenty more 
of the fame Profeffion ? Yes, Sir, fays he, I would give 
Chriil and the blefled Virgin Thanks all my Days, if i 
could be made the >kaft happy Inftrument of laving the 
Souls of theie poor Men, tho* I was never to let my Foot 
off this Ifland, or iee my native Country any more: :But 
fince you will honour me, fays he, with putting me into 
this Work, for which I will fray for you all the Days of my 
Life i I have one humble Petition to you, fasd he, beiides; 
What is th3it,faid I ? Why, fays he, it is, that you will leave 
your Man Friday with me, to be my Interpreter to them, 
and to aflift me 5 for without {bme Help I cannot Ipcak 
to them, or they to me. 

I WAS fenfibly troubled at his requeuing Friday, hecajiCc 
I could not think of parting with him, and that for man/ 
Rcafbns -, he had been the Companion of my Travels ^ he 
was not only faithful to me, but lincerely Afi"e6tionate to 
the laft degrees and I had reiblv'd to do ibmething confi- 
« derable for him, if he out-Hv'd me, as it was probable he 
would : Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be 
a Proteftant, it would quite confound him to bring him to 
embrace another Profeuion i and he would never, while his 
Eyes were open, believe that his old Mailer was an Here- 
tick, and wduld be damn'dj and this might in the End 
tuin the poor Fellow*s Principles, and £0 turn him back 
again to his firfl Idolatry. H o w* 



C 114 ) 

However, afiiddcn Thought reliev'd me in this Strait, 
atid it was thisj I told him I could not fay that I was 
willing to part with Friday on any Account whatever j 
tho' a Work that to him was of more Value than his 
Life, ought to be to me of much more Value than the 
keeping or parting with a Servant : But on the other hand, 
I was perfwaded that Friday would by no Means confent 
to part with me, and then to force him to it with- 
out his Confent, would be manifeft Injufticej bccaufelhad 
promiied I ^vould never put him away, and he had pro- 
inis'd and engag'd to me that he would never leave me, 
'imlefs I put him away, 

H E leem'd very much concerned at it, for he had no 
rational Accefs to theie poor People, feeing he did not un- 
derfland one Word of their Language, nor they one Word 
of his . To remove this Difficulty, I told him Friday's Fa- 
ther had learn'd Spam/l7» which I found he alio underftood, 
and he fliould ferve him for an Interpreter j £o he was 
much better iatisfied, and nothing coufd perfwade him but 
he would ft^y to endeavour to convert them j but Provi- 
dence gave another, and very happy Turn to all this. 

I COME back now to the firft Part of his Objections.' 
When we came to the Fnglijhmen, I fent for them all to- 

f;ether, and after fbme Account given them of what I had 
one for them* viz. what necefEry Things I had provide 
cd for them, and how they were' diftributed, which they 
were feniible of, and very thankful for 5 I began to talk ta 
them, of the fcandalous Life they led, and gave them a full 
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had akeady taken 
of it, and arguing how unchriftian and irreligious a Life it 
was : I firll ask'dthemif theywere married Men or Batche- 
lors? Theyfbon explain^ their Condition to me, andfiiew*d 
me that two of them were Widowers, and the other three 
were iingle Men, or Batchelors : I ask'd them with what 
Consciences they could take thefe Women and \\q with 
them, as they had done, call them their Wives, and have ' 
lb many Children by them, and not be marry'd lawfully 
to them ? 

They aH gave me the Ani^wa* that I expe<9:ed, viz, 
that there was no Body to marry them,} that they agreed 
before the Governour to keep them as their Wives i and 
to keep them and own them as thefr Wives,- and they 

thought, 



C n^ .) 

thought, as Things flood with them, they were as legaltf 
married as if they had been manned by a Paricii, and witht 
all the Formalities in the World. 

I TOLD them, that no doubt they were married in the 
Sight of God, and v/ere bound in Confciaice to keep tfiem 
as their Wives, but that the Laws of Men being otliervviie, 
they might pretend they were not married, and lb defcrt 
the poor Women and Children hereafter -, and that their 
Wives being poor delblate Women, friendleis and money- 
lefs, would have no Way to help themfelves : I therefore 
told them, that unleis I was afllir'd of their honefl Intent, I 
could do nothing for them,- but wonld take care that what 
I did ftiould -be for the Women and their Childrdn i-zithout 
them 5 and that unlefs tliey would ghe ibme ^iTurances 
that they wpuld marry the Women^ I could not think it 
was convenient they fliould continue together as Man andi 
Wife, for that it was both fcandalous to Men, and" ofFen- 
five to God, who they could not tliink would blefs them, if 
they went on thus. 

All this went on as I expected, and they told me, e- 
ipecially fVdl, Atkinsy who fcem'd now to fpeak for the 
reft, that they lov*d their Wives as well, as if they had been 
born in theii* own Native Country, and would not leave 
them upon any Account whatever j and they did verily believq- 
their Wives were as viituous and as modeft, and did to the 
utmoft of their Skill, as much for them and for their Children,, 
as any Women could polTibly do, and they would not part 
with them on any Account: And Will. Atkins for his own 
particular added, if any Man would take him away, and 
offer to carry him home to England, atid make him 0.p-» 
tarn of tl^ bell Man of War in the Navy, he Would not 
go with hirfi, if he might not carry his Wife and Children 
with himi and if there vvas a Clergyman in the Ship, he- 
wouM be married to her noW, with aH his Heart. 

This was juil: as I would have it j the iPriefl: was not 
' with me at that Moment, but was not far off: So to try 
him fartha*, I told him I had a Clergyman with me, and* 
if he was fincere, I would have hmi married the next 
Morning, and bid him confider of it, and talk with the reft 5. 
he 3&id, as for himfelf, he need not confider of it at all, for 
he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minifta* 
V¥ith m€> and he beUev'd they would be all willing alfo: I 

then 






< 116 ) 

then told him, tliat my Friend the Miniiler was a Trench- 
man^ and could not fpeak Erglifl), but that I Vs^ould a6i the 
Clcvk between them: l-Ie never ib much as ask'd me wlic* 
ther he was a Papiil or Prcte(bnt, which \\^as indeed what 
I was afraid of: But, I fay, they never enquired about it. 
So we pax ted, I went back to. my Clergyman, and J/Fdl. 
Atkins went in to talk with his Companions : I deiir^d 
the French GQnt\cm2Si not to fay any thing .to them, till 
the Buiincfs was thorough ripe, and I told him what An- 
fwer the ^len had given me. 

B E F o R E I went from their Quarter, they all came to 
me, and told me, they had been confidering what I had 
faid 5 that they v/ere very glad to hear I hag a Ciergymaa 
jn my Company, and they were very willing to give me 
the Satisfa6i:ion I defir'd, and to be formally married a« 
foon as I pleas 'd, for they were far from deiiring to part 
'with their Wives, and that they meant nothing but what 
was very honefl when they chofe them ,• fb I appointed 
them to meet me the next Morning, and that in the mean 
time they fliould let their Wives know the meaning of 
the Marriage-Law i and tliat it was not onjy to prevent 
any Scandal, but alfo to o'.li^e them, that they fliould not 
for fake them, whatever mignt happen. 

The Women were cafily made icnfible of the Meaning 
of the Thing, and were very well fatisfied with it, as, in- 
deed, they had Reaibn to be 3 To they fail d not to attend 
all together at my Apartment the next Morning, where I 
brought out my Clergyman j and tho' he Iiad not on a Mi- 
niftei 's Gown, after the Manner of Englmd, or the Habit 
of a Prierf, after the Manner of France , yet having a black 
Veft ibmething like a Caflbck, with a Safli round it, he 
did not look very unlike a Minifler j and as for his Lan- 
guage, I was his Inteipretcr. 

But the Serioufneis of his Behaviour to them, and the 
Scruples he made of marrying the Women, becaule they 
were not baptizd, and profcis d Chrijiians, gave them an 
exceeding Reverence for his Perfbn j and there was no need 
after that to enquire whether he was a Clergyman or no. 

Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have been 
carry 'd fb far, as that he would npt have marry 'd them at 
all J nay, notwithflanding all I was able to fay to him, he 
rciifted me, though modeflly, yet very ileadily, gnd at laft 

refufed 



( 1 17 ) 

refufed abfblutely to mavrj them, iinlcls he had fiifl talk'd 
with the Men, and the V. omen too j and though at firrt: I 
wa?^ a little backward to it, yet at laft I agreed to it with 
a good Will, perceiving the Sincerity of his Deiign. 

When he came to them, he let them know, that I 
had acarainted him with their Cir cum fiances, and with 
the preicnt Defign : That he was very willing to perform 
that Part of his Fun£tion, and marry them as I had defir'd ; 
but that before he could do it, he mufl take the Liberty 
to talk with then : He told them, That in the Sight of 
all indifferent Men, and in the Sen^ of the Laws of Socie- 
ty, tliey had liv'd all this wJiile in an open Adultery , and 
that it was true, that nothing but the Confenting to mar- 
I ry, or ef!e6lually Separating them from one another now, 
I could put an End to it i but there was a Difficulty in it 
1 too, with rciped: to the Laws of Chriftian Matrimony, 
\ which he was not fully Satisfy 'd about, viz.. That of marry- 
I ing one that is a profels'd Chrlflsan, to a Savage, an Idolater, 
\ an3 a Heatlien, one that is not baptiz'd i and yet that he 
I did not fee that there was Time left for it, to endeavour 
to perfuade the Women to be baptiz-'d, or to profcfs the 
Name of Chrift, whom they had, he doubted, heard no- 
thing of, and without whicn they could not be bapti2.*d. 

He told them, He doubted they Were but indifferent 
Chriflians themfelves j that they had but little Knowledge 
of God, or of his Ways : and therefore he could not ex- 
ped: that they had. faid- much to theii: Wives on that Head 
yet } but that unlefs they would promife him to ule their 
Endeavours with their Wives, to perfuade them to become 
Chriflians, and would as well as they could inftrud them 
in the Knowledge and Belief of God that made them, and 
to worfhip Jefus Chrifl that redeem'd them, he could not 
marry them 3 for he would have no Hand in joyning Chri* 
flians with Savages j nor was it conflflent with the Princi- 
dles of the Chnftian Religion i and was indeed exprefly 
forbidden in God's Law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and t delivered it 
very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as near his own 
Words a^ I could, only ibmetimes adding fomething of 
my own to convince, them how juft it was, and how I 
.was of his Mindj and I always vcrv faithfully diflinguifh'd 
between wlut liaid ftom my fclf, and what were the 

Clergy- 



("8) 

Clergyman's Words. Tliej told me, it was very true, 
what the Gentleman had faid, that they were but very in- 
diferent Chrifitms thcm£^lves, and that they had never 
talkd to their Wives about Religion : Lord, Sir ! fays 
Will. Atkins, How fliould we teach them Religion ? 
Why we know nothing our fclves ; and belides. Sir, [aid 
he, iliouid V7e go to talk to them of God, and Jefns Chrift, 
and Henvm and Hell, 'twould be to make them laugh at 
us, and ask us, What we believe our felves ? And if we 
fliould tell them we believe ail the Things that we fpeak 
of to them, fuch as of good People going to Heaven, and 
wicked People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where 
v/e intended to go our ielves, who believe all this, and yet arc 
fuch wicked Fellows, as we indeed arc ? Why, Sir, faid, 
WilL *tis enough to give them a Surfeit of Religion at 
firll: Hearing, Folks muft have fbme Religion themfelves, 
before they pretend to teach other People : WilL Atkins, 
faid I to him i though I am afraid what you iay has too 
much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife that 
fhe's in the wrong? That there is a God and a Religion 
better than her own j that her Gods are Idols, that they 
can neither hear nor ipeak j that thei e is a great Being that 
made all Things, and that can deflroy all that he had madej 
that he rewards the Good, and puniflies the Bad j that we are 
to be judg'd by him at lafl: for all we do here : You arc 
not fo igiiorant, but even Nature it felf will teach you 
that all this is true, and I am fatisfy'd you know it all to 
be true, and believe it your felf. 

That's true, Sir, faid Atkins; but with what Face 
can I fay any thing to my Wife of ail this, when ilie will 
tcU me immediately it cannot be true ? 

Not true ? faid I, What do you mean by that ? Why 
Sit, faid he. She will tell me it cannot be trure, that this 
God (I flail tell her of) can be juft, or- can punifl^ or re- 
ward, fmce I am not punifh'd, and fent to the Devil, that 
have been fuch a wicked Creature as flic knows I have 
been, even to her, and to every Budy elfe j and that I' 
iliOuld be fufferd to live, that have been always ading To 
contrary to what I muft tell her is Goodj and to what I 
ought to have done, 

W H y, truly, Atkins,, faid I, I am afraid thou fpeak'ft 
too much Truth i and with that I let the Clergyman know 

what 



(lip) 

what Atkins had faid, for he was impatient to know : 0[ 
faitl the Priefl ; tell him there is one Thing will make him 
the bell Miniftcr in the World to his Wife, and that is, 
Kepentmce j for none teach Repentance like true Penitents j 
He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be fb 
much the better quaiify'd to inflru6t his Wife j He will be 
then able to tell her, that there is not only a God, and that 
he is the juft Rewarder of Good and Evil, but that he is 
a merciful Being, and with infinite Goodnefs and Long- 
fullering forbears to punifh thofe that offend -, waiting to 
be gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner, but 
rather that he fliould return and live , that he oftentimes fuf- 
fers wicked Men to go on a long Time, and even referves 
Damnation to the general Day of Retribution 5 that it is 
a clear Evidence of God, and of a future State, that righte- 
ous Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men their 
Punifhment, till they come into another World 3 and this 
will lead him to teach his Wife the Dodhine of the Re- 
furreftion, and of the lafl: Judgment, let him but repait 
for himfelf, he wiU be an excellent Preacher of Repentance 
to his Wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who look'd very ferious all 
the while, and who, we could eafily perceive, v/as more 
than ordinarily affedled with it : When being eager, and 
hardly fuffering me to make an End, I knew all this^ MA" 
ftevi iays he, and a great deal more j but I han't the Im- 
pudence to talk thus to my Wifej when God, and my 
own Confcience knows, and my Wife wiD be an undeni- 
able Evidence againft me, that I have liv'd, as if I had ne- 
ver heard of a God, or a future State, or any Thing about 
it 5 and to talk of my repenting, ALAS! {And with that 
he fetched a deef Sigh 5 and I could lee, that Tears flood 
in his EyesO 'Tis pafl all that with me. Pafl it ! AT- 
KIN S, /aid /, What do ft thou mean by that ? I know 
well enough what I mean. Sir, fays he, J mean 'tis too 
late, and that is too true. 

« I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he faid; 
the poor zealous Priefl (I mufl^ call him fb, for, be his 
Opinion what it will, he had certainly a mofl fingular Af- 
fedlion for the Good of other Mens Souls, and it would 
be hard to think he had not the like for his ownj) I fej, 
this aealoi^ affedionate Man, could not refrain Tears alio; 
■ . But, 



( 120 ) 

But, recovering liimielf, he laid to me, ask liim but 
one QiiL'ilion, Is he eafy that it is ' too late, or is he 
troubled, and wifhes it were not fo ? I put the Queftion 
fairly to Atkins, and he anfvvered with a gi*cat deal of Paf^ 
lion, How could any Man be eafy in a Condition that cer- 
tainly muft end in eternal Dell:ru6tion ? that he was far 
from being eafy, but that on the contrary, he beliey'd it 
would one Time or other ruin him. 

W HAT do you mean by that ? laid I, Why, he laid he 
believed he Hiould, one Time or other, cut his own Tht oat 
to put an End to the Terror of it. 

The Clergyman fhook his Head with a great Con- 
cern in his Face, when I told him all this : but turning 
quick to me upon ity fays hey If that be his Cafe, you may 
allure him, it is not too late j Chrill will give him Repentance j 



But pray, fays he^ explain this to him7 That as no Man is 
fav'd but by Chrill: and the Merit of his Palllon, procu- 
ring divine Mercy for him, how can It be too late for any 



Man to receive Mercy ? Dees he think he is able to fin 
beyond the Power or Reach of Divine Mercy ? Pray teii 
him, there iDay be a Time wlien provoked Mercy will no 
longer Ibive, and when God may refule to hear, but that 
'tis never too late for Men to ask Mercy ,• and we that are 
Chril]:*s Servants are commanded to f reach Mercy at all 
times, in the Name of Jefus Chrifk to all thofe that fine ere- 
ly recent ; fo that 'tis never too late to repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great Earn- 
^Unelsi but it Icem'das- if he turned off the Dilcourfe to 
the reft i for he laid to me, he would go and liave Ibme 
Talk with his Wifej £o he wciitout awnile, and wetalk'd 
to the reft. I perceived they were all ftupidly ignorant as 
to Matters of Religion i much as I was Vv^hen I went 
gambling away from my father i and; yet that there were 
none of them bac^vvard to heai: wha|: iiad been faid 3 and 
all of them ferioully promised that they, would talk with 
their Wives about jt, ai)d jdo their Eadeavgur to pafuadc , 
them to turn Chriftians. ! V^ 

The Clergyman fmild"upon me, when I reported 
what Anfwer they gave, but fajd nothing a good while j 
but, at lafl, lliaking his Head, We that are Chnll's Ser- 
vants, fays he, can go no further than. to exhort and in- 
Uruft j and when Men comply, fubmit to thd Reproof, 

and 



and promife what we ask, 'tis all we can do j wc are 
bound to accept their good Words : But believe me. Sir. 
fa'td hey whatever you may have known of the Life or 
that Man you call Wdltam Atkins^ I believe he is the only 
fincere Convert among them j I take that Man to be a 
true Penitent 5 I won*t deipair ot the reft, but that Man is 
perfcdly ftruck with the Senie of his paft Life, and I 
doubt not, but when he comes to talk Religion to his 
Wife, he will talk himfclf efFe£lually into it i for attempt- 
ing to teach others, is fbmetimes the beft way of teaching 
our felves : I knew a Man, aUed he, who having nothing 
but a iiminiary Notion of Religion himlcif, and being 
wicked and profligate to the laft Degree in his Life, made 
a thorough Reformation in himfelf, by labouring to con- 
vert a yew j and if that poor Atkins begins but once to talk 
feriouily of Jcfus Chrift to his Wife, my Life for it, he 
talks himfelf into a through Convert, makes himfclf a Pe:- 
nitent: And who knows what may follow? 

Upon this Difcourfe however, and their promifing, 
as above, to endeavour to perfuade their Wives to embrace 
Chriftianity, he many'd the other three Coupler but Will 
Atkins and his Wife were not yet come in : After tlits, 
my Clergy man, waiting a while, was curious to know where 
-^fi^/W was gone j and, turning to me, y^j he, lintieat you. 
Sir, let us walk out of your L3)yrinth here, and look , I dare 
iay, we fliali find this poor Man iomewhere or other, 
talking ierioufly to his Wife, and teaching her already ibme- 
tliing of Religion. I began to be of the fame Mindj fb 
we went out together, and I carrv'd him a Way which 
hone kiKw but my felf, and where the Trees were lb 
thick fet, as that it was not eafy-to fee thro* the Thicket 
of Leaves, and far harder to fee in, than to fee out ^ when 
coming to the Edge of the Wood, I faw Atkins and his 
tawny Savage Wire fitting under the Shade of a Bufh, ve- 
ry eager in Difcourfe j I ftop*d ftiort till my Clergyman 
came up to mcj and then having fhow*d him where they 
were, we flood and look'd very fteadily at them a good 
*W"hile. . 

We obierv*d him very eamefl: with her, pointing up to 
the SUn, atKi to every Quarter of the Heavens ^ then down 
to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then to himfelf, then to 
hex, to the Woods, to the Trees ^ Now, fiys my Clergy-

ly we perceived Wrll Atkins flait up upon his Feet, fall 
down on his Knees, and lift up both his Hands: We fup- 
pofe he faid fbmething, but we could hot hear him, it was 
too far for thatj he did not continue kilecling lialf a Minute, 
bit comes and £ts down again by his Wife, and talks to 
her again : We perceiv'd then the Woman vei y attentive, 
but whether fhe laid any thing or no we could not tell, 
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could fee the 
Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's Cheeks, and I 
could hardly forbear my iclf j but it was a great* Affliction 
to us both,^ that Vve were not near enough to hear any 
thing that pafs'd between them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear of 
difturbing them, fo we refolv'd to fee an End of this Piece 
of Jim Coni^erfat/ofiy and it Ipoke loud enough to us, with- 
out the Help of Voice : He iat down again, as I have {aid, 
dole by her i and talk'd again earneftly to her ,* and two or 
three times Wc could lee him embrace her pafTidnatcly ,* an- 
other time we law him take out his Handkerchief and 
wipe her Eyes, and then kifs her again, with a kind of 
Tranlport very unullial j and after leveral of thcfe Things 
wc fee him, on a fudden, jump up 'again and lend her his 
Hand to help her up, when immediately, leading her by 
the Hand a Step or two, they both kneel d down together, 
and continu'd io about two Minutes, 

M Y Fi icnd could bear it' no longer, but cries out aloud, 
St. FAUL, St. PAXIL! Behold he fmyethi I was afraid 
Atkins would hear him, therefore I ehtreated him to 
with- hold himlclf a whUc, that we might lee an end of 
the Scene, which to me, I muH: confels, was the mofl af- 
jkCt'mg, and yet the moft agreeable that evcT I law in mv 
Life: Well, he ftrove with himlelf, and contaiiT'dhimfeif ' 
for a v^hile, but was in fueh Riptures of Jby, to thittk 
that the poor Heathen Woman was become a' Chfi- 
ftian, tliat he was' not able to contain himlclf /'he wept le- 
veral Times, then- throy/ing uphds Hands ^d croffrnghls 
Bread, laid over leveral Thlngs-Ejaculatory and by way of 
giving God Thanks for fo nliraodous a Teflim«ny of the 

Succcfs 



Succefs of our Eadeavours 5 fbme he fpoke foftly, and 1 
could not well hcari others audably, fbmc in Lat'my fbme 
in French', then two or three times the Tears of Joy would 
interrupt him, that he could not fpeak at all : But I beg'd 
that he would compofe himfelf, and let us more narrowly 
and fully obierve what was before us, which he did for a 
Time, and the Scene was not ended there yetj for after 
the poor Man and his Wife were riien again from their 
Knees, we obierv'd he flood talking flill eageily to her 5 
and we obferv'd by her Motion, that fhe was greatly af- 
fcdled with what he laid, by her frequent lifting up her 
Hands, laying her Hand to her Breaft, and flich other Pq* , 
fturcs, as ufiially exprefs the greateft Serioufncfs and Atten- 
tion : This continu'd about half a Quarter of an Hour, and 
and then they walk'd away too j fb that we could fee no 
more of them in that Situation. 

I T o o K this Interval to talk with my Clergyman j and 
firft, I told him, I was glad to fee the Particulars wc had 
both been Witnefles toj that tho' I was haid enough of* 
Belief in fuch Cafes, yet that I began to think it was all 
very fincere here, both in the Man and his Wifc, however 
ignorant they might both be j and I hop'd fuch a Begiu- 
ning would have a yet moic happy End j and who knows, 
fata I, but thefe two may in time, by Inftru<Slion and E>c- 
ample, work upon fbme of the others ? Some of them, 
faid he, tmrnng quick upon me, ay, upon Ml of them i de- 
pend upon it, if thofe two Savages, for he has been but 
little better, as you relate it, fhould embrace Jcfo Chriil, 
they will never leave till they work upon all the reflj for 
true Religion is naturally communicative, and he that is 
once made a Chriflian, will never leave a Pagan behind 
him, if he can help it : I own'd it was a mofl Chriftiaii 
Principle to think fb, and a Tefiimony of a true Zeal, as 
Well as a generous Heart in him : But, my Friend, faid I, will 
jou give me Leave to Hart one Difficulty here ? I cannot 
tell how to ohjt£k the leaft Thing againft that affediionate 
Concern, which you fhew for the turning the poor People 
from their Paganifm to the Chriftian R(Sgion: But how 
does this comfort you, while thefe People are in your Ac- 
count but of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without 
which you believe there is no Salvation^ fothat youeiJeem 

F * theie 



thcie but Hereticks flill, and for other Reafbns as effe^hially 
jiofl: as the Pagans thcmlclves. 

To this he anfwer'd with abundance of Candor and 
Chriilian Charity thus : Sir, I am a Carholick of the Ro- 
man Church, and a Prieft of the Order of St^Benedici, and 
I embrace all the Principles of the Roman Faith , But yet 
if you will believe me, and that X do not /peak in Comfit- 
fnent to youy or m reffeB to my CircHmftances and your Ci- 
liittks j 1 fay, neverthelefs, I do not look upon you, who 
<ali your iclves reformed, without ibme Charity : I dare 
not lay, //?<?' I know it is our Ofinion in general-, I fay, I 
daic not fay that you cannot be iav'd: I will by no means 
Jimit the Mercy of Chriil fb far, as to think that he can- 
not receive ycu into the Boibm of his Church, in a man- 
ticr to us unpcrceivable, and which it is impolfible for us 
to know; and I hope you have the fameChaiity for usj 1 
pray daily for your being all rellor'd to Chriil's Church, by 
whatibever Methods he, who is All-itvife, is plcas'd to di- 
rect : In the mean .time, fure you will allow it to confiil: 
v/ith me, as a Roman, to diftinguifli far between a Prote- 
llant and a Pagan > between one that calls on Jefiis Chrifl, 
tho' in a Way which I do not think is according to the 
true Faith: and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows no God, 
•no Chrifl, no Redeemer at all 5 and if you. are not within 
.the Pale of the Catholick Church, we Iwspe you. are nearer 
being reftor'd toit, ttln thofe that know nothing at all, of 
<3od or his Church : I rejoice therefore when I iee this 
poor Man, who you fay has been a Profligate, and almoft 
a Murtherer, kneel down and pray to Jews Chrift, as we 
ilippofc he did, tho* not fully enlightened, believing that 
Cod, from wlwm tYcvY fuch Work proceeds, will ieniibly 
touch his Heart, and bring him to the further Knowledge 
of the Tiuth in his own Time/ and if God fhall influence 
this poor Man to convert ^d inftru£fc the ignorant Savage 
his Wife, I can never believe that he fhall be cafl away 
himfclfi and have I not Reafbn then to rejoice, the nearer" 
any are bought to the Knowledge of Chrift, tho' they may 
not be brought quite home into the Boibm of the Catho- 
lick Church, juft at the Time when I may deiire it? leaving 
it to the Goodnefs of Chrift to perfedt his Work in his 
own Time, and his own Way : Certainly I would rejoice 
^' all the Savages in Jl/mrica were brought like this poor 

Womani 



( i2j ) 

Woman to pray to God, tho' they were to he a!I Profe- 
fbnts at iirft, rather than they ihoiiid continue Pagans and 
Heathens j firmly believing, that he who had beftovv'd that 
firft Light upon them, would further illuminate tlicmwith 
a Beam of his heavenly Grace, and . bring them into the 
Pale of his Church when he fliould fee good. 

I WAS aftonifli^d at the Sincerity and Temper of this tru- 
ly pious Papift, as much as I was opprefs'd by the Power 
of his Reafoning -, and it preiently occur'd^to my Thoughts, 
that if fuch a Temper was univerfal, we might be all Ca- 
tholick Chriilians, whatever Church or particular Profcf- 
iion we join'd to, or join'd in ,• tliat a- Spirit of Charity 
would foon work us all up into right Principles j and, in a 
Word, as he thought that the like Charity would make us 
all Catholicks, fo I told him I believ'd, had all the Mem- 
bers of his Chmrch the like Moderation, they would fboii 
be all Proteftants ^ And there we left that Part, for wft 
never difj^uted at all. 

However, I talk'd to him another way, and taking hir?^ 
by the pmdy my Friend, jfays I, I wifh all the Clergy of 
tie Roman Church were bleft with llich Moderation, and 
^ equal Share of your Charity j I am entr-dy of your 
Opinion i but I mufl tell you, that if you fhould preach 
fuch Dodl^rine in Sfmn, or Italy ^ they would put you into 
the Jnquijkm, 

I T may be {o, faid he, I know not what they mx^t 
do in Sfa'm and Italy, but I- will not iay they would tar 
the better Chriftians tor that Severity, for I am fure theic 
is noHerefy in too much Charity. 

Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our Bufi- 
nefs there was over: lb we went back our own ^^ay ,• and 
when we came back, we found them waiting to be czVid 
in : Obierving this, I ask'd nij Clergyman if we fl.oiild 
difcGver to him that we had ieen him under tlie Bufli, 
or no ,• and it was his Opinion we fhould not i but that 
we fhould talk to him firili and hear what he would iay 
tty usj lb wc calld him in alone, no Body being \n the 
Place but our iclves, and I began with him thus : 

Will Atkins, laid I, prithee what Education had you ? 
What was your Father? 

F I. W.A, 



W, A, A better Man than ever I Hiall he. Sir, my T4- 
ther was a Cler^mm, 

R,C. What Education did he give you? 

fV. A, He would have taught me well. Sir ; but I d^C:^ 
i^h'A all Education, Inibu£i:ion, or Corrediion, like a Beall 
as I was, 

jR. C. It's true, Solomon fays, he that defpifes Reproof h 
krutijh, 

fV, A. Ay, Sir, I was bnitifh, indeed, I murthcr'd my 
Father 5 for God's fake. Sir, talk no more about that, Sm 
I murther'd my poor Father. 

J^r, Ha! a Mmthererl * 

* Here fhe Vrkfi flarted (for I interpreted every Wcwd 
as he :Q>oke it) fmd look'd faU } Itfeems he hliev*d 
that Will had really kill'd his own lather, 

R. C, No, no. Sir, I do not undcrfland him fbj WtU 
\dtklnSi explain your Mf^ you dl^ not kill your Father, did 
you, with your own Hands ? 

pr, A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throaty but I cut 
the Thread of all his Comforts, md /horten'd his Days ,♦ I 
broke his Heart by the mofl: ungrateful unnatural Rerurn> 
for the moft tender affedionate Treatment that ever Father 
gave, or Child could receive. 

jR. C. Weil,. I did m>t ask you about your Father to 
extort this Confeffionj I pray God give you Repentance- 
for it, and forgive you that, and all your other Sins ,• but I 
«tsk'd you, tecaufe I iee, that tho* you have not much 
Learning, yet you are not £b ignorant asfome are, in Things 
that are good 5 that you have kjaown more of Religion a 
gieat deal than you have pra6i:i&d. 

m A, Tho' you, Sir, did not extort the Confeflio» 
that I make about my Father, Confcience does f and whea 
ever we come to look back upon our Lives, the Sins a- 
gaiiifl our indulgent Parents are certainly the firil that 
touches usj the Wounds they make lie dcepeft, and the 
Weight they leave will lie heavieft upon the Mind, of all 
the Sins we can commit. 

K . C. You talk top feelingly and fenfibly for m@ A^k'ms y 
I cani^ot be?ir it.. . • 



W. A. You bear it, Mafter! I dare iaj you know no- 
tiling of it. 

li. C. Yes, Atkins, every Shore, every Hill, nay, I may 
lay, every Tree in this liland is witnefs to the Anguifli of 
my Soul, for my Ingratitude and bale Uiage or a good 
tender Father, a Father much like yours, by your Deicrip- 
tion j and I niurther'd my Father as well as you, ff 1// At- 
kins y but think, for all that, my Repentance is ftiort of 
yours too * by a great deal. 

^ I wmU have faid more. If I could have reftrain'd 
my 'BaJJmns'j but I thought this poor Man's Repent^ 
once -mm fa muchfmcerir thmimimj that t was go- 
ing to have off the ^ijcourfi and retire, fir I was 
fmrpriz'd mth i»hat he /aid ^ and though, that infteaJ 
<f my going dhos^ to teach md infhuM him, the Mau 
waf made a Teacher and InflruBor to me, in a mo^ 
furprizing and fmexpeBed manner, 

I laid all this before the young Clergpaan, vrho was 
greatly affefted with it, a^d laid to me, Efed I not fay. Sir, 
that when this Man was converted, he would preach to'ul 
all ? I tell you. Sir, if this one Man be made a true Peni-^ 
tait, here Will be no need of me» he will make Chriftians 
of all in the liland : But having a little composed my ftlf^ 
I renew'd my Difcourfe with IVill Atkins. 

But IVILL, feud J, How comes the Senfe of this Mat- 
ter, to touch you juft now? 

fT. A. Sir, you have let me about a Work that has 
llruck a Dart thro'' my very Soul j I have been talking a^ 
bout God and Religion to my '^^ife, in order, as you di^ 
redbed me, to make a Chriftian of her, and Ihe has prcach'd 
fiich a Sermon to me, as I Ihall never forget while I 
live. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach'd to you ; 
but when you were moving religious Arguments to her, 
Confcience has flung them back upon you. 

A, PT, Ay, Sir, with fuch a Force as is not to be re- 
fifted. 

R. C. Pray P^^, let us know what pafs'd between-* 
you and yoi|r Wife, for I kgow fomething of it al- 
^«ady,!^ 

F 4 mA. 



(I28) 

IK A, Sir, it Is impofTiMe to pve you a Fall Accctmt 
©f it j I am too flill to hold it, and yet have no Tongue 
to exprefs itj but let her havcXaid what He will, andtho' 
I cannot give you an Account of it, this I can tell you of 
ky that I r^iblve to amend and reform my Life. 

R. C. But tell us fome of it. How did you begin 
Will ? For this has been an extraordinary Cajfe, that's cer- 
tain 5 flie has preach'd a Sermon, indeed, if ihe liai 
wrought this upon you, 

W> A. Why, I hrft told her the Nature of our Laws 
about Marriage, and what the Reafons were, that Men 
-and Women were oblig'd to enter into £ich Compacts, as 
it was neitlier in tjie Power of one or other to break 5 
that otherwise, Or(!er and Juilice could not be maintained, 
^nd Men would run firom their Wives, jand abandon their 
Children, mix confiifi^j with one another, and neither 
Families be kept entire, or Inheritancef be fettled by leg^ 
JDefcent. 

jR, C. You talk like a Civilian, Willi could you make 
iier underflmid what you meant by Inheritance and Faihi^ 
iies ? they know no (v^ch thing among th^ Savages, but 
many any hmfr withont Regard to Relation, Coniangui* 
nity, or Family 5 Brother and Sifter,- nay, as I have beea 
told, even the Father and Paughter^ and the Son and the Mo- 
ther. 

PV, A. I believe, Sif, you are mifinform'd, and mj 
Wife allures me of the. contrary, and that they abhor it j 
]peihaps, for any farther Relations, they may not be fo ex-. 
'%di as we arci but Ihe teBs nqi^ they never touch one an- 
other in the near Relations you fpeak of. 

R. C. Well,, what did fhe fey,, to what you told 
lier. 

W. A. She ftld, Ihe lik'dit very well and- it was much 
tetter than in her Country. 

JR, C. But diA you tell her what Marriage was ? 

W, A, Ay, ay, there began all our Dialogue. I ask'd 
her if fhe would be marry d to me our Way? She ask'd 
jne what Way that was ? I toM her. Marriage was a|>- 
pointcd of God -, and here we had a flrangeTalk together, 
yi^di as ever Mm a|4 Wife Wi I believe.. ^ 



C I2P ) 

N. B. This Dtdogue Betide en W. Atkins md his 
Piaffe, as I took it d<mn in Writings jufi after he told 
it me, was as follows, 

PFife, Appointed by your God! why iaveyou a God in 
your Country? _^2«J 

IV. A. Yes, my Dear, God is in every Country. 

Wife, No, your God in my Country^ my Country 
llave the great oH Benamuckee God. 

fV. A. Child, I am very unfit to ihew you who God> 
is j God is in Heaven, and made tlie Heaven and the Earth, 
tlie Sea, and all that in them is. 

Wife, No makee dc Earth ^ no, you God makce dc 
Earth, no make my Country. * 

* W. A. laughed a little at her lEx^refJton ofGodmt 
making her Country, 

Wife, No laugh, why laugh mc ,? This no Thing to 
laugh, f 

f He T»as juflly reproved h his Wife^ for fhe was more 
feri&Hs than he at firjt, 

W, A, That's true indeed, I will not laugh any more 
my Dear. 

Wife, Why you iay, you God make all ? 

W, A, Yes, Child, our God made the whole World, 
and you, and I, and all Things, for he is the only true 
God, there is no God hut him, he lives for ever in Hea- 
ven. 

Wife^ Why you no tell me long ago? 

W, A, That s true indeed, but I have been a wicked 
Wretch, and have not only forgotten toaccjiiaint tliee with 
any Thing before, but have lived without Goi in the 
World my felf. - 

Wife, What have you de great God in you Country, 
jaa no kno'him? No fay O to him? No da good 
Thing for him ? That no impoflible! 

W, A* It is too true tho , for all that, w« live ■:'s if 
F X theft 



there was no God in Heaven, or ttot lie M"no Pbwar 
on Earth? 

Wife. But why, God let you do & ? Why he no ma- 
fcee you gcod Yivs.} 

W. A, It is all our own Fault. 

Wife, But you iay me, hejs Great, much,- Great, have 
much great Power ^ can makee kill when he wilU- why- 
he nb roakec kill when you no ferve him ^ No iay O to 
Ijim ? No be gogd Mans ? 

W. A. That is true ; he might flrike me l!>e^, and B 
ougl|t to expe<Si: it, for I have been a wieked Wretch, that 
is truej but God is merciful, and does not deal with us a&^ 
we deierve. 

Wife. Biit then, do no you tell God Tankec for that 
too? 

W. A, No, indeed, I have n<3^ thank'd God for \hi. 
Merc}% ^y more than I have fear'd God for his Power. 

Wife. Then you God na Godfj me no think, believe, 
;fec be fiich one, great much Power, Strong j no makee kill 
you tho' you malee him much Angry ? 

^ A, What.? Will my wicked Life hinder you f mm 
believing in God ! What a dreadful Creature am I ! And , 
what a fad Truth is it, that the horrid Lives of Chriflians 
hinders the Converfions of Heathens ? 

Wife*. How me tink you have great much God f up 
ihete, and yet no do well, no do good Ting ? Can hct 
ii?ll ? Sure he no teU what you do .?^ 

f ^e pints up tQ Heaven, 

W, A, Yes, yeS) he knows and jfees all Things ,• h® 
hears us fpcai, fees what we do, knows what we think, 
1 ho' Ave do not ipeak.. 

Wife. What! he no hear you fwear, curfe,,, fpeak the 
great Damn ? 

Vy\ A. Yes, yes, he hears it- all,. 

Wife. Where be then the muchee great Power ftrong? 

W. Af He is merciful, that's all we cm fay for it ;. 
and- this proves h*m to le the tiue God j he is God and 
not Mac j and theicforc we ar€ not. confumcxi. * 



f Were Will. Atkins told us he was ftmck mth Horror, 
to thmk hotp he could tell his Wife fo clearly, that 
God fees, and hears, and knovus the fecret Thoughts 
of the Hearty and all that we do j and yet that he 
had da/d to do all the ^vile Th'mgs he had done. 

Wife. Merciful! What you call dlt ? 

W, A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pities and 
j^f^ us. 

• Wife, So then he never makee kill, never angry when, 
you do v^icked ,• then he Ho good himfelf, or no great 
able. 

W, A. Tes, yes,' my Dear, he is infinitely good, and 
infinitely great, and able to punifh too -, and Sometimes to 
il ew his Juftice and Vengeance, he lets fly his Anger to 
deftroy Sinners, aiid Make Examples j many are cut off in 
their Sins. 

Wife, But no makee kill you yet, than he tell you 7na^ 
be that he no make you kill, lb you make de Bargain with 
liim, you do bad Thing, he no be angry at you/' when he 
be angry at other Mans ? 

W, A. No indeed, my Sins are all Prefumptions upon 
his Goodnefs j and he would be infinitely juft if he de- 
ftroy*d me as h^ has done other Men, 

Pffe, Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, what 
you fay to him for that, you no tell him Tankee for all 
that too? 

jr. A, I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, that's 
true. 

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better, you 
(ay he makee you. 

W, A. He made me as he made all the World ; 'tis 
I have deform'd my (elf, and abus d his Goodnefs, and 
have made my fclf an abominable Wretch. 

Wife. I wifli you makee God know me, I no makee 
lum angry, 1 no do bad wicked Thing. 

Here Will. Atkins fald his Heart funk whin him, to 
hear a poor untaught Creature dejtre to be taught to 
know Gody and he fuch a wicked Wretch, that he 
eould not fay one Word to her about God, but what 

: .C the 



tk^ Kefroach of his own Carriage wmld make mof^^ 
irrational to her to believe ; nay, that alreoidy fie- 
": could not believe in God, becaufe he that was.fo wick'^ 

ed was not defircy*d^ 

W, A. My Bear, you mean> you wifh I could tcacR 
jou to know God, not God to know you , for he knows4 
you already, and every Thought in your Heart. 

W^e. Why. then he know what I fay to you now ? 
He know me wilh to know him. 5 how fhall me know 
-who mok&t me? 

W. A, Poor Creature, he muft teach thee, I cannot. 
Iteach thee ,* 111 pray to him to teach thee to know him,

Tfie poor Tellm was inifuch an Afony at her dejlring

W. A. No, we do not hear him ipeak, but he has re- 
T^al'd himfeif many Ways to us. 

Here he was at a great Zefs to make her tmderftand^ 
that God has revealed himfelf to us by his Word^ 
and -what his W0rd to as : But at lafi he told it her- 
thus, 

W, A, God hasfpoken to fbme good Men in former 
Bays, fven from Heaven, by plain Words , and God has 
inipir'd good Men by his Spirit j and they have written all 
his Laws down in a Book, 

Wife, Me no underiiand th^t, where is Book ? 

W, A, Alas! my poor Creature, ! have not this Book^ 
but I hope I fhall one Ti^ie or other get it for you to 
read it. 

Here k embraced her mth great ApEtion i b«t •with,- 
inex^effible Grief y that he had not a Bibk, 

Wfe, But how you makee me know, that God teachee 
them to wiitethat Book ? 

W, A* By the fame Rule that* we know him to be 
God. 

TVife, What Ruk, what Way you know ? 

W, A, Becau*^ he teaches- atii commands nothing but 
what is good, righteous, and holyj and tends to make 
us perfecSWy good, as well as perfe<fiiy happy j and be* 
cauls he forbids and commands us to avoid all that is 
wicked, that is Briiin it ielf, or E til in its Conft^

Here the fooxMQ.n,faUhe, could forbear ao longer; but 
raifing her up, made her kneel by Mm, and he pray'd to 
God, aloud, to inftm<Sl: her in the Knowledge of himicif 
by his Spirit, and that by fome good Providence, if pof- 
fible, {he might fbmetime or other come to have a Bible, 
that fhe might read the Word of God, and be taught by 
it to know him. 

This was the Time that we ^w him lift her up 
by the Hand, * and faw him kneel down by her, as 
above. 

They had ieveral other Difeourfes it ieems after this, 
too long to fet down here; and particularly fhe made iim^ 
promile, that fince he confels'd his ov/n Life had been a 
wicked abominable Courie of Provocation againft God, 
that he would reform it, and not jnake God angry . any 
more, left he Jliould mah him dead, as fl^.e calFd it, and 
then flie fhould be left alone, and nev^er be taught to know 
this God better i and left he fliould be miicrabk, as he had; 
told her wicked Men fliould be after Death. 

This was a ftrange Account, and very aie£Hng to us 
both, but particularly to the young Clergyman ; he was 
indeed wonderfully furpriz'd with it, but under the great- 
eft Aftli6i;ipn imaginable that he could not tdk to her, that 
he could not fpeak Engli/h to make her underftand him f 
and as Hie ipoke but very i:M:oken Englifh, le coukl not un- 
derftand her : However he turn'd himfelf to me, and told 
me, that he believ'd there muft be moi£ to do with this 
Woman than to marry her : I did not anderftand him at 
firft, but at length he explain'd himfe(f, .(viz.) that ihe 
ought to be Baptized. 

1 A G R E ED with him in tliat Part readily, and was for 

foing about it presently : No, no, bold Sir, faid he^ tho* 
would have her be bapti^'d by si Means, yet I mufl 
obferve,. that Will, Atkins., her Husl&nd, has indeed brought 
Ijer in a wonderful Manner to be frilling to embrace a lic- 
ligious Life, and has given her jqft Ideas of the Being of 
a God, of his Power, Juftice, Mercy 5 yet I delire to 
knaw of him, i^ he had faid ^ny Thing to her of Je£js 
Churift, and of the Salvation 0/ Sinners, of the Nature of 

Faitfi 



Cm) 

FaitE in him, and Redemption hj him ; of the Holy Si^y 
rit, the Reflirredion, the iaft Judgdment, and a future 
State. 

I CALLED WslL Atkins again, and ask'd him,- but the 
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears,, and told us he 
had faid ibmething to her of all thofe Things, but that 
he was himfelf fo wicked a Creature, and his own Con- 
fcience io reproached him with his horrid ungodly Life, 
that he trembled at the Apprehenfions, that her Know- 
ledge of' him, fhould lefTen the Attention fhe iliould give 
to thoie Things, and make her rather contemn Religion* 
than receive it : But he was alTur'd he faid that her Mind- 
was £o difpos'd to receive due Impreflions of all thofe 
Things, that if I would but difcourfe with her Ihe would 
make it appear to my SatisfacSbioa, that mj Labour would* 
not be loft upon her, 

AcGORDiNGiiY I c^Vd hcT ih| and placing mj felf 
as Interpreter between my religious Prieft and the Woman, 
I entreated him to begin with her j but flire (uch a Ser- 
mon was never preach'd by a Popifh Prieft in thefe latter 
Ages of the World j. and, m, I told him, I thought he had 
all the Zeal, all the Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a: 
Chriftian, without the Errors of a Roman Catholick j and 
that I took him to be fuch a Clergyman, as the Roman 
Bifhops wefBi before the Church of Rome aflum'd ipiri- 
tual Sovereignty over the Confciences of Men: 

I N a Word, he brought the poor Woman to embrace 
the Knowfedge of Chrift, and of Redemption i)y him,, 
not with Wonder and Aftonifhment only, as flie did the- 
lirft Notions of a God, but with Joy and Faith,, with 
an AfFe6tion and a furprifing Degree of Underflandirig, 
fcarce to be imagin'd* much lefs to beexprefsd j and at 
har own Requeft flie was baptiz'd. 

When he was . preparing to baptize her. I entreated 
him that he would perform that Office with ibme Caii- 
tk)n, that theM^ might not perceive he was of the Ra/»^i» 
Church, if poffible 5 l>ecaule of other ill Confcquences which 
might attend a Difference among us in that very Religion*. 
which we were inftruiSting the other in: He told me, that 
as he had no confecrated Chappel, no proper Things for 
the Office, I ihould fee he would do it in a Manner, that I: 
jbouli: not know by it, that he was a Rsmm Catholick 

my 



imy* lelF, if I Imd not known it before : And fb hedid r 
for faying only ibme Words over to himfelf in Latin, 
which I could not underftand, he poiir'd a whole Difhfu]^ 
of Water upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French^ 
Ytrj lohd, MARY, isiphich was the Name^ her Bufiarid. 
dejtr'd me to gt've her\ for I -was her Godfather, 1 baptize 
theein tl^ Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghoft i fo that none could know any Thing by ity 
what Religion he was of : He gave the BenedidHon after- 
wards in Latin; but either IVHL Atkins did not know but' 
it was in Trench, or elie did not take Noticej of it, at 
that Time. 

As. loon as this was over we marry 'd them,* and after 
the Marriage was over, he tum'd himlelf to WdL Atkins, 
af^d in a very affecftionate Manner exhorted him, not on- 
ly to p^rfevcre in that good Diipolition he was in, but to 
lupport the Convictions that were upon him by a Refold- 
tion to reform his Life j told him, it was in vain to fay. 
he repented, if he did not foriake his Crimes : Reprefent-^ 
cd to hiin, how God had honoured him with being the 
Inftrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge ot the 
Chriftian Religion, and that he ihould be caretul he did 
• not difpionour the Grace of God, and that if he did, he 
would lee die Heathen a better Chriftian than himielfj xht 
Savag*^ converted, and the Inftra nent call away, 

H E faid a great many good Things to them both, and 
tlwn recommended them m a few Words to God's Good- 
nofs, gave them the Benedidlion again, I repeating every 
Thing to them in Bngitjh, and thus ended the Ceremony: 
I think it was the moii pkalant agreeable Day to me that 
ever I palled m my whole Life. 

But my Clergyman had not done yet? his Thoughts 
hung continually upon the Converfion of the feven and 
thirty Savages, and fain he would have llay'd upon the 
Ifland to have undertaken it 5 but I convinc'd him, firfi, 
that his Undertaking was impra^Hcable in it lelf j and j>- 
cmdly, that perhaps, I would vat It into a Way of beii^ 
done, in his Abfence, to his Sidsi action jof w^ich, hy 
and by,

mifli^d SHip'5 Company came to me, aed told mc, he un*- 
undei flood I had a Clergyman with me, and that I had" 
caiifcd the En£li/I?me!3 to be married to the Savages, whom 
they called Waves ,• that he had a Match too, which he 
deiired might be finiili'd before I went, between two 
Chriftiansi which he hop'd would not be diiagrceable to 
me. 

I K KEw this muft be the young Woman who was his* 
Mother's Servant, for theie was no^other Chriftian Woman 
on the Ifland j fb I began to perfuadchim not (to do any Thing, 
of that Kind rafhiy, or bccaiife he found himfelf in this fbla- 
tary Circumftance : I reprefented' that he had fome confi- 
derabk Subftancc in the Word, and good Friends as I un- 
flood by himfclf, and by Kis Maid alSj that the Maid wa« 
not only poor, and a Servant, but was unequal to him» 
fhe being lis or feven ancf twenty Ycar^ old, and he ijot 
above fevcnteen or eighteen,- that he mfgfit verv probably,, 
with my AfTiftancc, maJke a Remove from this Wildc»^ 
nefs, and come into his own Country a^in, and that- 
then it would be a thouiand to one but h? would rcfenl 
his Choice ,• and the Dillikc of that Circumiknce might 
be di^dvanta^geous to both : 1 was going to Cxj more but 
he intemmted mc,. imiling, and told me, with a great 
deal of ^&M^"^;'that I miftook in my Guefles, that lie 
had nothing of that Kind in hiis Thoughts, his prefent 
Circumftance being melanchollv and difconlblate enough j. 
and he was very gp&d to hear tnat I had Thoughts of put- 
ing them in a Way to lee their own Country again, and* 
that nothing ihould have put him upon ftaying there,, but 
that the Voyage J was ^iiig was fb exceeding lOng and' 
hazardous, and would carry nim quite out of the ReacJf 
of all his Friends,* th^thd had nothing t« defire of mc 
but that I would fettlfc him in fome little Ptopnerty in the 
Ifland where he was, give him a Servant ot two and' 
fome few Neceflaries, and hq would fettle hlmfelf hera 
like a Painter, waiting the gootl Time, when, if ever t 
return'd to Englandy I would redeem him, and hop*d 1 
would not be unmindful of him when I came to Englan/^ 
that he would give mc fome Letters to his Friends in Ldn-^ 
don^ to let them know how good I had been to him, and! 
^ Wijat ?m:t pf the. World,, and what Circumftance I had

left Mm inj that he promiied mc, that when ev£r I re^ 
deem'd him, the Plantation and all the Improvements he 
had made upon it, let the Value be what it would, fl-ould 
be wholly mine. 

His DilcourJle was very prettily deliver'd, confidering 
his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me, becauie 
he told me pofitively the Match was not for himfclf : I 
gave him all pofTible Aflurances, that, if I liv'd to come 
lafe to Englandy I would deliver his Letters, and do his 
Bulmefs ^^■''■Q.^:A\y,^ and that he might depend I would 
never forget the Circumflance I had left him in j but ftill 
I was impatient to know, who was the Perlpn tobemar^ 
ricd, upon which he told me, it was myf^ck cf /ij^Tra4^s^ 
siid his Maid Sufm. 

I WAS moft Agreeably furpxi2.*d, when hp i^am'd thfi 
Match, for indeed! had thought it very iut^bjei the Cha- 
fa^ler of that Man I have given alr^y i antj as for th© 
Maid, ihe was a very Jioneft, modell, fbber anrf religious 
young Woman, had a very good Share of Senfe, was 
agreeable enough in her Perfon, fpoke very handibmly and 
to the Purpofe, always with Dee^iacy apd good Manners, 
and not backward to fpeak when any Thing required it, 
or impertinently forward to foeak when itvj%i^.mt her B^- 
finefs ,* ve;;7 handy and toufewifely in any^^Jgi^g^ that was 
before her -, an excellent Majiager, and fit indeed to have 
been Govemeis to the whole Iflami -, fne knew very well 
how to behave her^lf to all kind of Folks (he had about 
her, and to better, if fhe had found any there. 

The Match being propos'd in this Manner, we pi^r- 
ried them" the :&me Day, and a$ I was Father a^ the Alta?-, 
a3 I may fay, and gave her awav, fo I gay^ her a Por- 
tion y for I appointed her ai^d ner Husband a handfome 
large Space of Ground for their Plantation ,• and indeed 
this Match, and the Prepolad the young Gentleman 
made to me, to give him a fmall Property in the 
IHand, put me upon parcelling it out amongft them, that. 
they nught not quarrel afterwards about tlieir Situa- 
tion. 

This Sharing out the Land to them, I left t^WiU, Atr 
Imsy who indeed was now grown a moft fbber, gxave» 
managing Fellow 5 perf^Iy reforni'd, ex<;e?4ing . pipus 
and religious, and as far as I may be allow'd to fj)eak po-

fiiivcly in fucli a Cafe, I verily hclkvCj w^s a true finccr^ 
Penitent. 

He divided TJiings Co juftly, and Co much to every 
one's Satisfaftion, that they only delired one general Writ- 
ing under my Hand for the Whole, which I cauied to be 
drawn up, and %ned and iealed to them, letting out the 
Bounds and Situation of every Man's Plantation, and teM- 
fyinff, that I^ave them thereby, feveially a Right to the 
whole Poileiuon and Inheritance of the refpe£iive Planta- 
tions or Farms, with their Improvements, to them and 
their Heirs, referving all the reft of the Ifland as my own 
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular Plantation 
after eleven Years, if I, or any one from me, or in mj 
Nan^ came to demand it, producing an attefled Copy of 
the fime Writing, 

As to th^ Goremmeat and Laws among them, I told 
diem I was not capable of giving them better Rules, than 
they were able to givetli^tiiiHvesi only made them pro- 
mife me to live in Love and good Neighbourhood with 
one another} and Co I prepared to leave tEem. 

One Thing I mutt not omit, and this is, that being 
now fettled in a kind of Commoh*wealth among them- 
selves, and having much Bufinefs in Hand, it was but odd 
to have fevcn and thkty Indians live in a Nook of the 
Ifland, independmt, and indeed unemploy'd ; for except^ 
ing the providing themfelves Food,, which they had Di^ 
fieuky ojough in too, fbmetimes, they had no manner of 
Bufinefs or rroparty to manage: I proposed therefore to 
the GovcvnovLv Sf/mard, thatiie lliould go to them with 
Friday s Father, and popoie to them to remove, and ei- 
ther plant for themfelves, or take them into their feveral 
Families as Servants to be mamtain'd for their Labcmr, but 
without being abiblute Slaves, for I would not 2dmh 
them to make them Slaves by Fofce,^ by any Means, be-^ 
caufe they had their Liberty given by Capitulation, and at 
^^ it were Articles of Surrender, which they ought not t<l> 
break. 

They moil willingly embrac'd the Propofal, and came 
all very chearfuily along with him j Co wc allotted them: 
Land, and Plantations, which three or four accepted of, 
but fll tte refl; chofe to be employed as Servants in the fe* 

vcral 



( 1 40 ) 
terar Famines we had fettled ; and thus my Colony w?sr 
in a Manner fcttla^, as follows ; The Spaniards pofTcfs d 
my original Habitation, which was the Capital City, and 
extendi their Plantations all along the Side of the Brook, 
which made the Creek that I have io often defcrib'd, as 
far as my Bower , and as they encreas'd their Culture; 
it went always Eaftward 5 the £n^lijh liv'd in the 
North-Eaft Part, where Will. Atkins and his Comrades be- 
gan, and came on Southward, and South- Weft, towards 
the back Part of the Sfanmrds, and every Plantation had^ 
a great Addition of Land to take in, i^ they found Occa- 
sion, ib that they need not joftle one another for want of 
Room. 

A L L the Weft End of the Ifland was left uninhabited^ 
that if any of the Savages fiiould come on Shore therej 
only for their uflial cuftomary Barbarities, they might 
come and go 5 if they difturb'd no Body , no- Body 
would difturB them 5 and no doubt but they were often 
afhore, and went away again 5 for I never heard that the 
Pianters were ever attacked or difturb'd any more. 

J i* now came into my Thoughts, that I nad hinted to my 
Friend the Clergyman, that the Work of' converting the 
Savages, might perhaps be iet qn foot in his Abfencej to 
ids Satisfa<5hon 5 and I told him, that now I thought it 
was put in a fair Way ^ for the Savages being thus divided 
among the Clmftians, if they woi3d but every one of 
them do their Part with thofe which came under their 
Hands, I hop'd it might have a veiy good Eiie<St. 

H E agreed prefently in that,. I£ faid he, they will do^ 
their Part j but how, fays he, ftiaH we obtain that of them ? 
I told him, we would call them all together, and leave it 
in Charge with them, or go to them one by one, which 
he thought beft, £0 we divided it ; he to fpeak te the Spa* 
niards, who were all Fapifis, and T to the ZngliJIj, who 
were all Troteftants ; and we recommended it eameftly to 
them, and made them promifei that they never would ^ 
inake any Diftindion of Fafifl or Froteflant, in their exhort- 
ing the Savages to turn Chiiftiansj but teach them the 
gencal Knowledge of the true God, and of their Savi- 
our Jeilis Chrift, and they likewile promis'd us, tliat they 
would never have any Differences or Dilputes one with 
another, about Religion.

W H E N I came to W, Atkins's Houfe, (1 may call itrfb, 
for fuch .a Houfe or fach a piece 6i Basket- Work, I believe, 
^vas ciot Handing in the Woild again j) I fa/, when I came 
•there, I found the young Woman I have mcntion'd a- 
hove, and W, Atkins's Wife, were become Intimates i and 
.this prudent religious young Woman, had perfected the 
Work J'F. Atkins had .begun j and tho' it was not ^boVe 
four Days after what I have related, yet the new baptiz'd 
Savage Woman was made fuch a Chriilian, as I have fel- 
dcm hcatd of any like her, in allmy Obiervation, orCon- 
vcrfition in the World. 

It came next into my Mind inthe Morning before I went 
to them, that amongfl all the needful Things I had to leave 
with them, I had not left a Bible, in which, I fhew'd my 
fclf lefs confidering for them, than my good I>iend the 
Widow was for me, when <lie lent me the Cargo of an 
hundred Pounds from Lis6on, where il.e pack*d up three 
Bibles and a Prayer-Book : However, the good Woman's 
Charity had a greater Extent than ever Hx imagin'd j 
for thej were reierv'd for the Comfort and Inftrudiion 
of thoie, that made much better Ufe of them than I had 
done. 

I T o o K one of the Bibles in my Pocket, and when I 
came to PPlll Atkinses Tent or Soufe, and found the young 
Woman, and Atkins's baptiz'd Wife, had been difcouriing 
of Religion together ; for P01I Atkins toUme, with a great 
Jeal of Joy : I ask'd if they were together now, and he 
iaid. Yes j £o I went into the Houfe, and he, with me, 
and we found them together very earnefl: in Difcourfe , 
O Sir, lays Will, Atkins, when God has Sinners to recon- 
cile to himfelf, and Aliens to bring Home, He never wants 
a Meflengerj my Wife has got a new Infh-udor; I knew 
J was unworthy, as I was uncapable of that Work,- that 
young Woman has been lent hither from Heaven j fl:e is 
enough to convert a whole Ifland of Savages ^ the young 
Woman blulh'd, and rofe up to go away, but I de- 
fired her to fit Hill i I told her, fhe had a good 
Work upon her Hands, and I hop'd God would blcls 
her in it. 

W E talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they had any Book 
among them, though I did not askj but I put my Hand in 
jny Pocket, and puS'd out my Bible i here,^^ J, to Atkins* 



( 142 ) 

I have brought you an Afilftant that perhaps you had not be- 
fore } the Man was fo confounded, that he was not able to 
fpeak for £ome Timej but recovering himfelf, he takes it with 
both his Hands, and turning to his Wife, here, my Dear, fays 
he j did not I tell you, our God, tho' tie lives above, could 
hear what we :Giid ? Here's the Book I prayM for, when 
you and I kneel'd down under the Bufli5 now God has 
heard us, and fent it j when he had ^id fb, the Man fell 
into fuch Tranfports of a paffionate Joy, that between the 
Joy of having it and giving God Thanks for it, the Tears 
run down his Face like a Child that was Crying. 

The Woman was furpriied, and was like to have run 
into a Miflake, > that none of us were aware of j for fhe 
firmly bcliev'd God had lent the Book upon her Husband's 
Petition j It is true, that providentially itivasfb, asd might 
be taken fb in a conlequent Strife -, but I bcHev'd, it would 
liave been no difficult Matter at that Time to have pcr- 
iuaded the poor Woman to have believ'd, that an exprefs 
Meflenger came from Heaven, on purpofe to bring that 
individual Book , but it was too ierious a Matter, to fiifFer 
any Deluilon to take Place i lb I turn'd to the young Wo- 
man and told her, we did not delire to impole upon the 
new Convert, in her firft, and more ignorant underfland- 
ing of Things,- mdhes^d her to explain to her, that God 
may be very properly feid to anfwcr our Petitions, when 
in the Courfc of his Providence, fuch Things are in a par- 
ticular Manner brought to pafi, as we petition 'd for j but 
we do not expcd returns from Heaven, in a miraculous 
and particular Manner, and that it is our Mercy, that it is 
not to. 

Tirrs the ymmg 'Wmn^n did afterwards effectually; 
lb that tiic^c was, f affurc you, no Prieftcraft ufed here ; 
and I Ihould have thought it one of the moft unjuftifiable 
Frauds in the World, to have had it fo ^ but the Surprile 
of Joy upon Pf^/U. jitkins, is really not to be expreiledj 
and' there we may be lure, there was no Dektfion : Sure, 
no Man was ever more thankful in the World for any 
Thing of its Kind, than he was for this Biblei nor I be- 
lieve, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a better 
l*rinciplc j and though he had been a moft profligate Creature, 
deQ)erate, headftrong, outragious, furious, and wicked to a 
great Degreci yetthis Man is a ftandii^ Rule to us all 

for 



(143) 

for the well1nl!ru6l:ing ChiWrcn, (viz.) that Parents fhould 
never give over to teach and inftrudl:, or ever deipair of 
the Succefs of their Endeavours, let the Children be ever ib 
obftinate, refraftory, or to Appearance, infenfible of inftrud- 
ionj for if ever God in his Providence, touches the Con- 
fcienc^s of Jfuch, the Force of their Education returns up- 
on them, and the early Inftrudtion of Parents is not lofk , 
though it may have been many Years laid afleepj but fbmc 
Time or other, they may find the Benefit of it. 

T ji u s it was with tnis poor Man j However ignorant 
he was, or di veiled of Religion and Chriftian Knowledge; 
He found he had fbme to do with now, more ignorant 
than himfelf j and that the leaft Part of the Inftruclion of 
his good Father that could now come to his Mind, was 
of Ufc to him. 

A M o N G the refl it occurr'd to him, he i&id, how his 
Father us'd to infift much upon the inexprefTible Value of 
the Bible ; the Privilege and BleiTing of it to Nations, Fa- 
milies, and Perfonsj but he never entertained the leaft No- 
tion of the Worth of it, till now 5 when being to talk to 
Heathens, Savages, and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of 
the written Oracle for his AfTiftance. 

The young Woman was very glad of it alfb for the 
prefent Occalion, tho' fhe had one, and fo had the Youth 
on board our Ship among their Goods, which were not 
yet brought on Shore j and now having iaid ib many 
Things of this young Woman, I cannot omit of telling 
one Story more of her, and my felf, which has ibmething 
in it very informing and remarkaWe. 

I have related, to what Extremity the poor young Wo- 
man was reduced i how her Miflfeis was ilatv'd to Death, 
and did die on board that unhappy Ship we met at Sea j 
and how the whole Ship's Company being reduced to the 
lift Extremity ; the Gentlewoman, and her Son, and this 
Maid, were firil hardly ufed, d^'tt) Proviiio*nsj and at lail 
totally neglected arid ftarv'd j 'Mt iktp fay, brought to the 
lafl Extremity of Hunger. , , 

One Day being Diicoiirfing Mthhcr Upon the E'xtrer

what fhe hadfdt, What it was to ftafYe, attd how it ap-»

Years, and a weakly Woman too, ihe might flruggk

more would have ended all their Li^es, unlefe tl^y iiad 
prevented it by eating cme, another; and even that as, their 
Caie flood, would Mve fov'd them but a little while, they 
being foo Leagues from any Land ,• or any Poffibility of 
Relief, other than in the miracul«»is Manner it happen 'd : 
But this is by the Way,* Iri^rn to my Difpolition of 
Things among the People. 

AnDy.Wtrfii It is ta be obfervVi her^ That for many 
Reafons I did ttoH think fit to kt them inow any- Thijng,, 
of ti^ Sloop I had framed, and which I thought of fetting "^^ 
up among them ; for I found, at Uafi at, myfirft comfng, 
fuch Seeds of Diviiioftg among them, that I faw it plain- 
ly, had / fet up the Sloop, and left it among them, they 
G % would 



would upon every light Diiguft have feperated, and gone 
away from one another, or perhaps have turn'd Pirates, 
and fb made the Ifland a Den of Thieves, inftead of a 
Plantation of fober and religious People, as I intended it 
tobej nor did I leave the two Pieces of Biafs Cannpnthat I 
had on Board, or the two Quarter-Deck Guns, that my 
Nephew took extraordinary, for the iame Reaibn : I thought 
they had enough to qualify them for a detcnfive War a- 
gainft any that fhould invade them j but I was not to fet 
them tip for an Offenlive War, or to encourage them to 
go Abroad to attaque others, which in the End would on- 
ly bring Ruin and Deftru<5tion upon themielves and all their 
Undertakings; Ireferv'd the Sloop therefore, and the Guns, 
for their Service another Way, as I fliall obferve in its 
Place. 

I HAVE now done with the Ifland : I left them all in 
good Circumftances, and in a flourifliing Condition, and 
went on board my Ship again the Day of , 

having been five and twenty Days among them j and 
as they were all refblv'd to ftay upon the Ifland 'till I 
came to remove them, I promi&'d to icnd ibme further 
Relief from the Brafils, it I cx>uld poflibly find an Op- 
portunitv j and particularly I promised to iend them fome 
Cattle, fuch as Sheep^ Mc^s and Cows : For as to the two 
Cows and Calves, which I brought from England^ we 
had' lien obliged, by the Length of our Voyage, to kill 
them at Sea, for want of Hay to feed them. 

The ii^t Day^ giving them a Sakte of five Guns at 
Paitirig, we fet Sail, ^nd aniv'd at the Bay of AU-Saints, 
in the Braf Is, ifl about ii 1E^M4 meeting nothing re- 
markable in ourf^^fTage, but this, : That about three Days 
after we faiill^ hemg bccaltn^d, and the Current fetdng 
ftforig to the E : NrE; riiraiingv as it were, into a Bay or 
<Suljm on the Land-fide^ ^ we iWere driven (bmcthing out 
of our Courfei and once or tW'ke our Men cry'd. Land 
to the Weftvvard ; l^ut whether it was the Continent ort 
» lllands, we cduW-not tdi by my Means. 

But thethird Day towafdsEvasing,thcSca fmooth, and 
the Weather c^rtii we faw the Sea, as it were, covered to- 
wards the Land with fomcthing very black, not being able 
to difcover what it was ; but after fome Time, our chief 
' Mate going up the main Shrowds a little Way, and look- 
ing 



( H9 ) 

fng at them with a Perfpeiftive, o-y'd out It was an Ar- 
my i I could not imagine what he meant by an Army, 
and {poke a little haftily, calling the Fellow a Fool» or 
fome fuch Word: Nay, Sky fays he^ don't be angry, for it 
is an Army, and a Fleet tooj for I believe there aie a thoU'- 
iand Canoes, yom may fee them paddle along, and they are 
coming towards us too, apace, aad fuM of Men.. 

I WAS a little lurprizM then indeed, and £o was rny* 
Nephew, the Captain j for he had heard flich terrible Stories 
of them in the Ifland, and having never b^en in thoie Seas 
before, that he conld not tell what to think of it, but 
iaid two or three Times, we fhould all be devoured. I 
muft confefs, conlidering we were becalm'd, and the Car- 
rent iet ftrong towards the Shore, I Uk'd it the worle : How- 
ever, I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an 
Anchctf, as ibon as we came £0 near as to know that we 
inuft engage them. 

The Weather continu'd calm, and they came on ipadr 
towards us j fb I gave Order to come to an Anchor, and 
frule all our Sails . As for the Savages, I told them they 
had nothing- to fear but Fire 5 and therefore they fhoukf 

fet th£\s fioats out, and faften them, one dole by the 
lead, and the other by the Stern* and Man them both 
well, and wait the Ifllie in that PoftiM-e: This I M, that 
the Men in the Boats m^ht be ready with Sheets and Buc- 
kets to put out any Fire, thefe Savages might endeavour 
to iix upon the Outfide of the Ship. 

In this Pofture we lay hy for them, and in a littk 
while they came up with us 5 but never was fiich a hor* 
rid Sight feen by Chriftians : My, Mate was much miila*- 
ken in his Calculation of their Number, I mean of a 
thoufand Canoes -y the moil we could make <rf them when 
they t^me up, being about a hundred and fix and twenty, 
aiKl a great many of them too i for fbme of them had 
ijxteen or fevcntcen Men in them, iomd more 3 and the 
ieaft fix or fcven. 

When they came-nearer to U5 they feem*d to be ftruck 
with Wonder and Aiioniihmcnti as at a Sight which they 
had doubtlcfs never fecn before 5 nor coufl they at firft 
as we afterwards undcrflood, know what to make of us : 
They tome boldly up however very near to us, andiiem'd 
G J to 



( ^50 ) 

to go about, to row; round us ; but wc calFd to our Mat 
in the Boats, not to let them come too near them. 

T H I s very Order brought us to an Engagement with 
them, without our deiiging it j for five or fix of thcj'r 
large Gir.oes came fo near our Long-Boat, that our Men 
beckon'd with their Hands to them to keep back, which 
they underftocd Very well, and went back j but at their 
Ren cat, about fo Arrows came on board us from thoic 
^ Beats 5 and one of our Men in the Long-Boat was vcrjr 
»iuch wounded. 

However, I calld to them not to fire by any Means j 
but we handed down Ibme Deal-Boards into the Boat, 
and the Carpenter prdently £ct up a kind of a Fence like 
.wafte Boardsi to covet them fi<>m the Anows of the 
jSavages, if they fhould fhoot Again. 

A B o IT T half an Hour aftcrw^ds they came all up 'ta 
a Body a-jftern of us, and pretty near^ £o near that we 
could eafiJy difcern what they were, tho' we could not 
t;ell their Defign : I cafily f<Hind they were jTome of my 
old Friends, the fame Sort of Sava^s that I had been u- 
fed to engisgc with 5 and in a little Time more they row'd 
a Httle farther out to Sea, 'till thery came dircdtly Broad* 
fide with us, and then row'd down ilrmt upon us, 'till 
they came fo :feear that they cm]d jh^ar us'ipcak : Upon 
this I ordered all my Men t<i keep cb&, k& they Ihoul^ 
fJioot any more Arrows, and made ajj our Guns ready ^ 
but being fo near as to be within hearing, I made JFruiajf 

fo out upon the- Deck, and coil out aloud to them in Ins 
>anguagc, to know what they meantj which accordingly 
he Mdi whether they underflood him or not, that I knew 
xot : But asibon as he had cali-d.to them, fix of them > 
who were ih the fioremoft or^nighcft Boat to us, tuiris

naked Bacfc-fides, juft as if m Engilfhf faving your Pre- 
Icnce, they had. Sid us ktfs >^— 5 whether this was a 
Defiance or Challenge, we know not 5 or whether it ivas 
done in mccr Contempt, or as a Signal to the refi: ; but im- 
mediately Fruky cry*d tm, they weh: going to fhoot, 
and unlfflppily for- him (poor Fellow) they kt fly about 
.300 of their Arrows, and> to my inexpreffible Grief, kill'd

I w A s ib cnrag'd with the Lofs of my old Servant, 
the Companion, of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, that I 
immediately, ordei-'d five Guns to be loaded With fmall 
Shot, and four with great, and gave theiii fuch a Broad- 
fidc^ as they had never heard in their Lives before, to be 
fure» 

They were not above half a Gable's Length off when 
we fir'd, and our Gunners took their Aim fo well, thaf 
three or four of their Cargoes were ovcrfet, (as we Jiad 
Reafon to bcBeve) by owe Sho|: only, 

T H.E ill Mannas of turning up tbsit^ bare Back-fides to

certain, whether that "which woiild pafs for the greatert 
Contempt among us, might be under jElood fo by them, 
or not i therefore in Remm, I had only refolv'd to have 
fir'd four or five Guns with Powder only, which I knew 
would fright them fufficiently : But when they fhot at u« 
dirciSly with all the Fury they were capable 6r, and eQ)e-'

fcft any motej for a Breeze of Wind fpringing up the 
fame Evening, we weighed and fet Sail for the Brafils^ 

We had a Prifbner iudeed ; but the Creature was To 
fullen,thathe would neither cat or /peak i and we all fanfied 
Jhe would flarve himfelf to Death : But I took a Way to cure 
him j for I made them tak€ hirh and turn him into, the Long- 
Boat, and make him believe they wouki tois him into the 
Sea again, and £0 leave him where- they found him, if he 
wdula notipeaki Nor would tlaat do, but they really did 
throw him into the Sea, and came away from' him : and 
then he foUow'd them 5 for he fwam like a Cork, and 
called to them in his Tongue, tho* they knew not one 
Word of what he ^id: However, at laft they took him 
in again, and then he began to be more tradable f nor did 
I ever deiign they fhoilld drown him. 

W E were now under Sail again 5 but I was the moft 
diiconfbkte Creature alive, for want of my M^n J^iday; 
and would have been very glad to have gone back to the 
Ifland, to have taken one ot the reft from thence for my 
Occafioni hit it could not bej fo we went on : We had 
one Prilbner, ^ I have Md 5 and ^twas a long while before 
'we could make him underftand any thing, but, in time,

break them of it 3 nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it 
off, tho' at laft he did, 

Ak D now I name the poor Fellow once more, I muH 
take my laft Leave of him i poor honed Friday I We bu- 
ried him with all the Decency and Solemnity pofTible, by 
putting him into a Coffin, aad throwing him into the Sea: 
And I caus'd *em to fire eleven Guns for him ; and £0 
ended the Life of the rhoft grateful, faithful, honeil, and 
nioft affc^lionate Servant that ever Man had. 
. W E went now away with a fair Wind fpr Brafil, and 
in aboiit twelve Days time we made Land in the Latitude 
of five Degrees South of the Line, being the North- Eafter- 
iHoH: Land of all that Part of America : We kept on S. 
by E. in light of the Shore four Days, when we made 
Cape St. Au^ujiine, and in three Days came to an Anchor off 
of the Bay of AlUSaintSy the old Place of my Deliverance, 
from whence came both my good and evilFate. 

Never Ship came to this Part that had lefs Builneis 
than I had j and yet it was withgveat Difficulty that we 
were admitted' to hold the leafi: Corre4»ondencc on Shore, 
not mjr Partner himfclf, who. was alive, and made a great 
Figure among themj not my two Merchants Truftees, 
nor the Fame of my wonderful Prciervation in, the Ifland, 
could obtain me that Favour : But my Parmer r^rx^embcr* 
icg, that I had given 5"oq Moidpres to the Prior of the 
Monaftry of the Augujjines, and. 37a to the Poor, went to 
the Monaftry, and obligMthe Prior that theii w^ to go 
to the Governor, and get l^ve. for me perfbn$lly, with 
the Captain, and one more, befides eight Seanaen, to come 
on Shore, and no mores and this upon Condition abib- 
lutely capitulated f6r, that we fhoiikl iwt offer to land any 
Goods out of the Ship-, or to carry joiy Peffon away with*- 
out Licence. 

'They were fb {\:xi£k with us, as. to landing any Goods, 
that it was, with extream Difficulty that I got on Shore 
three Bales of Fnglijh Goods, fuch as fincSroad Cbaths, 
Stuffs, and ibme Linncn> which tia4 bought for a Pic-

Hi -was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho* (like 
me) he came from little at firft,- and the' he knew not 
tliat I had the ieall Defign of giving him any thing, he 
fent me on Bc^rd a Preifait of frefti Provifions, Wine, and 
Sweet-ineats, worth above 30 Moidores, inckiding fbme 
Tobacco, and three or four fine Medals in Gold : But I was 
even with him in my Prefent, wkieh, as I haveiaid, con- 
fined of fine broad Cloath, Et^Uflj Stuffs, Lace, and fine 
Hollands : Alfo; I delivered him nbout the Value of 1 00 /. 
SterL in the fame Goods for other Ufes j and I oblig d 
him to fct up the Sloop which I had brought with me 
from Biglandy as I have £aid, for the Ufe ot my Cdony, 
in order to fend the Rcfrdhmcnts I intended to my Plan-

Accordingly, he got Hands, and finiflied the Sho^ 
m a veiy few Days, for Ihc was drcady fiam'd, and I

the Stoop, mk kttk there upon my Letter to the Gover-

for a Plantation; and giving him i<mie Cloaths, and Tools 
for his Pkntii^-work, which he faid he undcrihjod, liav-

When we catsac to fit tfe Man out, my oM Partner 
told me, there was a certain very honeft Fallow, a JSrafiil 
Planter, of has Acfuaintance> wiie toi falkn into the Dil^ 
pleaflii e of the Church j I know, not what the Matter is 
with him, fays hcy^hxit on myConfcienee, I think he is an 
'Heretick in his Heart, and he has been obliged to conceal 
himleif for fear of the Inquifition ; that he would be very 
giad of £ieh an Opportunity to make his Efcape with his- 
Wife and two Daughters; and if I would Jet them go ta 
my Iflacd, and allot them a Phiitatioi?> he would give 

tmm 



tliem a fmall Stock to begin with 5 for the Officers of the 
Inquifition had feiz'd all his Efi^dts and Eftate, and he had 
nothing left but a little Houlhold Stuff and two Slaves. 
And, adds he, tho* I hate Us Piinciples, yet I Vv^uld not 
have him fall into thieir Hands j for he would affiirciJly be 
burnt alive if he does. 

I GRANTED this prefctitlT, and join'd my En^iifiman 
with them, and we conceal'd the ^aii, and his Wife and 
Daughters on Board our Ship, till the Sloop put out, to go 
to Sc^y and then (having'put all their Goods on board SiQ 
Sloop, fbme time before) we put them on board the Sioop^ 
after he was got out of the Baj. 

Our Seaman was mightily pleased with this new Part? 
ner ; and their Stock incfced was much alike rich in Tools, 
in Preparations, and a Farm, but nothing to bfegin With 
but as above : However, they carried 6\^ef WJth them 
(which was worth all the reftj'lome Materi^s for planting

make the reading tirelbme enough, and are pc?fe£tly un- 
profitable to all that read, except only to thofe, who are 
to go to thole Places themfelves. 

I T is enough to naiTje tlic Ports and Places, which we 
touch'd at, and what occur'd to us upon our palTing from 
one to another : We touched fir ft at the I (land of Mada- 
gafcar i where, tho' the People-^re fierce and treacherous, 
and in particular, very well arm'd^i^ith Launces and Bows, 
which they ufe with inconceivable Dexterity, yet we fared 
very well with them a while j they treated us very civil- 
ly, and for fbmc Trifles, which we gave them, liich as 
Knives, Sciflars, e^r. they brought us eleven good fat 
Bullocks, middling in Size, but very good in Flefh j which 
we took in» partly for frefli Proviiions for our preient 
Spending, smd the reft to J&k for tl^ Ship^sUle. 

W E were obliged to ftay here fomc time, after we had 
furnifh'd our felvcs with Provifions ^ and I, that was al- 
ways too curious, to look into every Nook of the Woild 
where-ever I came, was for going on Shore as often as I 
could : It was on the Eaft-fide of the Ifland that we went 
on Shore one Evening, and the People, who by the Wky^ 
are very numtrous, came thronging about us, and ftood 
gazing at us at a Diftance : As we had traded freely with 
them, and had been kindly ufed, we thought our (elves in 
no Danger i but when we law the Peope, we cut three 
Boughs out of a Tree, and ftuck them up at a Diftance 
fi-om u«, which it leems, is a Mark in the Country, not 
only of Truce and Friendiliip, but when it is accepted, the 
other Side fet up three Pofes or Boughs 7&£oi which is a 
Signal, that they accept the Truce too 5 but then, this is a 
knovirn Condition of the Truce, that you arc not to pafs 
beyond their three Poles towards them, nor they comepaft 
your three Poles or Boughs, towards you 5 £6 that you are 
perfectly fecure within the three Poles, and all the Space 
between your Poles and theirs, is allow'd like a Market, 
for free Converfe, Traftick and Commerce : When youg> 
there, you muft not carry your Weapons with you j and if 
they come into that Space, they ftick up their JaveMnes and 
Launces, all at the firft Poles, and come on unarmed f 
■ but if any Violence is ofFer'd them, and the Truce thereby" 
broken, away they run to the Poles, and ky hold of their 
Weapons, and thm the Truce is at an End* 



( i6o ) 

It happen'd one Evening when we went on Shore, that 
a greater Number of their People came down than uiual, 
but all was very friendly and civil: They bi ought with them 
ieveral Kinds of Provilions, for which we iatisfied them, 
with fuch Toys as wc hadj their Women alio brought us 
Mijk, aud Roots, and icveial Things very acceptable to us, 
and all was quiet j and vm made us a little Tent or Hut, 
of fome Boughs and l^rces, and lay on Shore alh that 
Night. > 

I K NOW not what was the Occafion, but I was not fo 
• v^cll iatisfied. to lie on Shore as the reft,, and the Boat ly-^ 
iiig at an Anchor, about a Stone's Call from, the Land? with 
two Men in her to take Caie of her j I made one of them 
come on Shore, and getting ibme Boughs of Trees to co- 
ver us alfo in the Boat, I fpread the Sail on the Bottom of 
the Boat, and lay under the Cover on board of the Branches 
of the Trees all Night. 

About two a Clock in the JVferning, we heard one of 
our Men^ make a terrible Noifis on the Shore, calling ou| 
for God's Sake, to brin^; tlie Boat in, and come and help 
them, for they were aUlike to murthcr'd.j at the iame 
Time, I heard the firing of five Muskets, which was the 
Number of the Guns they had, and that, three Times o- 
ver , for it icems, the Natives here were not fo eafily 
fiightcdwithGiins, as the Savages were ia America, where 
I.&d to dovwith them. . 

All this while, I kn^ not what was:the Matter ^ but 
rou5!iing immediately froni Sleep with the. Noiie, I caus'd 
the Boat to be.thruft in, and relolv'd, with three FuiHswc 
had (^ board, to land, and afliii- our Meir^ 

We got the Boat ibon to the Shore, but our Men were 
in two much hafte : For being come to the Shore, they 
pjung'd into the Water, to get. to the Boat, with all tlie 
Expedition they could, being puriued by between three and 
four hundred Men : Our Mcft-; woe but nine, in all, and 
only five of tlicm had FuUl^ With them 5 the reft indeed 
had PiUoIs and Swords, but they .were of fmali^Ufc to 
them. 

We took up ieven of our Mca, and v/itB Difficulty 
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded 5 and that 
which was ftill worie, was, that while we flood in the^oat 
to take our Mcirin, wcwere ia as much Danger as th«y 

wae 



( r<Sr ) 

were in on Shorc'i for they pom 'd their Arrows in upon usfb 
thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of the Boat 
Hpwith the Benches, and two or three loofc Boaids, which 
to our great Satisfndlion, we had by nieie. Accident, or 
Travidence rpfther^ in the Boat. 

And yet, had it been Day-light, they are, it feems, 
fuch exa<ft Maikfinen, that i'i they could have ieen but the 
leaft Part of any of us, they would have been fuie of us 5 
we had ^y the Light of the Moon a iiftle Sight of them, 
as they ftood pelting us fiom the Shore with Darts and 
Arrows i and having got ready our Fire- Arms,, we gave 
them a Volley, ^d we could hear by the Cries of jSme 
of them, that we had wounded feveral i however, they 
ftood thus in Battle- Array on the Shore /till Break of Day„ 
which we jRippoie was, that they might fee the better to 
take their Aim at us. 

In this Condition we lay, and' cotikf not tett how to 
wtigh our Anchor, or (et up our Sail, becaufc wc mufl: 
needs fland up in the Eo..t, and they w^eic as fure to hit 
us, as we wei e to hit a Biid m a Tree with fmall Shot y 
we made Signals of Dreis to the Ship, which, though we 
rode a League off, yet my Nephew, the Captain, hcarmg 
our Filing, and by Qlafles, perceiving the Poilme we lay 
in, and thk wc nr'd towards the Shore, pretty well un* 
derfcood us 5 and weighing Anchor, with all Speedy heftood 
as near the Shore as he durfl with the Sliip,^ and then 
lent another Boat, with ten Hands in her, to affiH vj^y but 
v/e call d to them not to come too near, telling them what 
Condition we were in ; However, they flood in neaier to^ 
wsi and one of the Men, taking the End of a Towiine. 
m his Hand, and keepinig our Boat between him and thcL 
Enemy, £b that they coufi not jorfecfUy fee tim^ J[wam on 
iToard us, and Tmik- t}ie Line fafl to the Boat j upon which, 
we ilippM our little Cable, and- \wvi^ our. Anchor Behind, 
they tow'ti us out of the. Reach orthe ^^rrrows, we alL 
• the wliiie lying clofe behind the Banicado we had. 
made. 

As ibon as we wcie got from between the Ship and 
the Shore, that fhe could lay her Sidfe to the Shore, fha 
run along juil by them, and we pourM in a Broad-fide ^

When we were got on board, and out of Danger, we 
had Time to examine into the Occafion of this Fray , and 
indeed our Sufra-Car^o, who had been often in thoie Parts., 
put me upon jt i -for he faid", he was fare the Ijnhabitants 
would not -have touched us, after we had made a Truce, 
if we had hot donfe fomethmg to provoke them ,to^ it : At 
kngth it came out, (^'/VJ that an old Woman, who had 
come to fell us fbme MiJk, had brought it within" our 
Poles, with a young Woman with her, who alfo brought 
fbme Roots or Herhs j and while the old Woman, whe- 
ther ftie was Mother to the young Woman pT> no, they 
could iiotteil, was, feBing us the Milk, one of ojir Mea; 
offered fbrne Rudenefi to the Wench that was with her, 
^ which the old Wbinan made a great Koijfe: . Hoy^^ever,, 
the Seaman would not quit his Prize, but c^ed her out 
of the old Woman's Sight, ' anaong the Treesv it Ijeing al- 
most dark j the oM Woman we^ away without ha, and 
as we fuppoie, made an Out-cry among the People fl-e 
came from i who upon Noti<^e, rais'd tliis great Army, up- 
on us in three or four Hours j and it wa^ great Q^s^ but 
wc had been ail deftroy'd. X 

One of our M^ was killed, with a Lauiic^. that was 
tJiro\vn at hini, jiift at the Beginning of fliie .Attack, as he 
fiilley*d out of the Tent Ve l)ai, xmdp j th^e reft came off 
free, all but the Fellow who was theOccafion of all the 
Mifchief, who paid dear enough for his, black Miftre(s5 (qs 
We could not hear what became of him, a ^eat whiles wc 
lay upon the Shore two Days after, though tjie Wmdpre-. 
iented, and inadc Signals for him y made our Boat fail up 
Shore and down Shore/ ieveral Leagues, but in vainj jR> 
we were oblig'd to give him over, and if he ajb^c iiad fiif-

I COULD not {atisfy my icli:^ Iwwever, without vefi- 
turing on Shore once more, to try if I could leara any 
Thing of him, or them j it was the third Night after the 
A<ftion, that I had a great Mind to learn, if I could by any 
Means, what Miichicf we had done, and hpw th^ Game

der my Command, before I engag'd m a Thing £o Iiatar- 
dous and milchicvous, as I was Draught into hj it, without 
vwy Knowledge or Delign. 

VV E took tvv'cnty jQ-out Fellows .with us as any in the 
Shi'py beiidcs the Supm-Cpirgo and my Iclfi and wc landed 
two Hours before Midnight^ at the iame Place where the 
J7idfans Hood drawn up the Evening before, I landed here, 
Icciuic my J>i]gn, as I hiYt laid, v/as chiefly to fee if 
they had quitted the F ield, and if they iiad left any Marks 
behind them of the Mifchief we had done theiii j and I 
thought, if we could fur prize one or two of them, 
perhaps v/e might get our Man again by Way of Ex- 
change. 

V/ E landed without any Noiie, and divided our Men in- 
to two Companies, whereof, thcBoatfwain commanded 
one, and I the other : We neither could hear nor fee any 
body flir when we landed, ib wc marched up, one Body ^ 
a Diilance from the other, to the Field of Battle : At firll 
we could fee nothing, it being veiy dark i but by and by, 
our Boatfwain, that led the firft Party, fhimbied and feU 
over a dead Boy; this made them halt a while, for know- 
ing by the Circumftances that they were at the Place where 
the Indians kid flood, they waited for my' coming up ,• 
here we concluded to halt 'till the Moon began to x\£cy 
which we knew wouki be in lefs than an Houri and then 
we could eafily difcern the Havock we had made among 
them 5 we told tv^o and thirty Bodies upon the Ground,, 
whereof two wure not quite dead: Some had an Aim, 
and fbmc a Leg fhot off, and <Hie his Head 5 thofb 
that were wounded we fuppos'd, they had carried a- 
way, ' ' 

W H E N we liad made, as T thought, a full Difirovery of 
of all we could come at the Knowledge of, I was for go- 
ing on Board again j but the Boatfwain and his Party of 
ten, fent me Word, that they were re&Iv'd to make a Vi- 
*iit to the Indian Town, where thefe Dogs, as theyi called 
them, dwelt, and defir'd me to go along with them j and 
if they could find them, as flill they fanfied they fhould,

have commanded them inftantly on board, knowing it was 
not a Hai^ard fit for us to run j who had a Ship, and Shit)*s

pended very much upon the Lives of the Men i but as they

Men, will you go with me? Fll go for one, fack ^id he 
would, and another followed, and then another ,• and in a 
Word, they all left me but one, who, with much Difficul- 
ty too, I perfuaded to ftayj £0 thcSufra-Cctrgo and I, with 
the third Man, went back to the Boat, where, J told them, 
we would flay for them, and take Care to take in as many 
of them aslhould beleftj for / told 'em it was a mad Thing 
tHoj were going about, and fuppoied moil of 'em would 
lun the Fate of Tho, fefry. 

They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they 
would come off again, and they would take care, ^c. So 
away they went : I entreated 'em to confider the Ship and 
the Voyage 5 that their Lives w«rc not their own, and 
that they were entrufled with the Voyage ip fbme mea- 
iiire I that if they mifcarry'd^ the Ship might be loft for 
want of their Help, and that they could not anfwer it to 
God or Man r I faid a great deal more to ^cm on that 
Head, buM might as well have taik'd to the Main-Maft of the 
Ship, they were mad upon- their Journey, only they ^vo 
me good Words, and begg'd I would not ht angry 5 iaid> 
they wouki be very cautious,.' and they did not doubt but 
they would be back again in about an Hour at fartheft i 
for the Indian Town, they laid, was not above half a Mile • 
<>fiF : Tho: they found it s6ne two Miles before they g&t ta 
it. 

Well, they all went away, as above ,• and tho*the 
Attempt Avas. delpeiate, and fuch, as none but Madmen 
would have gone about, yet to give 'em their due, they 

went

went about it warily as well as boldly < They were galant- 
ly armed, that's true i for they had every Man a Fuxee or 
Musket, a Bayonet, and every Man a Piftoi -, fomc of them 
had broad Cutlafles, Ibmc ot them Hangers and the Boat- 
fwain and two more had .Pole- Axes : Beiides ail which, 
they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenadocs : Bolder 
Felbws, and better provided, never went about any wick^ 
ed Work in the World. 

W 41 E N they went out, their chief Delign was Plunder, 
and they were in mighty hopes of finding Gold there , but a 
Circumflance which none of them were aware of, ict 
them on fire with Revenge, and made Devils of them all : 
When they came to the few Indian Houies, which they 
thought had been the Town, which was not above half a 
Mile off i they were under a great Di {appointment , for 
there were not above 12 or thirteen Houles, ,and where 
the Town was, or how big, they knew not : They con- 
fultcd therefore what to do, and were fbme time before 
they could reiblve ; For if they fell upon thelc, they muft 
cut all their Throats, and it was ten to one but Tome 
of them might efcape, it being in the Night, tho* the 
Moon was up 5 and if one efcaped, he would run away, 
and raife all the Towns, fo they fliould have a whole Army 
upon them : Again, on the other hand, if they went a- 
way and left thoie untouch'd (for the People were all 
ailecp) they couid not tell which Way to look for the 
Town. 

H o w EV E R, . tl^ laft was the bed: Advice i £0 they re- 
Iblved to leave thoiie Houfes, and look for the Town as 
well as they couki ; They went on a little way, and found a 
Cow tied to a Trecj. this they preieutly concluded, would 
be, a good Guide to thcmi for th/ey {aid, the Cow certain- 
ly, befonged to thie Town before them, or the Town be- 
hind themj >an4 tf.tliey untied her, thcv fliould iee which 
Way Aie went > ijf il^.C; went Uck they iiad nothing to fay 
ti|f herj but if (he, wept forward, they had nothing to do 
h\st toioUow her, fo they cut the Cord, whjfih was made 
of twifted Flags, and the Cow went on before them ,• in 
. a Word, the Cow led them dirc£ily to the Town, which 
as they reported, confifled of above 200 Houfes, or Huts ; 
and in fome of thefe> they found {everal Families living 
together. 

. Here 



( 166) 

Here they found all Silent j as profoundly fecurc, as 
Sleep, and a Country that had never feen an Enemy of 
that Kind, could make them j upon this, they call'd another 
Council to confider what they had to do 3 and in a Word, 
they refolv'd to divide themiclves into three Bodies, and to 
ict three Hcufes on Fire in three* Parts of the Town 5 and 
as the Men came out, to fcize them and bind them 5 if any re- 
fided, they need not be ask 'd what to do then, and ib to 
fearch the. reft of the Houfes for Plunder > but they re- 
fblv*d to march filently hrft, thro' tiie Town, and iee what 
Demenflons it was of^ and Coniider if they might ventu e 
upon it, or no. 

T H E Y did fb, and dcfperately refblv'd that they would 
venture upon them j but while they were animating one 
another to the Work, three of them that were a little be- 
fore the reft, call out aloud, and told them they had found 
Thorn, Jefvy j they all ran up to the Place, and fb it was 
indeed, for there they found the poor Fellow, hang'd up 
naked by one Arm, and his Throat cut i there was an /»- 
difm Houlejuft by the Tree, where they found fixteen or 
icventeen or the principal Indians who nad been concein'd 
in the Fray with us before, and two or three of them 
wounded with our Shot} and our Men found they were 
awake, and talking one to another in that Houie, but knew 
not their Number. 

The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade fo cnrag'd 
^em, as before, tl;at they fwore to one another they would 
be revenged, and that not -an Indian who came into their 
Hands lliould have Quarter, and to work they went imme- 
diately 5 and yet not fo madly as by the Rage and Fury 
they were in, might be expected : Their firft Care was to 
get ibmethir^ that would ibon take Fire, but after a little 
Jearch, they foumi tiat would be to 1^0 purpofc, for mofl 
•of theHoufesw«re low,' andThatch'dwith Flags or Rushes, 
of wMch the Country is full r^b they prefcntif made fome 
wild Fire, as m edit it, by wetting ^ little Powder in the • 
Pahns of their Hafnds, and iri: a quattfer of an-Hour tibey 
fct the ' Td wn ott Fire ; in four or fiyc. Places 5 arid particu- 
*larly that Houfc where the Indians ^n^cre not fone^to Bed- 
;As fbon as the Fire began to blaze, the poor fr^hted Crea- 
tures began to rufli out to fkvc their Ltres /but met with 
thek Fate in the Attempt, and elpecially attheDoor,wtee 

they 



( '^7 ) 

they drove them back, the Boatfwain himfelf killing one 
or two with his Polc-Ax ; The Houfe being large, and 
many in itj.hie did not care to go in, but cali'dfor aHand- 
Grenado, and threw it among *em, which at firfl frighted 
'cm j but when it burft, made iuch Havock among ,em, 
that they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In fhort mofl of the Indians who were in the open Part 
of the Houfcj were kWM or hurt with the Grenado, except 
two or three itiore whoprefi'dto the Door, which theBoat- 
{wa'n and two more kept with their Bayonets in the Muxzles 
of their Pieces, and dii patched all who came that Way. But 
there ^vas another Apartment in the Houfe where the Prince 
or King, or whatibever he was, and fcveral others were, 
and thefe they kept in till the Houie, which was by this 
time all of a light Flame, fell in upon them, and they were 
fmotherM or burnt together. 

All this while they fir'd not a Gun, becauic they 
would not waken the People fafter than they could mafta: 
them J but the Fire began to waken them faft enough, 
and our Fellows were glad to keep a little together in bo- 
dies j for the Fire ffrewlb raging, all the tloules being made 
of light combuftible Stuff, that they could hardly bear the 
Street between them, and their Bulinefs was to roibw the 
Fiie for the iiirer Execution : As faft as the Fire either forced 
the People out of thofe Houfes which were burning, or 
frighted them Out of others, our People were ready at their 
Doors to knock them on the Head, ftill calling and hol- 
lowing to one another to remember Tho, ^spys. . 

While tWs was^^doing, I muf! coiifels I was very un- 
eafy, and ^f^cially ^heq I iaw the Flames of the Town, 
which, it bcii^g Night, feem'd to be juft by me. 

M Y Ncpliew, the Captain, who was roUz^d by his Men 
too, feeing fuch a Fire was very uneafy, not knowing 
vi^hiat the TOttter" was, or- what T)atiger I ivas ; iti j cfpeci- 
ally Jiearing^the Gtms too, for by Jthil time they tx;gan to 
' tife'^their Ftrcf-Arms j a tliouland Thoughts opprefl: his 
Mfnd dbntmiirte me, and the' Strpra-Cargo, what fliould 
tebitte <>f us PK0 at Mft,' though he could : ill ipare any 
Imbfe'Man', yet notfcftowrag what Exigence we might be 
In, he takes another Bq^t, and with 13 Men and himfelf, 
comes <>rt^ Shore to- me. 

Ha 



(f id8: ) 

He was furpriz^Vi to fee mc and the Slipar-Cargo in the 
Boat with no more tlian two Men, for one had been left 
to keepthe Boat } and tho' he was glad that we were wj:]!, 
yet he was in the fame Impatience with us to know what 
was doing j for the Koife continued and the Flame en- 
creas'd : I ConTefs, it was next to an Impofllbility for any 
Men in the World to reftrain their Curiofity of knowing, 
what had happened, or their Concern for the Safety of the 
Men : In a Word, the Captajn told me, he would go and 
help his Men, let what would come : I argu'd wini him 
as I did before with the Men, the Safety oi the Ship, and 
the Danger of the Voyage, the Intereft of the Owners and 
Merchants, i^c. and told him, I would go and the two 
Men, and only fee if we could at a Diftance learn what 
was like to be the Event, and come back and tell him. 

I T was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it was to 
talk to the reft before j he would go, he faid, and he only 
wifl\'d he had left but ten Men in the Shipj for he could 
not think of having his Meii loft for want of lld^, he had 
rather, he faid^ loole the Ship, the Voyage, and hx5 Life 
and all j and fb away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to flay behind now, than I 
was to perfuade them not to go before 5 {o in fhort, the 
Captain ordered two Men to row back the Pinnance, and 
fetch twelve Men more from the Ship, leaving the Long- 
Boat at an Anchor, ajid that when they came back, lix 
Men fhould keep the two Boats and fix more come after 
us i £0 tliat he left <»ily 16 Men in the Shipj for the whole 
Ship's Company confiM of 6^ Men, whereof two were 
loft in the hrft (parrel, which brought this Mifchicf on. 

Being now on the march, you may be fiire we felt 
little of the Ground we trode on 5 and being guided by the 
Fire, we kept no Path, but went dire^ly to the Place of 
the Flame: If the Noife of the Guns was fcrpriiing to us 
before, the Cries of the poor People were now oT quite 
another N^turc^ and filfd us with Horrbr : I muft|Con-» « 
fefs I never w^s at t|ie Jlacking of a City, or at the. taking 
of a Town, W Stprnii I Imve heard o^ Oliver Cromwell 
taking Droghedft in Irelmd, and killing Man, Woman and 
Chiki : And I had read of Count Tillyy lacking of the.City 
oi Magdebwgh, and cutting the Throats of 21000 of all 

Sexes; 



( t69 ) 

Sexes: But I never haA an Idea of tHe Thing it fclf before, 
nor is it poflTible to defcribe iU or tiie Horror wlikh was 
upon our Minds at, hiring it. 

How £ vEji, we went on, and at length came to the 
Town, tlid* there was no entring the Streets of it for the 
Fire : The firft Obje^ we met with, was the Ruins of a 
Hut or Houfe, or rather the A^es of it, for the Houie was 
confum'dj and juil before it, plain now to be ieen by the 
Light of the Fire, lay four Men and three Women kill dj * 
and as we tliought, one or two more lay in the Heap a- 
mong tlie Fire : In fliort, there were fuch Inftances of a 
Rage altogetfe barbarous, and of a Fury, fomethiiig be- 
yond what was human, that we thought it impoirible our 
Men could be guilty of it i or if they were the AutJiors of 
it, we thought that every one of 'em ought to be put to 
the worft or Deaths: But this was not all, we law the 
Fire encreas'd forward, and the Cry went on jufl as the 
Fire went on, ib that we were in the utmofl: Coufufiou i 
We advanc'd a little Way farther, and beheld, to our Ailo- 
niiliment, three Women naked, crying in a molt dread- 
ful Manner, and flying, as if they had 'mkScuA had Wini^s, 
and after them iixtecn or feventeen Men, JSIativeSj in the 
lame Terror and Confternation, with three of our Engliflt 
Butchers, for I can call them no better, in their Rear ^ who* 
when they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them, 
and one that was kill'd by their Shot fell down in our 
flight i when the reft law us, believing uS;to be their Ene- 
mies, and t\m we would murther t&ufi aSr well as thofe 
that purfued them, they fet up a moft dreadful Shreik, e- 
fpecially the Women i and two of them fell down as if 
already dead with the Fright. . - ^ ,, 

My very Soul ilirunk within me, and niy Blood run 
chil in my Veins, when I law thisj and I believe, had the 
three EngUfh Sailois, that purfued them, come on, I had 
made our Men kill them all: However, we took^fomc Ways 
to let the popr flying Creatures know, tha? we would not 
hihtthem, and immediately they came up to us, and kneel- 
ing down^ witi^ thek Hands lifted up, ^wade pitious La- 
ntentation to us; to lave them, which we let them know 
we would do j whereupon they kept altogether in a Huddle 
dole behind us for Protection : I left my Men drawn up 
together, and charg'd them to hurt no bwody, but if polfible 
H to 



( 170 ) 

to get at ibme of our People, aiid fee what Devil it was 
pofiefs-d tKem, and what they intended to do> and, in a 
Word, to comn>and them oftj alluring, them, that if they 
flay'd till Day-light they would h^vt: an ]fundi'6d thoufaHd ' 
Mien abour their gats: 1,%, I 'left them, and went among < 
thole flying People;' takirlg only two of our Men with 
mci and there was indeed *a pitious Spe6i:acle among them: 
Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt with trampling 
and running thro' the Fire, others their Hands burnt, one 
of. the Women hid fallen down in'*Hie Fire, and was al- 
xnoft burnt to Dedth before ilie cduld'get out again j two 
or three of the Men had Cuts in their Backs .and Thighs 
from our Men pufluing 5 and anotlfdr was fhot thro' the 
Body, and died while 1 was thert. 

I WOULD fain -have learned what the Occalion of all 
this was, but I could not undcrftand one Word they faid ; 
tho' by Signs I perceieved that fome of them knew not 
what was the Occafion themfelvcs : I was fo terrified in 
my Thoughts at this outrageous Attempt, that I could not 
ftay there, but Went back to my own Men j I told them 
my Refolution, and commanded them td follow me, when 
irb the very Moment came four of our Men with the Boat- 
fwain at their Head, roving over the Heaps of Bodies they 
had kiird, all covered v^ith Blood andbufl, as if they want- 
ed more People to maflacrc, when our Men hallow 'd to 
tJiem as loud a^ they could hallow, and with much ado 
one of them made tbsm. hear; lb that they knew who we 
were, arid came up to us. 

As foon as tlic'Boaffwain (avvf us, lie let up, a Hallow

poor Fellow hanging upon the Tree wkh his Throat cut. 

I CONFESS, I was urg*d%en my felf, and at another 
Time fliould have been forward enough ; but I thought 
they had carried their Rage too far, and thduglit of ^/t<r(7^^ 
Words to hxsSovi^ Simeon and Levi ; Curfed oe their. Anger ^ 
for it 'SPAS fierce ; tmd their Wraths for it re its crud : But 
I had now a new Task upon my Hunds ,♦ for Avft^n the 
Men I carried with me fawthe Sight as I had d(Xie, Ihad 
as much to dotoreftrain theni, as Ifhould have had with 
the other j nay, my Nephew himfelf fell- in with them, and 
- told me in their hearing, that he was only concerned for 
fear of the Men being oyerpower'd, for as to the People, 
he thought not one of 'em ought to live j for they had 
all glutted themielves with the Murthcr of the poor Man, 
and that they ought to be ufed like Murtheiers : Upon 
thefe Words, aWay run eight 'of my Mdi with the Boat- 
fwain and his Crew, to complcat their blood/ Work,- and 
I feeing it quite out of my Tower torreftrairt tliem, canic 
away penllve and .fad} for I.coulrftidtbcat^thc Sight, much 
lefs thehorribfc Noife and Cries of tH^ poor Wretches that 
fell into their Hands. 

I G o T no body to come bade ivith the but tlie Supr^* 
Carp and two Men j and with theftr I walk d baclc to 
the Boats : It wps a verf grieat Pfece of Fdlly in- me» 
I confefs, to- venture back, as it were ^ne ,* for as it 
began now to be almoft Day, and the '^^larsn had run' 
over the Country, thpre fteod' about 40 Men arm'd with 
Launces and Bows at thc^lfttle Place ; where the iz or 15* 
Houies flood mention'd before; bat by Accident I mifs'cf 
, the Place, aiKl came diredly to the Sea-fide, and by the 
Tunc I got to the Sea-fide it was broad Thji immediately 
1 took the Pinnstee; and went a-board, and ient her back tof 
aflift ftis Men in whkt mi^t hapjptn. 

I dB^ERV^D that about the Time I came to the BoatW 

fide , the Fir« was pretty well out , and the Noife a** 

tatcdi' but in about naif an Hour after I got on boani, f 

kssid a Vo&rf of our Men's Firc^Anas, and &w a great 

H * Smoakg 



X n^ ) 

Smoak j this, as I underftood afterwards was our Men fal- 
ling upon the forty Men, who, as I {aid, flood at the few 
Houles on the Way j of whom they kill'd lixtcen or ieven- 
tccn, and let all thofe Houfes on Fire, but did not meddle 
v/ith the Women or Children, 

B y that Time the Men got to the Shore again with 
the Pinnace, our Mai began ixi appear j they came drop- 
ping in, fbme and Ibme j not in two Bodies, and in Form 
as t^cy went out, but all in Heaps, ftraggling here, and 
there, in fuch a Manner, that a fmali Force of refolute 
Men might have cut them all off. 

But the Dread of them was upon the whole Country : 
The Pct)ple were amax'd, and fiirpriz^d, and fb flight^, 
tliat I believe a hundred of 'em would have fled at the 
Sight of but five of our Men. Nor in all this terrible A.c- 
tion was there a Man who made any conliderable De- 
fence j they were £o ilirpriz'd between the Terror of the 
Vim, and the fudden Attaque of our Men in the Dark, that 
they knew not which Way to turn them {elves -, for if 
thej fled one Way, they were met by one Party, if bark 
again, by another ; £o that they were every where knocked 
down : Nor did anj^ of our Men receive tlie leaft Hurt, 
except one who {Irain'd his Foot, and another had one of 
his Hands very much burnt. 

I was very angrv with my Nephew the Captain, and 
indeed with aJlthe Men, in my Mind, but with mm in par- 
ticular j as well for his acting fb out of his Duty, as Com- 
niiindcr of the Ship, and having the Charge of the Voy- 
age lipi^ft him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, 
the Rage of his Men, in loblo<>dy and cruel anEnterprize : 
My Nephew 'aiii^er'd me very refpe<9:fully, but told me, 
that when he lay the Body of the poor Seaman, whom 
they liad mLUithet'd in flich' a cruel and barbarous Manner, 
he was not Mafler of hinifyf, i^ither could he govern his 
PulVioa : He, own*d, he {hqpld not have done fo, as he 
was CJonimandcr of the Ship 5 but as he was a Man, and 
Nature niov'd hirii, he could not bear it : As for the refl 
of the Men, they were not fubje^t to me at all, and thcV 
knew it well enough i £0 they tdokno notice of mv Dit 

like. ' ' y '^'" ^ ^^' 

%Th E.next Day S^-c let {ail, Co we never heard any more 
of it^ Our Men diffbr'd in the Acxxjunt of the Number 

they 



(m) 

they kiird : Some Md one Thing, Jbme another 5 but ac- 
cording to the befl of their Accounts put altogether, 
they kill'd or deflroy'd about lyo People, Men, Wo- 
men, and Children, and left not a Houie flanding in the 
Town. 

As for the poor Fellow, Tho, Jegrys, as he was quite 
dead, for his Throat was ik> cut, that his Head was Iialf 
oft it would do him no Service to bring him away, fo 
they left him where tliey found him, only took him 
down from the Tree where he was hang'd by one 
Hand. 

However juft our Men thought this A£lion to be, I was 
againft them in iti and I always after that Time, told 
them, God would blafl the Voyage, for I }ook*d upon ail 
the Blood they (bed that Night to be Murther in them : 
For tho' it is true, that they nad kill'd Tho, yeffrys, yet it 
was as true, tkit f^yy^ was the Aggreflbr, Tiad broken 
the Truce, and had violated or debauch d a voung Woman 
of theirs, who came to our Camp innocently j and on the 
Faith of their publick Capitulation. 

The Boatfwain defended this Quarrel when we were after- 
wards on board : Hefaid, It was true, thatwefeem'dtobrqik 
the Trace, but reaHy had not, and that die War was begun ' 
the Night before by the Natives themfelvcs, who had fliot at 
us, and kill'd one of our Men without any juft Provocation 5 
fb that as we were in a Capacitv to fight them, we might 
alfobe in a Capacity to do our ielves Juftice upon them, in 
an extraordinary Manner ^ that tho' the poor Man had tak^n 
a httle Liberty with a Wench, he ought not to have been mur- 
ther'd, and tliat in flich a villainous Manner : And that they 
did nothing but what was juft, and what the Laws of 
God allow d to be done to Murtherers, 

One would think this fhould have been enough to hare 
warn'd us, againft gc«ng on Shore among Hear hens and 
Barbaiians^ But it is impoflflble to make Mankind wile, 
but at their own Expence," and their Experience &ems 
to be always of . mod Uie to them, when it is deaiefl: 
bought. t 

We were now bound to the Gulph of P^r/^i*, and from 

thence to the Coafl of Coromandel^ only to touch at Sur- 

rat : But the chief of the Supr^Carg^'s Deiign lay at the 

Bay of Bengalt, where, if he mifs*d of his Bufaiefi out- 

H 3 ward 



( X74 ) 

ward bound, lie was to go up to China, and return to the 
Cbaft as he came Home. 

The firft Difcfler that befel us, was in the Gulph ot 
Terjiay where five of our Men venturing on Shore, on the 
Arabian Side of the GuJph, were flirroundedby the Arabs y 
and either all kill'd, or carried away into Slavery 5 the rell: 
,of the Boat's Crew were not able to refcue them, and had 
jbut juil Time to get off their Boat , I began to upbraid 
them with the jufl Retribution of Heaven in this Cafe, 
tut the Boatfwain very warmly told me, he thought I 
went farther in my Cenfures, than I could fliew any War- 
rant for in Scripture, and referred to the 13th St. Luke^ 
Verfe 4th, wheie our Saviour intimates, twX thoie Men, 
on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were not Sinners a-- 
hove all the Galileans 5 but that which indeed put me to 
Silence in the Cafe, was tliat none of thefe ^sfc Men, who 
were now loft, were of the Number of thofe who wene 
on Shore to theMaflacrc oi Madagafcar-y (pt I always caUd 
Uy tho" our Men could net hear the Word Maflacre veith any 
Patience :) And indeed, this laft Circumilance, as I have 
,iaid, put me to Silraice Ibr the prefent. 

B c T n\y frequent preaching to them 00 this Subjc<£t, 
.had v\^orie Confequences than I expelled 5 and the Boat- 
i^vain, who had been the Head of the Attempt, came up 
boldlj^ to me one Time, and told me, he found, that I 
continually brought that Afiair upon the Staee, that I made 
vnjiift Refiedions vpon it, and had ufed the Men very ill

ft 5 and that I had on all Occasions fpokcn my Mind free- 
ly about it, tho' not more upon him than any of the reft j 
that as to my having no Command in the Ship, that 
was true: nor did I exerciie any Authority, only took my 
Liberty of Ipeaking my Mind in Things which publickiy 
concerned us all, as to what Concern I Sad in the Voyage, 
that was none of his Bulineis; I was a confiderable Owner 
of the Ship j and in that Claim I conceived I had a Right 
' to {peak, even farther than I had yet done, and would not 
be accountable to him or any one elfe, and begun to be a 
little lyarm with him ; He matie but little R^ply to me at 
that TimCj and I thought that Affair ha4 been over : Wo 
were at irhis, Time in the Road of Bengali, and being wil- 
ling to fee the. Place, I went on. Shore with the Supra-C.argo 
in the Ship's Boatj to divert my felfi and towards Even- 
ing, was freparing to go on Board, when one of tlie 
Men <:ame to mc, and told me, he would not have me 
trouble my felf to come down to the Boat, for they had 
Orders not to carry me on Board i any one may gueft 
what a Surpi^ize I ,was,in, at io infclent a Meflage , and I 
ask*d the Man^ A^hobad Ixirti deliver that Errand to me ? 
'He told me, the Cockfwain : I iaid no more xo the Fel- 
low, bi^t bad him let them know he had delivered his Mdr 
fage, and that I had given him no Anfwer to it, 

I immediately went and found out the Supr^rCargo, and 
told him the Story, adding what I preiently jferelaw, {ijiz..) 
That there would certainly be a Mutiny in tlic Sliip, and 
intreated him to go immediately on Board the Ship in an 
Indifiin Boat, and acquaint the Captzdn of it i but I might 
ha' Ipar'c^ this Intelligence, for before I had fpoken to 
him on Shore, the Matter was elFedied on Boird, the 
Boatfwain, the Gunner, the; Carpenter 3 m^y in a Word, 
all tjie Inferior Offi<:ers, as ibon as I was eoneibfF in the 
Boat, camt up to the Quarter-Deck, and dciir'd to ipeak 
with, the Captain, and there tlie Boatfwain making a long 
Haj-angue, for the Fellow talkd very well, and repeating 
all' he had faid to mq, Xtf^ the Gap^am in few Words, 
tha'^ as I was now gono p^a^eably on iSjiojfe, they were 
;loatfi to ule.any.Viole5L^9' witl;;:m^i^cwiueh,af i had not 
gbrie on Shore, they wmild otherwii^h^vedOne,; to oblige 
me to have gone: They thcrcfere thp^ht. fittotcH him^ 
that as they fhipp'd themlelves to £erve in the Ship under 
H 4 his 



his Gommand, tliev would perform it faitKfdIy, Biit i£ I 
Would not quit the Ship, or the Captain oblige me to 
quit it, they would all leave the Ship, and fail no farther 
with hinl ; and at that Word ALL, he turn 'd his Face 
iho^st towards the Main-maft, which was it (eems the 
Signal agreed on between them ,* at which all the Seamen 
being got tegettei ^^^Y cry'd out. One and A LL, One 
and ALL. 

M Y Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, and of 
great Prefence of Mind, and tho' he was furpriz'd, you 
may be fure, at the Thing, yet he told them calrnly, that 
he would confider of the Thing, but that fie could do no- 
thiijg in it, till he had ipoken to me ahput it,' He u§*d 
ibine Arguments with them, to iliew them the Uiirealbn- 
ablenefs and Injuftice of the Thing, but it was all in vain, 
they iVore and fhook Hands round, before hjs Face, that 
they would go ail on ShorCj unlefs he would engage to 
them, not to liiifer me to come onboard the Ship. 

This was a ha^d Article upon him, who knew his Q- 
bligarion to me, and did not know how I might take it.; 
Sq he began to talk caf^id'ly to them, told them that I 
was a ve. y coniiderable Ownqr of the Ship,^ and' that in 
Juflice he could not put me out of my own Houfei that 
this was next Door to ferving me, as the famous Pirate 
Kid had done, who made the Mutiny in a Ship, fet the 
C^aptain on Shore in an uninhabited ifland, and ruu away 
with the Sh'p 5 that let them go into wliat Ship they 
vould, if ever they came to Engimd again, it would co& 
them dcar^ that the Ship was mine,, and tliat he would not 
put me out of it i' and that he woujd rather loft the Ship 
and the Voyage tod, than difbblige me lb mudJ '5 fe tliey 
might do as they pleaied: However, he would go on Shore, 
and talk with me on Shore, and invited the Boatfwain tp 

fo with himi and perhaps they might accommodate thj? 
lattter with me. 
B i; T they all rejeiSied the Propo&h and laid, they would 
have nothing to do with me any more, neither on board, 
nor on Shores and if I came on board, they would go on 
Shore 5 Well, /arid the .Captain, if yoii arc all on this Mind, 
let me g© on Shwc and mOn with him i Co away he came 
to ntewith this Account, a little after the Meflage had been 
brought to me from the Cockfwain.

( 177) 

I w A s very glad to iee my Nephew, I mufl: conFeis ; 
for I was not without Apprehenlions, that they would 
confine him by Violence, &t fell, and run away with the 
Ship, and thai I had been ftrip'd naked in a remote Conn- 
try, and nothing to help my ielf : In fhort, I had been in 
in a worie Cale, than when I was all alone in the Bland. 

But they had not come that length, it feems, to my 
great Satisfa£l:ion ; and when my Nephew told me what 
they had iaid to him, and how they had fwom, and fhook 
Hands, that they would one and all leave the Ship, if I was 
fiife'd to come on board, I told him, he ihould not be 
concerned at it at all, for \ wouk! ftay on Shore •> I only 
ddir'd he would take Care and lend me all my neceffary 
Things on Shore, and leave me a iufficicnt Sum of Mo- 
ney, and I would find my Way to IBngland, as well as I 
eould. 

. This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephewj k t 
there was no Way to help it, but to comply wirh it; So, 
in fhort, he went on baird the Ship again, andfatisfyd 
the Men, that his Uncle had vielded to their Importunity, 
and had lent for his Goods n^m onboard the Ship; £0 
the Matter was over in a very few Hours, the M^*n re- 
turned to their Duty, and I began to conilder what Courle 
I' fhould flea*. 

r w A s iK)W alone in the remoteft Part of the World, 
4Lf / think I may call h ; for I was near three thouiand 
Leagues by Sea farther off from Englandy than I was at my 
Ifland i only it is true, I might travel hei e by Land over 
the Great Mogul's Country to Suratte, might go from 
thence to lB,%jfbra by Sea, up the Gulphof ?erjia, and fmm 
thence might take the Way of the Caravans, over the Delarts 
oiArah'fa to Aleppo and Scandarocn ,• from thence by Sea agait>

might be at leaft a full IXiamerer of the Globe; but if it 
were to be meafur'd, I flippofe it wouki appeal* to be a 
great deal more. 

I H A D another Way before me, which was to Wait for 
fbme JS»f/(/^ Ships, which were coming to Bengalc fiom 
Aeh'm on the Ifland of Sumatra^ and get Pallage on board 
therti £or England: But asPearne hither withmit any Con-

I think, a Man in my Circumftanccs icarce ever met witl^ 
txcept fiom Pirates running away with a Ship, andfetting 
thoie that would not agree with thdir Villany on Shore, 
indeed this was next Door ta it^ both Ways j however* 
my Nephew left me two Servants, or rather, one Compa- 
nion, and one Servant, the firft was Clerk to the Purler,, 
who he engag'd to go with me, and the other was his 
own Servant i I took me alio a good'Lodging in theHoufc 
of an Englijh Woman, wherefeveral Merchants lodg'd ; fomc 
lErench, two Italians, or rather fews, and one JEngliJhman : 
Here I was handibmely enough entertained 5 and that I 
might not be laid to run raihly upon any Thing, I flay*d 
here above nine Months, confidermg wl^it Courfe to ttdce, 
and how to manage my felf : I had fomc Englijh Goods 
Vvith me of Value, and a confider^lc Sum of Money,

Sir, iays he, you are a Stranger to me, and I to you j but 
I have ibmetning to tell you, that very nearly concerns

I LOOKED fteadily at him a good while, and he thought 
at firll I had known him, but I did not 3 if it very nearly 
concerns me, faid I, and not ^our M't, what moves you to

you are in, and for ought I fee, you have no Knowle(%e 
of it j I know no Danger I am in, iaid I, but that my Ship 
is leaky, and I cannot; find it out,* but Lpropofe tolay her

that is. upon iuch: Adventures as you are upon, to come 
into a Port, and not examine firfl what ohips there are

jour Fate iliouU blind you againfl goocJ Advice ; but aflore 
your felf, if you do not put to Sea immediately, you will 
the very next Tide be attaqu'd by five Long-Boats full of 
Men, and perhaps, if you are taken, yOu*ll be hang'd fon a 
Pirate, and thePiarticularsbeexamin'dafter%vards: I thought 
Sir, added he, I ihould have met with a better Reception 
than this, for doing you a piece of Service of fuch Impor-

or to any Man that oiBfers me any Kindnefs, but it is f^ 
my Comprehenlion, //»/// J, what they lliou Id hdve fuch a

we can fwim without flopping it i But, Sir, (aid I, (hall I

I c A N tell you but Pairt of theStoryv Sir, &ys he, but I 
have a Dutch Seamen here witK me, and T believe I couE 
perfuade him to tell you the^reft^ but there is fcarce Time

was wiiththi$syp at i'^/^^/rj^f that there your C^ain was 
murther'd by the Mallfi^ans, with three or his Men 5 and 
that you, or fbme of thofe that were on board with you, 
ran away with the Ship, and are fince turhM PlRATESi 
this is the Sum of the Story, and you will be all feiz-'d as 
Pirates, I can afTure you ; and executed with' very little Ce-

Now you fpeak plain Znglijh\ fiid t and I* think you 5

the bcft Defence is to be out of the Danger 5 if you have any 
Regard to your Life, auid the Life of all your Men, put 
out to Sea witjiout f^l-at High- Water, and as you have a 
whole Tide b^efcwe you, you will be gone too far out before. 
they can come down, for they wiffcomc away at High* 
Water , and as th^y have twGity Miles to come, jwhj get 

near; 



( I^^ ) 

near two Hours of them, by the Difference of the Tide* 
not reckoning the Length of the Way ^ befides, as they are 
only Boats, and not Ships, they will not venture to follow 
you far out to Sea^ efpecialiy if it blows. 

Well, fays /, you have been very kind in this, what 
fball I do for you, to make you Amends ? Sir, [ajs he, 
you may not be fb willing to make me any amends, be- 
caufe you may not be convinced of the Truth of it : Fll 
make an Offer to you ^ I have nineteen Months Pay due 
to me, on board the Ship———, which I came out of 
JEngl/md in 5 and the Dutchman, that is with me, has feven 
Months Pay due to him i if you will make good our Pay 
to us, we wiU go abng'witn you ; if you find nothing 
more in it, wc will dclirc no more^ but if we do con- 
vince you, that we have fiv'd vour lives, and the ShiJ),

to you. 

IcoNsfiNTEDto tMs readilv, and went" immedisitely

to the Ship-fide, my Partner, who was oh board, came out

Joy, Oho ! oho! wt have fli^p*d the kak ! wtljanje ftoffd

the Captain, and he immediately ordered the Anchor to be 
got upj and tho* the Tide was not quite done, yet a little 
Land-Breeze blowing, wc ftood out to Sea i then I called 
him into the Cabin, and tbld him the Story at large, and 
wc call'd in. the Men, and they told ns the reft ofitj but

Xf By who, and bv what? By five Sloops 6r Boats, fays 
the Felbw, full of Men 5 Very well, faidi, then it is ap- 
parent there is fomething'in 'it: In the next Pfece I or- 
der'-d all our Men to be call'd up, and told^hcm,, that there 
was a Dciign to feijte the Ship^ and'to take iis '(bYPh-ates, 
miiQsk*d taem, if they would fland by u^; and hy one 
fttotfaer ?, Tie Men anwer'd chcarfully, that one arid^dl, 

they 



rliey would live and die with us: Tkml ask'd the Caftafti^ 
what Way he thought bell: for us to manage a Fight with 
them? For reiift them I refolv'd we would, and that to 
the laft Drop; he laid readily. That the Way was to keep 
them off with our great Snot, as long as we could, and 
then to fire at them with our fmall Arms to keep them 
from boarding us 5 but when neither of theie would do 
any longer, we fliould retire to our clofe Quarters ; per- 
haps they had not Materials to break open our Bulk-Heads, 
or get in upon us. 

T H E Gunaer had in the mean Time Order, to bring 
two Guns to bear ibreand aft, out of the Steerage, to clear 
the Deck, and to k>ad than with Mu%iit-9uBets ami finall 
Pieces of old Iron, mxd what next came to Mnd, and thus 
we made ready few Fight j but all this while kept out to 
Sea, with Wind enough, and could fee the Boats at a Di- 
ftance being five large Lmg-BmtSy following us, with al 
the Sail they could make. 

Two or thde Boats, which by our Gkdes we could 
fee, were EngUfh, had out-j&iled the refl, were near two 
Leagues a-head of them, and g^'d upon us confidcrablifrf 
fo that we found they would come up with us j upon 
which we fired a Gun without a Shot> to intimate, that 
they fhould bring too, and we put out aFhg of Truce, as 
a Signal for Parley 5 but they kept crowding after us, till 
they came within Shot : Upon this we t©ok kx our white 
Flag, they having made no Anfwer to it, hung out a red 
Flag, and fired at. them with a Shot j notwithftariding this, 
they came on, till they were near enough to call to them 
with a {peaking Trumpet, which we had on board; fa 
we caird to them, and bid them keep off at their Peril, 

I T was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavout- 
cd to come under our Stern, fb to board us on our Ouar# 
tcr; upon which, iceing they were refolute forMifcliief^ 
and depended upon the Strength that followed them, I or- 
dered to brirg the Ship too, fb that they lay upon our Broad* 
fide, when immediately we fired five Guns at them j one 
of which, had been levelled fb true, as to carry* away the 
Stern of the hindermoft Boat, and bring them to the Ne- 
cefiity of takitig down theirSail, and running all to the 
Head of the Boat to keep her" from finking, fb fhe lay 
by, and had enough- of it j but feeing the feemoft Boat 

crowd 



C i88 ) 

crowd Ml oa after us, we made ready to fire at her in par- 
ticular. 

While this was doing, one of the three Boats that 
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made ap 
to the Boat whicA we had diiabled, to relieve her, and wc 
could afterwards iee her take out the Menj we call'd again 
to the ferj^moil, Boat, and ofiferd a Truce to parley again, 
and to know what was her Buiineis with us, but had no 
Aniwer, oi)|y ilie crowded dole under our Stern , upon 
this, our Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, rnn 
out his two Chafe-Guns, and fired again at her i but the 
Shot miffing, the Men in the Boat Ihouted, wav'd their 
Caps, and came on j but the Gunner, getting quickly rea- 
dy again, fir'd among them tlie fecood Time j one Shot 
of which, tho' it miS'd the Bo^ it £d£y yet fellin among 
the Men, and we could eaiiiy fee, had done a great deal of 
Mifchief among them ,, but we taking no notice of that, 
war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to bear up- 
on thgmj and firing tltfee Guns more, we found the Boat 
was fplit almoft to Pieces j in particular, her Rudder, and 
a Piece of her Stern w;as fhot quite away, Co they handed 
their Sail immediately, and were in gieat Diibrder 5 but to 
compleat their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns 
at them aggin 5 where he hit them we could not tell, but 
we tbuad the Boat was finking, and fomc of the Men al- 
ready in the Water 5 upon this, I immediately man'd out 
pur Pinnace, which we had kept clofe by our Side, with 
Orders to pick up fbme of the Men if they could, and 
{ave them from drowning, and immediately to come on 
board with them i becauie we ftxw the reft of the Boats 
began to come up 5 our Men in the Pinnace follow d their 
Orders, and took up three Men i one of which was juft 
. drowning, and it was a good while before we could reco- 
ver him 4 as ibon as they were on board, we crowded all 
the Sail w^ could make, and ftpod farther out to Sea, and 
we jfbufad that when the other three Boats came up to the 
firil two, they gave over their Chace. 

Being thus deiivcr'd from a Danger, which though I 
knew- not the Reaibn of it, yet fcem'd to be much greater 
than I a|»prehcndcd i I took Care tliat we would change 
Qiur Coijrie, and not let aiiy one imagine whither we were 
going i fo wc flood Qui to Sea EaUward, quite out of the 

Courfc 



( i%9 ) 

Courle of all European Ships, whether tliey were bound to 
Chma, or any where eiie, within the Comm«erce of the 
Bf^ropean Nations. 

When we were now at Sea, we began to confliltwith 
the two Seamen, and enquire firft, WlSt the Meaning of 
all this ftiould be : The Dutchman let us into the Secret 
of it at once j telling us, that the Fellow that fold us the 
Sliip, as we faid, was no more than a Thief, that had run 
away with her: Then he told us, how the Captain, whofe 
Name too he told us, tho' I do not remember it now, 
was treacherously murther'd by the Natives on the Coaft 
ofMallaca, withthreeof hisMcni and that he, this Dutch- 
man, and four more got into the Woods, where they wan- 
dered about a great while j till 4it length, he in particular, 
in a miraculous Manner, made his Eicape, and Iwam off 
to a Dutch Ship, which feiiing near the Shore, in its Way 
from China, had ient their Boat on Shore for frefh Watery 
that he durft not come to that Part of the Shore where 
the Boat was, but made fhift in the Night, to take into 
the Water ferther off, and fwimming a great while, atlaft 
the Ship's Boat took him up. 

H E then told us, that he went to Battavia, where two 
off the Seamen belonging to the Ship had arrived, having de- 
fetted the reft in their Travels, and gave an Account, that 
the Fellow, who had run away with the Ship, fold her at 
Bengale, to a Set of Pirates, which were gone a Cruillng 
in her j and that they had already taken an Engli/h Ship and 
tw:o Df^ch Ships very richly laden, 

-This latter Part, we found to concern us directly, and 
tho' we knew it to be fallen yet, as my Partner faid very 
well, if we had jFallcn into their Hands, and tjhcy had had 
fuch a Prepofleffion againft us before-liand, it had been in 
vain for us to have defended ourielv^s, or to hope for any 
goodQuarrers at their Hands -, efpeci^lly confida jng tlmt our 
AtaiHsrs had been our Judges, and tha^we could J^jiflB cx- 
peifted* dothing from them, but what Rage would bave 
di&ated, and ungoverncd Paffion have executed ^ and there- 
fore itf'Was his Opinion, we fhould go diie^y back to 
Bengak, from whence we came, without putting xa at a- 
ny Port whatever j becaufe there, we ctmi, givQ an Ac- 
count of our felvcs, and could prove vjrberc we were when 

tlic 



( ipo ) 

the Ship put in, who we bought her of, and the like ; 
and, which was more than all the reft, if we were put to 
the Neceflity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we 
fliould be fure to have fbme Juftice, and not be hang'dfirft, 
and judg'd afterward. 

I w A s fbmetime of my Parimer's Opinion ^ but after a 
little more ferious thinking, I told him, I thought it was 
a very great Hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben- 
gale, for that we were on the wrong Side of the Straits 
of Malacca y and that if the Alarm was given/ we fhould 
be fure to be Way-laid on every fide, as well by the Dutch 
of Battavia, as the Bnglijh dfe-where ; that if we Ihould 
be taken, as it were, running away, we fhould even con- 
demn our, felves, and there would want no more Evidence 
to deftroy us^ I alfo asked the 'EngUjh Sailor's Opinion, 
who iaid, he was of my Mind, and that we fliould cer- 
tainly be taken. 

This Danger, a little ftartled my Partner and all the 
Ship's Company ; and we immediately relblved to go a- 
way to the Coaft of Tom^t, and fo on to China, and 
from thence purfiiing the iirft Defign, as to Trade, find 
fomc Way or other to diibole of the Ship, and come back 
in fbme of the Veflels ot the Country, fiich as we could 
get: This was approved of as the beft Method for our Se- 
curity 5 and accorditigly we fleered away N.N.E. keeping 
■aboye fifty Leagues off from the efual Courfe to the Eafl- 
ward. 

This however put us to fbme Inconveniences ; for firfl 
the Winds, when we came to that Diflance from the 
Shore, fean'd to be more ftcadily ' againfl us, blowing al- 
mofl: Trade, as vfie call it; from the Eafl, and E. N.E. fb 
that we were a k)ng while upon our Voyage, and we were 
but ill provided with Vidhials for jR> long a Run ,• and, 
which was ftill worfc, tliCTe was fbme Danger, that thofe 
Er^lifi^tki t>mch Ships,' whofe Boats purfued us, wherifof 
fome were bound that Way, might be got iii before us; 
and if not, {omt othnst Ship, bound to China, might have 
Inforraatk>n*of m from them, and purfue ik with the 
iame Vigour. ^ 

I MUST confe^, I was now very uneafy, and thought 
my felf, iocltKiing* the late Efcape trom the Long-Boats, 
toiarve been in tie mofl dangerous Condition that ever I 

was 



( 191 ) 

was in, thro' all my pad Lifci for whatever ill Circum- 
ftances I had been in, I was never purjRjed for a Thief be- 
fore 5 nor had I ever done any Thing that himted the Name 
of t^flioneft or Fraudulent, nauch kis Thievifh : I had 
chiefly been mine own Enemy, or, as I may rightly iky, 
I had been no body's Enemy but my own : But now I 
was embarrafs'd in the worft Condition imaginable j for 
tho' I was perfectly innocent, I was in no Condition to 
make that XQpocenfe appear : And if I had been taken 
it had been un4er a fuppofed Guilt of the worlt Kind 5 
at leaf}, a Crime cHeem'dib among the People I had to do 
with. 

This niacje me veriy anxious ^ to make an Efcape, tho', 
which Way to do it, I Jcnew notf or what Port or Place 
we (liould go -to : My Partner feeing me thus dejcded, 
tho* he was the moft concerned at firft, began to encourage 
nie i and defcribing to me the ieveral Ports of that Coafl, 
told me he would put in, on the Codk o£ Choch'mthhja^ or 
the Bay of Tonqmn 5 intending to go afterwards to MUcaoy 
a Town once in the Pofleflion of mtlPortuguezt^ and where 
ftill a great many JEnrofean^ Faniilies relided* and particu- 
larly the MiiTionary Prieftsr ufually went thither, in order 
to their going forward to China, 

Hither then we refolved to go j and accordingly, tho* 
after a tedious and irregular Courfc, and very much flraitr 
ned for Provillons, we came withm Sight of the Coaft ve- 
ry early m the Morning j and upon Rcfle6Hon, upon the 
paftCircumftances we were in, and the Danger if we had 
not efcapcd, we refolv'd to put into a fmaii River, which, 
howevo', had aJDq>th enough of Water for -^us, and to fee 
^ if we could, either over Landr-^Or by the Shfp's Pinftace, 
come to know what Ships were in any Port thereabouts. 
This happy Step ! was indeed; oiar Deliverance i for tho' 
we did not immediately fee any European Ships in the^y 
of Tonepi^mj yet the next Momajgi there came into die^y 
two D/^ff ^ SWps, and a third without any Colours fbread 
out, btit which we believ'd to be'aD«rd5>^/r», pafs'd by at 
about two Leagues Difbnce, ftecring for the Coailf of Chs- 
na- 1 and in the. Afternoon went by two Englijh SMps, 
fleering the fame Courfe 5 and thus, we thought, we faw 
our fcives bcfct with Enemies, botlx one Way and the o- 
thqr. The P]acc.wc.wef!e-in was wild aodbarbarous, the 

People 



( ipa ) 

People Thieves, even by Occupation or ProfefTion ; 'and 
tho' it is true, we had not much to leek of them, and ex- 
cept getting a few Provilions, car'd not how littjewe had 
to do with them, yet it was^ with much Difficulty, that 
w^e kept our felves fix)m being infiilted by them feveral 
Ways. 

W R were in a fmall River of this Country, within a 
few Leagues of its utmoft Limits Northward j and by our 
Boat we coafted North-Eaft to the Point of Land* which 
opens the great Bay of Tmqum; and it wis in this Beating 
up along the Shore, that we diicover'd as above* that, in a 
Word, we were furroundcd with Enemies. The People we 
w^ere among, were the moft barbarous of all th^ Inhabi*- 
tants of the Coafti having no CoiTeilpondence with any o- 
ther Nation, and dealing only in Hfli,* and Oil, and fuch 
grofs Commodities i and it tnay be particularly ieen, that 
they arc, as I /aid, the moft barbarous of any of the Inha- 
bitants, (viz.) that among other Cuftoms they have this as 
one. That if any VeflH have the Misfortune to be Ship- 
wrecked upon their Goaft they pr^lently make the Men 
all PrifiM^rs, f^t is fofmiSkvesi and it was not long be- 
fore we foupd a Spice of their Kindnefs this Way^ on the 
Occaiion following. 

I HAVE obierved above, that our Ship fprung a I-.eak at 
Sea, and that we could not find it out ; and however, it hap- 
pen d, that as I laave laid, it wasftop'd unexpectedly, in the 
happy Minute of our being to be feiz.*d, by the Dntch and 
BngujTy Ships, near the Bay of S Jam-, yet as we did not find 
the Ship {o pcrte<Slly tight and ibund as we deiir'd, we re- 
foW'd, while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore, 
take out what heavy Things we had on board, which 
were not many , and to waih , and clean her Bot- 
tom 5 and, if pofliblc, to find out where the Leaks 
were. 

AecoRDiKGLY, having Hghtncd the Ship, and brought 
all our Guns, and other moveable Things to one Side, we 
try'd to bring her down, that we might come at he? Bot- 
tooi j for on fecond Thoughts, wc did bot care to lay her 
dry, a-ground, neither could wc find out a proper Place 
for it. 

The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with 
fucha Sights came wpiiidering down to tlieSiiore, to look at 

us; 



( xp3 ) 

us ; and ieemg the Ship lie down on one Side in fuch a 
Manner, and heeling towards the Shore, and not feeing 
our Men, who were at work on her Bottom with Stages, 
and with their. Boats on the off 'Side, they prefently con- 
cluded, that the Ship was caft away, and lay fo veiy taft 
on the Ground. 

O N this Suppofition, they came all about us in two or 
three Hours Time, with ten or twelve large Boats, having 
fome of them eight, Ibme ten Men in a Boat, intending, 
no doubt, t6 have come on board, and plundered the Ship, 
and if they had found us there, to have carry'd us 
away for Slaves to their King 5 or whatever they call 
him, for wg knew nothing, who was their Gover- 
nour. 

When they came up to the Ship, and began to rovy 
round her, they diicover'd us all hard at work, on th« 
Out-lide of the Ship's Bottom and Side, wafliing, and 

f laving, and flopping, as every Sea-faring Man knows 
ow. 

They flood for a while gazing at us, and we, who 
were a little furpriz-'d, could npt imagine what their De- 
fign was j but being wiling to be Jure, we took this Op- 
portunity, to get fome of us into the Ship, and others to 
hand down Arms and Ammunition to thofe that were at 
work, to defend themfelves with, \£ there fliould be Occa- 
lion i and it was no more than need j for, in lefs tlian 
a Quarter of an Hour's Confliltation, they agieed, it fcems, 
that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all at 
work^ endeavouring to fave her, or to :^ve our Lives by 
the Help of our Boats, and when we hantkd our Arms in- 
to the Boats, they concluded, by that Motion, that we 
were endeavouring to fave fome of our Goods j upon this 
they took it for granted, we all belong'd to them ; and a- 
way they came aire6lly upon our Men, as if it had been iii 
a Line ot Battle. 

Our Men, feeing fb many of them, began to be fright- 
ed i for we lay but m an ill Poflure to fight, and cry'd out 
to us, to know what they fhould do? I mimediately called 
to the Men, who work'd upon the Stages, to flip them 
down, and get up the Side into the Ship 5 and bad thofe 
in the Boat to row round and come on board j and thofe 
few of us, who weje on board, work d with all the Strength 



( IP4 ) 

and Hands we had, to bring the Ship to rights; buthow- 
ev^er, neither the Men upon the Stage, nor thofe in the 
Boats, could do as they w^re ordered, before the Cochmchi- 
nejfes were upon them ; and with two of their Boats boarded 
our Long-Boat, and began to lay hold of the Men as their 
Prifoners. 

The firft Man they laid hold of, was an 'Englifli Sea- 
inan, a flout ftrong Fellow, who having a Musket in his 
Hand, never ofFcr'd to fire it, but laid it down in the 
Boar, like a> Tool, as I drought: But he underftood his Bu- 
ilnefs better than I could teach him, for he grappled the 
Tngan^ and dragg'd him by main Force, out of their own 
Boat into ours j where, taking him by the two Ears, he 
beat his Head fo againft the Boats Gunnel, that the Fellow 
dy'dinftantly in his Hands j and in the mean Time, a T>Htch' 
man, who flood next, took up the Musket, and with the 
But-end of it, ib laid about him, that he knock'd down 
five of them, who attempted to enter the Boat 5 but this 
was doing little towards refi-fting thirty or forty Men, 
who fearlefs, becaufe ignorant of their Danger, began to 
throw thcmfelves into the Long-Boat, where we had but 
five Men to defend it ; But one Accident gave our Men a 
compleatVidtory, which deierv'd our Laughter rather than 
any thing elfe, and that was this: 

Our Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Out-fide 
of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where he had 
caulk'd her to flop the L^ks, had got two Kettles jufl let 
down into the Boat j one fill'd with boiling Pitch, and the 
other with Rofm, Tallow,^ and Oil, and fiich Stuff, as the 
Ship-Wiights ufe for that Workj an^d the Man that tend- 
ed the Carper ter, had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with 
•which he fupply'd the Men that were at work with that 
hot Stuff; two of the Enemy^s Men entred the Boat jufl 
where this Fellow ftood, being in the Fore-iheets 5 he im- 
mediately fainted them with a Ladleful of the Stuff, boil- 
ing hot, which fb burnt and fcalded them, being half na- 
kcS, that they Toar'd out Hke two Bulls, and, emag'd with 
the Fire, leap'd both into the Sea: The Catpenter faw it, 
and cry'd oUt, Well done, fack, give them fome more of 
it J when flopping forward him^f, he takes one of their 
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot, he and his Man 
threw it am<!mg them fo plentifully, that, in fhort, of all 
W..5 the 



the Men in three Boats, there was not one that^ was not 
fcalded, and biirnt with it in a mofi: frightful pitifd Man- 
ner, and made fuch a Howling and crying, that I nc\'cr 
heard a wor£^ Noife, and indeed nothing ItSe it 5 for it is 
worth obferving, That tho Pain naturally makes all Peo- 
ple cry out, yet every Nation have a particular \\''ay of 
Exclamation, and make Notfes as different from one ano- 
ther, as their Speech ^ I cannot give the Noife, thefe Crea- 
tures made, a better Name than Howling, nor a Name more 
proper to the Tone of it ; for T never heard any Thing 
move like the Noife of the^ Wolves, which, as I have 
faid, I heard howl in the Foreft on the Frontiers of Lan- 
guedoc, 

I w A s never plca^M with a Vi6fcory better in my Life ; 
not only as it was a perfect Surprize to me, and tliat our 
Danger was imminent before: But as we got this Vidlory 
without any Blood-fhed, except of that Man the Fellow 
killd with his naked Hands, and which I was very much 
concern ci at ,• for I was fick of killing fuch poor Savage 
Wretches, even tho' it was in my own Defence, knowing 
they came on Errands, wKieh they thought juft, and knew 
no better i and tliat tho' it may be a jufl Thing, becduifi 
necellary, for there is ho necelfery Wickedriefs in Nature; ^ 
yet I thought it was a fad Life wh^n we muft be always 
obliged to be killing our Fellow-Creatures to preierv^e our 
felves, and indeed, I think fb flill j and 1 would even now fiif- 
fer a great deal, rather than I would take away the Life, 
even of the worft Perfon injuring me : I beiievd alfb, all 
confidering People, who know the Value of Life, would 
be of my Opinion, if they entred ierioufly into the Conli- 
deration of it. 

But to return to iny Storyj all the while this was do- 
ing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the reft: of the Mea 
on board, had with great Dexterity brought the Ship al- 
moft to rights ; and liaving gotten the Guns into their 
Places agaiii, the Gunner caD'd to me, to bid our Boat get 
cHit of the Way, for he would jet fly amobg them : I call* J 
'back again -t6 hini, and bid him iiot offer to fire, for the 
Carp0ter woald' do the Work withtmt Inm i Jbut bad him 
he^t another Fitch*Kettle,' which our-Gobk, who was oh 
board, took £/^t of; But the Enemy wis fi terrified with 



what they met with in their firft Attaque, that they would 
not come on figain s and Come of them that were far theft 
off, feeing tKe Ship fwim, as it were upright, begun, as 
we fuppoied, to fee their Miflake, and give over the En- 
tci prize, finding it was not as they expelled : Thus we 
got clear of this merry Figiit j and having gotten fome 
Rice, and fome Roots, and Bread, with about lixteen good 
big Hogs on board, two Days before > we refblv'd to Hay 
here no longer, but go forward whatever came of it ^ for 
we made no Doubt tut we fliould be fiirrounded the next 
Day with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch- 
Kittle would difpoie of^for us. ^ 

W E therefore got all our Things on board the fame E- 
TCping, and the next Morning was* ready to iail j in the 
mean Tim.e, lying at an Anchor fome Diilance from the 
Shore, we were not fb much concerned, being now in a 
fighting Pollure, as well as in a failing Pofture, if any E- 
ntmy had prefented : The next Day having finifli'd our 
Work within board, and finding our Ship was perfe6t:ly 
heal'd of all. her ]t.clks, we fet failj we would have gone 
into the Bay ofTonqum j for we wanted to inform our ielves 
pf wliat was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that 
had been, there j but we durft not -fland in therej becaufe , 
we liad feen feveral Ship^ go in* as we fuppog'd, but a lit- 
tle before} ,£o we kept on N.E. towards the I He of For- 
7??ofa, as much afraid -of being feen by a Duuh ox lEngliJIt 
Merchant Ship, as a Butch or Englijh Merchant Ship in the 
, Mediteranean is pf an Algerme Mzxi of War. 

wIh E N we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E. 
as if W£ would go to the Manillas or the Fhilippme Iflandsj 
and this we did that we might "not fall into the Way of 
jaixiY .oi the European Ships j and then we fleered North a- 
^gam, tin we came to the Latitude of 22 Degrees, 20 Mi- 
nutes j by -which Means we made the Ifland of Fornwfa 
diredtly, where we came to. an Anchor, in order to get 
. Water, ,and fielli Provifions, which the People there, vvho 
are very courteous, and civil in their Manners, fiipply'd us 
.with wiliiiigly,, and- dealt very fairly and pundhially with 
,us ii> aM their Agreements and Bargains j which is what wc 
did not find among ot^ier People j and may be owing to 
the Remains of Chriflianity, which was once planted nerjc 
by a Dut/h HUffioaaxybf Frotejimts, and is a Teflimony 

of 



( iP7 ) 

of what I hn.ve ofi-cn obfcrv'd, tIz':, That the Chrifliarr Re-^ 
I'lgion always civiliz.cs the People, and reforms their Mah- - 
Tiers, A^dlele it is receiv'd, whether it works faving Ef!e£ls 
upon txhem or no. 

Fro m hence we fail'd fl^ll North, keeping the Coaft of 
Chi?ja at an equalDiftance, till we knew we were beyond 
ail the Ports of Chnm, w^here our European Ships iillialiy 
come j being refblv'd, if poiTible, not to tall into any of 
their Hands, efpecially in this Counrry, where, as our Cir- 
cumftances were, we could not hW of being entirely' ruin- 
ed i na.y, lb great was my Fear in particular, as to my be- 
ing taken by them, that I believe firmly, I would nluch 
rather have chofen to fall into the Haiids of tlie SfmiJJj 
Inquifition. 

Being now come to the Latitude of 36 Deg- ccs^ w« 
rclbiv'd to put into the firft Trading. Port we ftibald come 
at J and (landing in for the Shore, a Boat came off two 
Leagues to us, with an o\(}iFortiigmze Pilot on board, who- 
knowing us to be an Europemi Ship, came to offer his Scr-' 
viccj which indeed we were v6ry glad of, 'and took him 
oir board ; up^i which, without asking us, whither we 
would go, he difmifs'd the Boat he c?ime in, pj:id fent it 
back. * ." 

I THOUGHT it was uow fb much in our Choice, to 
make the old Man carry us whither wc would, that I be- 
gan to talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph 
of Nanquihy which is the moft Northern Part of the Coa5: 
of Chma : The old Man faid he knew the Gulph of Nan- 
quin very well -, but, Imiling ask'd uS, what we would do 
there? 

I TOLD him, we would fell oUr Cargo, and purchaic 
Chma-WgLves, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea. Wrought- Silks, 
C3™f . and Co would return by tiie fame Courfe we came ; 
He told us our btft Port Iiad been to have put in at Ma- 
cao, where v/e could not fail of a Market for our Opium, 
to our Satisfa(Stion, and might for our Money have pur- 
chas'd all Sorts of Chma-Goodst as cheap as we could at 
Nanquin, 

Not being able to put the old Man out of his Talk, of 

which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I told him., 

we were Gentlemen, as well as Merchants, and that we* 

had a Mind to go and fee the great City of Fekm^ and thi 

I 3 famous 



famous Court of xk& Monarch of China. "Why then, fays 
the old. Man, you iliould go to Nm£ps, where, by the Ri- 
ver which runs into the Sea there, you may go up within 
five Leagues of the Great Canal : This Canal is a caviga^ 
ble ma^e. Stream, which goes thorough the Heart of that 
vafl Empire of C^*i»^, crofles alkhe Rivers^ pailes fbme cons- 
iderable Hills, by the Help of Sluices and Gates, and goes 
up to the City of Peking, being in Length near 270 
Leapics. 

WELL, faid I, Seignior V^rtuguefe, kit that is not our 
Buf:nefs now : Tlie great Queftion is. If you can carry Us 
i^p to the City o£ Natiqmn, from whence we can travel to 
Recking afterwards? Yesj he^fti<l,:he could do (b vety v^cft 
and there was a great Dutch Ship gone up that .Way juft 
before :. This ,gav^ me a little Shock j: a JDpttfhs^^. A^as 
ijow our Terror, and wc had much rather have itaet tiia 
Pevil J ;it leafl, if he had not come in too frightfiil a Fi-» 
gurej we depended upon it, that a I)t4tet9 Ship wrould b^ 
QurDeftrudlion,^ for we were in no Condition to fight themj 
all the Ships they trade with in thofe Pairts feeing of 
great Bopthen, and' of mneh g^r^tey Force thaa we 
were. ' ■:,.,■ ••/. ^^ . 

The old Man found me a little confiis'd, and und^ 
Ibme Concern, wheit he na'm'd a D«#<r^ Ship, and faid to 
me. Sir, you need be under no Apprehenfion o^tht Duiek^ 
1 luppo^e they are not now at War with your Nation : 
No,, fays I, that's true i but I know not what Lab^erties: 
Men may take, when they are out of the Reach of the 
Laws of their own^Q)untryj Why, fey s he, you are na^ 
firaies, what need your fear? They will not meddle with 
peaceable Merchants fure. 

I F i had any Blood in my Body that did riot fly np into 
my Face at that Word; it was hinder'd by ibme Stop* in 
the VejQels, appointed b} Nature to circulate itj for it put 
me into the gr^teft Diforder and Confufion imaginable y 
IJTor was it poflTible for riie to conceal it £0, but that the 
old Man eafily perceiyM it. 

Sir, fays he, I find you are in ibme Dilbrder . in yoiir - 
• Thoughts at mj talk, pray be pleas d to go which Way 
you t^nk fit,; and depend upon it, Til do you ail the Ser- ' 
vice I can : Why, Seignior, faid L it is tru^, I am a little 

unfetttedt 



Cx5P ) 

miiett W in my Refolution at this Time, whitljcr to go ki 
.j>articii!ar , and I am foxuething more fb, for what you 
Mid about Pirates, I hope there are no Filiates in thcfe Seas ^ 
we are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for you 
iee we have but a imail Force, and but very weakly 
^mannd. 

O, Sir, fays he, do not be c<Micern*d» I do not know 
that there has been any Pirates in thefc Seas rhelc fifteen 
Years, except one which was feen, as I h^r, in the Bay of 
S/am, about a Month fince; but you mny be aHlired ftie is 
'gone to the Southward j nor was fhe a Ship of any great 
: Force,- or fit for the Work ,• ihe was not built for a Prr- 
.vatecr, but wa$-run away witi by a Reprobate Crew that 
: wereion, Board, after the Captain and fome of his Men had 
.been murther'd by tise -M^k^ns, at or near the liland of 
Sumatra, 

VfuATlSAXU J, fi&?mgto kmrtf nothing of the Mat- 
tery Did they iriurther the Captain ? No, faid Ae, I do not 
simderftand that they murrher d hitn ^ bur as they afterwat^ds 
itxm away with uts Ship, it is generally b^Hev'd they be- 
tray 'd him into the Haads of tht M^Myms, who did mur- 
ther him, and peihaps they procurd them to do it : Why 
then, faid I, they deferve Death as much as if they had 
done it thcmfelves: Nay, fop, ^ dd.Mnn, they do dcierve 
it, and rhey wili certakiy have it, if they light upon any 
Mngl'sflj or Vntch Ship j for they have all agiiai together, 
that if they med: that Rogue, they will give Km no 
Carter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the Pinate is gone out of 
Hiefe Seas, how can they meet with him then ? Whj. t hat 
is true, fays he, they do lay lb; but he was, as I tell yoii, 
in the Bay of Siam, in the River Cambodia, and was diC 
cover*d there by fbme Dfttch Men who telcng'dto the 
Ship, and who were left on ^bore when they run away 
with lierj zsdikmt MftgHfij o^di^ Dutch Tfadeis being in the 
Rives', they were within a lilth of taking him: IS^^y^faid 
he, if the fbrcniofl: Boats lad been well fecondcd by the 
reft, they had certainly taltbi him j but he finding only tw<^ 
Boats within Reach of him, tack*d ^xm and firM at thele 
■tvyo, and difablcd them, befbre the other came up, and 
then flanding off to Sea, the other w© e not able to fdlov^ 
him, and fo he got away; But they have all fo exaar ft 
I ^ Defcriytion 



( loo ) 

Befcription of the SHp, that they will be flire to knovr 
him J and where-ever they find him, they have vow'd to 
give no Quarter to either the Captaip, or the Seamen, but 
to hang them all up at the Yard-Arm. 

What! lays I, will they execute them right or v/rong, 
hang them fir ft, and judge them afterwards? O, Sir! lays 
the old Pilot, there's no need to make a formal Bufmefs of 
it with fuch Rogues as thofe, let them tie them Back to 
Back, and let them a diving j *tis no more than they right* 
ly deierve. 

I KMEw I had my old Man fall a-board, and that he 
could do me no Harm, £o that I turn'd fhort upon him : 
Well, now Seignior, iaid I, and this is the very Realbn, 
why I would have you carry us up to Nanqum, knd not 
to put back to MacaOy or tp any other Part of the Coun- 
try, where the l£.nglijfh or Dutch Ships come; for be k 
known to yow, Seigiior, thoie Captains of the Engllfh and 
Dutch Ships, are a Parcel of rafh, proud, infolent FeJows, 
that neither know what belongs to Juftice, or how to 
behave themfclves, as the Laws of Qod and Nature direct ,• 
but being proud of their Offices, and not underftanding 
their Power, they would a(9: the Murtherers to punifh 
Robbers ; wouM take upon them to iniult Men falfly ac- 
cufcd, and determine them guilty without due Enquiry ^ 
and perhaps I may live to call fome of them to an Ac- 
count for it, where they may be taught how Juftice is to 
be executed, and that no Man ought to be treated as a Ci i- 
minal, till fome Evidence may be had of the Crime, and 
that he is the Man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very Ship they 
had attacked, and gave him a full Account of the Skirmifli we 
had with their Boats, and how fooliflily and coward-like 
they behaved : I told him all the Story of our buying the 
Ship, and how the jyukhmm ferved us : I told him the 
Reafons I had to believe that this Story of killing the Ma- 
jfter by the Malayms was true 5 as alio the running away 
with the Ships but that it was ail a Fiction of their own, 
to fuggeft tiiat the Men were turn'd Pirates -^ and they 
ought to have been (lire it was fo, before they had. ven- 
tured to attaque us by Surprize, and oblige ivs to refift 'em ^ 
adding that they wottld have the Blood of thofe Men, who 
we kiEd there in our juft Defence, to ^fwer for.

( 20I ) 

The old Man was amaz*d at this Relation, and told 
us, wc were very much in the right to go away to the 
North, and that if he might advife us, it fhould be to fell 
the Ship inCto/J, which wc might very w'cll do, and buy 
or build another in the Country 5 and, iaid he, tho' you 
will not get fo good a Ship, yet you may get one able c- 
nough to carry you and all your Goods back again to Ben- 
gale, or any Avhere eKe* 

I TOLD him, 1 would take his Advice, when I came 
to any Port whei-e I could find a Ship for my Turn, or 
get any Cuftomer to buy this : He reply'd, I ihould meet 
with Cuftomers enough for the Ship at Nmqu'm, and that 
a Ckinefe Junk wouM £cTve me veiy wcli'to go back a- 
gain j and that he would procure me People, both to buy 
one, and fell the other. 

\V E L L, but Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know the 
Ship lo well, I may perhaps, if I follow your Meafurcs, 
be inftvu mental to bring fome hdnefl innocent Men into a 
terrible Broil, and perhaps to be murther'd m cold Blootij 
for whcit-ever they find the Ship, they will prove the' 
Guilt upon the Men, by proving this wa^ tlicfShip, <and f<y ^ 
innocent Men may probably be overpowered and murthcr'd : 
Why, fays the old Man, Fll find out a Way to prevent that-, 
alfo j for'as T know all thofe Commanders you fpeak of very 
well, and ihall fee them all as they pafs by, I will be fiire 
to fet them to rights in the Thing, and jet them krfow^ 
that they had been fb much in tile wrbng), thiit tho' the 
People," who were on board at firft, mi^t ruii away virich 
the Ship, yet it was not true that the)' ha^J tutned Pirates j - 
and that in partiailar, thefe were not thfe MeA that firft 
went off with the Ship, but innocently bought her for 
their Trader and I am pcrfuaded they will fo far believe 
me, as at leaft to adlmore cautioufly for the time tocomei-

As WQ were unanimous in our Reiblutions, to go t<3 
this Place, we weigh'd the next Day, having only gone 
twice on Shore, where we were to get frefh Water j on 
both which Occafions, the People of the Country were 
very civil to us, and brought us abundance of Things to 
fell to Hs ; I mean', of Proviflonsy Plants, Rcors, Tea, Rice^ 
yind ibme Fowls i but nothing without Money. 
** -W^E came to the other Port, (the Wind being contiary) 
not till five Days, but it was very much to our Sarisfiidli- 
onj and I was joyful, and I may d^y thankful, when I let 
my Foot iafe on Shore j relbiving, anj my Partner too, 
that if it was poilible to difpofe ot .our £'ives and EfTcd:s, 
any other Way, tho' not every Way to our Satisfaction, 
we would never fet one Foot on board that unhappy Vci- 
£d morei and indeed I muft acknowledge, that of all the 
Cir cum fiances of Life, that ever I had any Experience 
of, rk>thing mak^s Mankind lb compleatly mife/abie as 
that, of being in conftant Fear : Well docs the Sctiptu] e 
lay, the Fear of Man hrmgs a Snxre 5 it is a Life of Death, 
and the Mind is £b entirely fupprcfs'd by it, that it is ca- 
pable of no Relief; the animal Spirits link, and all' tiie Vi- 
gour of Nature, which ufuaUy iupports Men under other ' 
Afflictions, and is prefent to them in the gjeateH: Exigen- 
cies, fails them here. 

Nor did it foil of its ufnal Operations upon the Fancy, 
h^ hd^htenittg every Danger, repreienting the Englsfh and 
Dutch Captmns, to be Men uiicapable of hearing Reafbn, 
or of dfftmguifhing between honeft Men and Rogues , or 
letweeti a Story calculated for our own Turn, made out 
of nothing, on purpolc to deceive 3 and a true genuine Ac- 
count of our whole Voyage, Prqgref?, and Defign j for we 
might many Ways have, convinced any reafbnable Crea- 
ture, that we were not Pirates 5 the Goods we had oii 
hoard, the Courie we ftecr*d, our frankly flicwing oiu" 
iclves, and cntrii^ into fuch and fuch Ports; even our vc- 
tj Manner, the Force we had, the Number of Men, the 
few Arms, little Ammunition, ihort Pioviiions ; all theie 
would have fcrv'd to convince any Men, that we were no 
Pirates j the Opium and other Goods we had on board, 
would make it appear the Ship had been at Bengale^ths

men en Board: Thefe, and maay other particular Ciicum-

we were no Pirates. 

But Fear, that blind ulelefs PaiTion, work'd another 
Way, and tbxw us into the Vapours 5 it bewildred oun

a thoi^iand tmible Things, that peihaps might never hap-

to us, that the Seamen on board the Englijh and Dmck

Boats, and efcapingj that they would not give themfeives 
Leave to enquire, whether we were Pirates or no i but 
would execute us off Hand, as we call it, without giving 
us any Roomr for a Defences we refle6i:ed, that there was

would fcarce enquire after any morej as foil, that the Shi p^ 
was certainly the fame, and that iibme of the Seamen a-

fecondly,. That when we had Intelligence at the River

Knuckles, and cut and bruiied the Flefli; io that it not on*- 
ly wak'd me out of my Sleep, but I was once afraid I 
fiiould hai^e loft two of my Fingas. 

Another Appreheniion I had, was of the cruel Ulage 
•vx/e fhould meet with from them, if v^'^e fell into their Hands ^ 
then the Story of Ami?(^na came into my Head, and how 
the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as they did our Coun- 
trymen there j and make ibme of our Men by Extremity 
of Toituie, confefs thole Crimes they never were guilty 
of 5 own themlelves, and all of us to be Piratesy and ia 
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appearance o£ 
Jufticej and that they might be tempted to do this, for 
the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, which was worth four- 
or five thouiand Pounds, put altogether* 

These Things tormehtcd me and my Partner too. 
Night and Day* nor did we conlider that the Captains of 
Ships have no Authority to 2B: thus j and if we had fur- 
rendered Priibners to them, they could not anfwer the de- 
ftroying us, cw torturing us, but would be accountable for 
k, when they came into their own Country : This I fay, 
gave me no Satisfa<ftion ,• for if they will a£i: thus with 
us, what Advantage would it be to us, that they would be 
call d to an Account for itj or if we were firft to be mur- . 
thered, what Satisfaction would it be to us, to have them 
punifl.ed when* they came Home? 

I cannot refrain taking Notice here, what Reflections I 
BOW had upon the pafl: Variety of my particular Circum-* 
ftancesi how hard I thought it was, that I who liad fpent 
forty Years in a Life of continued Difficulties, and was at 
kfl come as it w^ere to the Port or Haven, .which all Mea 
drive at, {viz^S) to have Rcfl and Plenty, fhould be a Vo» 
luntier in new Sorrows, by my own unhappy Choice i- 
and that I, who had efcapedfo many Dangers in my Youth, 
fhould now come to be hang'd in my old Age, and in fb 
remote a Place, for a Crime I was not in the leafl inclin'd 
to, much lefs guilty of 5 and in a Place and Circumftance, 
where Innocence was not like to be any Protection at all 
to me. 

. A E" T E R thefe ThonglitSj ibmething of Religion would 
comein j and I fhould be conlidering, that thi^ fecm'd to 
me to be a Difpofition of immediate Providence^ and. I 
©ught, tcrlook upon it, and fqbmittoJt as iuch j tlut air 
" ilio* 



C ZO0 ) 

tho* I was iimocent as to Metti I was far from being in- 
nocent as to my Maker 5 and I ought to look in and ex- 
amine, what other Crimes in my Life, were moft obvi- 
ous to mei and for which. Providence might juftly inflidt 
this Punifhment, as a Retribution, and that I ought toflib- 
mit to this, juft as I would to a Ship-wreck, if it had 
pleafed God to have brought fuch a Difefter upon 
me. 

I N its Turn, Natural Courage would fometimes takes its 
Place j and then I would be talking my felf up to vigorous Re- 
folurions, that I woukl not be taken, to be barbaroufly uied 
by a Parcel of mercilefs Wretches, in cold Blood j tliat it 
were much better to have foUen into the Hands of the Sa- 
vages, who were Men-Eaters, and who, I was fure, would 
feaft upon mc, when they had taken mej than by thole, 
who would perhaps glut their Rage upon me, by inhuman 
Toitures and Barbarities j that in the Cafe of the Savages, 
I always refolv d to die fighting, to the laft Gafp, and why 
fbould I not do {b now, leeing it was much more dread- 
ful to me fit i&afly t^Mnk of tailing into thefe Mens Hands, 
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men ; for the 
Savages, give them their due, would not eat a Man till he 
was dead, and kill'd them firft, as we do a BuUock 5 but 
that thefe Men had many Arts beyond the Cruelty of 
Death ; Whenever thefe Thoughts prevailed, I was fiire to 
put mj felf in a kind of Fever> with the Agitations of a 
ftfppeled Fight 3 my Blood would b«il, and my Eyes ipafkk 
as if I was engag'd j and I always refolv*d that I would 
take no Quarter at their Hands, out evert at laft, if I could 
reiift no longer, I would blow up the Ship and all that 
Was in her, and leave them but little Bootv to boaft of, 

B Y how much the greater Weight the Anxieties and 
Perplexities of thefe Things we to our Thoughts while we 
were at Sea, by fb much the greater viras our Sadsfa^ionj 
when-^we faw our felves ph Shore j and my Partner told 
me he dreamed, that he had a very heavy Load upon his 
Back, which he v^s to carry -up a Hill, and found that he 
was not able toftand long under it j but that the Fcrtn^ueze 
Yilot came and took it off Ms Back, and the Hill diiap- 
pcar'd, the. Ground before him lhev<ring all fmooth and

■ Fok fhy Part, I had a Weight taken oflF from mv Heart; 
that I was not able ah 7 longer to bear,- and, as I iaid above, 
we refblv'd to go no more to Sea in that Ship : When we 
came on Shore, the old Pilot, who was now our Friend, 

fnt us a Lodging and a Ware^Houfetbr our Goods, which 
y the Way, was much the fame^ it was a little Houfe or 
Hut, with a laige Houfe joining to it, all built with Canes 
and palliiadoed round with large Canes, to keep out pik 
fering Thieves, of which, it icems, tlierc were not a. few 
m that Countiy ; however, the Magiftrates ailow'd us alio, 
a little Guard, and we had a Soldier with a kind of Halbert, 
er Half-pike, who jflood Sentinel at our Door^ to whom 
we allowed a Pint of Rice, and a little Piece of Money 
about the Value of three Pence fer Day, lb that our Goods 
were kept very iafe. 

The Fair or Mart, ufuklly kept in this Place, had been 
over ibme Time , however, we found tliat there were threer 
or Four Juiijcs in the River, and two J-itfanners y J mean^ 
Ships from fitpan, with Goods which they had bouglit in 
t hina J .^nd wcirc not gone away, having Japonefe Mer-. 
chants ori Shore. 

Tut firfl: Thing our old Portugueze Pilot did for us, 
was to bring us acquainted with three miflionary KomiJJr 
Priefts, who Were m the Town, and who had been there 
fbme time, conveitfng the People to Clfi-iftiany ^ but we 
thought they made bift pdbr Work of it, arid made them? 
but Wttxy Ciiriftians when they had done j however, that 
was none of our Bulinei^ : One of thele vvas a Prenehmany 
\^h6 they caiPd ^Father Smm 5 he was a Jolly well condi- 
fion'd Man, very free in his Converfation, not fceming £0 
ierious and grave as the other two did y oiie of whom was 
i PcrtHgmze, and the Other a Genoefe j but Father S'mon 
was courteous, ealy in his Manner, and very agreeabk 
Company 5 the other tvvo were more relerv'd, feem^d ri- 
gid and auftere, and apply'd foioufty to the Work they 
eame about, (i4x.,} to talk with, and irifinuate themselves 
among the Inhabitahts, where-ever they had^ Opportunity j. 
we often cat and drank with thofe Men, and tho' I mufl 
confefs, the Ccwiverfion as they adl it, of the Chinefes to 
Chriftianity, is £0 far from the true Converfion, reqiiir'd, 
to bing Heathen People to the Faith of Chrift, thatitfeems

to amount to little moie, than letting them fcnow the 
Name of Chrift, fay fome Prayers, to the Virgin Mary, and 
her Son, in a Tongue which they underffand not, and 
to crofs themielves and the like j yet it muft be eonfefs'd 
that thefe Religious, who we call Miffionaries, have a firm 
Belief that thefe People fhall befav'd, and that they are the 
Inftruments of it j and on this Account, they undergo not 
only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Ha2.aias of living in 
£ucn Places, but oftentimes Death itielf, with the moll vio- 
lent Tortures, for the Sake of this Work } and it would be 
a great want of Charity in us, whatever. Opinion we Iraveof 
the Work itfcif, and the Manner of their doing it, if we fliould 
not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, who undertake it 
with fo many Hazards, and who have no Prorpe6t of the 
leafl: Temporal Advantage to thcmfelves. 

But to return to my Story ^ this Trench Priefl:, Father 
Simon, was appointed it Teems, by Order of the Chief of 
the Miflion, to go up to I'ek'mg, the Royal Seat of the 
Chinefe Emperor, and waited only for another Prieft, who 
was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with 
him i and we- fcarce ever met together, but he was invi- 
ting me to go that Journey with him, telling me, how he 
would fhew me all the glorious Things of that mighty 
Empire i and among the refl, the gi'eatefl: City in the 
World j a City, faid he^ that your Ldiidon and pur Faris 
put together cannot be equal, to.; This w^ the City, of 
Peking, which I confefs is very, great, and infinitely full 
of People j, but as I looked on thofe Things with di&renf 
Eyes fiom other Men, lb I fhall give my Opinion of them, 
in few Words, when I come in the Courle of my Tra- 
vels, to {peak more particulaily of them. 

But firft, T come to my Fryar, or Mifllonary ; dining 
with him one Day, and being very merry together, I fl'cw a 
fomc little Inclinatioii to. go with him, and he prefsU m^ 
and my Partner Very hard, and with a great many Pcr^^a-; 
lions, to confeat J why 'Father Simon, fays my Partner, 
Why fhould yon delire our Company fo much; You know 
we are Hereticks, and you do not love us nor, cannot keep 
' tis Company wirh any Pleafure j O ! f lys he, you m.ay 
perhaps be good "Catholicks in time j my Bu fine Is here is 
to conve;t HeatHens, and who knows but. 1 may convert 
you too j'Very well Failier £ud I, £o you wiir preach to 

us 



( 20p ) 

Us all the Way i I won't be t^oubfefbme to voii, fayt he, 
our Religion does not diveft us of good Scanners 5 beiides, 
iays he, we are here Wkc Countrymen, and £0 we are, 
compared to the Place we are in j and if you are Hugo- 
nots, and 1 a Catholick, we m.ay be all Chriftians at laft 5 
at leaft, faid he, we are all Gentlemen, and we may cbn- 
ve: Ic ib, without being uneafy to one another : I lik'd 
that Part of his Difcourfe very well, and it began to put 
me in Mind of my Prielh that I h:^^ left in the Bn^Jds ; 
but this Father Simon did not come up to his Crniatfter, 
by a great deal ,• for tho' Father Simon had no appearance 
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had not that 
Fund of Chriftian Zeal, flric^ Piety, and fincere AfFe<5tion 
to Religion, that my other good Eccleliafl-ick had, of whom 
I have laid {o much. 

B u T to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, nor So- 
liciting us to go with him 5 but we had ibmething elie 
before us at that time 5 for we had all this \^hile our Ship, 
and our Merchandize to difpofe of, and we began to te 
very doubtful what we fhould do, fbr we were now in % 
Place of very little Bufineis ,- and once I was about to ven- 
ture to fail for the River of Kflam, and the City of Nanquin : 
But Providence ieem'd now morevifibly, as I thought, than 
ever, to concern itielf in our Affair j and I was encou- 
raged from this very Time, to think, I fhould one Way 
or other, get out of this tangled Circumftance, and be brought 
Home to my own Country again ^ tho' I had not the leafl 
View of the Manner, and when I began fbmetimes to 
think of it, could not imagine by what Method it was to 
be done : Providence, I fay, began here to clear up our Way* 
a litrk' ; and the firft Thing that offered v^ns, that our old 
]Portu^u^z,e Pilot brought a J- a fen Merchant to us, w^ho 
beis^an to enquire wh^t Goods we had, and in the firfl: 
Place, he bought all our Opiuiti, and gave us a very good 
Price for it paying us in Gold by Weight, fbme in Imalli 
Pieces, of their own Coin, and lome in fmall Wedges, of 
about ten or eleven Ounces each : While we were dealing 
with him for our Opium, it came into my Head, that 
he might perhaps deal with us fbr the Ship too, and B 
ordaed the Interpreter to propofe it to himj he fbrunb 
up his Shoulders at it, when it was fiffl proposed to 
l^m i but in a few Days after, he came to me with one 

of 



( 2IO ) 

of tlie MiiTionafy Priefts for his Interpreter, and told me, 
he had a Propofil to make to me, and that was this ; he 
had bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he had 
no Thoughts (or Propolais made to him) of buying the 
Ship, and tl^t therefore, he had not Money enough to 
pay for the Ship ; but if I would let the fame Men who 
were in the Ship navigate her, he would hire the Ship to 
go to ^apMi, and would icnd them from thence to the 
PM/fPine lilands with another Loading, which he would 
pay tae Freight of, before they went from jFdpm , and 
that at thek Return he would buy the Ship : I began to 
Hilen to his Propofal, and ib eager did my Head Ml rua 
upon Ramblii^, that I c^aild not but begin to entertain a 
potion mvfHfof going with him, and m to j^il from the 
Jfhiliffine iflands, away to the South-Seas j and according- 
ly I ^k'd the y»fmefg Merchant, if he would not hire us to 
the Vh'niff'ine Ifknds, and difcharge us there j he faid, no 
^ could not do that, for then he could not have the Re- 
turn of his Cargo j but he would difcharge us in fa-f^n^ 
he iaid, at the Ship's Return -, Well, ftill I was fcwr taking 
jbim at that Propofal, and gdng myfelf j but my Partner, 
wifer than myidf, perfuaded me fiom it, repreicnting the 
Darters, as well of the Seas, as of the yafmefes, who ar@ 
a fa&, cruel, and treacherous People 5 and then of the Spa^ 
nhrds at the Fhilrpfines, mfxe falfe, more cruel, more trea- 
cherous than they. 

B u T to hring this long Turn of our Affairs to a Con- 
cluiion 5 tlie firii Thing we had to do, was to conliiltwith 
the Captain of the Ship, and with his Men, and know if 
they were willing to go to 'fafan ; and while I was do- 
ing this, the young Man, who, as I faid, my Nephew had 
kft with me as my Companion for my Travels, came to 
me, and told me, that he thought that Voyage promifed yery 
fair, and that there was a gieat Proipe6i: of Advantage, and 
he would be very glad if I undertook it 5 but that if I 
Would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a 
Merchant, or how I pieas'd to order him j that if ever he 
came to Mnglmd, and I was tliere, and alive, he would 
render me a faithful Account of his Succcfs, and it fhould 
be as much mine as I pleas'd, 

T was really loth to part with him, but confidering the 
Proipe^ of Advantage which was really confiderable, and 

that 



that he was a young Fellow, as likely to do well in it, as 
any I knew, I indin d to let him go j but flrft I toki him, f 
would conllilt my Partner, and give htm an Anfwer the 
next Day ,• my Partner and I diS:ours*d about it, and my 
Partner made a nio{?: generous Of^ei- 5 he told mc, you know 
it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both refblre not to 
go to Sea in it again ,• if your Steward, fo he called my Many 
will venture the Voyage, 1 11 kave my Share of the VefTel 
h> him and let him make the bcfl of it -, and if we live to 
meet in l^nglmd^ and he meetv^ with SucceJ(s abroad, he 
'frail account fcs- one half of the Profo of the Ship's Fright 
to us, the oi?her fhaff be hiS' own. 

I F my Partnef , ■ who \'^s no Way concerned with my 
youAg Man, made -him ^chfanOflfer, I could do nolels than 
lo^ hkn the ikne 5 and all the Ship's Company being 
wfiKng to go with him, we m^de over half the Ship to 
i^im in Property, and took a Writing from him, obiiging 
him to account for the other, and. away he went to 'j^a- 
fm\ HhtJ-fifar^ Merchant proT'd a very ,pun6l:ual honeft' 
?Maft i& feimi ppotefted him at fatm, and g6t him a Li- 
\ ^enfe tb come on Shbre, w}4ieh th^ ^ufofeans in gener^ 
^ \me not lately obtained ; pay'd him his Freight very 
pun^^flyi ient him to the PM/pp/nes, loaded with fapa^ 
-^id Chk^Wk'es, and a Supra-Cargo of their own, who^ 
trafficking with the Spmiards, brought back European 
Goods again, and a great Qiiati! tiy of Cloves, and other Spice; 
and -there he was not only pay'd his Freight very well, an<f 
at a very good Price, but being not willing to fell the Ship 
then, the Slerchant furnifh'd him wfth Gw>ds, on his own 
Account J 'that' for ibme Money, and ibme Spices of his 
owti, which he brought with him, he went back to the 
Manilla's^ td the Spaniards, where he fold his Cargo very 
well : ¥kre having gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla, 
he got his Ship made a free Ship 5 and the Govcrttour of 
Manilla hired him, to go to Accapulco, in America^ onthe- 
I Coa<n: of Mexico,^ and gave him a Licenfcto. Land there, 
I and travel to Uexico, and to paf| in ^ny- Spani/ty Ship ta 
-' Surope, with all his Men. 

He made the Voyage to Accapulco very happily, <andi 
there he foH his Ship 5. and having :tkfe alio o{)tained Al- 
lowance to travel by I^and to Porto Betid, ht found' Means 
fome how or other, to get to famma^ with all his Trea-*

{lire 5 and about eight Years after came to lE.ngland 
exceeding rich : Of which, 1 fiiall take Notice iii its 
Place i in the mean Time> I returp to our particular At^ 
fairs. 

Being now to part with the Ship, and Ship's Compa- 
ny, it came before, us of Courie, to coniider whatRecom.- 
pence v/e fhould give to the two Men, that gave us fiich 
tirnek Notice of the Delign af^ainft us in the River of 
Cam&odia : The Truth was^ they had done us a conlidc- 
ble Service, and deferv'd well at our Hands i though, i^y the 
Wi^y, they were a Couple of Rogues too \ for as they l)e- 
liev d the Story of our being. Pirates, and that we had really run 
away with the Ship, they, came down to us, not only to 
betray the De/ign tliat wa5 ibrmll agaiuft us, but- to go to 
Sea with us as Pirat^r and one of them confefs'd after- 
wards, that nothing elie but the Hopes of going a Rdgu- 
ing, brought him to do it: However, the Service they did 
us was not the lefsj and therefore, as I had promised to be 
grateful to them, I firrf order 'd the Money to be pay 'd to 
them, which tliey iaid was due to them on, board thdr 
refpe^bive; Ships j that is to fey, the Englijhman ninateen 
Months Pay. and to the Dutchman fcvenj and over and a- 
bove ihat, I gave them, each of them, a fmall Sum of 
Money in Gold, and which contented them very well}: 
then I made the Engitfljman Gunner in the Ship, the Gun- 
ner being now made Second*Mate, and Purfer i the Dutch- 
man I made Boatfwain ^ fo they were both very well 
pjeas'd, and prov'd very ferviceable, being both able. Sea- 
men, and very ftout Fellows. 

W E were now on Shore in China 5 if I thought my 
fclf baniih'd, and remote from my own Country at Ben- 
gale, \vhere I had niany Ways to get home for my Mo- 
ney 5 w:hat could I think of my ieif now? When I was 
gotten about a thouiand Leagues farther off from Home, 
and perfe(5):ly dcflitute of all manner of Pio^edi of Re- 
turn. 

Al L we had for it was this, that in about four Months 
Time, there was to be another Fair at the Place wheie we 
were, and then wc might be able to purchafe all Sorts of 
the Manufe£l:ures of the Country, and withal, might pof- 
fibly find fbme Chinefe funks or VefTels from Nanqu'-n, 
th^t would be to be fold, and would carry us. and our 

Goods, 



( 313 ). 

Goods, whitlicr we pleas'd, this I lik'd very well, and re- 
folv'd to wait ; befides, as our particular Peribns were not 
obnoxious, ib if any En^liflj or Dutch Ships came thither, 
perhaps we might have an Opportunity to load our Goods, 
and get Paflage to fome other Place in India, nearer 
Home. ! 

U PON thefe Hopes we refblv'd to continue here 5 but 
to divert our ielves we took two or three Journeys into 
the Country 5 firfl we went ten Days Journey to lee the 
City ot Na-aqmrii a City well Worth feeing indeed 5 they 
lay it has a ^liiiion of People in it j which, however, I do 
not believe j it is regularly built, the Streets all exadiriy flrait, 
and crois one another, in direct Lines, which gives the Fi- 
*gure of it great Advantage. 

But when I came to compare the miierable People of 
theie Countries with ours j their Fabricks, their Manner of 
Livingr their Government, their Religion, their Wealth, 
and their Glory, ( as Ibme call it ) I mull: confris, I do 
not fo much as think it worth naming, or worth my 
while to write ot\ or any that fliall come after me to 
read. 

I T is very obferveable that we wonder at the Grandeur, 
the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the Government* 
the Manuladures, the Commerce, and the Conduft of thefe 
People i not that it is toi>e wondet'd at, or indeed in the 
leaft to be regarded j but becaufe, having fifft a Notion of 
the Barbarity of thofe Countries, the Rudenefs and the Ig- 
norance that prevails there, we do not expedt to find any 
fuch Things fo far oi£ 

Ot HER WISE, what are their Buildings to the Palaces 
and Royal Buildmgs of Europe / What' their Trade, to the 
univerfal Commerce of England, Holland, France and Spain ? 
What their Cities to ours, for Wealth, Strength, Gaity of 
Apparael, rich Furniture, and an infinite Variety ? What 
are theii" Ports, fupply'd with a few Junks and Barks, to 
our Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, our large and pow- 
erful Navys ? Our City of London has more Trade than all 
their mighty Empire : One Englijh, or Dutch, ov French 
Man of War of 80 Guns, would fight with, and deftroy 
all the Shipping of China : But the Greatnefs of their Wealth, 
their Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength 
of their Armies, is furpifing to us, becaufe, as I have (aid. 



( 214 ) 

confidering them as a tebarous Nation of Paigans, littk 
better than Savages, we did not expert fuch Things among 
them j and this indeed is the Ad^ant^e with which sS 
their Greatnefs and Power is i-cpreiented to us, jothcrwife 
it is in it felf nothing at all j for as. I have Md of their 
Ships, fb may be laid of their Armies and droops j all the 
Eoixes of their Empiie* tho' they were to Bring two Mil- 
lions of Men into the Field together, would be able to do 
nothing but ruin the Country, and ftarve thcmielves : If 
they were tobeliege a ftrtnigTown inFiamers, or to fight 
a dircipiin'd Army, one Line of Qtrnmn CuiiaWiers, or a 
French Cavalry, would overthrow all the Horfe of Ck^na; 
a Million of tiieir Foot could not Qiznd before one em- 
battled Body of our Infantry, ported fo as not to be fur- 
rounded, though they vwre not to be one to twenty in 
Numbers nay, I do not boafb, if I fay? that 30000 G^- 
man or JEnglifi Foot, and looco French Horfe, would fair- 
ly beat all the Forces of Ch'raa : And fo of our fortified 
Towns, and of the Ait of our Engineers in ailaulting and 
drfending Towns j there's not a foitificd Town in China, 
could hold out one Month againft the Batteries and At- 
taqucs of an Europea^i Army 5 and at the fame Time, all 
the Armies of China, <:(mU laever take fuch a Town as 
Dunkirk, provided it was aot jftarv'd j • no, not in ten Years

Warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the lowers of 
Murope would have envy'd or interrupted him ; he ^ght 
by this Time have been Emperor of G^w^j inftead of be-

Husbandry, is imperfe£t and impotent, com par d to the 
fame Things in Europe j alfb in their Knowledge, their 
Learning, their Skill in the Sciences j they have Globes and

tliey know nothing of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies ; 
and £o grofly abSirdly ignorant, that when the Sun is e-

away with it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums 
and Kettles in the Country, to fdght the Monfler away, 
juft as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees. 

A s this is the only Excurfion of this kind whifch I have 
made in all the Acount I have given of my Travels, fo I 
fliall make no more Dcfcriptions of Countries and People, 
\is none of my Bufinefs, or any Part of my DeSgn; but 
giving an Account of my • own Adventures, through a 
Life of inimitable Wandrings, and a long Variety of Chan- 
ges, which perhaps few have heard the like of, I fliall lay 
nothing of the mighty Places, deiart Countries, and 
numerous People, I have yet to pafs through, more than 
relates to my own Story, and which my Concern among 
them will make neceflary : I was now, as near as I can 
compute, in the Heart of China, about the Latitude of 
thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we were returned 
from Nanquin j I had indeed a Mind to fee tlie City of 
Veking, which I had heard fb much of, and Father Simon 
importun'd me daily to do it -, at length his Time of go- 
ing away being fet, and the other MilTionary, who was 
to go with him, being arriv'd froni Macao, it was neceflary 
that we Should rcfblve, cither to go, or not to go j ib I re- 
ferred him to my Partner, and left it wholly to his Choice, 
who at length rciblv'd it in the Aflfttmative, and we pre- 
par d for our Journey : We fet out with very good Ad- 
vantage, as to finding the Way, for we got Leave to travel

in the Retinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of Vice- 
roy, or piincipal Magifliate in the Province where they 
rciide, and who take great State upon them, travelling 
with great Attendance, and with gieat Homage from the 
People, who are ibmetinjes greatly impoveiiih'd by them, 
becauie ail the Countries they pafs thro' are obliged to f\ir- 
niHi Proviiions for them and all their Attendants : That 
which I particularly ol)fervd, as to our travelling with his 
Baggage, was this, that tho' we received fuificicnt Provi- 
iions, both for our iclves and our liories, from the Coun- 
ti'y, as belonging to the Madar in, yet we were oblig'd to pay 
for every Thing we liad, after the Market- Price of the 
Country, and ttie Madarin Steward, or Commiflary of 
the Pjovifions, collected it duly from usj {o that our tra- 
velling in the Retinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very 
fieat Kindnefs to us, was not fuch a niighty Favour in 
im, but was indeed a gieat Advantage to him, conhdering 
there were about thirty other People travelPd in the fame 
Manner beiides us, under the Protection of his Retinue, or 
as we may caH it, under his Convoy : This, I fay, was a 
great Advantage to him, for the Country furnifh'd all 
the Proviiions Joy nothuig, and he took all, our Money for 
them. 

W E were five and twenty Days travelling to Peking^ 
through a Country infinitely populous, but niilerably cul- 
tivated} thfi Husbandry, Oeconomy, and the Way ofhving, 
all very miierable, tho' they boaft £b much of the Induftry 
of the People j I lay, miierable 5 and £0 it is, if we who 
underjfland how to live Were to endure it, or to compare 
it with our own, but not fb to thefe poor Wretches who 
know no othet : The Pride of theie People is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, which 
adds to that which I call their Mifery : I muil needs think " 
the naked Savages of America live much more happy, be- 
cause, as they mve nothing, ib they defire nothings where- 
as theie are proud and inlolcnt, and in the main are meer 
Begars and Drudges j their Oftentation is incxprefTible, and 
is chiefly ihew'd in their deaths and Buildings, and in the 
keeping Multitudes oC Servants or Slaves, and, which is to 
tlie laft Degree rediculous, thek Contempt of all the World 
butthemioves. 

I M U $ T 



1 MVST cmifefs, I traveird more pleafantly afterwards In 
the Detos and vaft Waderncfles of Grand Tarmry, than 
here ; and yet the Roads here are well pav'd, and well kept, 
and very convenient for Travellers} but nothing was move 
aukward to me, than to fee fucha haughty, imperious, m- 
foknt People, in the midft of the grofleft Simplicity and 
Ignorance, for all their fem*d Ingenuity is no more i My 
Wend Father 5/»w» and lus'd to be very merry upon thelc 
Occafions, to fee the beggarly Pride of thofe People j for 
Example, coming by the Houfe of a Country Gentleman, 
as Father Simm caff d him, about ten Leagues oft of the City 
o^Nanquin, we had firft of all the Honour to ride with 
the Matter of the Hoiife, about two Miles i the State he 
rode in, was a perfed Don ^ickotifm, being a Mixture ot 
Pomp and Poverty. ^ ^ r ^ ^ 

T H F Habit of this greafy Don wa^ very proper for a 
Scaramouch, or Merry- Andrew 5 bcinga dirty CaUicoe, with 
all the tawdry Trappings of a Fool's Coat, fuch as Hang- 
ing-Sieves, Toffcls, and Cuts and Slaflies dmoft on every 
Side; it covered a richTaflfety Vcft, as greafy as a Butcher, 
and which teftify'd, that his Honour muft needs be a moft 

cxquifite Sloven. . . . » 1 1. r^ ^ ^ 

H I s Horfe was a poor, lean, ftarv'd, hobbling Creature, . 
fuch as in England might iellfor about 30 or 40 Shillings, 
and he had two Slaves followed him on Foot, to dnve the 
poor Creature along; he had a Whip in his Hand, and he 
telabour'd the Beaft as faft about the Head, as his Slaves 
did about the tail, and thus he rode by us with about 
ten or twelve Servants^ and wc were told he was going 
from the City to Ids Country-Scat, about half a League 
before us : We traveU'd on gently, but this Figure of a 
Gentleman rcrfe away before us, and as v^re ftop d at a Vil- 
hge about an Hoar to refrcfli us, when vre came by the 
^ntry-Seat of this great Man, we faw him m a ittlc 
Place, before his Door, eating his Rcpaft 5 it was a kind 
of a Garden, but he was eafy to be fiai. and we were ^i- 
Tcti to uni«fta[nd, that the m<a:e wc look'd on him, the 
better he vsrould be pkas'd. , « , »^ 

' H E iat under a Tree, fomethinghkc the Palmetto Tree, 
which cffearually fbidcA him over the Head, and on the 
South Sidej but under the Tree alfo. wasplac^da largeUm- 
brdla, which inade that Part look well enough i he fat 
lolling back in a great Elbow-Chdr, being a heavy corpu- 



(2lS) 

fent Maft, and his Meat being brought him by two Wom<!n 
Slaves y he had two more, whdie Office, I think, few 
Gentlemen in Europe would accept of their Servicein(i'7i5:.) 
One fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the 
Difh wifh one Hand, and fcrap'd off what he let fall upon 
his Woiihip's Beard and Tanaty Veil:, with the other j 
while the great fat Brute thought it bcbw him to employ 
liis own Hands in any of thofe familiar Offices, which 
Kings and Monrachs would rat ha* do, than be troubled 
with the clumfy Fingers of their Servants. 

I TOOK this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride 
puts them to : and how troublefome a haughty Temper, thus 
ill-manag'd, muft be to a Man of common Senle i and 
leaving the poor Wretch to pleaie himfelf with our look- 
ing at him, as if we admir'd his Pomp, wh«-eas we really 
pity d and contemned him, we purfu'd our Journey } only 
Father Simon had the Curiofity to ftay to mform himfelf 
what Dainties the Country Jufticc had to feed on, in all 
his State; which he faid hfehad the Honour totafte of, 
and which was, I think, a Dofc that an Engli/h Hound 
would fcarce liave eaten, if it had been of&r'd him, (vizs) 
a Mcfs of boil'd Rice, with a great piece of Garlicfc in k, 
and a little Bag fiU'd with Green Pepper, and another Plant 
which they have there, fbmething like our Ginger but 
fmelling like Musk, and tafting like Muftard ^ all this was 
put together, and a fmall Lump or Piece of lean Mutton 
boil'd in it 5 and this was his Wdrjfhip's Repaft, four or 
five Servants more attending at a Dif!ance. If he fed them 
meaner than he was fed himlelf, the Spice excepted, they 
muft fare very coarfely indeed. 

A s for our Mandarin, with whom we travell'd, he was 
i«{pc<Sed like a King > furrounded always with his Gentle- 
men, and attended in all his Appearances with fuch Pomp, 
that i fa w little of him but at a Diftance; but this I ob- 
Icrv'd^ that there Was not a Horfe in his Retime, but that 
our Gariiers Pack-Horles in England kern to me to look 
much better, but they were fo cover'd with Equipage, 
Mantles, Trappings and iuch-like Trumpery, that you can- 
not ice whether they arc fat or lean,- in a Wwd, wc 
could fee fcarce any thing but their Feet and their 
Meads. 

I W AS now light-hearted, and all my Trouble and Per- 
pkxity that I have given an Account ot being over, I bad

as they call itj that is to futy, threw me inj the Place was 

not dt&^» but it wetted me' all over 5 I mention it becaufe 

it fpoird my Pockct-Bbok, wherein I had fct down the 

Names of feveral Peopk attd Places which I had Occafion 

to remember, and which, not taking due iCare of, the 

Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after to be read, 

to my great Lofs, as to the Nanies of fome Places which 

I touchMat in this Voyage. 

At length we arriv'd at ?ekmg\ I had no Body with 
md but the Youth, who ifiy Nephew, the Captain, had 
given me to attend me as a Servant, and who proved very 
fnifty and diligent j and rtiy Partner had no Body^ witk 
him but one Servant, who was a Kinfman : As for the 
Fortugeze Pilot, he being defirous to fee the Court, we 

tave him his Paifage, that is to iay, bore his Charges, fof 
is Company i and to ule hJm as an Interpreter, for he un- 
der ftood the Language of the Country, and Ipbke good French, 
and a little Engltjh ; and iftdded, thisdd Man was a raofl ufe- . 
ful Impliment to us every where 5 for we had not been a- 
bove a Week at Peking, whert he came laugking, :Ahy Seig- 
ni&r Ingliic, fays he, I have fifnething to teuyou , will make 
j9Hf Henri glad :■ My Heart glad, fays I, Pf^at cm that 
kei 1 don^'t knoTO any thing m this Country can either giv^ 
me Joy or Grief, to ar^ great Degree: Yes, yes, iaid the old *l 
Man, m broken Englip^y make yoii glad, me forrorp j forrf 
he would havcfaid. This made me more inquiiitive. iVhy 
faid I, •mdi it make ymfohy ? Becaufe, fiid he, you have 
brought me here if I>ayi journey, md mil leave me to ge 
hack alone, and which wayjhall I geiio my Tort afterwards 
without a Ship, withom a Horfe, without Pecune > So he 
called M<Hiey, being hxs broken Latin^ of which he had a- 
bundance to make us merry With. 

In ihort, he told us there was a great Caravan of Muf- 
covite and ToUjh Mca-chants in the City, and they were 
preparing to fct out on theh* Journey by Land to Mufcovy^ 
within rour or five Weeks, and he was lure we would take 
theOjjportunity to go With them, and leave him behind to^ 
go back all akme : I confcfs, I was furpriz'd with his New^^ 
« fecrct Joy fprcad it felf over my whole Soul, which I 
K % cannot

tannotdcforibe, and never felt before of fince, and I Imd no 
Bower for a good while to ipcak a Word to the old Man i 
but at laft I tum'd to him j How do you know this, iaid 
'I, arc you furc it is true? Yes, lays he, I met this Morn- 
ing, in the Street, an old Acquaintance of mine, an Arme- 
nian^ or one you call a Grecian, who is among them 5 he 
came laft fix>m Afiracm, and was dcfigning to go to Tm- 
quin^ where I formerly knew him, but lias alter'd^ his Mind, 
cmd is now reiblv'd to go back with the Caravan toMufcoWf 
and IbdowntheRiveroii^/^/* toAftracm'.'WcX Siegnior» 
Jays I, do not be uncafy about being left to go back alone, 
if this be a Method for my Return to England, it ihall be 
your Fault, if you go back to Macao at ail: We then went 
to confulting togemer what was to be dt^xr, aiui I ask'd 
my Partner what he thought of the Pilot*s News, and 
whether it would fiiit with his Aflairs ? He told me he 
would diO juft as I would, for he had Jietled all his Affairs 
fo well at Bengale, and left his Ef!e£ls in fiich good Hands, 
that as we had made a good Voyage here, if he could veft 
it in China Silks, wrought and raw, fuch as might be 
worth the Carriage, he would be content to go to 'England, 
and then make his Voyage back to Bengale, by the Com- 
pany's Ships. 

Having Ecfblv*d upon this, we agreed, that if our 
FortHgai Pilot would go with us, we would bear his Char- 
ges to MufcoWf or to England if he pleas'd y nor indeed were 
we to be efteem'd over generous in that Part neitte", if 
we had not rewarded him farther, for the Service he had 
done us was really worth all that, and more^ for he had 
not onl)^ been a Pilot to us atS«i, but he had been alfb like a 
Broker for us on Shore } and his procuring for us tlitfapan 
Merchant, was fbme Hundreds of Pounds in our Pockets : 
So we coufulted together about it, and being willing to gra- 
tify him, which was indeed but doing him Juftice, and ve- 
ry willing alfo to have him with us bcfides, for he was a 
moft ne<^l!ary Man on all Occaiions, we agreed to give 
him a Quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it, 
came to about vjf Pounds Sterling between us, and tobeat 
all his Charges, both for himielf and Horfe, exc^ edf a 
Hor& to carry his Goods. 

Having fettled this among our iHves, we caB*d him 
t® let him know what we had rcWv*d j I t<^ him, he

I was now to tell him we was refblv*d he fhould not go 
back at all: That as we had rciblv'd to go to Europe with 
the Caravan, we relblv'd alio he fhould go with us, and 
that we call'd him to know his Mind : He fhook his Head, 
andiaid, it was a longjournev, and hehad no Pecune to car- 
ry htm thither, or to mbfifl nimfelf when lie came there : 
We told him, we believ'd it was Co, and therefore we had 
refolv'd to do fbmething for him, that fhould let him fee 
how fcnfible we were of the Service he had done us, and al- 
£o how agreeable he was to us 5 and then I told him what 
we hadreiblv'd to give him here, which he might layout as 
we would do our own 5 and that as for his Charges, if he 
would go. with us, we would fet him lafe a-fliore, ( Life 
and Cmialties excepted) either in Mufcovy or England^ 
which he would, at our own Charge, except only tte Car- 
riage of his Goods. 

H E received the Rropofel like a Man traniported, and 
toM us he Woidd go with us over the whole World ,• and 
fb, in fhort, we all prepar*d our felves for the Journey : 
However, as it was with us, fb it was with the other 
Merchants, they had many Things to do, and inflead of 
being ready in five Weeks, it was foiar Months and fbme 
odd Lhys before all Things were got together. 

I T was the Beginning of Fehi^arf^ our Stile, when we 
fet out from Fekmg-, my Partner and the old Pilot Imd gone 
exprefs back to ths Port where we had firfl put in, to - 
di^fe of fbme Goods which we had left there 1 and I 
with a Chimfe Merchant, who I had fbme Knowledge 
of at Nmqmn, aftd who came to Peking on his own Af- 
feirs, went to Nmquiny where I bought nificty Pieces of 
fine Damasks, with about two hundred Pkces of other 
very fine Silks, of feveral forts, fbme mix'd with Gold, 
and had all thefc brought to Peking againfl: my P^tna's Re- 
turn j bdyes this, wc boudbt a very large Quantity of 
Raw Silk, and fbme other Goods, our Car^ amounting 
in thefc Goods <Mily, to about three thoufind five hundred 
Pounds Sterling, which, tc^hcr with Tea, and fbme fine 
Callicocs, and three Camc!l.oads of Nutmegs and Cloves,' 
loaded in all dghtecn Camels for imr Share, bcfides thoie 
we rode upcm> which with two or three fyoxe Horfes, 
and two Horfb loadrf with Provifions, made us in fhwt 
t6 Ckmels and Hor&s in our Retinue. 

Tm Company was rcry great, and, as i^su* aslcan re- 
K 5 membo" 



jtrember, made between g and 400 Horfe and Camefe, and 
upwards of a hundred and twenty Men, very well arnned 
and provided for all' Events : For as the Eaftern Caravans 
arc fubjedt to be attacked by the uirahy Co arcthefe by the 
Tartars ; but they are not altogether fo dangerous as the 
Arabs, nor fo barbarous when they prevail. 

The Company confifted of Peopfe of (evcral NationSj 
iuch cs, Mnfcovites chiefly, for there were above Sixty &f 
them who were Meixhants br Inhabitants of Mufcon, t%>* 
of them fbmc were Llvohmns, and to our particular Satif- 
fodion, Five of them were Scots, who appeared alio to be 
Men of great Experience in Buline6> and Men of very good 
Subflance. 

W H E N we had travelled one Days Tonmey, the (Juides, 
who were Five in Number, called all the Geatlemen and 
Merchants, that is to fay, all the Paffenaers^ except ijieSfir- 
yants, to a great Coujicil, as they JC^Hd it: At tjus^grcat 
Council, every one cjepoiited a certain (^ntity of Money 
to a common Stock, for the neceflary Expence of buying 
Forage on the Way, where it was not ptKqrwitc tp be 
jhad, and for fatisfying the Guides, getting Horics, and the 
like ; And here they conftitutcd tlie Journey, as they called 
It, {viz.) They named Captains and , Officers, to di^aw us 
all up, and give the Cpmmand in cafe of an Attack, and 
gave every <»ie' their Turij of Commands. Nipr was this 
toming us inta Order, any more than what we found* 
scedfiil upon the Way, as flisil be obfervod in Its Place. '

be j how big is it ? Can we carry it in a Box upon a Ca- 
mel? If we can, we will buy it: Ufon a Camsl! faysthtf 
©Id Pilot, holding up both his Hands, wh^ there is a Fam'- 
iy of Thirty Veofie lives in it, 

I WAS then carious indeed to fee it, and when I came 
to iu it was nothing but this ; it was a Timber Houfc 
pr a Houfe built, as wc call it in 'Englmid, with Lath and 
Tiaifler, but all the Plaiflering was really China^l4^are^ that 
is to fay, it was plaiftcr'd with the Earth that makes ChinM- 
Ware, 

The Outfide, which the Sun fhonc hot upon, was gli-' 
zed, and look'd very well, peifcdi white, and painted with 
biue Figures, as the large China-Ware in Zngland is paint- 
ed, and hard, as if it had been burnt: As to the Infidc, all 
the Wafls, inftead of Wainfcot, were lined up with har- 
dened and painted Tiles, like the little fquare Tiles we call 
Galley-Tiles in England^ all made of the finefi China, and 
the Pigur^s exceeding fiiie indeed* with extraordinary Va- 
ricty of Colours mird with Gold, many Tiles making but 
one Figure, but join'd & artificially, the Morter being made 
of the lame Earth, that it was very hard to fee wheie tlic 
Tiles met: The Floors of the Rooms were of the fame 
Compofition, and as hard as the earthen Floors we have iix 
wfe in fever4 Parts of England, eipccially Uncolnjhire, Not- 
tinghamjhire, Leicejierjhire, ficc, as lurd as Stone, and 
fmQoth, but not burnt and painted, except fbme fmaller 
Rooms, like Qofets, which were all as it were paved with* 
the fame Tile^ the Ciclings, and, in a Word, all the Plai- 
ftcring-Work in the whole Houflb were of the fame Earth j 
and, after all, the Roof was covcr'dwith Tiles of the fame, 
but of a deep iliining black. 

This was a Chin^ W^c-houfc indeed, truly and lif^ral- 
ly to be caird Co i and )^ I not been upon ths Journey, I 
could have fbid fbmc IJays to fee and examine the Parti- 
culars of it: They told me there were Fountains and Fiih- 
ponds ii? the Garden, all paved at the bottom and ildes 
with the fame, aqd fine Statutes fet up in Rows on the 
Walfc^ entirely fgx^Xd of the JPfirg^Uin Earth, and burnt 
whole. 

As this is one of ti^ Singularities of CfeVwf, fo they may 
be allow'd to excel in it i but I am very fiire they excel in 
JUl their Accounts o£ it ,• for they told mc'fudi mcrcdiblc

( ^H ) 

Things of their Performance in Oocktry-Ware^ for fech it 
Is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it couM not be 
truej tfey told me in particular of one Workman that 
n^ade a Ship with all its Tackle, and Mafts, and Sails, in 
f!arthen-Ware, big enough to carry Fifty Men : If he had 
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to J ftpm m it, 
I might have faid {omcthmg to it indeed^ but as it was, I 
knew the whole Story, which was in fhort, asking Par- 
don for the Word, that the Fellow lied j fo I fmiled, and 
iaid nothing to it. 

This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the Cara- 
van, for which, the Leader of it for the Day, fined me a- 
boutthe Value of three Shillings, and toldmc, if it had been 
three Davs Journey without 3ie Wall, as it wis three Days 
within, he muft iavc fined me four times as much, and

an Army might enter in Battalia, or blow it up in the Air, 
Foundation and all, that there ihould be no fign of it left ? 
Ay, ay, %s he, I know that. The Chinefe wanted mighti- 
ly to know what I faid, and I gave him leave to tell him 
a few Days after, for we was then almofi out of theii; 
Country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward .; 
but when he knew what I had ifaid, he was dumb all the 
reft of the Way, and we heard no more of his fine Story, 
of the Chinefe Power and Great neis, while he ilay'd. 

A F T E R we had paft'd this mighty Nothing, cali'd a Wall, 
(bmething like the Pifis Wall, & famous in KorthumSer-

in fortified Towns and Cities, as being fubjedi to the In-

Misfortune attending it, {yix.,) that all our Mutton that vvc

as for the Tarmrsy there was about five of them kill'd j 
how many were wounded, we knew not ^ but this we 
knew, that the other Party wasib frighted with the Noife 
of our Guns, that they made off, and never made any At-

We were all this while in the Chinefe Dominion, ani 
therefore the Tarters were not fb bold as afterwards j but 
in about five Days we enter 'd a vaft great wild Dei&rt, 
which held us three Days and Nights March ^ and we were 
obliged to carry our Water with us in jgreat Leather-Bot-

in the Defarts of Arabia,

be caird J<lo Man's Land ; being a Part of the Great Kara- 
kathay, or Grand Tartary^ but that however it was recko- 
ned to China i that there was no Care taken here, to pre- 
lerve it from the Ihroards of Thieves, and therefore it was 
teckon'd the worft Deiart in tlie whpje Marchj tho' we 
were to go over Ibme much larger.

peror of C^/»i, bijt Ia}n for^the xnc^ Partr m Villages, £bme 
of which were fortifi^, becauie of the liiairiions of the 
i'ariars : When we came to one of thcfe Towns,^^ (it was 
about two Diiys and a half's Journey before -we were to 
come to tlie City of N^wn) I wanted to buy a Camel; of 
whicK* there are plenty to be foM alLthc Way upon tliat. 
Roadj and ol Horles aU©, £\ich zs they are, becauie ib ma* 
ay Caravans coming that way, they are often wanted: The 
Perlbn that 1* fpok« to to get me a Camel, would have gone 
and fetch'd it for me, but I like a Fool muft be officious, 
tad go my felf along with him : The Place was about two 
Miles out of the Village, where* it feems, they kept the 
Camels and Horlcs feedmg under a Guard. 

I w A lk'd it on Foot with my oki Pilot in Company, 
and a, Chine/e, being very defirous, foriboth, of a little Va- 
ncty t: Whai wc came to this Place* it was a low marfhy 
Ground, wall'd round with a Aonc Wall, piled up dry, 
without Morter or Earth among it, like a Park, with a 
httle Guard of Chmefe Sokiiers at the Door . Having bought 
a Camel, and agreed for the Price, I came avray, and fh^ 
Ghmjk Man that went with me, hit the CameU when oo 
a iuddcn.came up lire Tmfkt-s on Hofffe-back,* two of 'cm 
ftiz.'d the Fellow, and took the Carod from him, whflc

immediately flepM up to him who had ftop'd us, as I ^xd^ 
and before he could come forward agaih> (for it was all 
done as it were in a Moment) made a Blow at him with 
a Scy meter which he always wore, but miffing the Man, 
cut his Horie into the Mt of his Head, cut oiie of his 
Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice down the fide of 
his Faccj the poorBeaft enraged with the Wounds, was no 
more to be governed by his^ plider, tho' the Fellow fat 
well enough too,* but away he ficw, and carry d him quite 
out of the Pilot's Reach, and at fbmc diftance riling upon 
his hind Legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell uponlum. 
In this Interval the poor Chinefe came in, who had loft 
the Camel, but he had no WeatXHis however, feeing the 
Tartar down» and his Horfe fafien upon him* he runs to 
him, and feiaing upon an ugly iil-favour'd Weapon he had 
by his fide, fbmething like a Pole-ax, but not a Pok-ax 
neither i he wrench'd it from him, and madcfhift to knock 
his Tartarian Brains out with it : But my old Man had 
the third Tartar to deal with flill, and feeing he did not 
fly, as he cxpcd:ed, nor come on to fight him, as he ap- 
prehended, but flood flock flill, the old Man flood flill too, 
and falls to work with his Tackfe to charge his Pif^ol a- 

Eiinj but as fbon as the Tartar &w the Pil&], whether h^ 
ppofed it to be the fame or Miother, I knovir not; but 
away he fcowercd, and left my Pilot, my Champkin I cal- 
led him after waid, a compkat Vi£h>ry. ' 
By tlds time I was a little awake, Ipr I thoujjht 
when I hfk bqgan to awake, thkt I had hech iti k 
fyifc&t Sleeps but, as I iaid above* I wondefcd whetcl wa|r 
how I came lyon the Ground, asui What was tlkMsTttdr':

Bsd; and feeing mc bloody, wouW fee how I was hurf, bdlf 
it was not much, <Mily what we call a broken Head,- nei- 
tiier did I afterwards find any great Inconvenience from 
the Blow, other than the Place which was Hurt, and which 
was well again in two or three Days. 

W E made no great Gain however by this Viftory, for 
we loft a Camel, and gained a Horfcj but that which was 
remarkable, when we came back to the Village, the Man 
demanded to be paid for the CameU I difputed it, and it 
was brought to a Hearing before the Chinefe Judge of the 
Place} that is to iay, in lEnglifh, we went before a Juftice 
•of the Peace: Give him his due, he a6ted with a great deal 
of Prudence and Impartiality j and having heard both Sides, 
he gravely ask'd the Chtnefe Man, that went with me to 
buy the Camel, whoic Servant he was ? I am no Servant*, 
fays he, but went with the Stranger : At whole Requeft, 
fhys the Juftice? At the Stranger s Reqiieft, lays he 5 why 
then, fays the Juftice, you were the Stranger's Sei'vant for 
the Time, and the Camel being delivered to his Servant, it 
was delivered to him, and he muft pay for it. 

I CONFESS, the thing was to clear, that I had not a 
•Word to %j but admiring to fee fuch juft Rcaibning 
upon the Conlcquence, and lo accurate ftating the Caufe, I 
pay d willingly for the Camel, and fent for anotha: 5 but 
you may obierve, I fent for it, I did not go to fetch it 
jiay fclf any more, I had enough of that. 

The City of Naum is a Frontier of the Chtnefe Emmre j 
they call it fortified, and ib it is, as Fortifications gotherci 
for this I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars InKft- 
r^^thaie, which I believe areibme Million^, could not batter 
down th? Walls. with their Bows and Arrows,- but to call 
it ftrong,^ if it were attacked with Cannon, would be to 
make tboie who underftand it, laugh at you.

Qur Baggage* and the whole Caravan in the Center 5 in this 
©rder, and wcjl prepared for Battle^ we thought our (elves 
% Match for the whqle ten thouiand Mongul Tartars, if they 
had appear'd.j but the next Day when they did- appear, it 
was quite another Thing. 

It was early in the Morning, when marching from a. 
little well fituated- Town called Changu, we had. a River to 
pafs, where we were obiig*d to. ferry j and had the Tartars had' 
any Intelligence, then had been the Time to have attak'd 
us, when the Caravan being over, the Rear Gaurd was 
l>Bhihd5 but they did not appear there.. 

About- three Hours after, when we were enter'd up- 
^i a De^rt of about fifteen or lixteen Miles over, behold, 
by a Cloud of Duft they rais'di we law an Ehemy was at

wpon the Spur.

^Brequqitly look'd behind them, which is a certain Sign in 
^ Soldier,, that hcis juft ready to run away^ my old Pilot was

in the Ffoat of our Line ; and as we found diem wtthiaf 
Gun-|bot^ our Leader ordered the two Wings to ^dvmcc 
iwiftly, and give them a Salvo on each Wing with th«r 
Shot, which was done 5 but they went oft and I fiippofe 
went back to give an Accout of the Reception they wiere lUae 
to meet with : And indeed that Salute clogg*d their &t^ 
machs, for they immediately halted, ftood a while to cmk* 
iidcr of it, and wheeling oft' to the left, they gave over the 
Deilgn, and faid no moie to us for that time j wluch was 
very agreeable to our Circumftances, which were but very 
indifferent for a Battle with fuch a Number.. 

Two Days after this, we came to the City Naunm, or 
Jtfaum ; we thank'd the Govcrnour for his Care for us, and 
collected to the Value of a hundred Crowns, or thereabouts 
which we gave to the Soldiers fent to guard us i and here 
we refted one Day : ITiis is a Garrilbn indeed, and there were 
nine hundred Soldiers kept here j but the Reaibn of itwa8> 
that formerly the Mufcovite Frontiers lay nearer to them 
dian they do now, the Mufcovites having abandoned that 
Part of the County (which lies from this City Weft, for 
about two hundred Miles) as dcfolate and unfit for Ufe j 
and more efi?ecially, being ib very remote, and Co difficult 
to fend Troops tEther for its Defence ; for we had yet a- 
bove two thoufind Miles to Mufcozy, properly {o called*

wliile before we came to any confiderablc Town, we had 
nothing to obferve there but this,- firil, That all the Rivers 
run to the Eaft: As I underftood by the Charts which 
•fame in our Caravan had with them, it was plain, that all 
ithofe Rivers ran into the Great River Xamour, or Gam- 
itnow: This River, by the natural Courfe of it muft run 
into the Eafl: Sea, or Chinefe Ocean : The Story they tell 
lis, that the Mouth of this RiVer is choak'd up with Bull- 
Tuflies of a monftruous Growth, (viz..) three Foot about 
and twenty or thirty Foot high, I muft be allowed to faj, 
I believe nothing or; but as its Navigation is of no Uie, 
.becauic there is no Trade that way, the Tartars, to whom 
<aloae it belongs, dealing in nothing b«t Cattle, fb no Body 
ithat ever I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go 
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from the 
•McHith of it in Ships; but this is certain, that this River 
-numing due Eaft, in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, caiTjes a 
yaft Concourse of Rivers along with it, and hnds an Ocean, 
to empty itfeif in that Latitude j fo vre are fure of Sea 
there. 

Some Leagues to the North of this River, there arefe* 
yerai ccmfiderabk Rivers, whofe Streams run as due North 
^ the Tmn&ur runs Faft , and thefe are all found to join 
^eir Waters with tlie Great River Tartarus, nam'd £0, 
irom the northcrmoft Nations' of the Mongtd Tartars^ 
mh^thc Ckm/e fay, Wf^c the firft Tartars in the World; 
and who, as our Geographers alledgc are the Gog and M^ 
^gi mentioned in £cred Storv. 

'TAese Rivers running 4l Northward, as well as all 
th^ othes* Riva^, I am yet to fpeak of, make it evident, 
.that the N<Mthem Ocean bounds the Land alfb on that 
M6% fi that it does not fceni rationall in the leaft to think, 
that the Land can extend itl^f to join with America on 
tlSat S^e, m that there Is ncH: a Cbmtxiunication between 
th^ Nortfaa^n and th^ Eaftcm Otean; but of this 1 fball

a^r the h& of thofe Places I had the Qiripfity to go and 
fee their Way of Living, * which is moft brutiih and unfuf- 
Arable; they ha^ I iuppofe a great Sacrifice that D^y, for 
there ftood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an Idol 
made of Wood, frightful as the Devil 5 at leaft as any Thing 
we can think of to repreicnf ths Devil , can be made 5 it 
had a Head certainly i^ot & much as refembling any Crea-- 
ture that the World ever few; £^rs as big as Goats Horns, 
and as htghj Eyes^ as big as a Crown-Piece j a Nofe like a 
crooked Rani^s Horn, and a Mouth extended four cpriler'd, 
tike that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like % 
I^aiTot*s under Bill 5 it was dreiTed up in the filthieft Map-

It was about eight Foot high, yet Imt^ Feet or Legs, or 
aiiy otliier Fropbrtion of Parts. 

This Scarecrow was &t up at the OMtca* Side of the

Our Caravan refted three Nights at the Town, which 
ivas about four Miles off, in order to provide ibme Horjfes 
ivMch they wanted, feveral of the Horfes having beenlan3i*4 
and jaded, with the Badnefs of the Way and our long Mbrch 
m€r the hft Defert i ib we had ibme Leifure here to put 
my pedgn in Execution: I communicated my l^rojedt ta 
ths Sc0ts Merchant of Mufeaw, ofwhofe Courage I had 
had fufficient Teftimony, as above: I told him what I had 
feen, aid with what Indignation I had fince thought that 
liuman Nature could be £6 degenerate : I told him, I was 
rcfolv'd, if I could get but four or five Men well arm'd to 
go with me, to eo^d deftroy that vile, abominable Idol; 
to kt them &e that it had no Power to help it ielf, and 
consequently could not be an Objeft of Worfbip, or to be 
pray'd to, much JcTs hdp them that of&r'd ^orifices to 
it. 

H E laugh*d at me ; Jkjt^ he. Your Zeal may be good, 
but what do you propoie to your felf by it ? Propole I 
faid h to vindicate the Honour of God, which is infiilted 
by this Devil Worfhip : But how will it vindicate the 
Honour of Qod^faid h$ ? Wiulc the People will not be 
^le to knowwluit you mean hy it, unlefs you could fpeak 
to them too, and m\ them jR>, and then they will tight 
you too, I'll aifure you, for they are deipcrate Fellows, *nd 
that e^?ecially in Defence of their Idolatry : Can we not, 
faid ly do it in the Night, and then leave them the Rea- 
fons and Caufes in Writing in their own Langu^ ? Writing ! 
Jaidkiy why there is not in five Nations or theni one >m 
that knows any thing of a Letter, or how to read ^ ^ord 
in any Language, or in their own : Wretched Ij^orance!

&cn*y and aMb of what I intendeds and he told merrily* 
he wduM go with me if it cort him his Life? ib we a^em 
to go mdj us three : I had indeed proposed it to my Part* 
IMT, but f^ dedin'd it,- he fak!, he was rc^y to aflift me 
to the utmofi, and upon all Occalions for my|Deicnc»y 
hmt that this was an Adventure quite out <rf his Way j fo^ 
I 6y» we refbiF*d upon our Work, only us three, and my 
Man-fe-vant, md to put it in Execution that Night dxHit 
Midnight, with all the Secrecy imaginaWe. 

However, upon fecond Thoughts, we were willing 
to delay it till the next Night becauS the Caravan being to 
ict forward in the Morning, we iuppos'd the Gover- 
nour could not pretend to give them any Satisfaction 
upon us when wc were out of his Power : The Sc^s 
Merchant, as fteady in his Relblution to enterprise it, m 
bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown 
of Sheep-Skins, and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows^ 
and haa provided the i&me for himfelf and his Country- 
man, that the People, if they ikw us, ihould not be able to 
determine who we were. 

A L L the firft Night we Ipent in mixing up fbme com- 
buftible Matter with Aqua-vitae, Gun-powder, and fiich o- 
ther Materials as we could get, and having a good Quan- 
tity of Tar in a little Pot, about an Hour after Night w^ 
fet out upon our Expedition. 

W E came to the Place about eleven a-Clock at Nigh^^ 
and found that the People had not the kaft JeaJoufy oi 
Dangerattending their Idol ^ the Nkhtwas doudy, jct the 
Moon gave us Light enough to fee that the Idol il«x)d juft in 
the lame Pofture and Place that it did before i The People 
feemcd to be ail at their Reft, pijy, that in the great Hut, 
or Tent, as wc cali'd i|:, where we iaw the three Priefts, 
who wc miftook for Butchers, we faw a Light, and go^ 
ing up clofc to the l>oor, we heard People talking, as if 
there were five or fix of theni } we. concluded tterefbrc, 
tiut if wc fet Wild-fire to the Idol, thefe Men would come 
out immediately, and run up to the Pkcc to rcfcuc it from 
the De(hrud:ion that wc intended for it, and what to dor 
with them we knew not ,• once wc thou^t of carry- 
ing it away and fetting Fire to it at a Diflancci but 
when wc came to handte it, we found it too- bulky iot 
our Carriage, fb we vverc at a Lofs again ; The ictood 
Scots-mm was for fetting Fire to the Tent or Hut, and 
knocking the Creatures thatwerc there on the Head when 

xhsy 



( a40 ) 

they canie out i Sut I coM notjoin with that j I was 
againft killing them, if it was poflible to be avoided : Well 
tfcn, laid the Sc0ts Merchant, 1 II tell you what we will 
dot we wifl try to take them Prifbners, tie their Hands 
and make them ftand, -and fee their Idol deChtjy'd. 

A s it happened, we had Twine or Packthread enough 
about us, which wa« ufcd to tie our Fire- Works together 
with J fo we refblved to attaque thefc People firfl, and with 
as little Noife as we could : The firft Thing we did, we 
knock'd at the Door, when one of the Friefts coming to 
the Door, we immediately feized upon him, ftop'd his 
Mouth, and ty'd his Hands behind him, and led him to 
the Idol, where we gag'd him, that he might not make a 
Noiie y ty'd hi^ Feet alfb together* arid Mt him on the 
Ground. 

Two of us then waited Ikt the Door, expeifling that 
another would come out to fee what the matter was j but 
we waited fo long till the third Man came back to us ; 
and then no body coming out, we knock'd agiin gently, 
and immediately out came two more, and wc fcrv'd them 
juft in the fame Manner, but was oblig*d to go all with, 
them, and lay them down by the Idol fome oSance from 
one another J when going back, we found two more were 
come out to the Door, and a third iftood behind them with- 
in the Door : We leiz'd the two, and immcdfately ty*d 
them, when the third ftepping back, and crying out, my 
Scats Merchant went in arter him, and takmg out a Com- 
position we had made, that would only finoak and (link, 
he let Fire to it, and threw it in amoQg them j by that 
time the other Scotfmm 2xA my Afen, taSdag Charge of 
the two Men already bound, and ty^d topiBtto alfo by the 
Arm, led them away to the Idol, and left rftBtn there, to 
ice if their Idol would rdicve thehi, makmglafte bade to 
us. 

Whek the Fuze wc had thrown in had fill'd the Hut 
with fb much Smoak, that they were almofl: fiiffocatcd,- 
we then threw in a fmall Leather Bag of another kind, 
which flam'd like a Candle, and following it m, wc ifbundi 
there was but four Ptople fcft, who, it ieems, -were t^ 
Men and two Women, and, as wefuppos'd, h^ been about 
ibme of their Diaboiick Sacrifices : They appcar'd, in fhort; 
frighted to Death, at kaft fo as to fit trcmWing and ftupidi 
and not able to fpe^ neither, for the Smoak. 

In a Word, wc took them, bound them as we had the 

othov 



other, and all without ^y Noife : I fhould have Mi, we 
brought them ouf: of the Houfc or Ijut firft 5 for indeed 
' we weic not able to b^ ^ Smoak any more than they 
were: When we had done this, w:e carry *d them alltpge* 
tier to the Idol : When wc came there, we fell to Work 
with himj and firil wc daiib^d h^n jl over, and hisRobei 
a}% with Tar, and iuch othar Stuff as we liad, which was 
Taflo^iy mix'd with Brimftone > thm we l!:op*d his Eyes, 
aiii fiffs, and Moqth fall of Gun-jpow4cr, then wf wrapp'd 
V^ a g^eat Piece of Wild-fire m his Bonnet, and. thca 
fticking all the CombuftiUes we had brought witli us upon 
him, *ve looked about to fee if wc could find any thing 
clCe to help to bum him 5 when my Sect/man remembred, 
that by the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there lay a 
Heap of xiry Forage, whether Straw or Ruihes I do not; 
remember, away he and the other Scot/man run, and 
fetch'd their Arms full pf that; Whejj wc had done this, 
we took all our Prifoners,, and brtnidit them, lay'mg un- 
ty'd their Feet, and ui^s^'d their A&uth^ and made them 
Ibnd up, and fct them juir bdbre their monftrous Idol, and 
thtti fet Fire to the whc^, 

W E i\3iy*i by it a Qgarter of an Hour , or thereabouts, 
^till the Powder, in the Eyes, and Mouth , and Ears of the 
Idol blew up, and as wc couH ^^ivc had iplit and de-

by him ^ The Czar ikvfeg ftraitly charged them to treat 
the conqu^r'd Country with Gentlencfs and Civility, gavx 
them ftill all tkc good Words he could ,• at laft he told 
them, there was a Caravan gone towards KuJJk that Morn- 
ing, and pei'hapsit was fbmec^ them, who had donetf^n 
this injury ; and that if they would be iatisfy 'd with thar, 
he v^'ould fend after thenft, to enquire into it: This fcem'd 
to appcafe them a little, and dccordinglv the Goverriour 
ferit after us, and gave Us a particular Account how the 
Thing was 5 intimating With;^, that if any in our Caravan 
had dpne it, they (houB nijike their Efcapei but that, whe- 
thef^ey had dbne it or 60, wc fliould make all the Hafte 
forward that was poAlble ,- and that, in the mean Time, 
he would keep them in Play as long as he could. 

This was very" friendly in the Govemour ; however, 

when it came to the Caravan, there was ik) body knew 

arty lliirigof the Matter* and, as few. us that were guilty, 

we weretJ^fetft of all fiifpe^ed i none fo much as askd

three Days March,'to (mter upon a vaft namelefs beiart, 61 
which I fliall iky more in its Place; and which, if wehal 
now been upon it, 'tis mote than probable, we had been al 
deftroy'd : It was the fecond Days March from flothns^ 
that by the Clouds of Duft behind us at a great Diilancc, 
ibme of our People began to be fentible we were pur&ed % 
\ve had entered the Deiart, and had pafs'd by a great Lak&, 
cail'd Sch^ks Ofer, when we perceived a very grdit Body of 
t^orfe appear on the other Side of the Lake to the North, 
we travelling Weil : We obfer*d they weit away Wefl: as 
vve did, but had fuppoied we would have taken that Sidt 
of the Lake, wh^eas, we very happily took the South- 
Side i and in two Days more we fiw them dot, for they 
believing, we were ftiil before them, pufli'd on, till they 
came to the River XJdda i this is a very great River when 
it pafles farther North, but where we came to it> we found 
it narrow, and fordable. 

The third Day they either found their Miftake, or hai 
tntelligence of us, and came pourii^ in upon us, towards 
the Dusk of the Evening : We had, to our great Satisfac- 
tion, juft pitched upon a Place for our Camp, which was 
very convenient for the Nig;ht ; for as we were upon a 
Deiart, tho' but at the Beginning of it, that was above 
five hundred Miles over, we had no iTowns to lodge at» 
and indeed ^xpedbed ndne but the City ^^r^wew*, which 
we had yet two Days March to 5 tfe Dcfirt, liowever, 
had fome few Woods in it on this Side, and little Rivers* 
which ran all into t)ie great River XTdda : It was in a nar^ 
row Strait between two little, but very thick, Woods, than 
we pitch'd our little Camp for th^ Night, cxpe6ting to be 
attack'd in the Night. 

No body kftcw but our felves, what we were purfuel 
for,- but as it v^s ufual forths Mangul tartars to go about 
in tVoops in that Defart, fo tlie Caravans always fortify 
themfelvcs every Night againft them, as againft Armies ot 
Robbers i and it was rherclor^ no new Things be purfued. 

B u T we had this Night, of ail the KIghts of our Tnp- 
vels, a moft advantageous- Camp; for wc^y between two 
Woods, with a little Rivulet runinng jurt txsfore our Front 5 
fo that we could not be iurroun<ie«3, or attack'd any way^ 
but in our Front or Rear: we took care alio to make our 
Front as ftrong as we could, by placing our Packs, with 
our Camels and Horfes, all in a Line on the Infide of the 
River, and wc fcU'd fome Trees in our Rear*

They were far ftom being fatisfy'd with this for an

Booming bv Break of Day to our Camp; but feeii^ us in

was moft natural alio that I Ihould take more Servants^ 
with me than 1 had before, and tlie young Lord pafs*d for 
my StewardjWhat great Man I pafs'd for my felf, I know 
not, neither did it concern me to enquire j we had here^ 
the word and the krgeft Delart to pals over that we met 
with IB all thfe Joumeyi Indeed I caJl it the worflj becaufe 
the Way was very deep m fbme Places , and very uneven . 
in others^ the befi: we had to fay for it, was, that we 
thought we had no Troops ofTar^ars and Robbers to fear, 
and that they never came on this Side the River O^y , or 
at leaft, but very fefdom 5 but we found it otherwife. 

Mx ypung Lotd had with him, a faithful Mnfcovlt^ Scr-

tie Difference between that Country and the MonpdTartaryi 
the People, moflly Pagans, and little better than' the Savages 
of America i their Houies and Towns full of Idols, and 
their Way of Living wholly barbarous, except in the Cities 
as above, and the Villages near them j where they are Chri- 
ftims as they call them ielves, of the Creek Church j but c- 
vea thefe have their Religion mingled with io many Re-

In paffing this Forreft, I thought indeed we rftuft, after 
all our Dangers were in. our Imagination eJLcap'd,.as before, 
have been plundered and rob'd, and perhaps murthei'd by a 
Troop of Thieves i of what Country they were, whether 
the roving Bands of the p/?//Jr&, a kind of Tartars, or wild 
People on the Bank of the oiy, had rang'd thus far, or 
whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I am yet 
at a Lofs to know j but they were ail on Horfe-back, car-

twice J sit length they plac'd themfelves juft in our Waw, 
Hpon which, we drew up in a little Line before our Camels, 
being not above fixteen Men in aM j and being drawn u|> 
thus, we.haltcil ajsi fent out the Siierim Scf:vsii^, who.at:r

Truce, and called to them j but tho* he ipptoe feveral of 
their Languages or Diaie6ts of Lang^iagcs rath®*, he conM 
i^t underftand a Word they fiid j however, after fi)mt 
^igns to him, not to come nearer to them at his Peril; Qx

This ,was fmall Comfort to us i howeveis we had no

of a Mile*5 Diftance, a little Grove or Clump of Tree*; which 
flood clofe together, and very near the Road , 1 immetii-

xxig Mm, namely, tiat he was always readieft and mofl apt

we advanced immcdtately with what Speed we could, and 
gain'd that littk Wood, the Tatars ov Thieves, for wc 
kn€W not what to caS them, keeping their Stand, and not 
attempting to hinder us; When we came thither, we found 
to our great Satisfa^ion, that it was a iwampy fpringy 
Piece of Ground, and on the one Side, a very great Spring 
of Water, which running out in a little Rill or Brook, was 
a Uttk feather, join'd by another of the like Bignefs, and 
was in fiiort, ms Head or Source of a conliderablc River, 
cali'd afterwards the Wirtskai the Trees which grew about 
tiffis Spring, were not in alj above two hiimir^d, bmt wer^

We aim*d Co true, (or Providence dire^ed our Shot fo fiirc) 
that we kiird fourteen of them, at the firft Volley, and wound- 
ed federal others^as alio fevcral of their Horfesj for we had all of 
us loaded our Pieces with twox>r three Bullets a piece, at kaft. 
They were terribly furpriz'd with our Fire, and retreated 
imincdiately abcnit one Jiundned Rods frcMaa us j in which 
Time, we loaded our Pieces again^ and feeii^ them keep 
that Diftance, we ially*d out and catch'd four or five of 
their Horfes, whofe Riders, we fuppos*d were killed, and 
coming up to the Dead, we could eaiily percdve they were 
Tartars, but knew not from what Country, or how thsf 
came to make an Excurfion fuch an unufiial Length. 

About an Hour after they made a Motion to attack us a^n. 
and rode round our little Wood, to fee where 4!Mh they might 
break ixi} butfinding us always ready to face them,they went off 
again, and we reioR'd not toftir from the Place for that Night. 
We flept little, you may be fure, but fpent the moH: Part 
of the Night in flrcngthening our Situation, and barricado- 
ing the Entrances into the Wood, and keeping a ftriS 
Watch, we waited for Day-L^ht, and when it came, it 
gave us a very unwelcome Difcovery indeed, i for the Ead- 
mj, who we thought were difcourag'd with the Rcccp- , 
fion they had nnet with, were now encreas'd to no kfstlm 
three hundred, and had ict up efcvcn w twelve Huts and 
Tents, as if they we refplv*a to bcfiege us j and this Rttlc 
Carhp they had pitch'd, was upon the open Plain, at about 
ti^•ee Charters of a Mile from us. We were inde^ kxprit^d 
at thisDifcovery ; and nowlconfefi, I gave my fclf over 
for loft, and all that 1 had; TheLofs of mv B&£ksdid not 
lieib near me, (tho* they were vtry cm^dtarAbk) as the Thoughts 
of fafliiig Into the mnds erf" iuch Bnr^rmm, at the latter

The young Lord, as gallant aseverFlefli {hew*d it fclf, 
wjis for nghting to the lail al&i and my old Pilot was of 
the Opiriion we weie able to refifl thcni all, in the 'Situa-

found that the Number of our Eaemies ftiU eiicreas*d, per- 
haps a§ they were abroad in feveral Parties for Prey i the 
€rft had fent out Scouts to call for Help, and to accjuamt 
them of the Booty, and we did not know, butby the Morn* 
ing they might itillbe ^ greater Number j fo I began to ca- 
^uire of thole People we hod brought from TMski, if there 
was no other, or more private Ways by which we might a- 
void them In the Night, md perhaps either retreat tofomc 
Towh, or get ^eip to guard us over the Deiart. 

Tv.v.Sjkrian, who Was Servant to the young Lord, told 
u^, if we defign'd to avoid them and not fight, he would 
engage to carry uS off in the Night, to a Way that went 
Noith towards the River Petraz, by which he made no 
-caeilion, but we might get away^nd the Tartars never the wi- 
(cr j but he faid, his Lofd had told him, he would not return but 
would rather chufc to fight : I told him, he miflook his Loi3> 
for that he wastoowiS a Man to love fighting for the {ake 
of it i that I knew his Lord was brave enough by what, lie 
had fl,ew*d already j but that his Lord knew better, than 
to dclire to have feventeen or eighteen Men fight five hun^ 
dred, udefs an unavoidable Neceulty forcM them to iti and 
that if he thought it poffible for us to efcape in the Night, 
we had nothing elfe to do but to attempt it : He anfwer^d. 
If his Lord gave him fiich Orders, he would lofe liis Life 
if he did not perform it j we foon brought his Lord to 
give that OrdeH tho' privately, and we iipme;dlately pre- 
par'd for the putting it in Pra^icc. 

hvco firft, as foon as it began to be dark,, we kindled a 
Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burning, and pre- 
pared & as to make it burn all Night, that the T/!frf;«rj might 
concliide we were ftiil there 5 but as foon as it was dark, 
(that is to ^f) fb as we couM iee the Stars (for our Gukic 
would not ftir before) having all our fiorfes and Camels 
ready loadcri, we followed our new Guide, who, I 'foon 
founds dkr'd htefelf hf the Pole, or NortK Star, ail the 
Country beli^gleveifcH' a !bi% Way. 

AFtfeRi^e had travelled ti^d "tlckirs very hard, it be^an 
to be lighter ft2i, not that it was quite dark all Night, but 
the Moonbe^nto fife, lb that in fliort, it was rather light- 
er than we wifh'ditto be^ but by fix a-Clock next Morn- 
ing we were gotten near forty Miles, tho* the Truth is, 
we amioft fpoild our Horfes : Here we found a Ruffian 
Village named Kirmaunskoy, where we refted, and heard 
hothmgof the CdmuckTartars that Days about two Hours 

before 



'{ ^S } 

before Kight we fet out again, and tr^vell'd till eight, the 
:r.ext Morning, tlio* riot <Juite & haftily as before, and about 
feven a-ClocK we pafs'd a Httk kiver call'd Jsh-tza, and 
came to a good large Town inhabited by Kuffram, and very 
pdpuldus, cSiW'd Ozomo^s, there we heard that ievcral Troops 
or Hoords of Calmncks had been abroad upon the Defart, 
but that we were now compleatly out of Danger of them, 
which was to our great Satisfadt ion you may beflirc : Here 
we were obiig'dto get fbme freHi Horfes, and haying need 
enough of Reft, we ilaid five Days ; and my Partner and 
i agreed to give the honef! Syherian, who brought us thi- 
ther, the Value of ten Pifloles, for Iiis condu<Si;ing us. 

In Bv€ Days more we came to Veupma, upon the River 
WitzogJa, which running into the Dwina^ we were there 
very happily near the End of our Travels by Land, that 
River being navigable in feven Days Paflage to Arch-Angel: 
From hence we came to Lawrenskoy, where the River 
joins, the 3d of yuly, and provided our Cclves vvith two 
Luggage ^af s, and a Barge fpr our Convenience^ we cm- 
bark'd the 7th> and arrived allfafe at Arch-AngH the iSth, 
liaving been a Year, five Months and three Days on the 
Journey, including our Stay of eight Months and odd 
Days at ToboUki. 

W E were obliged to ftay at this Place fix Weeks for the 
An ival of the Ships, and mi^ft h^e tarry 'd longer, had not- 
a Hamhtirgher come in above a Month fboner than any of 
the EngliJJj Ships; when after fbme Confideration, that the 
City of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a Market 
for our Goods as Londmy we all took Freight with him, 
and having put our Goods on board, it was moft natural 
for me to put my Steward on board to take care of them, 
by which means myjoung LoM had a Sufficient Oppor- 
tutunity to conceal .fcmfHf, never coraag on Shore again 
in all the Tin^ wc jftaid there i aad tktj he did^ that ha 
might not befcea k th& (^ttj, whex^{^^ oi^Mufionf

We r^'d^om Ar£i^i4m^i the zoth fame 

Year, and aftet no jO^swrdinaryJW V^ in the 

jElbe the 13 th ofSepemi^: Here mylKrtner and I found 
a very good Sale for our Goods, as well thofe of Chma, as 
the Sables, (^c. of Syberia ; and dividing the Produce of 
our EfiTedts, my Share amouted to 3475"*. ^7 s. 3 </. not-

up the ElSey m orScr to go to the Court of Viema, whwc 
he reiblv'd to ieek Protedrion, and where he could cor-

done him, ana his Sen/cc of my Kkdnefs to the Prince

To comrlude, having ftaid near four Months in Ham^

I embark'd in the Paoquetj and arrived in Lmdrnt the loth 
of Jmuary^ ^l^fi Slaving been gone from England ten 
Years and nine Months.
