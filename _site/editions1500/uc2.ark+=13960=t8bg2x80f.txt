 INTRODUCTION 
 
 I THE TEXT 
 
 Nothing need here be said about the merit of the Robinson story. 
 The fact that it has fascinated and still is fascinating generations, 
 proves its intrinsic worth. It is owing to its deep and perennial in- 
 terest that an attempt is here made to use it as a means of instruction. 
 It is here attempted to bring within the focus of this interest the 
 language or expressive skill and to some extent the manual work in 
 the school — to use it as a content to be expressed in these different 
 ways. The purpose is to furnish a content not only rich and worth 
 while in itself but to use it for the purpose of getting skill in all oral 
 and written language, illustration, and the manual arts. 
 
 The text here given is a very free adaptation of the original story. 
 The main departure is that Robinson gets nothing from the wrecked 
 ship. It is years afterward that he obtains tools from another ship 
 wrecked off the island. Incidents have been added and departures 
 made wherever it was thought best to do so. Robinson, in the adapted 
 version, lived in New York. This gives the story a more familiar air 
 and adapts it better to primary work. Indeed any other city could 
 as well be used. For Chicago children he could better perhaps be 
 placed in that city. In this way the normal direction of education 
 instruction would be conserved. 
 
 The idea of such an adapted Robinson Crusoe was first obtained 
 from a German version of the story by William Rein. A translation 
 was made of this version and used for some years in Chicago. This 
 version may be considered as the starting point for the present one. 
 It has been almost entirely rewritten, however, as it was meagre in 
 detail, inaccurate, and unsatisfactory in many other respects. This 
 rewriting has been done with especial reference to accurate details of 
 the animal and plant life of the island which Defoe undoubtedly had 
 in mind when he wrote the immortal story, and to invention and

 evolution in the several industrial arts and pursuits. The ethical and 
 social values have also been emphasized. 
 
 II THE VARIOUS VALUES 
 
 On the informing side the Robinson has been considered as pos- 
 sessing a threefold value, (i) It has value as nature-study and 
 geographical material. (2) As a social-industrial history. (3) 
 As a medium of ethical instruction. 
 
 (i) Its Nature Stxtdy Value. The very best way to study 
 nature is of course to give opportunity for actual sensuous contact on 
 the part of the learner. But if our knowledge of the world were con- 
 fined to such actual sensuous contact it would include a very small 
 number of objects of which we really have intelligent comprehension. 
 Most of our knowledge-objects belong to the Universe of Discourse 
 rather than to the Universe of things material. Education is and 
 must be always an introduction into the Universe of Discourse. It 
 is granted that his progress therein and its value to the child depends 
 upon the range of his actual sensuous contact, or the breadth of his 
 direct experience. If the learner has a fair measure of direct experi- 
 ence or interpretive material, his knowledge, secondary it may be, 
 may be built out in all directions. He may be introduced into the 
 world of words and make progress therein under skillful teaching. 
 It is a matter of widening the range of concepts by the inclusion of 
 new material under them in the form of symbols or words. Good 
 ft,> teaching will of course always keep well within the child's range of 
 '" interpretive material. It will not advance faster than the rate at 
 
 which the old meanings can assimilate the new. 
 
 Skillful instruction will always use whatever objects there are at 
 hand to aid in forming adequate ideas. Pictures are invaluable aids. 
 Careful planning will get together illustrative materials. Zoological 
 and anthropological exhibits are available in Museums. 
 
 Thus it is possible to start with the child's present stock of direct 
 experience and gradually go out to the more and more remote. Each 
 step taken should be used as an instrument for further advance. 
 
 The Robinson is rich in nature study suggestions; plants, animals 
 and materials of a new world and remote zone are presented radiant 
 with the interest reflected from the hero of the tale. 
 (2) The Robinson as Industrial History. The version here
 
 INTRODUCTION 9 
 
 presented aims to be an epitomized industrial history. Robinson 
 begins with nothing but his hands and at length wins from inhospi- 
 table nature food and shelter, clothing and comforts. In doing this 
 he reinvents the appliances of primitive industry and makes a begin- 
 ning in each industrial art. In his struggle, experimenting, failures 
 and successes, racial history is recapitulated and the arduous path of 
 progress revealed. 
 
 Much is said now-a-days about making the school an ideal social 
 community. It is contended that it should reproduce or stand for 
 the highest projection of the social ideal. The school should be a 
 real living, not a make believe. But how can the school be the ideal 
 social unit or group unless the relative values and worth of social 
 activities be maintained in the school. How can a real social life be 
 maintained within it unless it is centered in the real social way? On 
 this view it is clear, that the school should be centered around those 
 social functions that arc the center and core of the community life. 
 
 It will be readily agreed that the industrial arts in the social life are 
 the most fundamental. They are, largely at least, the bonds that hold 
 society together. Society is a superstructure built upon them. 
 
 Every member of society has some relation to these fundamental 
 activities. A large majority of citizens is actually engaged in them. 
 But so far has the division of labor gone that the industries have lost 
 sight of their mutual interdependence. The workers in one field do 
 not see the real imjxirtance of their specialty in relation to the whole. 
 And thus labor loses the sustaining power of social and emotional 
 reactions. As the isolation of the different occupations increases, the 
 more marked is the loss of sympathy and solidarity that are so essen- 
 tial to the social welfare. 
 
 Now from this standpoint education may be defined as the bringing 
 the child into complete and sympathetic understanding of all the 
 parts of our complex social life. As the years of maturity come, the 
 sense of the unity of the whole should strengthen. The social, ethical 
 and aesthetic values that come from a wide outlook and broad sym- 
 pathies should uplift and ennoble the worker in whatever field, c^ Each 
 must be brought into a sympathetic participation of all difficulties, 
 hardships and pleasures of all the groups and divisions of the social 
 organization. 
 
 But at the outset the school meets with almost insuperable ob- 
 stacles in any attempt to realize such an end. 
 
 The first difficulty is the complex nature of the social life taken at
 
 lo INTRODUCTION 
 
 its present level of development. So far has the separate occupa- 
 tions diverged that they seem at casual view to run parallel — to be 
 independent. So that the whole of which they are the parts, is ob- 
 scured. Among so many apparently isolated parts, no unity can be 
 found. Over against this specialized content we have the weak, 
 unorganized powers of comprehension of the child. This is the 
 first problem. 
 
 The second difficulty is that such an emotional or sympathetic 
 attitude toward the elements of the social life cannot be given by 
 formal instruction. It may do something but not much. The 
 difficulties of each must be real problems to the child before he can 
 have any real valuable social experience — before he can feel 
 really the meaning of the different social situations. We have not 
 here an intellectual problem wholly, but an emotional or ethical one 
 as well. A mere contemplative knowledge of social affairs, however 
 broad and complete, will not fill the requirements of the end set up. 
 This knowledge must have emotional reaction. The efficient social 
 factor is active as well as contemplative. Social problems are to him 
 something more than problems of the intellect. 
 
 These are the difficulties. How may they be overcome? It is 
 plain that to begin with a cross section of the intricate network of the 
 social life at its present level as a content and attempt to comprehend 
 it as a whole and in its manifold relations, is a task far beyond the 
 feeble grasp of the child. Equally hopeless would be the attempt, 
 to start with any special factor of the industrial life. Wherever one 
 might penetrate, one would find parts and ends of the industrial 
 processes whose unraveling and reconstruction would be just so far 
 beyond the child. 
 
 The solution of this difficulty is not far to seek. A cross section 
 of the social life must be taken farther down in the stream of develop- 
 ment at a point of departure where the divergence has hardly begun 
 and where the mutual interrelation and interdependence is manifest 
 because of the simplified form. That is, the presentation must be 
 historical. From crude undifferentiated beginnings the various occu- 
 pations have emerged into an apparent freedom or independence. 
 Go back far enough and we find them all contained within the circle 
 of the simplest living. To start at this level, get a grasp of the 
 various lines and follow them into greater and greater divergence and 
 freedom will not necessarily mean to lose sight of their interconnec- 
 tion and functional unity. So much for the intellectual problem.
 
 INTRODUCTION 1 1 
 
 The solution of the emotional problem seems to lie in the direction 
 of making the difliculties attending the social advance from crude 
 beginning to specialization of function, real ones for the child — at 
 the same time emphasizing the importance of the solution of the prob- 
 lem in its relation to further advance. This participation by the 
 child in the social life must be an active one. He must actually meet 
 and solve the difficulties as they arise if he is to get social experience 
 and the proper emotional reaction. Of course, at no time does the 
 child lose sight of his own identity or the fact of his looking down 
 from a greater social height. 
 
 There is then both sociological and physiological warrant for 
 interrelating the industrial arts with a historical content which shall 
 put them in their relation to human advance and advancement and 
 shall make them a means of wider social view and deeper social 
 feelings. 
 
 It is just this aspect of the present Robinson that will commend 
 itself to thoughtful teachers. It is a social study. It is a study 
 in the social life in its simpler primitive form. It is a cross section 
 of life back in its crude beginning. Each occupation and invention 
 is seen with reference to human need and in its relation to the whole. 
 It is seen how each trade grows out of a need, what has been its 
 struggles and problems and triumphs. 
 
 Such a content affords opportunity to present the industrial hand 
 works as problems of satisfying desires, whose solutions are of the 
 utmost importance and value. Thus a motive and setting is given 
 to each step forward. 
 
 Even if the reinvention of primitive tools and weapons cannot be 
 completely carried out, yet the industries are seen in their proper and 
 ethical relationship to the community life. 
 
 Little opportunity is given for work in the thin woods. This 
 comes from the nature of the case. Industries using the less resisting 
 mediums first developed, such as basketry, clay moulding, pottery, 
 spinning and weaving. These handworks all will admit are best 
 suited to the primary grades. These occupations are best presented 
 as problems, the solution of which involves the invention or improve- 
 ment of the tools or implements used. 
 
 (3) The Robinson as Ethical. Nothing is so evident as the 
 fact that our schools are not performing their full social function and 
 duty in the way of moral training; in so far as this is a matter of 
 conscious instruction in the results of different lines of conduct and
 
 12 INTRODUCTION 
 
 in so far as it is a matter of giving opportunity for exercise of moral 
 judgment in concrete cases. 
 
 The Robinson aims to depict the consequence of a certain typical 
 kind of juvenile conduct. It finds Robinson in a loving home with 
 every comfort. His parents are kind to indulgence. Nevertheless 
 Robinson develops waywardness. He becomes a truant. Despite 
 all correction and advice, he continues his wayward course of action. 
 He becomes idle. He cannot apply himself to serious affairs. He 
 breaks off his home ties and seeks freedom from parental restraint 
 on board ship. His subsequent troubles are a direct consequence of 
 his misdeeds at home, the direct result of idleness, disobedience and 
 evil companions. He is thrown into a situation where he must either 
 work or starve. Through pressure of his needs Robinson gradually 
 acquires industrious habits. Though lacking in all kinds of skill 
 from having neglected his schooling, he gradually acquires ability to 
 cope with the most discouraging circumstances with inferior tools 
 and implements. 
 
 Having been selfish and neglectful of his home and opportunities 
 Robinson suffers the penalty of being deprived of the companionship 
 of his kind, and opportunity for satisfying the ordinary ambitions and 
 aspirations. Hardships, however, are corrective. They not only 
 make him industrious but soften his heart and fill him with anguish 
 and remorse for his past wasted youth. He becomes thoughtful and 
 kind to all living creatures. He knows now the value of all sentient 
 comradeship. Life to him becomes sacred. Having been deprived 
 of the fellowship of his kind, he feels the value for himself of all 
 moving things, at the same time he instinctively recognizes the in- 
 herent right of each thing to its own life and way of living. He is the 
 friend and benefactor of animals and treats with kindness even 
 savages that are entirely in his power. 
 
 After atoning for his early sins, by becoming an industrious, 
 thoughtful, kind, sympathetic, useful man, he is placed at last back 
 into the comforts and values of countrymen and home. Thus the 
 story furnish us a complete dramatic cycle. A home and a place in 
 society is lost through idleness and regained through industry. The 
 story is thus a typical ethical situation. It affords abundant oppor- 
 tunity for the exercise of the ethical judgment in concrete cases. 
 Character is not much affected by wise ethical saws. The moral 
 judgment fashions habits of conduct only by use in ethical 
 situations.
 
 INTRODUCTION 13 
 
 With children the need is not so much to learn precepts as to 
 actually make and give ethical judgment upon conduct. Instruction 
 that consciously enforces the moral aspect of every action will also 
 miss its end if such aspect is forced and thrust to the front. With 
 children the dramatic element occupies the center of interest. Other 
 aspects borrow interest from this. So that the moral of a tale con- 
 sciously and openly enforced is instructive energy misapplied. 
 
 The ethical value of the Robinson is one of its strongest appeals 
 to good teaching. It will fill a very evident lack in our instruction. 
 It furnishes an excellent ethical content and cannot fail to be hailed 
 with delight by the judicious teacher. 
 
 The suggestive questions are all fashioned on the plan of giving 
 opportunity for moral judgment on part of the child. It is not the 
 plan to consciously enforce a moral. That may well be left to take 
 care of itself as the story proceeds. 
 
 Ill THE ROBINSON AS A MEANS OF GETTING LIN- 
 GUISTIC AND EXPRESSIVE SKILLS 
 
 But the content value of the Robinson is but half its worth. Infor- 
 mation as such in school or elsewhere, avails nothing. Unless infor- 
 mation works out into skill it is mere lumber and a waste of time. 
 Each particular content has its skill side. Unless the teaching brings 
 out this skill through the medium of the content, it is poor teaching, or 
 not teaching at all. In telling a story and leaving to chance whether 
 it is used in obtaining linguistic or other skills, teaching is losing 
 its most pregnant opfxirtunity. For with primary children all skills 
 should come indirectly, as the expression of a content suited to the 
 demands of their stage of development. 
 
 The problems of skill or technique may be centered around the 
 discussion of the question! Should there be formal exercises from 
 the first years of school life whose end is skill without reference 
 to the purpose, need or interest that controls the child in such ex- 
 ercises? Or should skill wait upon and grow out of activity, which 
 is the expression of the pupil's ovm present needs or purposes? 
 
 In all controversy over this problem there is either implicit or 
 explicit recognition of two factors or aspects involved in adult effi- 
 ciency. One is that side or elficiency shown in the mere mechanical 
 ability to perfonn acts skillfully, such as a skillful copyist shows.
 
 14 INTRODUCTION 
 
 The other factor is that side or aspect of efficiency which is more 
 than skill in this sense, to which attaches moral worth, initiative 
 independence, individuality — in short, intelligent will. 
 
 These two factors being aspects of all efficiency, must be factors 
 in the educational process that makes for efficiency. Hence their 
 reaction and relations are of extreme interest. 
 
 On the psychological side, these two factors are referred to when 
 we speak of the idea to be expressed and the expression of it. Dr. 
 Dewey points out here that we have not here a spiritual and physical 
 factor, but the whole matter is a relation between two kinds of images. 
 The idea to be expressed is related to the motor images that express 
 it as end to means. He further says that we have not the idea and 
 its expression, but that the expression, the technique, is a part of the 
 full play of the idea itself. 
 
 These two factors appear then as phases of the concrete fact. 
 Their relation is vital or organic. They are phases of the develop- 
 ment of the volitional act. They are both necessary in the growth of 
 efficiency. The doing (habit skill or technique) reacts upon the 
 image (idea being expressed) makes it more definite; that is, reveals 
 its parts and relations. At the same time this growth in definition 
 of the images makes clear the sequence in means of expression (motor 
 images). 
 
 Now if a separation is made between these two necessary sides 
 of the educational process, before the emergence in consciousness 
 of the value and importance of skill as a means of expression there 
 occurs a break in the educational process which has as a result the 
 following consequences. 
 
 This separation between ideas to be expressed and means of ex- 
 pression (technique) — as in all formal set exercises and drills, before 
 consciousness of their value and relation — cuts oflf interest from the 
 technique side and leaves it without propulsion. The attitude 
 toward it is indifference, repugnance or open rebellion. The in- 
 terest is always in the end as expression of the self. The means get 
 interest from this source. They (the technique) become valuable 
 only because they express the end. Separated from the end or true 
 purpose, such exercises have to substitute some other external 
 motive, such as fear of punishment, rivalry or reward. That is they 
 become really immoral besides largely ineffectual in getting the 
 skill. Skill in any line with children is to be arrived at through 
 interests in content, that is indirectly. The more instruction in-
 
 INTRODUCTION 15 
 
 sists on skill for skill's sake the less there will be obtained except at 
 cost of the idea. 
 
 On the side of the idea a separation of the two, as in formal 
 drills, results in mental stagnation. The image is cut off from 
 normal conditions of growth. There is vagueness, dreaminess, lack 
 of concentration. The real mental life is not connected up with 
 execution. 
 
 The question of technique is one of the questions of most frequent 
 debate among teachers. The older practice was dominated by the 
 dictum "Form first and content afterward." The more recent 
 aphoristic pedagogical imperative is, "Learn to do by doing." We 
 have in these two dicta the whole controversy placed in sharp contrast. 
 In the first there is conscious separation of the image and its 
 expression. The pupil must know how before doing. He must 
 learn to swim before getting into the water. Teaching is a drill, 
 method is a mechanism. The argument that a child cannot do a 
 thing until he knows how, seems irresistible. It is an open ad- 
 mission to the principle, that knowing is prior to the doing and really 
 independent of it. 
 
 The second principle makes knowing dependent on doing. Form 
 or the how must wait on the doing. The pupil must learn to swim 
 without guidance. The extreme of this position looks askance 
 at all directed or required work. 
 
 The problem reduces in its last analysis to the question of priority 
 of knowing and doing. In this abstract form the crux is unsolvable. 
 Any presupposition of a division of conduct into two abstract factors 
 renders the case hopeless. It could never be determined whether 
 knowing precedes doing or doing precedes knowing because they are 
 simply two aspects of one and the same concrete whole of conduct. 
 And as such there can be no question of priority between them as 
 already shovm. They are a whole either for the knowing or the 
 doing. From the psychological side, therefore, they can be no prefer- 
 ence given to either side of the question. 
 
 In fact at the bottom for {pedagogy the problem is not a psychologi- 
 cal one at all but an ethical one. 
 
 In adult life the technique is of such transcendent importance 
 economically, as to overshadow the moral and intellectual aspect of 
 the matter. A livelihood depends upon skill. This may give it 
 such an interest and importance as to compel its pursuit independent 
 of other considerations.
 
 i6 INTRODUCTION 
 
 But with children of school age the ethical aspect of the problem 
 should be prominent. Learn to do by doing, expresses this ethical 
 import. It sees in this procedure, activity working free from fixed 
 motor habits at an age when such fixed habits would operate to im- 
 pede mental and physical growth and hence moral growth. It 
 contemplates a gradual control of muscular co-ordinations as the 
 needs of child's living make them urgent. 
 
 Skill is like happiness; if aimed at directly, we miss it. To get 
 skill we must emphasize the content. To get content systematized, 
 understood, to make it practical and worth while, the technique 
 side must be given opportunity for development. 
 
 (i) Language. The greatest need of the primary school to-day 
 is some positive content or subject-matter of instruction. The 
 popular conception of such a school is that its main function is to 
 teach the young child to read, write, and cipher. That is, that it 
 has to do mainly with the formal aspects of language and numbers. 
 So long as a certain amount of facility is gained in these formal arts, 
 there is little disposition to demand anything more. 
 
 When we consider what the child at the age of six or seven really 
 is; when we consider his love of story, his hunger for the concrete 
 material of knowledge, his deep interest in the widening of his ex- 
 perience — it is evident that such a course is out of all harmony with 
 his real nature. It is the giving of stones when the cry is for bread. 
 It is even worse than the proverbial making of bricks without straw. 
 It is attempting to make bricks with straw alone. 
 
 It will be granted that the mastery of a printed and a written 
 vocabulary is of the utmost importance. As a subordinate end, the 
 ability to interpret the printed page and to express thought in correct 
 form is the most imperative demand upon the school. But these 
 acquirements are not a content in themselves. They are not the 
 material of instruction. In themselves, they do not enlarge the 
 understanding or furnish the food which the young mind hungers 
 for, and must have, if it is maintained in a condition of health. They 
 are mere forms, and the dwelling upon them during the impression- 
 able years of childhood results in a deadening of his interest and 
 dwarfing of his powers, so that the over emphasis of this phase of 
 education to the exclusion of content defeats it ovm ends. 
 
 Laying the foundation for a future character edifice, keeping ac- 
 tive the developing interests, the widening of his experience, the for- 
 mation of interpretative concepts — these are of greater value from
 
 INTRODUCTION 17 
 
 the point of view of language mastery, even of its spoken and written 
 forms, than the persistent drill in its formal elements. 
 
 Language teaching must be approached from the content side 
 if we are to get any genuine interest in the overcoming of difficulties 
 on the part of the child. There is no interest for the child in the 
 language forms themselves when presented in abstraction and em- 
 phasized as such. He may be drilled into proficiency, but the in- 
 terest does not come from the relation of these formal elements to 
 his own needs or activity. The interest has been external and it 
 flags as soon as the external excitement is withdrawn. A genuine 
 interest, and intrinsic one growing out of his own needs and nature, 
 can be fostered only by supplying a subject matter adapted to the 
 various levels of thought through which its development leads him. 
 If this is furnished, it is no partial, intermittent attention that the 
 pupil gives. While dealing with such a content he is not forming 
 the habit of mind-wandering and inattention so frequently seen when 
 children are kept closely to word drill and to reading for elocutionary 
 purposes. 
 
 The early forcing of technique is not a real gain in the child's 
 education, however much may be apparently accomplished. Im- 
 mediate results are not a safe guide for instruction in the primary 
 grades. They are, many times, a positive loss in time, and are 
 gained at the expense of dwarfing the mental and physical powers. 
 There is no real need of forcing the process of learning to read if the 
 teacher is ready with a subject-matter which the child is already 
 going out to meet. 
 
 What has been said with regard to the relation of reading to a 
 content is equally true with regard to what is known as language 
 teaching. It is a hopeless task to endeavor to give skill in the use 
 of language independent of a content which is not in accord with the 
 pupil's own stage of development. The interest to be genuine, and 
 productive of self-effort, must always be in the content. An en- 
 richment of his vocabulary, a proper use of words, correct form of 
 oral and written speech must come, not for themselves, but as re- 
 sults of an effort to the adequate expression of something which the 
 pupil is interested to communicate. 
 
 The widespread criticism directed against the results of language 
 teaching in our schools no doubt has something of justification. This 
 defect does not come from lack of attention to the matter, or from 
 indifference on the part of the teachers, but largely from the over-
 
 i8 INTRODUCTION 
 
 emphasis of the purely formal aspects of language. The matter 
 is approached from the wrong side. In early years, to get form 
 we must emphasize content. In the primary grades, formal insist- 
 ence on correct technique should be at the minimum, while richness 
 and variety of subject-matter should be at the maximum. 
 
 (2) Correlation. There cannot be much question but that 
 the kind of correlating center that the Robinson offers is the only 
 practical one. Such a center or material must or should be one 
 about which both manual and linguistic exercises may without 
 absurd stretching be grouped. The content of such a center must 
 flow out naturally with the various manual and linguistic skills. 
 Such a center is the Robinson. Without violence to its form or 
 content the entire work of the school may be grouped around its 
 fascinating story. It is offered as material to be used, not merely 
 be given as something whose form it is sacrilege to alter. The tell- 
 ing children stories for the purpose of amusing or entertaining them 
 very easily degenerates into imaginational dissipation, and should 
 be indulged in but rarely. 
 
 Certainly the nature study, the social and industrial history with- 
 out which manual art is just one thing more to teach, finds in the 
 Robinson an easy and natural center. It gives to the manual work 
 a setting and connection, makes it understandable, gives it mean- 
 ing. In the light which the story and good teaching throws around 
 it the hand work is not just for the purpose of keeping mischievous 
 hands busy. It is not something else to be taught. It is given vital 
 connection in the life of the school. Each step in advance a prob- 
 lem whose solution throws light on what the child sees going on 
 around him. 
 
 The same may be said for the ethical aspect. Ethical teaching 
 flows out of the content without any far fetched application. To 
 talk about the conduct of the hero in this light seems easy and natural. 
 To praise or to blame seems the natural attitude to take. The con- 
 tent takes the ethical form as naturally as it takes the social or his- 
 torical. In any case, there can be no question but that it is a natural 
 content for the centering of the language arts. The same may be 
 said for drawing and illustrating. 
 
 These activities are usually cut oflF from all setting that lends in- 
 terest or shows value. Drawing is simply something else to learn. 
 It is without present meaning. Es Schwebt in der Lujt. It is the 
 most difficult thing in the world to get continuous and develop-
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 19 
 
 mental application to it, just because it is one thing more, without 
 any vital relation to what is already going on. The Robinson gives 
 it such a setting. It borrows interest from the story. It gives some- 
 thing to jxirtray, over which the child lingers fondly. His drawing 
 ceases to be abstract and just because the teacher demands it, and be- 
 comes another and cherished mode of expressing the content of the 
 story. It becomes a mode of expressing the content in many respects 
 superior to language for the child, because the child life is a series 
 of pictures. He has not reached the level where his thought gives 
 on in words for the most part, as with adults. 
 
 For the primary grades the Robinson furnishes an excellent point 
 of departure for hand work. As already said, it places hand work 
 in a setting of meaning. It is not advisable, perhaps, to follow 
 slavishly the order or projects of the texts. In any case the ideal 
 connection, tlie meaning, is there, without which the hand work 
 loses half its value. Nothing is truly informing that does not work 
 out in some kind of skill or technique either linguistic or otherwise, 
 and nothing Is really worth while in skill that does not analyze, 
 systematize, and give form and personal value to content. 
 
 IV SUGGESTIONS 
 
 (i) The story should be told, not read to pupils. The teachers 
 that fail to do this are not living up to their high privileges. The 
 difference between reading and telling it is just the difference be- 
 tween a dry mechanical performance and one instinct with life 
 and expression. It is not meant that the teacher should memorize 
 the words of the text. She should master the details and depend 
 upon inspiration for the form in which it is given. 
 
 This story is divided into short dramatic units. It is not meant 
 that they should be taken as lessons and administered one a day 
 until exhausted. There is abundance of material for a year's 
 work or more. The material is to be used. 
 
 (2) Oral Reproduction. Children should never be required 
 to repeat a portion on once hearing it. Many teachers read a story 
 and then call upon someone to give it back. Such a method misses 
 the aim. With children long drilled in reproduction this might 
 occasionally be done. But for the most part great care should be 
 exercised in familiarizing the children with details until the slowest
 
 20 INTRODUCTION 
 
 is ready to say something. The Germans call this process "deepen- 
 ing" — a good word. This "deepening" may be done in many 
 ways. The teacher at first may not tell the story at all consecutively, 
 but develop it by means of questions, adding parts not guessed out 
 by the children. 
 
 She may tell it on two or three consecutive days. She may tell 
 it and then bring out and enforce details by questioning for two or 
 three days. She should make each object of interest mentioned a 
 subject of conversation, explanation, or a peg on which the chil- 
 dren hang their experiences. 
 
 But when the deepening process has been completed or thought 
 sufficient, the children should be then thrown upon their own re- 
 sources. Each one should tell the portion designated without help 
 from suggestions or questions. 
 
 The exercise should be conducted as any other school recitation. 
 Each child should be called upon as often as possible. Volunteers 
 should not be called for, but each one should be called out as a matter 
 of course. 
 
 If any distinction is made, it should always be the slow child 
 that is called oftener than his more brilliant mate. The tempta- 
 tion is to let the good talker tell the story. This will discourage the 
 poorer talkers. 
 
 When once a child begins his story he should not be interrupted 
 by corrections. Everything should be subordinated to spontaneity 
 and easy flow of language construction. Anything making the 
 child unduly conscious of the means of expression will defeat the 
 end. Many incorrections and speech defects will correct themselves 
 in time. After the child has made his attempt or said all he can, or 
 has been superseded by someone else, corrections can be made on 
 the board or otherwise. 
 
 (3) Preparation. Before telling the new topic, preparation 
 should always be made for it. This is simply good teaching. Be- 
 fore the new is given, the ideas necessary to assimilate it, to under- 
 stand it, or give it meaning should be in the fore of consciousness. 
 There should be an active fringe of related or similar ideas. 
 
 The experience of the children should be gone over carefully 
 to find a familiar point on which to hang the new story. 
 
 Not only this, but each important step should always be put as a 
 problem for the children to work out, either orally or in written 
 fonn.
 
 INTRODUCTION 21 
 
 Many teachers may object to reproduction exercises as not giving 
 scope for originality and invention. Abundant opixjrtunity may be 
 given for original comix)sition if tiic new matter is first placed be- 
 fore the child in the form of a problem to be worked out. 
 
 Indeed all learning is the solution of problems. Skillful teaching 
 will present even history as a series of problems. The beginning 
 of wisdom is the question. The question always locates a problem. 
 
 But in the form of a problem the new part or movement may be 
 anticipated by the children either orally or in writing. In this way 
 opportunity is afforded for originality and invention. 
 
 There is much td commend this practice. In this way the child 
 is active according to his present ability. He is nothing if not im- 
 aginative. His originality and invention should be exercised on 
 this level. 
 
 (4) Written Language. The written work in connection with 
 the Robinson may consist of two kinds as above. After the story 
 is well started those that have not read the story may anticipate what 
 is coming. Or the particular problem involved in the new chapter 
 may be given for a written solution. Children will show great 
 ingenuity in such work. And in many ways this form of written 
 work is superior to reproduction, although reproduction should 
 never be in the words of the story given by the teacher. 
 
 The ante-solution, so to speak, of Robinson's problems in oral or 
 written form should not, however, wholly displace written repro- 
 duction of the story. There will always be pupils that find them- 
 selves better in this form of language exercise than the other. 
 
 It is always wise to have each child keep each part of the story 
 anticipated and reproduced and use them for reading exercises so 
 that motive for the written exercises may be strengthened. Port- 
 folios for this purpose may be easily made. For a number of years 
 the following plan for spelling has been found to bring good results. 
 No formal spelling work in the primary grades is required. At the 
 time or period of written work the teacher gives to it her entire at- 
 tention. When a child wishes to use a word he does not know how 
 to spell he asks the teacher for the spelling. Usually the teacher 
 spells it orally, then writes it on the board, either erasing it quickly, 
 or if an unusual word, allowing it to remain for the information of 
 others. 
 
 Written work in the higher primary grades should take place not 
 more than once or twice a week or after the whole chapter has been
 
 as INTRODUCTION 
 
 thoroughly exhausted in all its other possibilities. The written 
 exercise crowns the work, cements together its various parts, gives 
 it form and portability. 
 
 The suggestions under the heads, "Things to Think and Talk 
 About" and "Problems to Work Out," are mere suggestions. 
 They are intended as examples of the way the story may be utilized 
 as a carrier or medium of school activity — as a center for correlat- 
 ing the work of the day. They are not meant to trench on the 
 legitimate province of the teacher. Her own working over, her own 
 points of stress and of view are always best. Her high privilege it 
 is to be thus self contained. It is not a duty; it is a privilege. The 
 teacher that does not rise to the mastery of her subject matter to the 
 extent of being able to use it as a sculptor uses clay to accomplish 
 her educative purposes is not living up to her h?gh privilege of 
 feeling her work a joy — a high calling rather than a business or 
 drudgery. 
 
 (5) Nature Study. It is not to be supposed that the knowledge 
 of the children unsupplemented by the teacher will be adequate 
 to illuminate all the nature study topics that are suggested. The 
 teacher must prepare himself to explain and describe by pictures, 
 drawings, objects, visits to collections and museums. This work 
 should show itself in the drawings and illustrations. The teacher 
 can test her thoroughness in getting the details of objects and en- 
 vironment into mental circulation by watching the drawings and 
 illustrations by the children. Robinson goes out from tolerably 
 familiar surroundings of the temperate zone and in all excursions 
 that the instruction takes it should go out from this familiar environ- 
 ment and come back to it so that instruction may always keep foot- 
 ing within the child's experience. The remote should be illumined 
 by the near and familiar. Patiently a fair idea of a tropical en- 
 vironment and climate should be built up with considerable detail 
 of typical trees, vines, insects, shrubs, flowers, animals, birds, and 
 weather. In doing this the usual province of nature study vv^ill of 
 course be somewhat transcended and the instruction will be geo- 
 graphical in its nature rather. Indeed, as a preparation for formal 
 geographical and scientific work this side of the story will prove in- 
 valuable. 
 
 (6) The Industrial and Social History. The social and 
 industrial history will probably be the most diflficult to handle. It 
 is here that most teachers need especial preparation. But the
 
 INTRODUCTION 23 
 
 means of becoming well infonncd on these points are easily at hand. 
 Frederick Starr's "First Steps in Human Progress," in Joly's 
 "Man Before Metals" and "Evolution in Art," by C. Haddon, will 
 be found to contain all the information needed along the line of the 
 history of invention, manners and customs of savage and primitive 
 peoples. Children usually know something about Indians and 
 Eskimo life and this should be used as a point of departure for under- 
 standing savage and primitive people. The extent to which this 
 line of work should be carried would depend entirely upon the age 
 and ability of the class. In third and fourth grades it could be 
 made a considerable feature. In any case its point of departure 
 should be the present and its return to the same point. 
 
 (7) Ethical Treatment. In the suggestions for ethical treat- 
 ment the aim has been to give opportunity for children to give their 
 own judgment on alternative courses of conduct. This is far 
 different from consciously enforcing a moral. Children are very 
 quick to respond to ethical situations in simple cases. In many 
 cases, however, the fault disapproved or the virtue extolled can be 
 used to emphasize some particular remissness in some members 
 of the class. 
 
 (8) Drawing. The means of expression called drawing falls 
 into three parts, as a school discipline. Object drawing, illustrative 
 drawing, and design. Illustrative drawing or pictorial representa- 
 tion seems to come first in development. The drav/ing of an ob- 
 ject was made not for the purpose of making an exact copy, but for 
 the purpose of using it for the end in view. So long as the draw- 
 ing answered this purpose that was all that was required. Accuracy 
 of representation was never an end. It is likewise with the child. 
 Accuracy of drawing is not the end aimed at, but the delineation of 
 some event or happening. It is a movement, not a detail, that the 
 child is interested in portraying. For this reason illustrative 
 drawing may well serve as the starting point. The teacher can get 
 accuracy and detail in the objects portrayed best by borrowing 
 interest from the larger whole in which the child is interested. 
 When Robinson gets the dog from the ship is the time to make 
 dogs the special topic of the formal drawing lesson. When it is 
 cocoanut trees with which the young artist wants to characterize 
 his tropical landscape, that is the time to study to draw cocoa palm 
 trees. The child's ability to illustrate truly and characteristically 
 the scenes and incidents of the story in free or undirected occasions
 
 34 INTRODUCTION 
 
 is a good measure of the success, not only of the formal drawing 
 lesson but of the nature-study work as well. 
 
 Object drawing is for the pictorial or illustrative work and apart 
 from it has little meaning or attraction for primary children. Points 
 of technique should be taken up in formal lessons, as need for them 
 is felt by the learner. Gradual progress should be made toward 
 more and more typical and characteristic detail in illustrative 
 compositions. 
 
 The merely aesthetic is not felt as a propulsion toward delinea- 
 tion at early stages. Figures, animal and human life, types of 
 vegetation should be emphasized rather than mere landscape 
 effects. Both teachers and pupils show a tendency to avoid the 
 human figure in the later primary grades. 
 
 A stereotyped Robinson that does not change from the beginning 
 to the end of the story should be avoided. The drawing of Robin- 
 son should respond strictly to each change of dress noted.

 ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 I 
 
 ROBINSON WITH HIS PARENTS 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 We are going to hear the story of a boy who did not love school 
 and wished to go away on the ocean in a ship. The story tells how 
 he finally ran away from home and was ship-wrecked on an island, 
 where he remained alone for many years. Where were the ships 
 that you have seen? Did they go to a strange country? In what 
 country would you find many wild animals and black men? Do 
 you know any boy that does not go to school ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 There once lived in the city of New York, a boy by the 
 name of Robinson Crusoe. He had a pleasant home. 
 His father and mother were kind to him and sent him to 
 school. They hoped that he would study hard and grow 
 up to be a wise and useful man, but he loved rather to 
 run idle about the street than to go to school. He was 
 fond of playing along the River Hudson, for he there saw 
 the great ships come and go. They were as big as houses. 
 
 25
 
 a6 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 He watched them load and unload their cargoes and hun- 
 dreds of people get off and on. His father had told him 
 that the ships came from far distant lands, where lived 
 many large animals and black men. His father told him 
 too, that in these faraway countries the nuts on the trees 
 grew to be as large as one's head and that the trees were 
 as high as church steeples. 
 
 When Robinson saw the ships put out to sea, he would 
 watch them till they would disappear below the horizon 
 far out in the ocean and think, "Oh, if I could only go 
 with them far away to see those strange countries!" 
 Thus he would linger along the great river and wish he 
 might find an opportunity of making a voyage. Often 
 it would be dark before he would get home. When 
 he came into the house his mother would meet him 
 and say in a gentle voice, "Why, Robinson, how late you 
 are in getting home! You have been to the river again." 
 
 Then Robinson would hang his head and feel deeply 
 ashamed, and when his father, who was a merchant, 
 came home from the store, his mother would tell him 
 that Robinson had again been truant. 
 
 This would grieve his father deeply and he would go to 
 the boy's bedside and talk earnestly with him. "Why 
 do you do so?" he would say. "How often have I told 
 you to go to school every day?" This would for a time 
 win Robinson back to school, but by the next week it had 
 been forgotten and he would again be loitering along 
 the river in spite of his father's remonstrances.

 ROBINSON AS AN APPRENTICE 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Do you know what an apprentice is ? How do men earn money ? 
 How do boys learn trades? Do you know anyone having a trade? 
 What trade would you like to follow when you grow up? How many 
 trades can you name? Does one have to learn store-keeping? 
 Everyone should learn to do some useful thing. What trade do you 
 think Robinson best fitted for? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 In this way one year after another slipped by. Robin- 
 son was not more diligent. He was now almost sixteen 
 years old and had not learned anything. Then came his 
 birthday. In the afternoon his father called him into his 
 room. Robinson opened the door softly. There sat 
 his father with a sad face. He looked up and said, "Well, 
 Robinson, all your schoolmates have long been busy try- 
 ing to learn something, so that they may be able to earn 
 their own living. Paul will be a baker, Robert a butcher, 
 Martin is learning to be a carpenter, Herman a tailor, 
 Otto a blacksmith, Fritz is going to high school, because 
 he is going to be a teacher. Now, you are still doing 
 nothing. This will not do. From this time on I wish 
 you to think of becoming a merchant. In the morning 
 28
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 29 
 
 you will go with mc to the store and begin work. If you 
 are attentive and skillful, when the time comes you can 
 take up my business and carry it on. But if you remain 
 careless and continue to idle about, no one will ever want 
 you and you must starve because you will never be able 
 to earn a living." 
 
 So the next morning Robinson went to the store and be- 
 gan work. He wrapped up sugar and coffee, he weighed 
 out rice and beans. He sold meal and salt, and when the 
 dray wagon pulled up at the store, loaded with new goods, 
 he sprang out quickly and helped to unload it. He 
 carried in sacks of flour and chests of tea, and rolled in 
 barrels of coffee and molasses. He also worked some at 
 the desk. He looked into the account books and saw 
 in neat writing, "Goods received" and ''Goods sold." 
 He noticed how his father wrote letters and reckoned 
 up his accounts. He even took his pen in hand and put 
 the addresses on the letters and packages as well as he 
 could. 
 
 But soon he was back in his careless habits. He was 
 no longer attentive to business. He wrapped up salt in- 
 stead of sugar. He put false weights on the scales. He 
 gave some too much and others too little. His hands 
 were in the business only, his mind was far away on the 
 ocean with the ships. When he helped unload the 
 wagons, he would often let the chests and casks drop, so 
 that they were broken and their contents would run out 
 on the ground. For he was always thinking, "Where 
 have these casks come from and how beautiful it must be 
 there!" And many times packages came back because 
 Robinson had written the name of the place or the county 
 wrong. For when he was writing the address, he was 
 always thinking, "You will be laid upon a wagon and will
 
 30 
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 then go into the ship." One day he had to write a letter 
 to a man far over the sea. He could stand it no longer. 
 His father had gone out. He threw down the pen, picked 
 up his hat and ran out to the Hudson to see the ships, 
 and from that time on he spent more time loitering along 
 the river than he did in the store. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (o) Sugar, coffee, rice, when and how grown ? Trace them from 
 plantation to Robinson's store. Tea — where does it come from ? 
 
 (b) Industries and Trades. How each works for each. Trades 
 known to children. 
 
 (c) Why couldn't Robinson go to High school? Did he have 
 education enough to make a good business man ? Why was he care- 
 less and forgetful ? Could he have made a great merchant like his 
 father? Did Robinson's parents love him?

 you think he became better and mended his bad habits ? What is 
 likely to happen to a boy such as Robinson ? Tell what you think he 
 did and what happened to him. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson's father soon noticed that his son was no 
 longer attending to his work, and one morning sent for 
 him to come to his ofiEice, When Robinson came in his 
 father arose from his chair and looked him long and 
 earnestly in the face. Then he said, "I am very sorry, 
 Robinson, that you seem determined to continue your 
 evil ways. If you do not do better you will grow up to be 
 a beggar or worse. Robinson cast his eyes down and said, 
 "I do not want to be a merchant, I would rather sail in a 
 ship around the world." His father answered, "If you 
 do not know anything you cannot be of use on a ship, and 
 no one will want you. In a strange land you cannot live 
 without working. If you run away from your parents 
 you will come to be sorry for it." Robinson wept, for 
 he saw that his father was right, and he promised to obey. 
 
 After two or three weeks, Robinson went to his mother 
 and said, "Mother, won't you go to father and tell him 
 32
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 33 
 
 that if he will only let me take one voyage and it proves 
 to be unpleasant, I will come back to the store and work 
 hard?" But the mother cried. With tears in her eyes, 
 she said: "Robinson, your brothers are both dead. You 
 are the only child left to us and if you go away, wc shall 
 be entirely alone. How easy it would be to be drowned 
 in the sea, or torn to pieces by wild animals away there 
 in a foreign country. Both your father and myself are 
 getting along in years and who will take care of us when 
 we are sick? Do not cause us the grief we must suffer 
 if you go away so far amid so many dangers. I cannot 
 bear to have you speak of it again." 
 
 Robinson did not speak of it again, but he did not for- 
 get it. He was now nineteen years old. It was one day 
 in August that Robinson stood at the wharf looking 
 longingly after the departing ships. As he stood there, 
 someone touched him on the shoulder. It was a ship 
 captain's son. He pointed to a long ship and said, "My 
 father sails to-day in that ship for Africa and takes me 
 with him." "O, if I could only go with you!" cried 
 Robinson. " Do come along," cried his comrade. "But 
 I have no money," said Robinson. "That doesn't 
 make any difference," returned the captain's son. "We 
 will take you anyway." Robinson, without thinking for 
 a moment, gave his friend his hand and promised to go 
 with him. 
 
 So without saying " Good-bye" to his parents, Robinson 
 went immediately on board the ship with his friend. This 
 happened on the loth of August.

 ROBINSON FAR FROM HOME 
 
 ROBINSON'S VOYAGE 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What happened on the ship ? The children talk about the manner 
 of his departure, of what he could have seen and heard, the farewells, 
 the commands and numerous possibilities of the outcome. What 
 happened to Robinson ? Where did he go ? What dangers are there 
 on the ocean ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Once on board, Robinson watched the preparations 
 for departure. At command the sailors clambered up 
 into the rigging and loosened the sails. Then the cap- 
 tain from his bridge called out, "Hoist the anchor!" 
 Then the great iron hooks that held the ship fast were 
 lifted up, a cannon sounded a final farewell. Robinson 
 stood on the deck. He saw the great city shimmer in the 
 sunshine before him. Very fast now the land was being 
 left behind. It was not long until all that could be seen 
 of his native city was the tops of the highest towers. Then 
 all faded from sight. Behind, in front, right and left, he 
 saw nothing but waters. 
 
 He became a little afraid. At noon there arose a strong 
 wind and the ship rocked to and fro. He became dizzy 
 36
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 37 
 
 and had to hold fast to something. The masts and rigging 
 began to dance. It seemed to him as if all was turning 
 around. Suddenly he fell full length on the deck and it 
 was impossible for him to get up. He was seasick. He 
 wailed and cried, but no one heard him, no one helped 
 him. Then he thought of his home, his parents whom 
 he had so ungratefully left. 
 
 He had been on the water about two weeks, when one 
 day as he lay in his room, Robinson heard people over his 
 head running about and crying, "A storm is coming!" 
 The ship's sides trembled and creaked. The ship was 
 tossed like a nutshell. Now it rolled to the right, now 
 to the left. And Robinson was thrown from one side to 
 the other. Every moment he expected the ship to sink. 
 He turned pale and trembled with fear. "Ah, if I were 
 only at home with my parents, safe on the land," he said. 
 "If I ever get safe out of this, I will go home as quickly 
 as I can and stay with my dear parents!" The storm 
 raged the whole day and the whole night. But on the 
 next morning the wind went down and the sea was calm. 
 By evening the sky was clear and Robinson was again 
 cheerful. He ran about the ship. He looked at the

 (b) Getting ship ready. Sailors, rigging, swelling of the sails, 
 cannon shot, storms. 
 
 (c) The relatives and friends gather at the wharf to see one of 
 their number depart. They wave their handkerchiefs, etc. Did 
 any one come down to see Robinson off? Why? What did Robin- 
 son's parents do when he did not come home ? Did he know whether 
 he would ever see his parents again ? Had he entirely forgotten his 
 love for his parents? How did Robinson's sickness affect him?

 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 What was the first thing he thought of? He knew then how good 
 his dear mother had been when he was sick at home. He no doubt 
 felt guilty. He felt he had been ungrateful and thoughtless. He 
 promised himself to go back as soon as he could; but as soon as danger 
 was over, how did he feel ? Did his good resolutions last?

 THE SHIPWRECK 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What further happened to Robinson on the ship? The children 
 tell what might happen to Robinson. May have arrived in Africa, 
 South America. Perhaps he has again thought of the promise. 
 Perhaps strong wind has blown again. A storm? What is that? 
 What can happen to a ship when it is driven by a storm near a 
 rocky coast? Is it safer near or far from land in a storm? What 
 becomes of the people on a ship that strikes a rock? Tell about 
 a wreck of Robinson's ship and how he was saved. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Several weeks went by. Robinson haxi forgotten his 
 resolutions to return home long ago. It was very hot. 
 The glowing sun beat down upon the ship. The wide 
 surface of the sea glistened. No breeze stirred. The 
 sails hung loose on the top of the mast. But far away 
 on the shore could be seen a black bank of clouds. 
 
 All at once the ship was thrown violently to one side 
 by a fierce gust of wind. Robinson threw himself on the 
 deck. The sea began to rise and fall. The waves were 
 as high as mountains. Now the ship was borne aloft to the 
 skies, and now it would seem that it must be over- whelmed 
 in the sea. When it sank down between the great waves 
 of water, Robinson thought it would never again rise. 
 
 39
 
 40 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 The waves beat violently on the ship's side. Robinson 
 went down the steps into his little room, but he came 
 back full of anxiety. He believed every minute he would 
 meet death in the waves. The night at last came on. 
 The lightning flashed. The storm howled. The ship 
 trembled. The water roared. So the night wore on. 
 The storm raged for six days. Then on the seventh day 
 it was somewhat abated. But the hope was soon dashed. 
 The storm had abated but to get new strength. Sud- 
 denly it bore down with frightful power on the doomed 
 vessel, struck it, and shot it like an arrow through the 
 water. Then Robinson felt a fearful crash. The ship 
 groaned as if it would fall into a thousand pieces. It 
 had struck a rock and there held fast. At the same 
 moment the sailors raised the cry, "The ship has sprung 
 a leak!" The water surged into the ship. All called 
 for help. Each one thought only of himself. There 
 was only one boat. The others had all been torn away. 
 It was soon let down into the sea. All sprang in. For 
 a moment the sailors forgot the waves, but all at once a 
 wave, mountains high, struck the boat and swallowed it 
 up. Robinson shut his eyes. The water roared in his 
 ears. He sank into the sea. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Storms at sea, wind, waves, thunder, lightning, shipwreck,

 ROBINSON SAVED 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What has become of Robinson ? Perhaps he was drowned in the 
 sea. Perhaps he was thrown up on the land. Have you seen the 
 shore of the ocean ? Can you tell in what water the storm occurred? 
 Near what continent? Or what zone? What direction did the 
 ship sail ? Tell how Robinson might be saved. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson was borne down far, far into the ocean. He 
 attempted to work himself up, so that he could see light 
 and breathe the air. But again and again the waves 
 carried him down. Finally a wave threw him up and 
 he saw, for a moment, the light of day and got a breath 
 of air, but the next instant he was deep under the water. 
 Then another wave bore him on its crest. He breathed 
 a deep breath and at the same time saw land not far g^ 
 away. He bent all his strength toward reaching the 
 land. He got almost to it, when a wave caught him and 
 hurled him on a jutting rock. With all his strength he 
 seized the rock with both hands and held on. Presently 
 he worked himself up a little and at last got a foothold. 
 But, scarcely had he done so, when his strength left him 
 and he fell on the ground as one dead. But he soon re- 
 42
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 43 
 
 vived. He opened his eyes and looked around. Ik- 
 saw above him the blue sky, and under him the solid 
 brown earth and before him the gray angry sea. He felt 
 to see if he still breathed. The storm had destroyed the 
 ship. The waves had overwhelmed the boat. The 
 water wished to draw him into the deep. The rocks 
 seemed to want to hurl him back, but storm and wave and 
 rock had accomplished nothing. There was One who 
 was stronger than they. 
 
 Then Robinson sank on his knees and folded his 
 hands. Tears came to his eyes. He breathed hard. 
 At last he said, " Dear Father in Heaven, I live. Thou 
 hast saved me. 1 thank Thee." 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Waves, their course, height, nature and power. Winds, 
 their effects in a storm, ships' danger when near shore in a storm. 
 Cliffs, sandy beach. 
 
 (b) History of Hghthouses. Some famous Hghthouses, life- 
 saving crews, their method of work. Means taken to save lives of 
 those on a sinking ship, etc. 
 
 (c) Do you think Robinson deserved the trouble he fell into? 
 Had he thought before that he might be caught in a storm? How 
 could he have saved this trouble? Do you think he is punished 
 enough for his being so ungrateful and disobedient to his parents ?

 THE FIRST NIGHT ON LAND 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 The waves had cast Robinson on land. What do you think was 
 the name of the land ? Did he know what land he was on ? Did he 
 know that all his companions had perished ? What do you think was 
 the first thing he did ? Do you suppose he thought about the danger 
 of the wild animals ? Do you think he was afraid ? How long had 
 Robinson been now from home? What did Robinson most need 
 now ? Tell how he passed the first night. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 "Where are my companions?" That was his first 
 thought. He began to call and halloo: "Where are 
 you?" "Come here!" But no one answered. Then 
 he wished to see if anyone lived on the land, and he cried, 
 "Is there no one here? Hello!" but all remained still. 
 
 All at once he drew himself together and shrank back. 
 He heard a bush rustle and the thought came like a flash, 
 "That is a wild animal that will pounce upon me and 
 tear my flesh with his teeth and claws. How shall I save 
 myself? Where shall I fly for safety? Where shall I 
 turn? I have nothing but my clothes and my life saved 
 from the water. All that I had the waves have swallowed 
 up." 
 
 44
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 45 
 
 And then hunger and thirst began to trouble him. He 
 had eaten nothing the whole day and tlie salt water made 
 him sick. 
 
 In the meantime the night had come on. Robinson was 
 very tired. Everything was new and strange. He did not 
 know which way to move. He was in the greatest terror. 
 
 He expected to hear the roar of wild beasts from every 
 secluded spot. Lions and tigers and dreadful serpents 
 filled his thoughts. He must find shelter from them. But 
 where should he pass the night? Not a house, a hut or 
 a cave was to be seen. He stood a long time hesitating 
 and did not know what to do. Finally he thought, "I 
 will do as the birds do and get into a tree. " He very soon 
 found a tree which had such thick branches that it would 
 hold him up. 
 
 Robinson climbed up into the tree, made himself as 
 comfortable as possible, said his prayers, and as he was 
 thoroughly exhausted, he soon fell asleep. When he awoke 
 the sun was high in the sky. At first he could not remem- 
 ber where he was. Then the truth burst upon him. He 
 tried to move. He was stiff and sore. His flesh was 
 bruised from being thrown against the rocks and beaten 
 by the waves. 
 
 He was dreadfully thirsty. His mouth and throat were 
 dry and parched from the salt water. His tongue was 
 thick and swollen. He said, "I must find some water to 
 drink or I shall die!" 
 
 It was hard work to get down from the tree. His limbs 
 and back ached from sitting in the tree all night. At last 
 he slipped down and fell on the ground. He clasped his 
 hands in prayer and thanked God for keeping him through 
 the night.
 
 46 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 Then he got up and tried to walk. He was so weak he 
 could not stand. 
 
 He threw himself down on the ground and began to sob 
 and cry, "O Lord, do not let me die! Do not let me die!" 
 As he lay there he heard a queer sound. He listened. 
 It sounded like water running over rocks. He tried to get 
 to the place from which the sound came. He tried to walk. 
 When he fell he crawled on his hands and knees. At last 
 the sound was close by. He dragged himself up on the 
 rocks. Yes, there was a spring of clear, cool, sparkling 
 water bubbling up and trickling over the stones. Robin- 
 son was so thirsty he put his face into the water and drank 
 and drank. 
 
 Then he sat down, and after a while he drank again and 
 again. 
 
 After Robinson had satisfied his thirst and rested awhile 
 he felt much better. He said, " I must try to walk and sec 
 whether I can find something to eat." He found many 
 kinds of fruits and berries all around him, but he was 
 afraid to eat them, as they were strange to him and he 
 feared they might be poisonous. 
 
 As he was walking along, all at once he spied a tall plant 
 in the distance which had a familiar look. It looked like 
 corn. He said to himself, "I wonder if it can be corn." 
 At last he came near enough to recognize it. Yes, it was 
 corn. It did not look exactly like the corn that he saw at 
 home, but still he knew it would be safe to eat it. He 
 broke off an ear and eagerly ate the kernels raw. Oh, 
 how good it was! Robinson could not remember any- 
 thing that tasted half so good. 
 
 He ate as much as he wanted and then filled his pockets 
 with cars of corn for his supper. Then he went back to 
 the spring to get another drink.

 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Springs, corn plants — kinds, history, uses and cultivation. 
 Uses of parts. (See "Com Plants. Their Uses and Ways of Life,"

 (b) Trees as Homes (see "The Tree Dwellers," by Katherine 
 Dopp) — homes of birds, animals, insects. Different animals 
 using trees as homes. What objection could Robinson make to a 
 tree as a home ? Could he have slept on the ground ? 
 
 (c) Robinson is on land. What did he bring with him? Has 
 he now a thankful heart? He is thankful for life alone. He is 
 thankful, yet he lacks the necessities of life even.

 ROBINSON ON AN ISLAND 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Does Robinson yet know on what land he has been thrown? 
 Whether on mainland or on an island ? Does he know whether it is 
 inhabited or not ? How can he find out ? Tell what Robinson does 
 and what he finds. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 After his hunger and thirst were satisfied, Robinson 
 thought he would try to find another dweUing place. 
 "My legs are stiff and sore from sitting so uncomfortably 
 last night, and there is so much danger of falling," he 
 said. "I will climb yonder hill and look around and 
 see on which side the houses are. I will find me a stick 
 to help me on my way." 
 
 He broke a stick from a dry bush and climbed up the 
 steep sides of the hill. After a half hour's climb he was 
 on top. What a sight met his eyes! There were no 
 houses, no huts to be seen, no smoke arose from the 
 forest, no field could be seen. Nothing but trees and 
 bush, sand and rock. "I am then upon an island alone, 
 without food, without shelter, without weapons! What 
 will become of me?" he cried. "I am a prisoner. The 
 island is my prison, the waves are the guards which will 
 not allow me to get away. Will no ship ever come to set 
 
 49
 
 5© THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 me free?" He stretched his gaze out to the sea till his 
 eyes ached, but he saw no ship. 
 
 Robinson came down and seated himself on a stone and 
 considered what he should do. It was not yet noon, yet 
 he feared greatly the next night. " I must find me a better 
 bed," was his first clear thought. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) What is an island ? Have you an idea where the island is on 
 which Robinson has been thrown? Is it in the Atlantic Ocean? 
 The Pacific? Is it in the Arctic zone? The temperate or the 
 hot? Near what mainland is it? (The island on which Robinson 
 is supposed to be thrown is undoubtedly the island called Tobago 
 near Trinidad, at the mouth of the Orinoco River, South America. 
 This island has been very fully and interestingly described by Fred- 
 erick H. Ober in his book, " Crusoe's Island, " published by D, Apple- 
 ton and Company). All teachers should read this book. 
 
 (b) Can you imagine how one would feel cast alone on a strange, 
 uninhabited island? He is certainly in a sad plight. He has lost 
 everything at once, home, friends, comforts. He is like an animal. 
 He has lost his civilized ways of living. 
 
 (c) What is it to be a prisoner? Did Robinson deserve punish- 
 ment of this kind? Do you suppose he now regretted his leaving 
 home?

 IX 
 ROBINSON'S SHELTER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What now do you suppose Robinson will do? He can certainly 
 not remain long in his tree? Will he build a shelter? Tell the 
 diflferent kinds of shelter he might provide himself. Did you ever 
 read about the Tree Dwellers? What natural shelters are there 
 besides trees ? Tell what Robinson did to provide himself a shelter 
 without tools. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson saw at a little distance what seemed to be a 
 cleft or an opening in a huge rock. "If I could only get 
 inside and find room to stay over night. The rock 
 would protect me from rain, from the wind and wild 
 animals better than a tree." 
 
 He long sought in vain for a place wide enough to allow 
 him to get into the opening in the rock. He was about 
 to give up, when he seized hold of a branch of a thorn 
 tree growing on the side of the rock. He looked closer 
 and saw that it grew out of the cleft in the rock. He saw, 
 too, that at this point the opening was wider and that he 
 had only to remove the tree in order to get in. "The hole 
 shall be my dwelling," he said. "I must get the thorn 
 tree out so that I can have room." 
 
 That was easily said. He had neither axe, nor saw, nor 
 52
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 53 
 
 knife nor spade. How could he do it? He had nothing 
 but his hands. He tried to pull it out by the roots, but in 
 vain. He wasn't strong enough. "I must dig it out," 
 said Robinson. He scratched with his nails, but the 
 earth was too hard. What should he do? He sought a 
 stick with a fork in it and dug in the earth, but it was slow 
 work. Then he found a clam-shell. He did better with 
 it, but it was hard work, and Robinson was not used to hard 
 work. The sweat ran down his face and he had often to 
 stop and rest in the shade. The sun burned so hot and 
 the rock so reflected the heat that he was all but over- 
 come. But he worked on. When evening came, he 
 would sleep in the tree and next morning he would go at 
 it again. On the third day the roots were all laid bare. 
 
 But the roots were fast in the clefts of the rock and he 
 could not loosen it, try ever so hard. What would he not 
 have given for an axe, or at least a knife. And yet he had 
 never thought of their value when at home. He attempted 
 to cut one root through with his clam-shell, but the shell 
 crumbled and would not cut the hard wood. He stood 
 for a long time thinking, not knowing what next to do. 
 He made up his mind that he must have something harder 
 than the shell to cut with. Then he tried a stone with a 
 sharp edge and soon found he needed another one, how- 
 ever. He found one. Then he set the sharp one on the 
 wood and struck it with the heavy one. In this way he 
 slowly cut the roots in two. On the fifth day there was 
 yet left one big root, bigger than any of the others. Rob- 
 inson got up early in the morning. He worked the whole 
 day. Finally it gave a crack and it too was broken. 
 Robinson had only now to remove the loose earth inside 
 the cleft. He found the opening could be made large 
 and roomy. It was choked up with dirt. He dug out
 
 54 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 enough to allow him room enough lo make a place to lie 
 down. "In the future," he thought, "I will take out all 
 the dirt and then I shall be comfortable." 
 
 It was then dark and the moon shone bright in the 
 Heavens. Robinson gathered a heap of dry grass and 
 made himself a safe bed. But as he lay there he saw the 
 moonbeams shining into his cave. He sprang up. "How 
 easy," he thought, "for wild animals to creep in hereupon 
 me." He crawled out and looked around. Not far from 
 the cave he saw a large flat stone. With great trouble he 
 rolled it to the opening of his cave, but before this the 
 morning began to dawn. He went inside the shelter, 
 seized the stone with both hands and rolled it into the 
 opening till it almost closed it. "I have now a closed home. 
 I can again stretch my legs. Wind and rain cannot get 
 at me, nor wild animals," 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) What kind of shelters or homes do the various animals have? 
 What animals build homes? What have no shelter? What build 
 or have shelter in trees? In the ground? How do birds build? 
 How do other animals make shelters? Does any animal use a tool 
 in building? 
 
 (b) Why was not Robinson's tree shelter satisfactory? Did he 
 suffer from cold ? Were there any animals that might disturb him ? 
 Was it comfortable ? What other uses has a dwelling besides afford- 
 ing protection to our bodies? It also protects our property and 
 serves as a store house for goods. Do savage people store up food ? 
 Do animals? Where do animals store food? Birds? Squirrels? 
 
 Why did not Robinson construct a shelter of logs? Would 
 not this have been better suited to his needs ? What simple cutting 
 tool would have enabled him to do this? It is easier to move earth 
 than to cut the tough fibers of wood. 
 
 Caves are natural shelters for men and animals. Men — 
 early or primitive men — used to live in caves. This was before men
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON] CRUSOE 
 
 55 
 
 had tools with which they could build in wood. Many things men 
 used when they lived in waves are now found there. 
 
 As with Robinson, early man's first tools were of stone. Why 
 did men use stone instead of metals ? Do stones furnish a good cut- 
 ting edge? What kinds of stones or rocks afford the best cutting 
 edge? How many different kinds of stone tools have you seen? 
 Many such tools may be seen at museums. Many such tools, some 
 of them brightly polished, are found all over the world. Men first 
 made cutting tools of stone. 
 
 (c) Robinson sees he is on an island and is again discouraged. 
 "What will become of me?" Why did he say that? Because he 
 was afraid. Because he must remain alone. Was he brave and 
 manly? Had he reason to be thankful? He had been saved from 
 the wreck. He had found water, food and shelter. But he quailed 
 before each new danger. Did Robinson now think back and re- 
 member how many comforts he had at home? Are we thankful for 
 the many comforts we have? 
 
 Robinson at last has to work and work hard. Did he like 
 to work at home ? Every one should do some kind of work. 
 
 PROBLEMS TO 
 WORK OUT 
 
 (a) Study a thorn tree 
 and practice drawing it. 
 Represent Robinson a t 
 work to remove the tree 
 from the cleft or opening 
 in the rock. 
 
 (c) Study different 
 kinds of rock in order to 
 find one best suited for 
 use, as to material out 
 of which to make tools. 
 Find out how early men 
 made arrows and knives 
 of stone. How they made 
 hammers. How were they 
 fastened to handles?

 ROBINSON MAKES A HAT 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Have you thought about Robinson's clothes? Just what articles 
 of clothing did he save from the wreck? Did he need clothing to 
 keep him warm? Why do men need clothing in hot or tropical 
 countries ? They need it to protect the body from the hot rays of 
 the sun. Do you suppose Robinson saved his hat? Did he need 
 one ? How can he supply himself with one ? Out of what materials 
 and in what manner can he make one? Describe a hat that you 
 suppose he made and tell exactly how he made it. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Refreshed and with renewed strength, Robinson awoke 
 late the next morning, but he had a bad headache. The 
 day before the hot tropic sun had beat down on his bare 
 head, as he worked at his cave. He was so busy that he 
 forgot to go into the shade from time to time in order to 
 shield himself from the scorching sunshine. He felt a 
 new need. "I must make me a hat," said Robinson to 
 himself. "But how?" He had no straw, no thread 
 and no needle. He looked around for a long time, but 
 found nothing. The sun mounted even higher in the 
 heavens, and shone hotter and hotter. He went to seek 
 shelter at last in the deep shade of a nearby tall plant. 
 As he stood there he examined the plant more carefully. 
 56
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 57 
 
 "Out of these leaves," he said, "I might make a hat." 
 He climbed up the short stem of the plant and saw that 
 it had not only leaves as long as himself, but between the 
 leaves were big bunches of long, thin fruit, as thick as 
 three fingers and similar in shape to a cucumber. 
 
 He plucked the leaves and fruit and was about to eat 
 some of the fruit when he heard near him a light stir as of 
 some animal. He rolled the leaves and fruit together 
 and hastened back to the cave. 
 
 The bananas, for that is what the fruit proved to be, 
 were sweet and refreshing. After he had eaten enough 
 he set immediately about making his hat. He broke off 
 a couple of reeds. He bent one into a hoop. But the 
 hoop would not hold without thread. Sometimes it was 
 too large and sometimes too small. But it must fit his 
 head. He pulled up grass and bound its ends together, 
 but the grass stalks were not strong enough. He hunted 
 until he found a tree whose inner bark was soft and came 
 out in long fibers. He bound his reed with this. This, 
 too, made the hoop soft so that it did not hurt his head. 
 
 When the hoop was ready and fitted to his head he 
 found the banana leaves could not be used. Their veins 
 ran straight out from the midrib. This made them 
 easily torn, and besides, they were too large. They were 
 not the best shape. He saw that leaves about a foot long 
 with broad and tapering points would be best. He saw 
 too, that if the leaves had their veins running parallel 
 with the midrib they would be strongest. He made 
 search and at length found leaves that seemed made 
 for his purpose. They were thick and leathery and 
 tapered from base to apex like a triangle. 
 
 He now proceeded with his hat-making. He would take 
 a leaf and lay it on the ground with the base toward him.
 
 5ft THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 Then he laid the hoop on the base of the leaf, wrapped 
 it around the hoop and fastened it with thorns. He 
 did the same with the other leaves. The thorns were his 
 pins. At last he pinned the tips of the leaves together 
 at the top and the hat was ready. It looked just like a 
 big cone, but it kept out the heat of the sun. 
 
 Robinson now had corn and bananas and when he 
 was thirsty he drank a handful of water from the spring. 
 He had been now nine days on the island. Every day 
 he looked out on the sea until his eyes ached to see if he 
 might discover a ship. 
 
 He could not understand why no ship came his way. 
 "Who knows how long I must wait here?" said he sorrow- 
 fully. Then the thought came to him: "You will not 
 be able to keep track of the days unless you write it down." 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Why do the sun's rays appear hotter in tropical countries 
 than elsewhere? Have you seen a banana plant growing? De- 
 scribe its leaves? What material do we use to make hats? 
 Men's? Women's? What plants are used for reeds? 
 
 (b) Do savage or uncivilized men wear hats ? Think of Indians, 
 Africans, Eskimos? What materials if any do these people wear 
 in the manufacture of head coverings? What tools do they need 
 or use? Do you know how hats are now made? Straw hats? 
 Silk hats? Hats of felt? What things are used to decorate hats? 
 Did Robinson think of decorating his hat? Why not? Are flowers 
 or birds the better decorations? Was not Robinson's hat an ex- 
 ceedingly clumsy affair? Could he not have done better even 
 without tools had he learned to work at home with his hands? 
 Suppose he had learned to weave baskets in the schools, could he 
 not have woven a more suitable and serviceable hat out of long 
 grasses or plant stems and branches? 
 
 (b) Where do the bananas you buy come from ? Roinson was 
 indeed fortunate in finding this fruit. He now had com and 
 fruit for food? Does the banana grow wild in tropical America, or
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 59 
 
 had it been brought to Robinstm's island by man? Where is the 
 native home of the banana? Of com? 
 
 (c) Did Robinson learn to work at home? Did he do well 
 in his father's store ? Is it right not to learn how to work ? Every 
 one should know how to work, how to do and make things. Robin- 
 son now has to work. Did you feel sorry for him working so hard 
 making his shelter and hat? He will be a better and more useful 
 man for learning how to make things and provide for his own wants. 
 
 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (a) Draw Robinson in such clothing as he had left after the 
 shipwreck. 
 
 Study from nature or pictures and descriptions to draw a 
 banana plant accurately. 
 
 Represent Robinson standing beneath the banana plant, with

 ROBINSON'S CALENDAR 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 How do we keep track of the day, month, and year? We count 
 them off on a printed calendar. How is Robinson to keep track 
 of time with no ink or pen or pencil ? Do you think Robinson would 
 want to know the day of the week and month ? Why ? How can 
 Robinson know the time of day ? Would the time of the day be as 
 useful to him as the day of the week and month ? Describe the 
 calddar you think Robinson could make without paper or pens. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 The matter of keeping track of time puzzled Robinson 
 very much. It was getting more difficult every day to 
 keep it in his memory. He must write down the days as 
 they slip by, but where and how ? He had neither pen, ink, 
 nor paper. Should he mark every day with a colored 
 stone on the smooth side of the huge rock wall within 
 whose clefts he had dug out his cave? But the rain 
 would wash off the record and then he would lose all his 
 bearings. Then he thought of the beach, but there 
 the wind and waves would soon also erase it. 
 
 He thought a long time. "I must find something," he 
 
 said to himself on which to keep a record. "I must 
 
 also know when Sunday is. I must rest one day in the 
 
 week. Yes, I must find something," he said, "on which 
 
 60
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 6i 
 
 to write." And finally he found it. He chose two trees 
 standing near each other and then sought for a small 
 sharp stone, which he could make still sharper by striking 
 it on another. When he had got this pen ready he cut 
 into the bark of one tree. 
 
 Shipwreck^ Sunday., loth oj September, 1875. 
 
 He made seven cuts in a row for the seven days in the 
 week. The first cut was longer than the others. This 
 was to represent the Sunday. At sundown every day he 
 made a new cut in the bark. 
 
 The other tree he called the month tree. On its stem 
 he was to cut a mark every time his week tree told him a 
 month had passed. But he must be careful, for the 
 months were not of equal length. But he remembered 
 that his teacher had once said in school that the months 
 could be counted on the knuckles and hollows of the 
 hand, in such a way that the long and short months could 
 be found easily and he could tell in this way the number 
 of days in each. 
 
 Robinson worked at enlarging his shelter a little every 
 day. He was sorely at loss to find something in which 
 to carry the dirt away from the entrance, or enough so 
 that it would not choke up the opening. A large clam 
 shell was all he could think of at present. He would 
 carry the dirt to the entrance and some distance away, and 
 then throw it. Fortunately the ground sloped awdy 
 rapidly, so that he needed a kind of platform before his 
 door. 
 
 He was careful to open the cleft at some distance above 
 the large opening. For the air was damp and impure 
 in the shelter. But with the opening made high above,
 
 62 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 fresh air was constantly passing into, and impure air out 
 of, his cave. Light, too, was admitted in this way. 
 
 THINGS TO TALK AND THINK ABOUT 
 
 (a) In connection with measuring and reckoning time the ro- 
 tation and revolution of the earth, sunrise and set. The length 
 of the day. 
 
 What kind of trees do you think Robinson would be likely 
 to find on his island? 
 
 Were there changes of seasons on Robinson's island ? Winter 
 and summer. Would one be more likely to lose track of time in a 
 country where there was not marked seasonal changes? 
 
 The sun dial is an instrument used to show the time of day. 
 Have you seen one ? It will tell the hour of the day when the sun 
 shines only. We use a machine called a clock or watch for telling 
 time of day. Can you tell time of day from the clock ? 
 
 (b) From what event do we reckon time? What does A. D. mean? 
 Name the months of the year. Does each have the same number 
 of days? Which is the shortest? It was lucky for Robinson that 
 he remembered a rule for telling the long and short months. Do 
 you know the one beginning: 
 
 Thirty days hath September, 
 April, June and November? 
 
 (b) What other machines are used for measuring time? The 
 Greeks used a water clock. Have you seen an hour-glass? 
 
 What fixes the length of the month? The Indians reckoned 
 time in moons. Our word month comes from an old word meaning 
 moon. How do uncivilized people keep track of time? 
 
 Why did Robinson wish to keep a record of the time? Do 
 you think his scheme a good one ? Do you think of any better way? 
 
 Was Robinson wise in providing for fresh air in his cave? 
 What sickness comes from impure air? Do you always have fresh 
 air in your sleeping rooms?

 ROBINSON MAKES A HUNTING BAG 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Will not Robinson grow tired of com and bananas? Will he not 
 need to store food? Will he not wish for meat? Will he not hunt 
 for animals fit for food? What animals will he find? How will 
 he bring food from a distance? He will need something in which 
 to carry it. Tell how you would provide a vesse' for this purpose. 
 How did Robinson meet this need ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Several days passed with Robinson's hat-making and 
 his calendar- making and his watching the sea. Every 
 day his corn and bananas become more distasteful to him. 
 And he planned a longer journey about the island to see 
 if something new to eat could be found. 
 
 But he considered that if he went a distance from his 
 cave and found something it would really be of little use 
 to him. "I could eat my fill," he said, "but that is all. 
 And by the time I get back to my cave I will again be 
 hungry. I must find something in which I can gather 
 and carry food." He found nothing. 
 
 "The people in New York," he said, "have baskets, 
 or pockets, or bags made of coarse cloth. Of them all, 
 I could most easily make the net, perhaps, of vines. But 
 64
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 65 
 
 the little things would fall out of the net. I will see 
 whether I can make a net of small meshes." 
 
 But he soon saw that the vines did not give a smooth 
 surface. He thought for a long while. In his garden at 
 home his father had sometimes bound up the young trees 
 with the soft inner bark of others. He wondered if he 
 could use this. He stripped away the outer bark from 
 the tree, which before had yielded him a fiber for his hat, 
 and pulled off the long, smooth pieces of the inner bark. 
 He twisted them together. Then he thought how he 
 could w^eave the strands together. He looked at his 
 shirt. A piece was torn off and unravelled. He could 
 see the threads go up and down. He saw that some 
 threads go from left to right (woof), others lengthwise 
 (the warp). 
 
 From his study of the woven cloth, Robinson saw he 
 must have a firmer thread than the strips of bark gave 
 alone. He separated his bark into long, thin strips. 
 These he twisted into strands or yarn by rolling it between 
 his hands, or on a smooth surface. As he twisted it he 
 wound it on a stick. It was slow, hard work. Of all 
 his work, the making of yarn or thread gave him the most 
 trouble. He learned to twist it by knotting the thread 
 around the spindle or bobbin on which he wound it and 
 twirling this in the air. He remembered sadly the old 
 spinning wheel he had seen at his grandmother's house. 
 
 His next care was something to hold the threads while 
 he wove them in and out. He had never seen a loom. 
 
 After long study Robinson set two posts in the ground 
 and these he bound with seventy-two strands horizontally 
 under each other. Then he tied in the top at the left 
 another thread and wove it in and out through the seventy- 
 two threads. So he tied seventy-two vertical strands and
 
 66 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 wove them in and out. Thus he had a net three times 
 as long as his foot and as wide as long. He tied the four 
 corners together. He made a woven handle for it and 
 put it on his shoulder like a sack, saying gleefully, 
 "This shall be my hunting bag." 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Do you know any tree with a tough inner bark? What 
 plants furnish a fibrous inner bark? Do you know the flax plant 
 or hemp? Name plants giving us fiber for making cloth? What 
 part of the plant is cotton fiber? 
 
 (b) What do Indians use in making baskets ? Have you woven 
 baskets? Was Robinson skillful in his work? He did not learn 
 to weave and make baskets in school. How is flax prepared for 
 weaving? Describe spinning. Would Robinson have to spin his 
 strands? 
 
 Can you think of a better loom than Robinson made? It 
 was a very simple loom. Have you seen the great looms used 
 in factories for weaving cloth? Have you used looms in school? 
 Name as many kinds of cloth as you can. What part did the spin- 
 ning wheel play in making cloth? How do you suppose Robinson 
 obtained the posts and set them in the ground ?

 ROBINSON EXPLORES THE ISLAND 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Does Robinson yet know all about his island? Will he not 
 want to explore it? He may not find inhabitants? Will he not 
 wish to find other kinds of food? Now that he has his bag he 
 can bring fruit and all kinds of food from a distance. What kinds 
 of fruits and nuts will Robinson be likely to find on his island? 
 Tell how Robinson explored the island and what he found. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 After Robinson made his hunting bag he was anxious 
 to set off on his journey of exploring the island. So he 
 arose very early next morning. "Before it is hot," thought 
 he, "I will be quite a distance on my journey." He ate 
 a couple of bananas, scooped up a few handfuls of water 
 from the spring, stuck a few ears of corn in his hunting 
 bag, took his stick in his hand and went forth. As he 
 left his cave the thought struck him. "What if I could 
 not find my cave again? How can I manage so that I 
 can come back to it ? I will go away in one direction and 
 return the same way; but suppose I were to lose the 
 way?" 
 
 Then he noticed his shadow pointing like a great finger 
 from the sea toward the land. He could direct himself 
 by that. He kept his shadow in front of him. He had 
 68
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 69 
 
 noticed, too, that the wind always blew north of the point 
 where the sun rose. This helped him. But sometimes 
 the wind died down. 
 
 He had to climb over many rocks and pierce many 
 thickets. At each step he saw a rich growth of plants, 
 stems, leaves, flowers, but nothing to eat, no fruits, or 
 nuts. At length he came to a tree as high as a small 
 church steeple. Then he thought of what his father had 
 once said about the trees in strange countries. "Many 
 are as tall as a church steeple and the nuts are as big as 
 one's head." He looked again. Yes, there they hung 
 among the leaves, concealed high above in the crown! 
 But so high, it was well that Robinson had learned to 
 climb while on board the ship. He quickly laid down 
 his hunting bag and clambered up the smooth stem of 
 the high tree, a palm. He picked off a nut and threw it 
 down and then several more, and climbed down again. 
 
 But the nuts were very hard. How should he open 
 them ? He had brought along his sharp stone with which 
 he had stripped off the inner bark. With this he forced 
 off the thick outer shell. But now came the hard nut 
 within, and how hard it was! Striking it was of no use. 
 
 Then he threw a great stone on the nut. The shell 
 was crushed and a snow-white kernel lay before him. 
 It tasted like almond. With astonishment Robinson saw 
 in the middle of the nut a large empty space which must 
 have been filled with fluid as the inside was wet. He 
 wished that he had the juice to drink for he was very 
 thirsty. With this in view he examined another and 
 riper nut, and the outside came off more easily. But how 
 could he break it and at the same time save the juice. 
 He studied the hull of the cocoanut, on all sides. At the 
 ends were three little hollows. He attempted first to bore
 
 70 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 in with his fingers, but he could not. "Hold!" he cried. 
 "Maybe I can cut them there with the point of my stone 
 knife." This was done without trouble and out of the 
 hole flowed the sweet, white juice. 
 
 Robinson put a couple of nuts in his hunting bag, and 
 also the shells from the broken nuts. "Now," he thought, 
 "I shall no longer have to drink from my hand." With 
 this thought he went on his way. 
 
 As Robinson came to a rock in his path, out jumped 
 what Robinson took to be a hare. He ran after him to 
 catch him, but the hare was much the swifter. So 
 Robinson hastened home, but before he reached it the 
 stars were shining with their lustrous light. Tired 
 Robinson stretched his limbs on his bed of grass and 
 leaves and slept soundly. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (c) On which side of the island was Robinson, the east or 
 west? What direction did he travel away from home? Ex- 
 plain how his shadow would finally bring him back home. How 
 could he tell when it was noon by his shadow? 
 
 Name if you can some of the plants and trees Robinson 
 saw. (See Crusoe's Island.) 
 
 Tell about the cocoanut palm. What purpose does the 
 outer corky husk serve? How do monkeys break them? 
 When do the nuts grow on the trees? What is the purpose or 
 use of the three soft places at the cocoanut's end ? 
 
 (6) How do men find their way through forests? How on the

 ROBINSON AS A HUNTER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Will not Robinson remember the hare or rabbit? Will he not 
 be hungry for meat? We do not like to live entirely on fruits 
 and cereals. How can Robinson manage to catch a rabbit? He 
 has no weapon. Tell how you would catch one, the first time you 
 tried. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 All the time Robinson was confined to the cave he kept 
 thinking about the rabbit he had seen and how he might 
 catch one. Finally, he determined to make a spear. 
 He broke down a thin, young sapling, stripped off its 
 branches and in one end fastened a sharp stone. He 
 then went to bed, for he wanted to be up early for his first 
 hunting trip on the morrow. 
 
 With a large umbrella he had made, his hunting sack, 
 and spear, Robinson crept lightly through the under- 
 brush. But he did not go far before he saw a lot of 
 rabbits feeding peacefully on the soft leaves and grass. 
 He drew back and threw his spear with all his might. 
 But the spear did not reach the rabbits. It fell far 
 short and the rabbits sprang up and ran quickly away. 
 He tried it several times with the same result. Then 
 Robinson, discouraged, turned back home and ate his 
 com, bananas, and cocoanuts without meat. In the 
 72
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 73 
 
 meantime he found a new kind of food. He discovered a 
 nest of eggs. How good they tasted to him! 
 
 But his longing for meat was still very great. "I will 
 try to make a bow and arrow," he said. No sooner said 
 than done. He bent a long piece of tough, young wood 
 and stretched between the ends a cord twisted out of the 
 fiber taken from the cocoanut shell. He then sought for 
 a piece of wood for arrows. He split the ends with his 
 flint knife and fastened in splinters of stone. At the other 
 end he fastened on some feathers found on the ground. 
 The arrows flew through the air with great swiftness. 
 "They will go far enough," thought Robinson, " if I could 
 only hit anything." 
 
 He practised shooting. He stuck his stone knife in a 
 tree and shot at it the whole day long. At first he could 
 not hit it at all. The arrows flew far from the mark. After 
 a while he could hit the tree, but not the knife. Then as 
 he practised, his arm grew ever surer until at last he could 
 hit the knife at almost every attempt. After a few days 
 he again went rabbit hunting. He thought that the rabbit 
 did not offer a mark so high as his knife, so he stuck a 
 stone in the ground and practised shooting at that. He 
 gradually increased the distance until he could hit the 
 mark at twenty or thirty yards. 
 
 The next morning Robinson took his bow and arrows 
 and went out to hunt. He aimed at a rabbit, shot, and 
 it fell, pierced by the arrow. His very first shot was 
 successful. 
 
 He hastened up and took the dead rabbit on his shoulder, 
 carried it to his cave and skinned it. Then he cut off a 
 nice, large piece of meat and was going to roast it, but 
 alas, he had no fire!
 
 74 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Hares are not the same as rabbits. What Robinson saw 
 were probably agouti. The rabbit isa burrowing animal and lives 
 in Europe. We call our hares rabbits. 
 
 (b) When men first began to hunt they probably hunted with 
 spears and javelins. These were thrown at the animal. It was a great 
 task for primitive man to make a shaft and set a stone shaped 
 with a sharp point in it. When thus thrown they were liable to be 
 lost. Spears were afterwards made with loose shafts so that they 
 might be recovered. Finally when barbed heads were used these 
 were tied to the shaft with a string. (See the "Later Cave Men," 
 by Katherine Dopp.) 
 
 Robinson has to invent and make things just as savage men 
 did. Why was not Robinson successful with his spear? Tell 
 what he would have to do in order to become successful. 
 
 What weapon did the Indians use? Is the bow and arrow 
 a better weapon than the spear? Tell in what way it is better. 
 Do you suppose the Indians were skillful at first with the bow 
 and arrow? Did the boys have to practice? What kinds of 
 wood are best for bows ? For arrows? There is a shrub growing 
 in the parks called arrow wood. Have you seen the stone arrow 
 heads made and used by the Indians? How were they made? 
 They were flaked out. Small bits of stone were clipped out of 
 the pieces from which the head was to be fashioned by pressure, 
 until the required form was obtained. Robinson's work on the 
 shafts, heads, bow and arrow was no doubt very clumsy and 
 awkward. He was not skillful. He did not know how to work. 
 He had not learned when at home. Primitive men were very 
 skillful. They made beautifully shaped and polished spear heads. 
 Many such are now found in caves. ("Man before Metals, " Joly.)

 we treat animals? For what purposes is it right to take their

 ROBINSON'S SHOES AND PARASOL 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 How about the covering of Robinson's feet. Had he shoes? 
 Will not his feet become sore from walking through thick tangles 
 of plants and over rough ground? Was Robinson used to going 
 barefoot? What will he do? How he can get covering and pro- 
 tection for his feet ? The sun, too, is it not hot on his island ? Can 
 he make further protection from its great heat? Should not 
 Robinson have some way to tell the time of day? Can you 
 think of a way Robinson may make covering for his feet? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 The next morning Robinson could not get up. His 
 feet were swollen and sore in consequence of walking 
 without shoes over thorns and stones. He must remain 
 the whole day in his cave. 
 
 Before him, in the sun, his walking stick stuck in the 
 ground. He thought how he had been troubled yesterday 
 to find his way and about the shadow. He had now time to 
 study it. He watched it the whole day through. In the 
 morning it pointed toward the land. In the evening 
 toward the sea. This comes from the daily movement of 
 the sun. He determined to study the matter more care- 
 fully. 
 
 Robinson got up and with great effort walked to the 
 76
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 77 
 
 spring. There he cooled his burning feet, and gathered 
 some large leaves, which he bound on them. He de- 
 cided to remain in his cave a few days, for he had enough 
 food stored up to last him some length of time. He 
 planned how he might make himself a pair of shoes. As 
 soon as his feet were well, he sought out some thick bark 
 and put fastenings of tough, strong fiber on it. These 
 served very well to protect his feet. 
 
 But he must have some further protection from the 
 sun. It beamed so hot that his hat was not enough. He 
 made a parasol out of leaves like his hat. He took a 
 stick and bound the stems of the long leaves at one end 
 and let their ends hang down. Then he took reeds and 
 bent them into a large circle. On the beach he found 
 skeletons of fish and used the needle-like bones to fasten 
 the leaves together. He then tied six thick ribs to the 
 hoop and the end of the stick. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Was not Robinson mistaken about the shadow pointing 
 toward the cave at noon? Can you think how the time of day 
 might be told on a clear day by the fact Robinson noticed ? Would 
 the shadow of the stick make a complete circle or only a semicircle. 
 What is the name applied to this kind of clock ? Is the sun really 
 hotter in tropical countries? 
 
 (b) Do uncivilized people tell the time of day? A clock is a 
 machine for telling or measuring time? Besides clocks run by 
 machinery there are water clocks, shadow clocks, and hour glasses. 
 Hours, minutes and seconds are parts of the time it takes the earth 
 to turn around once or make a rotation. 
 
 (c) What do you think of Robinson's shoes? Can you think of a 
 better way to protect his feet or of more suitable material ? Of 
 what materials are shoes made — in Holland? China? By the 
 Indians? Was it not because Robinson had not learned to work 
 that he made such clumsy things ? Would people not have laughed
 
 78 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 at him had he been seen with his clumsy hat, shoes, and parasol ? 
 Would he not have been ashamed ? 
 
 (d) Robinson must have presented a sorry figure with his 
 tattered clothes — his awkward hat, his clumsy shoes and para- 
 sol. Even primitive men were better clothed. The dress of 
 Indians compared to that of Robinson. Decorative and pro- 
 tective. 
 
 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (a) Study to draw Robinson in his clothes, cap, shoes, and 
 with his parasol, true to description and in proportion. 
 
 (c) Construct a shadow stick and sun dial with scale for telling 
 hours.

 GETTING FIRE 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Will not Robinson try to get fire in order to cook his game? 
 How can he do it? How do men get fire without matches? 
 Robinson will have to invent a way to get fire if he has roasted 
 rabbit. Maybe he will not succeed. How would you go about it? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Now Robinson had heard that savages take two dry 
 pieces of wood and rub them so long on each other that 
 they at length begin to bum. 
 
 He tried it. The sweat ran down his cheeks, but every 
 time the wood was about to catch fire his strength would 
 give out, and he was obliged to rest, and when he began 
 again the wood was cold. "How will it be in winter," 
 he cried, "when it is cold, and I have no fire ?" He must 
 try other ways of preparing meat for his table. He must 
 think of some other way of getting fire. He remembered 
 that once, when a boy at home, he had in playing with a 
 stick made it hot by twirling it on end on a piece of wood. 
 "I will try this," he thought. He searched for a good 
 hard stick and a piece of wood upon which to turn or twirl 
 it with his hands. Having found the best materials at 
 hand, he began to twirl the stick. He made a little hollow 
 
 79
 
 8o THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 in the block of wood in which to turn his upright stick. 
 There was heat but no fire. He twirled and twirled, but 
 he could not get the wood hot enough to blaze up or 
 ignite. He had not skill. Besides his hands were not 
 used to such rough treatment. Soon they blistered and 
 this method had to be given up. "I must have fire," 
 he still thought, and recalled the sparks that flew from 
 the stone pavements of the streets when the iron shoes of 
 the horses struck them as they slipped and strained at their 
 cruel loads. Why may I not get fire by striking together 
 two stones? He sought out two hard stones and with 
 great diligence kept striking them together until his 
 strength gave out, and he was obliged again to acknowl- 
 edge failure. 
 
 He remembered that sometimes travelers put the meat 
 underneath the saddle and ride on it until it is soft. He 
 tried it with pounding. He laid some of the meat on a 
 flat stone and pounded it. It became quite soft and 
 tasted very well. He then tried hanging it in the sun 
 and finally wrapped it in leaves and buried it for a few 
 hours in the hot sand. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) If Robinson had gone to school would he have worried 
 about the coming of winter? Are there winters in the tropics? 
 
 (b) Did you ever think that someone at some time must have 
 discovered fire or the way to produce and keep it? (Man has 
 not always had fire. It was a great step forward when the first 
 man learned how to produce it at will. He placed at once between 
 him and the animals an insurmountable distance. Fire gives 
 control over climates and refractory metals, increases man's 
 power incalculably.) 
 
 Cannot fire be produced by friction or rubbing, as Robinson
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 8i 
 
 tried to produce it? Why did he fail? Was it owing to lack of 
 skill or poor and imperfect materials? Why did he fail by twirl- 
 ing the stick? Can fire be produced by striking two stones to- 
 gether? Does it not need a stone and steel or iron? Two flint 
 stones when struck may produce a spark. Iron pyrites, a very com- 
 mon stone, will, with flint, readily give a spark. How when this 
 method is used is the spark made to ignite? What is used for 
 this purpose? Dried moss, punk, rotten wood, thoroughly dry, 
 some kinds of fungus. Had Robinson produced a spark in this 
 way could he have succeeded in igniting wood without punk 
 or some receptive material ? Why did Robinson fail to get a 
 spark? 
 
 How do we produce fire? Have men long had matches? 
 What is a match? Getting fire by rubbing or twirling is called 
 producing it by friction, by striking iron or steel or stones together, 
 percussion. In using matches are we obtaining fire by friction 
 or percussion? Tell the different parts of a match. Which 
 part ignites? Why does it ignite? See Chapter I "Starr's 
 First Steps in Human Progress." 
 
 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (c) Represent Robinson trying to produce fire by friction ? 
 (c) Get proper material and try to produce fire in the ways 
 that Robinson attempted to produce it.

 We have furniture in our houses. We make ourselves com- 
 fortable. We have chairs, tables, and beds. We have not yet 
 learned how Robinson managed to live in his cave — what furni- 
 ture he had. How might he have made a chair? A bed ? A table ? 
 Out of what materials ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 One thing troubled Robinson ver}' much. He could 
 not sit comfortably while eating. He had neither chair 
 nor table. He wished to make them, but that was a big 
 job. He had no saw, no hammer, no auger and no nails. 
 Robinson could therefore make no table of wood. 
 
 Not far from his cave he had seen a smooth, flat stone. 
 "Ay," thought he, "perhaps I can make me a table out 
 of stone." He picked out the best stone and built up 
 four columns as high as a table and on these he laid his 
 large, flat stone. It looked like a table, sure enough, but 
 there were rough places and hollows in it. He wanted 
 it smooth. He took clay and filled up the holes and 
 smoothed it off. When the clay dried, the surface was 
 smooth and hard. Robinson covered it with leaves and 
 decked it with flowers till it was quite beautiful.

 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 83 
 
 When the table was done, Robinson began on a chair. 
 He made it also of stone. It had no back. It looked 
 like a bench. It was uncomfortable to sit on. Robin- 
 son covered it with moss. Then it was an easy seat. 
 
 Table and chair were now ready. Robinson could 
 not move them from one corner to another, nor when he 
 sat on the chair could he put his feet under the table, 
 and yet he thought them excellent pieces of furniture. 
 
 Every day Robinson went hunting and shot a rabbit, 
 but the meat would not keep. At home they would have 
 put it in the cellar. If only he had a cellar! He saw 
 near his cave a hole in the rock. He dug it out a little 
 with his mussel shell and found that it led back under 
 a rock. 
 
 From much bending over in digging, Robinson's back, 
 unused to severe toil, ached wretchedly. He decided 
 to make a spade. With his flint he bored four holes in 
 a great, round mussel shell. They formed a rectangle as 
 long as a little finger and as wide. Through these holes 
 he drew cocoanut fiber and bound the shell to a handle 
 fast and strong. 
 
 With his spade he dug a hole so deep that he could 
 stand in it upright. Then he put in a couple of shelves 
 made of flat stones. In this cellar he put his hare meat and 
 his eggs. Then he laid branches over it and finally 
 covered the whole with leaves.

 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (c) Out of the lazy good-for-nothing boy you see a sober in- 
 dustrious man has been made. How has this happened? Was it 
 then necessary for him to be diligent and active? Here no one 
 would see him, and no one would shame him. He could live as he 
 chose. But Robinson had learned that diligence gives food and that 
 idleness brings to want and that he by his lazy, shiftless ways of 
 living could get nothing to eat or nothing to wear, or no place to live. 
 Robinson had learned a great lesson. He now worked continuously, 
 never stopping from morning till night. He had made himself 
 a parasol, a hat, some shoes, a knife, a net, a cave, a cellar, bow and 
 arrows, a chair, and table. He now knew the satisfaction that 
 comes to one who well uses his time.

 ROBINSON BECOMES A SHEPHERD 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What is the business of a shepherd ? Have you seen a shepherd 
 dog? Do sheep Hve in cold or warm countries? Would you ex- 
 pect to find sheep in Robinson's Island? Why? What could there 
 be for Robinson to be shepherd of? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 With his bow and arrow, Robinson went hunting every 
 day. The rabbits soon learned to know him and let them- 
 selves be seldom seen. As soon as they saw him, they took 
 alarm. They became timid and shy. One day Robin- 
 son went out as usual to shoot rabbits. He found none. 
 But as he came to a great rock he heard from behind a 
 new sound, one he had not heard before in the island. 
 Baa-ait sounded. "A kid, "thought Robinson, "like that 
 with which I have so often played at home." He slipped 
 noiselessly around the rock and behold, really there stood 
 a kid. He tried to call it, but the kid sought safety in 
 flight. He hastened after it. Then he noticed that it 
 was lame in one fore foot. It ran into some brush, where 
 Robinson seized it by the horns and held it fast. 
 
 How Robinson rejoiced! He stroked it and fondled 
 it. Then he thought, how could it come into this wilder- 
 ness on this lonesome island? "Has your ship been cast 
 85
 
 86 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 upon the rocks too, and been broken to pieces?" You 
 dear thing, you shall be my comrade." He seized the 
 goat by the legs, and no matter how it kicked, carried it 
 to his cave. 
 
 Then he fetched quickly a cocoanut shell full of water 
 and washed and bathed the goat's wounded leg. A stone 
 had rolled down from the hill and had inflicted a severe 
 wound on his left fore leg, or perhaps she had stepped 
 into a crack in the rocks. Robinson tore oif a piece of 
 linen from his shirt, dipped it in water and bound it with 
 shreds of the cocoanut upon the wound. Then he pulled 
 some grass and moss and made a soft bed near the door 
 of the cave. After he had given it water, it looked at 
 him with thankful eyes and licked his hand. 
 
 Robinson could not sleep that night. He thought 
 continually of his goat and got up time and again to see 
 if it was safe. The moon shone clear in the heavens. 
 As Robinson sat before the goat's bed he looked down on 
 his new possession as lovingly as a mother on her child. 
 
 The next morning Robinson's first thought was, " I am 
 no longer alone. I have a companion, my goat." He 
 sprang up and looked for it. There she lay on her side, 
 still sleeping. 
 
 As he stood and considered, the thought came to him 
 that perhaps the goat had escaped from its keeper. There 
 must then be some one living on the land. He quickly 
 put on his shoes and his hat, took his parasol, and ran to 
 the rock where he had found the goat. 
 
 He called, he sought, he peered about to see if some 
 shepherd were there somewhere. He found nothing. 
 He found no trace of man. There was no road, no bridge, 
 no field, no logs, not even a chip or shaving to show that 
 the hand of man had been there.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 87 
 
 But what was that? In the distance ran a herd of 
 goats over the rocks. But no dog followed them and 
 no shepherd. They ran wild on the island. They had 
 perhaps been left there by some ship. As he came home 
 he noticed the goat sorrowfully. The bandage had be- 
 come dry. The goat might be suffering pain. Robinson 
 loosened the bandage, washed the wound again and bound 
 it up anew. It was so trustful. It ran after him and he 
 decided always to protect it. "I will always be your 
 shepherd and take care of you," he said. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Sheep and goats. 
 
 (b) Why do sheep need the constant care if a shepherd? Do 
 cattle need a herder? What useful material do we get from sheep? 
 From goats? Tell how wool is cut from sheep, and prepared for 
 spinning and weaving. How had Robinson heretofore obtained 
 food. Has he sowed seed and raised food — cultivated the soil ? 
 Has he had flocks and herds? Has he not been a hunter? Has he 
 not supplied all his needs by finding his food and clothing and 
 shelter, just as savage men do ? Did the Indians cultivate the soil 
 or live by hunting and fishing? Is it not good to depend upon 
 hunting alone for food? Why is it better to have sheep, goats, 
 horses and cattle — tame, domesticated animals ? Will Robinson feel 
 safer when he has a flock of goats? Do you know of any people 
 or country that makes a business of herding sheep and cattle? 
 Robinson with his goats will not have to work so hard for his food 
 and clothing and he will be more sure of having food and clothing. 
 
 (c) Why did Robinson feel so glad on finding the goat ? He was 
 lonely and wished for companions. What was the first thing he 
 did on finding himself alone on land? He had idled away his time 
 with worthless fellows. Now he has no human face to look upon 
 and is glad to have the company of even a goat. Do you like Robin- 
 son's kindness to the goat? What sheep picture have you seen that 
 you liked?

 ROBINSON BUILDS A HOME FOR HIS GOAT 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 How do you suppose Robinson will protect his goat, shelter it 
 and provide food for it? What kind of shelter will he build for 
 it ? Will he need to protect it from cold ? From what will he need 
 to protect it. From heat? Animals? Will he need to keep it 
 tied, tethered or fenced in to prevent its wandering away and joining 
 the flock of wild goats ? How will Robinson build such a fence ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 But the goat was a new care. Wild animals could come 
 and kill, and carry Robinson's goat away while he slept, and 
 if the goat got frightened while he was hunting it would 
 run away. "I will have to make me a little yard in front 
 of my cave," he said, "for my goat to live in." But from 
 whence must come the tools? He had neither hatchet 
 nor saw. Where then were the stakes to come from ? He 
 went in search of something. After hunting for a long 
 time he came upon a kind of thistle about two feet higher 
 than himself, having at its top a red torch-like blossom. 
 There were a great many of them. "Good!" thought 
 Robinson, "if I could only dig up enough of them and 
 plant them thick around the door of my cave, I would 
 have just the thing. No one could get at me, nor at the 
 
 89
 
 go THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 goat, either. The thorns would keep anything from 
 creeping through, peeping in or getting over." 
 
 So he took his mussel-shell spade and went to work. 
 It was pretty hard, but at length he succeeded in laying 
 bare the roots of quite a number. But he could not drag 
 them to his cave on account of the thorns sticking him. 
 He thought a long time. Finally, he sought out two 
 strong poles or branches which were turned up a little 
 at one end and like a sled runner. To these he tied 
 twelve cross-pieces with bark. To the foremost he tied 
 a strong rope made from cocoa fiber. He then had some- 
 thing that looked much like a sled on which to draw his 
 thistle-like brush to his cave. But for one day he had 
 done enough. The transplanting of the thistles was 
 hard work. His spade broke and he had to make a new 
 one. In the afternoon he broke his spade again. And 
 as he made his third one, he made up his mind that it 
 was no use trying to dig with such a weak tool in the hard 
 ground. It would only break again. 
 
 "If I only had a pick." But he had none. He lound 
 a thick, hard, sharp stone. With it he picked up the hard 
 earth, but had to bend almost double in using it. "At 
 home," he thought, "they have handles to picks." The 
 handle was put through a hole in the iron. He turned the 
 matter over and over in his mind, how he might put a hole 
 through the stone. But he found no means. He searched 
 out a branch with a crotch at one end. He tied the stone to 
 this with strong cocoa fiber and bark. How his eye glis- 
 tened as he looked at the new tool! Now he began to 
 work. He first loosened up the earth with his pick, then 
 he dug it out with his spade and planted in a high thistle. 
 Many days he had to work, but finally one evening the 
 hedge was ready. He had a row in a semi-circle in front
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE gi 
 
 of his cave. He counted the marks on his calendar 
 tree. The day on which he had begun to make his 
 hedge he had especially marked out. He had worked 
 fourteen days. 
 
 He had completed his hedge with the exception of a 
 small hole that must serve for a door. But the door 
 must not be seen from without. 
 
 As Robinson thought, it came to him that there was 
 still place for two thistles on the outside. He could easily 
 get in, but the entrance was difficult to find from the 
 outside. 
 
 Robinson looked on his hedge from without. It was 
 not yet thick enough. For this reason he planted small 
 thistles between the larger ones. With the digging them 
 out and transplanting them he was a whole week longer. 
 
 Finally, the hedge and the yard were ready. Now 
 Robinson could rest without fear and sleep in his cave, 
 and could have his goat near him all the time. It delighted 
 him greatly. It ran after him continually like a dog. 
 When he came back from an absence, it bleated for 
 joy and ran to meet him as soon as he got inside the hedge. 
 Robinson felt that he was not entirely alone. He had 
 now a living being near him. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) What animals need Robinson fear on his island? Does he 
 know what animals he will or might find? Has he explored his 
 island thoroughly ? Had he gone to school would he not have known 
 more about the climate and animals of the island ? Of what do we 
 make hedges ? Name some hedge plants. Are thistles good hedge 
 plants? Why? Have you seen thistles growing? What animals 
 in our country trouble sheep and goats? 
 
 (6) Can you think of some other way that Robinson might have
 
 92 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 made a shelter for his goat? Do you remember how his mussel- 
 shell spade was made? Why did not Robinson plant the seeds of 
 the plant and thus avoid the labor of transplanting the thistles ? 
 
 (b) What tools now has Robinson invented ? He has invented them 
 as he needed them. Don't you think he could have made a hole 
 through the stone had he known better how to work? Could the 
 Indians bore holes through stone? Have you seen the stone tools 
 in the museum with holes in them? Do you know how they were 
 bored? How did the Indians fasten stone tools on handles. De- 
 scribe the tools you have seen in the museum. 
 
 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (c) Represent Robinson's cave in the hillside with the hedge 
 in front. 
 
 (c) Select a suitable stone and try to make a hole in it. Try to 
 fasten a handle on to some stone tool you have made.

 ROBINSON GETS READY FOR WINTER 
 PREPARATION 
 
 When, at what time in the year, did Robinson arrive in the island ? 
 Does Robinson yet know in what zone he is? Or maybe he does 
 not know about hot and cold places on the earth. Did he study his 
 geography? Does he know about the changes of seasons at the 
 place he now is? What were the seasons at the place he came 
 from? Would he not naturally suppose that he would have the 
 same changes in the island? Would he not worry about the com- 
 ing of winter? Is Robinson now in shape for winter coming? 
 Has he warm clothing? Is his shelter warm enough to protect 
 him? Has he a good supply of food? Do you know whether or 
 not there is really winter in Robinson's Island? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 There was one thing that troubled Robinson greatly. 
 "What will become of me when the winter comes? I 
 will have no fire to warm me. I have no clothing to pro- 
 tect me from the cold, and where shall I find food when 
 snow and ice cover all the ground and when the trees 
 are bare and the spring is frozen ? It will be cold then in 
 my cave ; what shall I do ? It is cold and rainy already. 
 I believe this is harvest time and winter will soon be here. 
 Winter and no stove, no winter clothing, no winter store 
 of food and no winter dwelling. What shall I do?" He 
 
 93
 
 94 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 considered again the project of making fire. He again 
 sought out two pieces of wood and sat down and rubbed 
 them together. The sweat rolled down his face. When 
 the wood began to get warm his hand would become 
 tired, and he would have to stop. When he began again 
 the wood was cold. He worked for an hour or two, then 
 he laid the wood aside and said, "I don't believe I can 
 do it. I must do the next best thing. I can at least 
 get warm clothing to protect me from the rain and snow." 
 He looked down at his worn, thin clothing, his trousers, 
 his shirt, his jacket; they had become so thin and worn 
 that they were threadbare. 
 
 "I will take the skins of the hares which I have shot 
 and will make me some clothing," he thought. He washed 
 and cleaned them, but he needed a knife and he set about 
 making one. He split one end of a tough piece of wood, 
 thrust his stone blade in it and wound it with cocoa fibre. 
 His stone knife now had a handle. He could now cut 
 the skins quite well. But what should he do for needle 
 and thread ? Maybe the vines would do. "But they are 
 hardly strong enough," he thought. He pulled the sinews 
 from the bones of the rabbit and found them hard. Maybe 
 he could use them. He found fish skeletons on the sea- 
 shore and bored a hole in the end of the small, sharp rib 
 bones. Then he threaded his bone needle with the rab- 
 bit sinews and attempted to sew, but it would not go. 
 His needle broke. The skin was too hard. He bored 
 holes in the edge of the pieces of skin and sewed through 
 the holes. This went very well. 
 
 He sewed the skins together with the hair side inward, 
 made himself a jacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, and 
 finally covered his parasol with rabbit skin, for the rain had 
 already dripped through the leaves of it. All went well,
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 95 
 
 only the trousers did not fit. He loosened them and 
 puckered them to no purpose. "Anyway," he thought, 
 "I am now well protected from the cold, when it does 
 come." 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Where on the earth's surface is it coldest ? Where warmest ? 
 Do you know about the zones? Do you know about the Frigid, the 
 Torrid, and the Temperate Zones? What changes of seasons are 
 there in the Temperate Zones? In the Torrid or hot zone? Do 
 plants shed their leaves and rest in the hot zone? Do you know 
 any plant at home that does not shed its leaves during the winter? 
 Do you know any plant that bears fruit continuously? When does 
 our harvest time come? Does winter follow our grain harvest? 
 It follows our com and apple harvest. Is it cold in the rainy season 
 in the hot zones? 
 
 (b) How do savages dress? Out of what do they make their 
 clothes? The Indians? The Eskimos? The Savages? Have 
 you seen the Indian and Eskimo clothing in the Museum? How 
 was it put together? What do Indians and Eskimos use for thread ? 
 For needles? Does their sewing show skill and care? Is rabbit 
 skin good for clothing? Do you think Robinson found the same 
 kind of rabbits there, that we have ? Would they have thick fur like 
 ours? Would ours furnish good material for making clothing for 
 the hot zone? Have you seen stone knives in the museum? The 
 Indians used stone knives. Do you know about making thread, 
 yam, and cloth ? Why did not Robinson continue his weaving and 
 make some cloth for his clothes ? Could he not have spun yam for 
 the cloth out of cocoanut fiber? See if you cannot weave from this 
 fibre on your looms. 
 
 (c) Had Robinson been thankful for good things at home, for 
 food, clothing, friends? Do you suppose he appreciated them now? 
 Do you suppose that he ever thinks of old times and wishes that the 
 past might be wiped out? Who gives you food and clothing? Who 
 prepares for you food and clothing for winter and a warm house to 
 live in ? Is Robinson now lazy ? What has made him better ? Do 
 you like the way he works now? Does he have time to loiter away? 
 Has he his time filled with work?

 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (o) You will now need to study Robinson's appearance in his 
 new suit and make careful drawings of him. Draw his stone knife 
 with handle. 
 
 (c) Try to make a needle out of bone. Would it not be diffi- 
 cult for you to make a stone knife as Robinson did ?

 HOW ROBINSON LAYS UP A STORE OF FOOD 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Can you think what foods Robinson could store up for use at 
 a time when none could be gathered? What do we use to pre- 
 serve meats? How are fruits preserved ? How are grains kept? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Now for the food. Could Robinson preserve the meat? 
 He had often heard his mother tell about preserving meat 
 in salt. He had even eaten salt meat, pickled meat. 
 But where could he get salt? 
 
 One day when the wind blew hard the water was driven 
 upon the shore and filled a little hollow. After a few days 
 the ground glistened white as snow, where the water had 
 been. Was it snow? Robinson took it in his hands 
 and put it in his mouth. It was salt. The sun had 
 evaporated the water in the hollow — had vaporized it — 
 and the air had drunk it up. What was left behind ? 
 Salt. Now he could get salt as long as he needed it. 
 
 He took cocoanut shells and strewed salt in them. 
 Then he cut the rabbit meat in thin strips, rubbed them 
 with salt, and laid them one on the other in the salt in the 
 shells. He covered it over with a layer of salt. He put 
 over each shell the half of a larger one and weighted it 
 
 97
 
 98 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 down with stones. After a period of fourteen days he 
 found the meat quite red. It had pickled. 
 
 But he did not stop here. He gathered and stored in 
 his cellar cocoanuts and com in such quantities that he 
 would be supplied for a whole winter. It seemed best 
 to catch a number of rabbits, build a house for them and 
 keep them. Then he could kill one occasionally and have 
 fresh meat. Then it came to him that goats would be 
 much better, for they would give milk. He determined 
 immediately to have a herd of goats. He made a string 
 or lasso out of cocoa fibre. 
 
 Then he went out, slipped up quietly to a herd of goats 
 and threw the lasso over one. But the lasso slipped from 
 the horns and the goat ran away. The next day he had 
 better luck. He threw the lasso, drew it tight and the 
 goat was captured. He brought it home. He rejoiced 
 when he saw that it gave milk. He was happy when he 
 got his first cocoa shell full of sweet rich milk. His goat 
 herd grew. He soon had five goats. He had no more 
 room in his yard. He could not provide food enough. 
 He must let them out. "I must make another hedge 
 around my yard so that the goats can get food and yet be 
 kept from going away. He got stakes from the woods 
 and gathered them before his cave. He sharpened them 
 and began to drive them in the earth. But it rained more 
 and more each day. He was wet through as he worked. 
 He had finally to stop work, for the rain was too heavy. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (b) How do we obtain salt? Do we get any by evaporating salt 
 water? What is it to evaporate? Could he not have dried his 
 meat? Would this not have been better? Why did he not do this?
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 99 
 
 Is not dried meat better tlian salt or pickled meat? Do you think 
 Robinson could have succeeded in taming or keeping his rabbits? 
 
 Which kind of life is better — hunting or being a shepherd? 
 Which is safer? At which does one have to work the harder? 
 Robinson was now both a hunter and a shepherd. Did Robinson 
 know what this rain meant? 
 
 Do animals make preparation for winter in our climate ? Do they 
 in tropic climates? 
 
 For what do they make preparation ? How many seasons in tropic 
 countries? Tell of the winter preparations of some animals you 
 know of? Do plants prepare for winter? Do they in the same 
 way as plants? How do animals prepare for winter? How do 
 plants ?

 ROBINSON'S DIARY 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 How do you suppose we know what Robinson did while he was 
 alone on the island? Has he yet fcund a way to write anything 
 down ? Do you suppose he will ? What is needed in order for him 
 to write down things as they happen from day to day? He needs 
 paper, ink and pens. Do you think of anything that could be used 
 instead of paper? Anything instead of our ink? Instead of our 
 steel and gold pens? 
 
 Write a story telling how Robinson finally got together the things 
 needed to write with. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson was much disturbed because he had no means 
 of keeping a record of things as they happened from day 
 to day. He had his calendar, it is true. He would not 
 lose track of the time. But he wished for some way to 
 write down his thoughts and what happened. So he 
 kept up keen search for anything that would serve him 
 for this purpose. 
 
 Every time he journeyed about the island he kept care- 
 ful watch for something that he might write upon. He 
 thought of the leaves of the palm tree, the white under 
 surface of the shelf fungus. But these he found would 
 not do. He tried many kinds of bark and leaves. There 
 was a kind of tall reed or grass growing in the marshes
 
 I02 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 whose rind scemtd good when dried. He examined the 
 inner bark of many trees. He at last found that the inner 
 bark of a tree which resembled our elm tree worked best. 
 He would cut through the bark with his stone knife around 
 the tree. At about one foot from this he would cut an- 
 other ring. He then would cut through the bark length- 
 wise from one circular cut to the other. He could then 
 peel off the section easily. While it was yet full of sap he 
 would separate the soft, tough, thin inner layer of the 
 bark. This usually came off in sheets without a break. 
 When these sheets of bark were stretched and dried 
 they could be used very nicely instead of paper. 
 
 Robinson next searched for something that would serve 
 him as ink, and this was much easier to find than paper. 
 He had noticed many kinds of galls of many different 
 colors growing on trees. He did not know what they 
 were, or how they grew, but he had learned in his father's 
 store that ink was often made from galls gathered from 
 trees. "Anyway," he thought, "I can get ink from the 
 cuttle-fish." He had watched this animal get away from 
 its enemies by sending out a cloud of purplish fluid, in 
 which to hide as it darted away. He had learned also 
 that indigo is made from the leaves of a plant. He had 
 noticed a plant growing in the open places in the forest 
 whose leaves turned black when dried. 
 
 Robinson gathered a quantity of gall-nuts and soaked 
 them in water. To the black fluid thus obtained he added 
 a little rice water to make it flow well, and this served very 
 well as an ink. He kept his ink in a cup made from a 
 cocoanut shell. 
 
 He was not long in getting a pen, though the lack of 
 a good sharp knife made it hard to make a good one. 
 In going about he had gathered a quantity of large feathers.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 103 
 
 He saved these for the time when he should have his paper 
 and ink ready. Now, he cut away a quill to a point and 
 split it up a little way. He was now supplied with writing 
 materials. "It it not wonderful," he thought, "how all 
 our wants are tilled ? We have only to want a thing badly 
 enough and it comes." 
 
 Robinson began at once to write down the date for each 
 day and the main thing he did or that happened on it. 
 He called this his diary. He had now a better way of 
 keeping time than on his tree calendar. He did not need 
 it any more. 
 
 You have no doubt wondered how Robinson could 
 work in his cave, especially at night without a light. The 
 truth is, it was a great source of discomfort to him. At 
 sunset he was in total darkness in his cave. During the 
 daylight enough streamed in from the open doorway. 
 To be alone in total darkness is not pleasant. "If I only 
 had fire!" he said again and again. 
 
 He watched the many large beetles and fire-flies flash 
 their light in the dark of the evening as he sat in front of 
 his shelter. The thought came to him that if he only 
 had some way of keeping together a number of them, 
 they would serve very well for a candle in his cave at 
 night. How he longed for a glass bottle such as he had 
 so often wantonly broken when at home! Back of his 
 shelter there was a hill where the rock layers jutted out. 
 He had noticed here several times the thin transparent 
 rock that he had seen in his father's store. It is called 
 isinglass. "I will make a living lantern," he said aloud 
 in his eagerness. He soon had a suitable piece pried 
 loose. He cut a part of a cocoanut shell away and in its 
 place he put a sheet of isinglass. That evening at dark 
 he gathered several handfuls of the great fire beetles and
 
 I04 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 put them in his lantern. What joy their glow gave him 
 in his cave, at night. It was almost as much comfort as a 
 companion. But while it lighted up the deep dark of the 
 cave and enabled him to move about, he was unable after 
 all to write in his diary at night. Every morning he set 
 his captives free. In the evening he would go out and 
 capture his light. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) The bark of trees, uses, etc. Bark of birches and elm trees. 
 Galls on plant, causes and uses. The squid or cuttle fish. The

 ROBINSON IS SICK 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What will Robinson do for someone to help him if he gets sick? 
 Will he not die without care ? What do we do for help, when sick ? 
 Poor Robinson has no one upon whom he may call in time of need. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 One evening Robinson went to bed sound and well. 
 The next morning he was sick. Before he had only the 
 heat of the day to complain of. To-day he was freezing. 
 He wanted to go to work to get warm, but even this did 
 not break his chill. It increased till his teeth chattered 
 with the cold. 
 
 "Perhaps," thought he, "if I can sleep a little I will get 
 better." But he could not sleep. He was burning with 
 fever and then shaking with cold by turns. He felt a 
 strong thirst, but he was so weak that he could scarcely 
 get the goat's milk. He had no sooner drank the milk 
 than his tongue was as dry as before. He felt better after 
 a night of sleep, but the next day his fever and chills were 
 worse than before. Then he bethought him of his parents. 
 How kindly his mother had taken care of him! Now no 
 one was near that could assist him. "Ah," he sighed, 
 
 io6
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 107 
 
 "must I die here? Who would bury mc? There is 
 no one to miss me." At this the tears came to his eyes. 
 
 His sickness increased with each day. Occasionally 
 the fever would go down sufficiently to allow him to get 
 something to eat. Then it would be worse than before. 
 In his dire need he wanted to pray, but he was so weak 
 that he could only slammer, "Dear God, help me, or I 
 shall die!" 
 
 One night he had a strange dream. He thought he 
 saw his good old father standing before him calling to him. 
 He spread out his arms and cried aloud, "Here I am, 
 here I am!" He tried to get up, but he was so weak that 
 he fell back fainting. 
 
 He lay there a long time, but finally came to. He felt 
 a burning thirst, but no one reached him a drop of water. 
 He prepared to die. He folded his hands and prayed 
 to God that he would be merciful to him. He prayed for- 
 giveness from his parents. Once more he raised his head 
 and gazed wildly around, then he sank back and knew 
 no more. 
 
 When he again awoke he felt better. His hot fever had 
 gone. He attempted to walk. He had just enough strength 
 to crawl to the table and fetch a shell of water. W^hen 
 he tried to walk he had to sit down at every two or three 
 steps. 
 
 From this he recovered gradually, growing better and 
 better, and he thanked God inwardly for his recovery. 
 His sickness had continued from June 18 to July 3.
 
 io8 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (c) Does not Robinson miss the many comforts of his home? 
 Who had nursed him when at home? Did he not have a fine, soft 
 bed to sleep in ? Do you not wonder what kind of bed he now has ? 
 Will he not now recall the kindness of his mother and father? Can 
 you think of anything more pitiable than Robinson's condition? 
 One in prison has companions and a nurse and a doctor when one is 
 ill. Is it not sad to think of Robinson lying long weeks at the point 
 of death with no one near?

 ROBINSON'S BOWER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What was Robinson's reason for making his home in the cave? 
 Has he found any animals he needs to fear? Is it healthful to live 
 in a cave? Maybe Robinson's sickness was brought on because 
 he lived under ground. Tell how he may remedy this and get a 
 better place to sleep. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson's sickness set him thinking about his home. 
 He had been so afraid of animals when he came to the 
 island that he thought of nothing but protection from 
 them. He had been now a year on the island and had 
 seen nothing more dangerous than a goat. The fear of 
 animals had practically faded away. In thinking over 
 his sickness he made up his mind that it was caused by 
 sleeping in his cave where the sun never shone. The 
 ventilation seemed good, but the walls were damp, especi- 
 ally in the rainy season. Then the water would trickle 
 down through the cleft in spite of all he could do. 
 
 He resolved to build, if possible, a little cottage, or, 
 
 as he called it, a bower, in the yard in front of his shelter. 
 
 The hedge of thistles was growing and formed a fence that 
 
 an animal could not get through. His screen of willows 
 
 on the outside of this would soon hide him from view 
 
 109
 
 HO THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 from the sea. He had the wall of rock and the hill be- 
 hind him. 
 
 He planned out his way of building it very carefully. 
 "It must be done," he said (Robinson formed the habit 
 of talking to himself, so that he would not forget how to 
 talk), "without hammer, nails or saw." 
 
 He first sought out four posts, as large as he could well 
 handle. There were always broken trees and branches 
 in the forest. If he searched long enough he could find 
 posts just suited to his need. He wanted four of the 
 same thickness and height and with a fork at the end. 
 After long searching he found what he wanted. He 
 was careful to get those that he could drag to his shelter. 
 
 He placed these in the ground, forming the corners of a 
 square about ten feet long. In the forks he placed poles 
 running around about eight feet from the ground. At 
 about every three feet he fastened others, running in the 
 same way, with heavy cords made of fibre. He found 
 his greatest trouble with the roof. It must be sloped to 
 shed rain. He had to find two more forked posts, three 
 or four feet longer than the others. These he placed 
 opposite each other in the centers of two sides. Upon 
 these he placed a ridge pole. He then laid other poles 
 lengthwise from ridge-pole to the edge of the frames. 
 
 His frame was now done. His plan was now to cover 
 this frame with straw or grasses tied in bundles. He had 
 seen the barns in the country thatched in this way by the 
 Dutch farmers in New York State. He gathered the 
 straw of the wild rice. It was long, straight and tough. 
 It was easily tied into flat bundles. These he bound 
 securely on to the frame work with cords. He began at 
 the bottom so that the ends of the row would lap over the 
 tops of the last one put on.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE in 
 
 In this way he built a very comfortable and rainproof 
 bower. It was easy to make a bed of poles covered with 
 straw. A table and bench were added and shelves of 
 poles. 
 
 Robinson felt great joy over this new home. "I will 
 not now be sick any more," he said. "In case of danger 
 I can get into my cave. But at all other times I will live 
 in my bower." He had use still for his cave. He could 
 use it to store some things in. But he had to be careful 
 about the dampness in wet weather. 
 
 Robinson was getting to feel at home. He was no 
 longer so sad. He did not grieve so much for home. He 
 looked upon his home with great delight. It was secure. 
 He had his herd of goats always in his sight. At evening 
 he would do his milking. He found he could keep the 
 milk for some time in the cave. He was tempted to try 
 making some butter from the good, rich cream. "But," 
 said Robinson, "I have neither vessels to make it in nor 
 bread to eat it on." 
 
 He planned many things to do. " I will make a hammock 
 some day for my bower and some vessels to use in my 
 work," he thought. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (b) Do you think Robinson was right about the reason for his 
 sickness? Is it not strange that Robinson did not build a bower 
 sooner? Why didn't he? It was really easier to make without 
 tools than his cave. 
 
 How is your home given fresh air and sunshine? How is your 
 school-room given fresh air? Have you an engine in the base- 
 ment forcing fresh air in? Find where the fresh air comes in and 
 where the foul air goes out. 
 
 (c) Do you like Robinson for feeling a pride in his home and
 
 112 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 the work of his own hands ? Do we not like him for being cheerful 
 and happy, and for learning to do so many things? 
 
 Fresh air and sunshine are necessary to health. Had Robinson 
 gone to school, he would have learned this. He would have known, 
 too, that there are no dangerous animals in the part of the world 
 where he was. His teachers would have taught him how the bad 
 blood is purified by fresh air. Robinson had felt the need of fresh 
 air. He had opened the cleft above, but this had not been enough. 
 It is Robinson's duty to keep well.

 ROBINSON AGAIN EXPLORES HIS ISLAND 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Does Robinson yet know all about his island? Do you remem- 
 ber his first exploration of it? Will he not wish to know all about 
 it? Maybe that inhabitants may yet be found? Maybe other 
 kinds of fruits, grains and animals are still undiscovered on the 
 island. It may be there are better caves for him to live in and better 
 pasture lands for his goats. Maybe he will find wild cattle and 
 horses. How long has Robinson now been on the island? Has he 
 been there a whole year? We use the word anniversary to name the 
 completion of a year. Name some fruit and grains that you think 
 Robinson may discover if he explores his island thoroughly? Can 
 you tell why Robinson has not explored his island? Do you sup- 
 pose he was afraid ? Of what ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 When Robinson recovered his strength he had a strong 
 
 desire to see more of the island. At first he had been in 
 
 constant fear of wild animals, but now he thought he 
 
 would like to see all there was to see in the island. On 
 
 the 15th of July he started out. First he went to a brook 
 
 which ran into the sea near his cave. Its water was clear 
 
 and pure; along its shore lay beautiful meadows. As 
 
 he came to the upper course of the brook the meadow 
 
 gave way to forest. On the border of the forest he found 
 
 melons and grapes. 
 114
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE] 115 
 
 The night came on and he slept again in a tree. The 
 next morning he went farther and came to a clear rivulet. 
 Here the region was wonderfully beautiful. The flowers 
 bloomed as in a garden, and near the flowers stood the 
 most splendid a[)ple and orange trees. He took as much 
 of the fruit as he could carry and went on his way. This 
 journey continued three days. 7/he grapes which he had 
 carried he dried in the sun and made raisins. 
 
 The loth of September came, one year had passed on 
 the island. He was many hundred miles from home, 
 alone on an island. With tears he cried out, "Ah! what 
 are my dear parents saying? They have no doubt long 
 given me up as dead. If I could only send them a message 
 to comfort them and let them know how much I love 
 them!" 
 
 The day was celebrated as a holiday. He thanked 
 God that He had given him so many good things. Often 
 he had lived the whole day in care and anxiety. Now 
 he tried to be more cheerful and to meet the troubles of 
 each day w^ith courage. 
 
 But Robinson was not yet satisfied. He longed to 
 know more of the island and prepared himself for a greater 
 journey. He slung his hunting pouch over his shoulder, 
 filled it full of food, took his bow and arrows, stuck his 
 stone hatchet in his belt and started on his way. He 
 traveled over meadows, through beautiful forests in which 
 were hundreds of birds. He was delighted as they sang 
 and fluttered about. 
 
 The journey was beautiful and pleasant to Robinson. 
 In the forests he often saw small wild creatures, but he 
 shot nothing. After the first night he slept under a tree 
 in the soft grass, for he had now no fear of wild animals. 
 
 Along the shore he saw great groves of palms with
 
 ii6 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 their great nuts. He saw, too, many goats in all parts 
 of the island. 
 
 Now he was ready to take the shortest way home. He 
 had not gone far before he came into a dark forest. He 
 became confused and wandered about for several days. 
 On the fourth day he came to a little pile of stones, which 
 he had made to mark the way as he was going out. From 
 this place the way was easy to find. On this trip he was 
 gone already two weeks. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (o) What animals has Robinson found up to this time? Is it 
 not strange that he has not said more about birds ? Are not there 
 many birds no doubt on his island ? Maybe Robinson does not care 
 for birds or think them worth his notice. Could they be of any use 
 to him? Has Robinson yet found any dangerous animals? Are 
 there none in this island? The butterflies, too, and moths, Robin- 
 son has not said anything about. Do you think Robinson loved 
 the beautiful things of nature, the birds, flowers, butterflies, and 
 moths? He seems to notice only those animals and plants that he 
 can eat. Is this not because he did not go to school and leani about 
 all the wonderful and beautiful things of nature ? 
 
 Do melons and grapes grow wild? On what kind of plants do 
 these grow? Is the melon a fruit or vegetable? 
 
 (c) Do you not like Robinson because he now remembers his 
 parents and grieves for them? Do you not think his parents would 
 like to hear from him? Robinson, too, was now grateful and thank- 
 ful. He was cheerful and happy. He thanked God for the many 
 good things he had found. Robinson is growing thoughtful. 
 
 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (a) Study the pictures of forests in hot countries in your geo- 
 graphies and make a landscape that you think would represent some- 
 thing like that Robinson saw on his journey. 
 
 Can you draw an orange tree or show the difference between an 
 apple and an orange tree ?

 ROBINSON AND HIS BIRDS 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Would you not like to have Robinson tell about the birds he saw 
 on his trip? Can you tell of any birds he would be likely to see? 
 Did you ever see a bird whose home is in the warm zone ? Tell a 
 story about Robinson catching and taming a parrot. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Of all the things he saw on his journey Robinson was 
 most delighted with the birds. They were of the most 
 beautiful colors. The forest was full of them. They 
 gleamed like jewels in the deep masses of foliage. In the 
 morning their singing filled the air with sound. 
 
 Robinson had never taken much notice of the birds at 
 home. But now every living thing attracted him. He 
 loved to see them happy. He would watch often by the 
 hour and learn the habits of nesting and getting food 
 of nearly every bird on the island. 
 
 Robinson did not know the names of many of the birds 
 he saw on the island. He had to make names for them. 
 The strangest thing he saw on his journey was the nest 
 of what he called the yellow-tail. This bird lives in colonies 
 and makes its nest at the ends of the long leaves of the 
 mountain palm. When he first saw these queer looking 
 
 117
 
 ii8 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 sacks hanging from ihc kaves he was amazed. He had 
 never seen so strange a sight. From the end of each great 
 leaf hung a long, closely woven nest. Robinson could not 
 make out at first what they were. Soon, however, he saw 
 the birds come out of the mouths of the nests. Here, one 
 hundred feet from the ground, they hung their nests. 
 But they were perfectly safe. 
 
 He had not gone far from the tree in which the yellow- 
 tails had their nests when he was suddenly startled by a 
 voice crying, "Who, who are you?" Robinson was 
 greatly frightened and hid beneath the drooping branches 
 of a cedar tree. He feared every moment that the owner 
 of the voice would make his appearance. But it kept at 
 a distance. Every few minutes from the depths of the 
 forest would come the doleful cry, "Who, who are you?" 
 Robinson did not dare to stir from his hiding place. He 
 remained there over night. After the night came on he 
 heard the strange voice no more. 
 
 The next day he renewed his journey. He saw many 
 birds that were wholly strange to him. There was a kind 
 of wild pigeon that built its home in a hole in the rock. 
 It was a most beautiful bird with long, slender, graceful 
 feathers in its tail. He saw the frigate bird soaring high 
 aloft above the island. The numbers and beauty of the 
 humming-birds amazed Robinson. They were of all 
 colors. One had a bill in the shape of a sickle. The 
 most brilliant of them all was the ruby-crested humming- 
 bird. 
 
 Near noon, while Robinson was shielding himself from 
 the scorching heat of the sun in a deep, shaded glen, he 
 was startled again by the strange voice crying, "Who, who, 
 who are you?" He lay quite still, determined if possible 
 to allow the voice to come, if it would, within sight. He
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 119 
 
 heard it slowly coming up the glen. Each time it repeated 
 the cry it sounded nearer. At last he saw spying at him 
 through the boughs of the tree under which he was lying 
 a large bird with soft, silky feathers of green and chest- 
 nut. "Who, who, who arc you?" said the bird. Rob- 
 inson could not help but laugh. He had been frightened 
 at the cry of a bird. 
 
 But the bird that interested Robinson most was the 
 parrot. There were several kinds of them. They flew 
 among the trees with great noise and clatter and shriek- 
 ing. Robinson determined if possible to secure one for a 
 pet. "T can teach it to talk," he said, "and I will have 
 something to talk to." As soon as he returned home he set 
 about catching one. He noticed that a number were in 
 the habit of visiting an old tree near the shelter every 
 morning. He planned to snare one and tried several 
 mornings, but lie could not get one into the snare. He 
 tried to hit one with his bow and arrow. He at last suc- 
 ceeded in hitting one and stunning it so that it fell to the 
 ground. He ran rapidly to pick it uj), but before he 
 could get to where it lay in the bushes it had disappeared. 
 
 After thinking the matter over he concluded that it 
 would be much better to get a pair of young birds and 
 raise them. The old ones would be hard to tame and 
 difficult to teach. It was easy enough to find a nest in a 
 hollow tree. He secured from the nest two birds just 
 ready to fly. He made a cage for them out of willow 
 rods. He placed the cage at the entrance of his cave and 
 studied how he would feed them, ]\Iuch to his surj)rise 
 the parent birds discovered their \'oung ones and brought 
 them food and fed them through the open work of the 
 cage. When the birds were grown they rapidly learned 
 to talk. Robinson took great delight in teaching them.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 He taught them to call his name and when he came near 
 they would call out, "Poor old Robinson Crusoe!" 
 These birds remained for many years with Robinson. 
 In fact, he was never afterward without a parrot. They 
 helped him to pass away very pleasantly many hours 
 that without them would have been sad. 
 
 Another bird that Robinson loved was the little house 
 wren. This bird was exceedingly tame and friendly. 
 It was a very sweet and strong singer. It loved to make 
 its nest in or near his shelter. There it would build 
 and rear its young, within reach of his hands, while its 
 throat was always bursting with melody. 
 
 The mocking bird, too, always nested near and awakened 
 him in the morning with its wonderful song. 
 
 Robinson became a great friend and favorite of the 
 bird inhabitants of the island. They seemed to know 
 him and showed no fear when near him. This pleased 
 him very much.

 ROBINSON GETS FIRE 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Do you think Robinson still wishes for fire? How many ways 
 has Robinson tried to get fire ? Should he not try again ? Do you 
 think of any other way in which he might get fire? How will he 
 keep it when he does get it? How will fire help him? Is not the 
 climate warm? What changes will it make in his way of life? 
 Tell how Robinson finally gets fire. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson was now pretty comfortable. He had his 
 bower with its chair and table. He had his cave in case 
 of danger. He had his cellar in which to keep his meat. 
 He would sit in the shade near the door of his bower and 
 think of the many things he should be thankful for. But 
 there was one hardship that Robinson could not get used 
 to and that was the eating of raw food. "How fine it 
 would be if only I could parch a few grains of corn in the 
 fire! I could live hke a prince," thought he, "if I had 
 fire. I would grind some of my corn into flour and 
 make some corn bread or cakes and cook rice." He did 
 so long for roasted meat and determined to again make 
 the attempt to get fire. 
 
 Robinson was fast losing his idle, thoughtless ways of 
 doing things. He had become a thoughtful and diligent
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 123 
 
 man in the short timu that he had been on the island. 
 Trouble and hardship had made a man of him. "1 must 
 think the whole matter of getting fire over carefully," 
 he said. He had failed twice and was now resolved to 
 succeed. "If the lightning would only strike a tree," 
 he thought, "and set it on fire. But he could not wait 
 for such a thing to happen, and how could he keep it 
 when once thus obtained ? It was clear he must have 
 some way of producing fire when he wanted it, just as 
 they did at home? He thought over the ways he had 
 tried and the one most likely to be successful. He re- 
 solved to make a further trial of the method by twirling 
 a stick in his hands. He selected new wood that was hard 
 and dry. He carefully sharpened a stick about eighteen 
 inches long and, standing it upright in a hollow in the 
 block of wood, began to roll it between his hands. By 
 the time Robinson's hands were well hardened, it seemed 
 that he was going to succeed at last. But he lacked the 
 skill to be obtained only by long practice. 
 
 "If I could only make it go faster," he said. There 
 must be some way of doing this. I believe I can do it. 
 I used to make my top spin round with a cord ; I wonder 
 if I can use the cord here." The only cord he had was 
 attached to his bow. He was going to take it off when 
 a thought struck him. He loosened the string a bit and 
 twisted it once about his spindle. Then he drew the bow 
 back and forth. The spindle was turned at a great rate. 
 He saw he must hold one end with his left hand while 
 the other rested in the hollow in the block. With his 
 right, he drew the bow back and forth. How eagerly 
 he worked! He had twirled but a few minutes when the 
 dust in the hollow burst into fire from the heat produced 
 by the rapidly twirling spindle.
 
 124 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 Robinson was too overjoyed to make any use of it. He 
 danced and capered about like one gone mad until the 
 fire had gone out. But that was of no matter now, since 
 he could get fire when he wanted it. 
 
 He hastened to make him a rude fireplace and oven of 
 stones. He hollowed out a place in the ground and lined 
 and covered it with large flat stones. On one side he 
 built up a chimney to draw up the smoke and make the 
 fire burn brightly. He brought wood and some dry fungus 
 or mushroom. This he powdered and soon had fire 
 caught in it. He kindled in this way the wood in his 
 stove and soon had a hot fire. 
 
 The first thing he did in the way of cooking was to 
 roast some rabbit meat on a spit or forked stick held in his 
 hand over the fire. Nothing Robinson had ever eaten was 
 to be compared to this. 
 
 "I can do many things now," thought Robinson. "My 
 work will not be nearly so hard. My fire will be my ser- 
 vant and help me make my tools as well as cook my food. 
 I can now cook my corn and rice." 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Lightning. 
 
 (b) How Indians produced fire. The Eskimos. The primitive 
 or early men. Name the uses of fire to men. What use besides

 fire ? Do you know whether any races of men now use Robinson's 
 method?

 ROBINSON MAKES BASKETS 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Now that Robinson is making ready for a time when he can not 
 get food, how or in what can he store his com and other grains? 
 Will they not spoil if put on the floor of the cave? How do you 
 think Robinson will meet this new need? In what kind of vessels 
 do we store away our grains and vegetables? What kind of vessels 
 would be easiest for Robinson to make? Out of what materials can 
 he best make vessels? Could he make them of stone? Would 
 shells of cocoanut be large enough ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson still continued anxious about his food supply 
 when he could no longer gather it fresh from the fields 
 and forest. Corn had again become ripe. He had 
 found in a wet marshy place some wild rice-plants loaded 
 with ripened grain. As he now had fire he only had to 
 have some way of storing up grains and he would not lack 
 for food. He knew that grain stored away must be kept 
 dry and that he must especially provide against dampness 
 in his cave or in his bower. 
 
 If he only had some baskets. These would be just the 
 
 thing. But how was he to get them? Robinson had 
 
 never given a thought to either material or the method of 
 
 making them. He, however, was gradually acquiring 
 
 126

 skill and confidence in himself. So far he had managed 
 to meet all his wants. He had invented tools and made 
 his own clothes and shelter, and, "Now," said he to him- 
 self, "I will solve the new problem. I must first study 
 the materials that I have at hand." He remembered the 
 splint market baskets in which his father took vegetables 
 home from the store. He recalled how the thin splints 
 were woven. 
 
 "They went over and under," he said. "That is 
 simple enough if I had the splints." He set himself, 
 diligently to work to find a plant whose bark or split; 
 branches could be used for splints. He tried to peel off 
 the rough outer bark of several trees in order to examine 
 the inner layers of soft fibrous material. He found several 
 trees that gave promise of furnishing abundance of long, 
 thin strips, but the labor of removing the bark with his 
 rude imperfect tools was so great that he resolved that he 
 would have to find some other kind of material. "Why 
 need the strips be flat?" he thought. "I believe T could 
 weave them in the same way if I used the long, thin, 
 tough willow rods I saw growing by the brookside, when 
 I was returning from my journey." 
 
 He found on trial that the weaving went very well, but 
 that he must have strong, thick rods or ribs running up 
 and down to give strength and form to his basket. He 
 worked hard, but it was slow work. It was three days 
 before his first basket was done. He made many mis- 
 takes and was obliged many times to undo what he 
 had accomplished in order to correct some error. And 
 at last when he had woven the basket as large as he thought 
 was suitable for his purpose, he did not know how to 
 stop or finish the top so as to keep the basket from un- 
 raveling. At last he hit upon the plan of fastening two
 
 128 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 stout rods, one outside, the other inside, the basket. These 
 he sewed firmly, over and over, to the basket with a kind 
 of fibre ?rom a plant he had discovered that looked almost 
 to be what he had heard called the century plant in the 
 parks at home. 
 
 On attempting his next basket he thought long how he 
 might improve and save time. He must hasten, or the 
 now almost daily rains would destroy his ripened wild 
 corn and rice. 
 
 "If I could use coils of that long grass, I saw growing in 
 the marsh beside the rice," he thought, " I could make twice 
 the progress. He gathered an armful, twisted it into 
 cables about an inch thick and wove it into his frame 
 of upright rods instead of the horizontal layer of willow 
 canes. This answered his purpose just as well and 
 rendered the making of large baskets the work of a few 
 hours. He found, however, that the willow rods or osiers 
 were not pliant enough to work well in fastening his coils 
 of grass cables together. He tried several things and at 
 last succeeded best when he used the long thread-like 
 fibre of the century-like plant. He had, however, to make 
 a stout framework of rods. He would first coil his grass 
 rope into this frame and then sew it together with twine 
 or thread made from this fibre. 
 
 He afterwards tried making smaller and finer baskets 
 out of the fibre that he had discovered, which could be 
 easily had from the thick-leaved plant he thought he had 
 seen at home. He first used long, tough, fine roots he 
 had seen when digging up the tree at the mouth of his 
 cave. Afterwards he discovered some tall, tough reeds 
 growing near by. He laid in a supply of these. He 
 found that when he wanted to use them, a good soaking in 
 water made them as pliable and tough as when first cut.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 129 
 
 The making of the baskets and storing up grains made 
 it possible for Robinson to become a farmer and thus 
 make himself independent. This thought was a great 
 relief to him. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Do you know the agave plant ? It is a native of Mexico and 
 the tropics. From it we get sisal, a long, coarse fibre out of which 
 we make twine and coarse cloths. Maybe it was a species of the 
 agave that Robinson found yielding a fibre. Do you know from 
 what plant v/e get raffia? 
 
 (b) Do we use willow rods for making baskets ? Have you seen 
 baskets made of them ? Name the diflferent materials you have seen 
 in baskets and let us write them down. Have you seen Indian 
 baskets? What material do they use ? Are they not skillfully woven? 
 Some Indians weave baskets in the same manner that Robinson did 
 and weave them so carefully that they will hold water. Indian 
 women make beautiful baskets. They ornament them in many 
 ways. They weave in plants and animal forms by using different 
 colored fibres. 
 
 Do you think the making of baskets an important event in Robin- 
 son's island life? Tell the use of baskets and the changes it made 
 possible in his ways of living. The carrying and storing up food 
 stufl^, nuts and grains, vegetables and roots are of the greatest im- 
 portance to good living. What animals store up foods? How is 
 it carried ? See " First Steps in Human Progress," Chapter V.

 ROBINSON BECOMES A FARMER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Tell what changes Robinson will now make in his getting food. 
 How do we get our food ? Does the com and grain we use for food 
 grow wild? Wild plants did not yield very much for Robinson 
 nor did he always know where to find it. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson had now been on the island long enough to 
 know how the seasons changed. He found that there were 
 two kinds of weather there, wet weather and dry weather. 
 There were two wet seasons in each year and two dry 
 ones. During the wet seasons, which lasted nearly three 
 months, Robinson had to remain pretty closely at home, 
 and could not gather grain, for the plants were then start- 
 ing from the seeds. It ripened in the dry seasons. Rob- 
 inson soon found that he must have a store of corn and 
 wild rice for food during the rainy seasons. He, however, 
 knew nothing about planting and harvesting, nor prepar- 
 ing the ground for seed. 
 
 He had it all to learn with no teacher or books to in- 
 struct him. He found a little space near his dwelling 
 free from trees and thought he would plant some corn 
 seed here. He did not know the proper time for plant- 
 
 131
 
 132 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 ing. He thought because it was warm seed would grow 
 at any time. It happened his first seed was put in at the 
 beginning of the dry season. He watched and waited to 
 rejoice his eyes with the bright green of sprouting corn, but 
 the seed did not grow. There was no rain and the sun's 
 heat parched the land till it was dry and hard on the up- 
 land where his corn was planted. 
 
 "Very well," thought Robinson, " I will plant it at the be- 
 giiming of the wet season, either in March or September." 
 He did so, the seed quickly sprouted up. But the weeds, 
 shrubs and vines sprouted as quickly and before Robin- 
 son was aware, his corn was overgrown and choked out 
 by a rank growth of weeds and vines. "I see," said 
 Robinson, "that I must thoroughly prepare the soil be- 
 fore planting my seed." But he had no spade and no 
 other tool that would stand the strain of digging among 
 tough matted roots. But he must succeed. He put a 
 new handle in the stone hoe or pick he had already made. 
 His mussel shell spade was worn out. He must set him- 
 self to fashion out another. He decided to make one 
 from the tough heavy wood of a tree that grew plentifully 
 in the forest. 
 
 He was lucky enough to find a tree of this kind whose 
 bole had been split lengthwise by the falling of an old 
 rotten tree near it. With his stone tools and the help of 
 fire he managed after several days' work to make a wide 
 sharpened tool out of one of the large pieces split off. 
 It was a little over three feet long. He had trimmed 
 one end small and cut notches in the sides about one foot 
 from the flat end. He could place his foot in the notch 
 and thrust his wooden spade into the earth. With his 
 rude tool he dug up and turned the soil of a small space 
 of ground several times to kill the vines and weeds. His
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 133 
 
 corn quickly sprouted after this attempt and outstripped 
 the weeds and vines which Robinson constantly had to 
 hold in check by pulling and hoeing. He was rejoiced 
 at his growing crop and went each morning to feast his 
 eyes on the rapidly expanding leaves and ears. 
 
 One morning as he came in sight of the little clearing 
 he thought he saw something disappearing in the low 
 brush on the other side as he approached. Alas, his labor 
 had been in vain! A herd of wild goats had found out 
 the place and had utterly destroyed his crop. Robinson 
 sat down nearby and surveyed the ruin of his little field. 
 "It is plain," thought he, *'I will have to fence in the field 
 or I will never be able to harvest my crop. I cannot watch 
 it all the time." 
 
 He had already learned from his experience in making 
 the fence around the goat pasture that the branches of 
 many kinds of shrubs and trees, when broken off and 
 thrust into the ground, will send out roots and leaves 
 and at length if planted close together in a line, will 
 form a thick hedge which no kind of beast can get through 
 or over. He found out some willow trees where branches 
 broke easily and soon had enough to thrust into the 
 ground about six inches apart around the entire edge of 
 his little field, which contained about one eighth of an 
 acre. 
 
 After this hedge had grown so as to be a fair protection 
 to his crop he tried planting again at the proper season. 
 He spaded up the ground and pulled out the matted roots 
 as best he could and with great pains and care planted his 
 corn in straight even rows. To make them straight and 
 each hill of corn the same distance from its neighbors, 
 he first marked off the ground in squares whose sides were 
 about three and one half feet long.
 
 134 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 "Now," thought he, "I will reap the reward of my 
 labor." The corn grew rapidly, and toward the end of 
 the first dry season was filling out and ripening its ears. 
 But to Robinson's dismay a new danger threatened his 
 crop against which he could not fence. He was in de- 
 spair. The birds were fast eating and destroying his 
 partially ripened corn. He could not husk it yet. It was 
 not ripe enough. He thought how easy it would be to 
 protect his field if he had a gun. But he had learned 
 that it is useless to give time to idle dreaming. He must 
 do something and that quick. 
 
 "If I could catch some of these rascals," he thought. 
 "I would hang them up on poles, dead, as a warning to the 
 rest." It seemed almost a hopeless task, but he went about 
 it. It was in vain he tried to kill some of them by throw- 
 ing rocks and sticks. He could not get near enough to 
 them. At length he laid snares and succeeded in snaring 
 three birds. He had learned to weave a pliable, strong 
 thong out of cocoa and other fibre that he was now ac- 
 quainted with. The birds thus caught he fastened on 
 broken branches of trees which he stuck into the earth 
 in different parts of his field. The birds heeded the 
 warning and visited his corn field no more that season. 
 
 At the end of the season he gathered or husked his 
 corn and after it was thoroughly dry he shelled it from 
 the cob with his hands. He used his baskets in which 
 to carry his husked ears from the field to his cave and in 
 which to store it when shelled. He found that the ears 
 were larger and better filled and plumper than when the 
 plants grew wild. He selected the largest and best filled 
 ears for his seed the next time. In this way his new crop 
 of corn was always better in kind and yielded more than 
 the old one.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 13S 
 
 At first he grew two crops a year, but by experimenting 
 he found out about how much he needed for his own use 
 and planted once a year enough to give him a liberal sup- 
 ply. 
 
 He observed that the wild rice grew in swampy lands, 
 so that he did not make the mistake of trying to raise it 
 upon the upland where the corn grew best. He saw at 
 once that the planting of rice on low, marshy or wet land 
 was beyond his present strength and tools. "Some time 
 in the future," he thought, "I may try it." 
 
 Robinson also found wild grapes in abundance. These 
 he dried by hanging them on the branches of trees. He 
 thus had a store of raisins for each rainy season. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) The seasons and changes in occupations. Do we have 
 regular seasons of wet and dry weather? Do the winds always 
 blow from one direction ? They blow from one direction in the hot 
 zones. Keep a daily weather record. 
 
 (b) Name the grains that farmers plant. How does the farmer 
 plant com and the grains? Wheat, rye, oats? How does he pre- 
 pare the soil ? He almost always puts in the soil some kind of plant 
 food. Robinson's soil was rich with plant food. Have you seen 
 corn gathered or harvested ? Sometimes it is husked as it is gathered. 
 How are wheat and other grains gathered from the field? Robin- 
 son probably gathered the heads of rice and rubbed out the grains 
 from among the chaffy covering in his hands. Farmers have great 
 machines run by steam for threshing out grain from the straw and 
 chaflf. Different ways of threshing in historical series, etc. 
 
 (c) Is not Robinson to be commended for keeping at his work 
 of raising com until he succeeded? Was he discouraged? Did he 
 give up? We call keeping at a thing until it is done perseverance. 
 How many times did Robinson try before he succeeded? He had 
 to work hard and try again. Motto: "Jf at first you don't suc- 
 ceed, try, try again."

 ROBINSON AS POTTER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Do you think of anything Robinson now must have before he can 
 cook his food? What kind of vessels do we use in which to boil 
 water and cook foods ? Can Robinson make vessels of iron ? Do 
 you think of any way he can get vessels in which to boil water and 
 cook food ? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson was now anxious to cook his food, to boil his 
 rice and vegetables and bake bread, but he could do noth- 
 ing without cooking vessels. He had tried to use cocoa- 
 nut shells, but these were too small and there was no way 
 to keep them from falling over and spilling the contents. 
 He determined to try to make some clay vessels. He 
 knew where he could get a kind of clay that had the ap- 
 pearance of making good ware. It was fine grained and 
 without lumps or pebbles. He was much perplexed to 
 mould the clay into right shapes. He tried taking a lump 
 and shaping it into a vessel with his hands. He tried 
 many times, but each time the clay broke and he was 
 forced to try some other way. He recalled how he had 
 made his basket out of strands of twisted grass and 
 wondered whether he could not make his pots in the same 
 way. 
 
 137
 
 ijS THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 He spun the clay out into a long rope and began to coil 
 it around a small basket forming the layers together with 
 his hands. This was easy, but he did not see clearly how 
 he was going to get the basket out from the inside of the 
 pot. He found he could copy in this way any form he 
 wished, but he finally hit upon the plan of making a form 
 of wicker work and coiling the clay rope inside it, for he 
 saw that whether he succeeded or not in getting the clay 
 free from the basket he could use the pot, and besides if the 
 pot would stand the fire the basket would burn off. To 
 dry the pots Robinson stood them in the sun a few days. 
 When they were dry he tried to cook some soup in one of 
 them. He filled it with water and put it on his stove or 
 oven, but how sadly had he deceived himself. In a 
 short time the water soaked into the clay and soon the 
 pot had fallen to pieces. 
 
 "How foohsh I am!" said Robinson to himself; "the 
 pots have to be fired before they can be used." He set 
 about this at once. He found two stones of equal size 
 placed them near each other and laid a third across these. 
 He then placed three large pots upon them and made a 
 hot fire under them. No sooner had the flame shot up 
 than one of the pots cracked in two. "I probably made 
 the fire too hot at first," thought Robinson. 
 
 He drew out some of the coals and wood, but afterwards 
 gradually increased the fire again. He could not, how- 
 ever, get the pots hot enough to turn red. He brought 
 the dryest and hardest wood, but could not succeed in 
 getting them hot enough to turn red. At length he was 
 tired out and was compelled to give it up. When the 
 pots were cool he tried to boil water in one. It' was no 
 better than the sun dried one. 
 
 He saw that he must provide some way to get the pots
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 139 
 
 mudi holier ihaii hv could in ihc open air. He resolved 
 to make an oven of stones large enough to take in the 
 wood as well as the pots. It must be above ground so 
 that there might be plenty of draught for the fire. With 
 great labor, he pried up and carried together flat stones 
 enough to make an oven about four feet high with a 
 chimney at one side. He had put in the center a stone 
 table on which he could place three quite large pots. 
 He left an opening in one side that could be partially 
 closed by a large, flat stone. 
 
 He worked eagerly and at the end of the second day he 
 was ready to fire his oven. He first carried together a 
 good quantity of dry wood, then he put in his pots and 
 laid the wood around them. In a short time he had a 
 very hot fire. He kept this up all day and until late at 
 night. 
 
 The next morning he went to his oven and found his 
 pots were a beautiful red . He drew out the fire and allowed 
 them to cool slowly. Then he filled one with water and 
 set it over the fire to heat it. Before many minutes the 
 water was boiling and Robinson had another reason to be 
 thankful. He wept for joy. His patient labors had 
 brought their rewards. No prince could feel as happy as 
 Robinson now. He had overcome all difficulties. Start- 
 ing with nothing but his hands, he was now able to supply 
 all his wants. "If I only had a companion now," he 
 thought, "I would have nothing further to wish as long 
 as I stay on the island."

 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (b) What kind of clay is used in making dishes? 
 
 Have you seen a potter's wheel? Potters shape their pots 
 and earthen vessels on a moving wheel. Have you tried shaping 
 vessels with your hands alone? Have you seen a potter's kiln? 
 In this he fires his vessels. He can tell by Ihe color when they are 
 hot enough. Did the Indians make burnt clay vessels? How did 
 they cook food? Do the Eskimos have earthen -ware vessels? 
 Primitive men made pots and vessels. We find broken parts of 
 them in caves and in river sands.

 ROBINSON AS BAKER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 How has Robinson prepared his com and rice up to this? Will 
 he not now try to bake some bread ? How will he prepare his com 
 for making bread ? Will he not need a mill for grinding his com ? 
 Can you tell how to make one? Out of what material would you 
 think Robinson might make a mill? Describe the simplest mill 
 for making flour, and tell how Robinson finally makes flour and 
 bread. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Now that Robinson had fire, he determined to try to 
 make bread. He had seen the servants at home make 
 bread many times, but he had not observed closely and 
 knew next to nothing about the way bread is made. He 
 knew he must in some way grind the corn into flour, 
 but how could he do this? He had no mill nor any tools 
 with which to crush the corn. 
 
 He first tried to find a stone large and hard enough 
 out of which he might hollow a vessel or kind of mortar. 
 He thought he could put the corn into this mortar and 
 grind it by means of another stone or pestle. It was with 
 great difficulty that he could get a stone of suitable size 
 and form. After several days' trial he at last got one cut 
 out from some layers of rock near the shore. He made 
 
 141
 
 142 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 a hollow place in it. Then he took a smaller oblong 
 shaped rock for his pestle. 
 
 He took great pride in these new tools. "I shall soon 
 be a stone-cutter," he said to himself, "as well as a farmer 
 and potter." But his stone mortar was a failure. The 
 rock was too soft. Every time he thrust the pestle down, 
 it loosened small pieces of the stone vessel. These 
 mixed with the ground corn or flour and made it unfit 
 to eat. There was no way to separate the sand from the 
 crushed grain. 
 
 He resolved then to try to make a mortar and pestle 
 of hard wood. Now that he had fire, he could do this, 
 though it cost him many a hard day's work. He found 
 not far away a log of very hard wood. By building 
 a fire at the right distance from one end he was able to 
 separate a piece of the log. He rolled this to his cave and 
 made a good-sized hollow in it by burning. This pestle 
 was not so difficult to make. He took a limb or branch 
 of an iron wood tree, burned it in two at the place to make 
 it the right length. By burning also he rounded one end 
 and then he was ready for the grinding. After cleaning 
 his mortar and pestle carefully he placed some corn in 
 the hollow and soon had some fine yellow meal or flour 
 without any grit or sand in it. 
 
 His next care w^as to separate the coarse outer husk or 
 covering of the kernel from the finer parts that make the 
 meal. He had no sieve. His net was too coarse. It let 
 both bran and meal go through. "I must make a net 
 or cloth fine enough to sift or bolt my flour," said he. 
 Such was now his skill in spinning and weaving that this 
 was not hard to do. He had soon woven in his loom a 
 piece of fine netting which allowed the meal to shake 
 through, but held back the coarse bran or outer husk of
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 143 
 
 the kernel. Out of the dry corn that he had stored up 
 he now made quite a quantity of flour. This he kept 
 tightly covered in a large earthen pot or jar that he had 
 made for this purpose. "I must keep all my food clean 
 and protect it from the ants and other insects as well as 
 dust and damp," he thought. 
 
 His preparations were now nearly made. He had al- 
 ready his stove of flat stones. On this he could set his 
 pots to boil water, cook rice, and meat, but it would not 
 do for baking a loaf of bread of any thickness. He must 
 have an oven or enclosed place into which he could put 
 the loaf to bake it. By the use of flat stones he soon re- 
 built his stove so as to have an oven that did fine service. 
 Now it was mixing the dough that claimed his attention. 
 He had of course no yeast to make raised or light bread. 
 He poured goats' milk on the flour and kneaded it into 
 a thick dough. He did not forget to add salt. He 
 placed his loaf into a shallow earthen pan he had made 
 for this purpose. After the fire had heated the stones 
 of his oven through, he put in his loaf and soon was en- 
 joying a meal of corn bread and meat stew. 
 
 Robinson soon tried to make cocoa from the beans of 
 the cocoa palm that grew in the island. This with good 
 rich goats' milk in it he thought the best drink in the world. 
 He often thought of making sugar from the sugar cane 
 plant he had discovered in the island. But the labor of 
 squeezing out the juice was too great. He could think 
 of no way to do this without the help of horses or oxen.

 ROBINSON AS FISHERMAN 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Can you think why Robinson has never caught fish for food? 
 Would not they be more easily caught than goats and rabbits? 
 Will not Robinson now think of catching fish? Can you imagine 
 how Robinson might catch fish? Can he make a hook? Can we 
 catch fish without a hook? Can one make a bone hook? Could 
 Robinson make a line strong enough to catch fish? Will Robin- 
 son fish in salt or fresh water? 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson was now eager to use his fire and cooking 
 vessels. He had noticed with hungry eyes fine large fish 
 in the creek near his cave. But he had never taken the 
 trouble to catch any. What is the use?" he thought. "I 
 cannot eat them raw." It was difi"erent now and he be- 
 gan to devise ways of making a catch. How he longed 
 for a fish-hook, such as he had so often used when loiter- 
 ing along the Hudson River! "But a fish-hook is not to 
 be thought of," he said to himself, "unless I can make 
 one of bone." He went down to the brook and searched 
 long for a fish-bone that he might make use of for this 
 purpose. He found nothing. 
 
 "I must try something else," he thought. He remem- 
 bered the nets he used to see along the Hudson and won- 
 
 145
 
 146 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 dered if he could not make a small one to pull through 
 the water and thus catch the fish. 
 
 He had now a better source of fibre for weaving and for 
 spinning into lines and ropes. He had discovered this 
 when he was trying to find a good strong thread or yarn 
 with which to bind the coils of his grass-made baskets 
 together. He obtained fibre in great abundance from 
 the century-like plant. He found if he broke oft" the 
 long leaves of this plant and allowed them to decay there 
 remained a long, tough fibrous substance out of which 
 strong cords could be twisted or yam made for weaving 
 a coarse cloth or netting. 
 
 Out of this he spun yarn thread to make a net about three 
 or four feet by two feet. He fastened cords to the four 
 ends of this, tied them to a long pole, and was now pre- 
 pared to test his plan for catching fish. 
 
 The brook he found was too shallow for him to catch 
 fish in this way. At the sight of him and his net, they 
 scurried away to deep water. Neither could he succeed 
 in the shallow water along the shore. "I must wade out 
 as far as I can," he said to himself," and draw the net 
 through the water." 
 
 As he did this he was surprised at the many forms of 
 sea life, new to him, that he saw. He, however, was 
 careful and watchful. He walked along near the shore 
 to a point where some rocks showed aboye the surface. 
 As he looked ahead he saw the single eye of a giant cuttle 
 fish glaring at him from among the rocks. It was thrust- 
 ing out its long arms towards him. He drew back quickly, 
 but as he did so he was terrified to hear the snap of some 
 huge creature's jaws near him. A great shark had seen 
 him and had thrown himself on his back to seize him in 
 his rows of sharp teeth, but was prevented reaching him 
 by the shallowness of the water.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 147 
 
 Robinson was too much terriiicd to continue longer his 
 attempt at fishing. He went back to his cave with only 
 a few small ones, not worth the trouble of dressing for 
 his dinner. 
 
 The next day undismayed he tried again. He suc- 
 ceeded in drawing in some very beautiful large fish. 
 Their sides shone as burnished gold and silver. "Now," 
 he thought, "I will have a feast." He carried them home, 
 carefully cleaned and dressed them, seasoned them with 
 his salt, and broiled them over his fire. Imagine his dis- 
 appointment when they proved unfit to eat. Their flesh 
 was coarse and tough and ill-tasting. He saw that the 
 catching of fish for his table was a more difficult thing 
 than he thought it. He must not only catch fish, but catch 
 ones that could be eaten. He could only tell the good 
 from the bad by trying them. 
 
 He was more fortunate in his next venture. He was 
 going along the shore at the mouth of the creek which ran 
 near his cave when he noticed a group of fishes, dark 
 bluish above with silvery sides. The largest of them 
 were about two feet long. They were feeding on the 
 bottom in the brackish water at the mouth of the creek, 
 which at its mouth opened out into quite a little bay or 
 inlet. They would take up a mouthful of earth from the 
 bottom and let it wash through their mouths, keeping 
 all the bits of food that happened to be in it. When one 
 fish got a good place to feed the others swam around it 
 and tried to get some of the food. 
 
 Robinson watched his chance and slipped his net under 
 a group, while each one was busy trying to get the best 
 mouthful of mud. He drew up three quite large fish, 
 but just as he was about to lift them from the water, one 
 of the cords which bound the net to the poles broke and
 
 148 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 he saw his catch fall back into the creek and dart away 
 in the deepest water. But Robinson was not to be dis- 
 couraged. He soon mended his net and at last was suc- 
 cessful. He soon drew out another catch of two fish. 
 
 These proved excellent food and were so abundant 
 as to furnish Robinson with all the fish he wanted as long 
 as he stayed on the island. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Have you seen the century plant? Have you seen sisal 
 twine and fibre? It is used in making binding, twine. Have you 
 seen pictures of the giant cuttle fish or squid? Their arms are 
 sometimes eight feet long. They abound in the rocks around 
 Robinson's Island. It is probable that it was on account of the 
 sharks that Robinson did not bathe in the surf of the sea. Describe 
 the shark and cuttle-fish. The fish Robinson caught and found 
 excellent food was a kind of mullet common in West Indian waters. 
 Described by David Starr Jordan. 
 
 (b) What did the Indians use with which to catch fish ? Did 
 they have fish hooks? Did they use nets? How do Eskimos 
 catch fish? Describe the different instruments for catching fish

 (c) Is not Robinson getting skillful? He can now do things. 
 He knows how to get along and provide for his own wants.

 ROBINSON BUILDS A BOAT 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Do you see any way Robinson can build or make a boat ? Do you 
 not suppose he has wished for one? Could he make a sail-boat? 
 Can he weave a sail? Is his loom large enough? Can he make 
 a loom large enough ? Can he weave a cloth heavy and firm enough 
 for a sail? Do you see other trouble in the way? Can he make a 
 boat with his stone tools? To make a boat, will he not have to fell 
 trees, hew out boards of the proper thickness? Will this not be 
 almost impossible? Do you think of any other way Robinson might 
 make a boat? How will he make it go? Can he make it on the 
 water? How will he get it to the water when made? Describe 
 the way Robinson makes a boat and uses it on the water. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson had wished for a boat many times. He 
 wished to explore the shore of his island. He wanted to 
 go clear around it so that he might see it on every side. 
 But he knew the work of making a boat would be great 
 if not wholly impossible. 
 
 The shaping of boards to build a boat with his rude 
 tools was not to be thought of. He knew how the In- 
 dians made boats out of bark of trees. But he saw 
 that for his purpose so light a boat would not do. He 
 finally remembered a second Indian way of making a 
 ISO
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 151 
 
 boat by hollowing out a large log. The forest was full 
 of the boles of trees that had been blown down. But 
 they were far away from the shore. At first he did not 
 think of this very much. He had overcome so many 
 difficulties that he thought, "Never mind, I will get my 
 boat to water, no matter where I make it, in some way." 
 So he selected a tree trunk some distance from the bank 
 of the little creek near his cave and began work. He had 
 first to burn out his log the proper length and hack it into 
 boat shape with his stone tools. This was very slow and 
 tedious work. He had to handle the fire with great care 
 for there was always the danger of spoiling the shape 
 of the slowly forming boat. Both ends must be sharpened, 
 but one more than the other to form the prow or forward 
 going end. After he had shaped his boat, he began hol- 
 lowing it out. This he did also by burning for the most 
 part. He used the branches of pitch bearing trees for 
 this purpose. But it was so slow. He worked at his 
 boat all the time he could spare from his regular duties 
 in attending to his goats, his garden and his cave. He 
 was always making his cave larger. Every time he made 
 a piece of furniture or stored away grain he must make 
 more room in his cave by digging away the earth and carry- 
 ing it out. He had made a large strong wicker basket 
 for this purpose. 
 
 He had had a vague idea that when he got his boat done 
 he would dig a trench back from the bank of the creek 
 and thus float his boat. But he had not thought it out 
 clearly. "Or anyway," he thought, "I can in some way 
 manage to roll it to the water." He must now actually 
 plan to put some of these ideas into effect. He first went 
 over the ground and found that to dig a trench from the 
 water to the boat, so that the water would come to the
 
 15a THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 boat, he would have to dig it twenty feet deep. "I can 
 never do this," he said, "with my poor tools." 
 
 He next tried his rolling plan. But he had been so 
 anxious to have a large boat that he had overlooked 
 everything else. Try as hard as he might he could not 
 stir his boat from the spot. After many trials with the 
 longest levers he could handle the boat still stuck fast. 
 It would not budge an inch. He at last gave it up." 
 "It will lie here," he thought, "to remind me how foolish 
 it is to attempt to do anything without first having thought 
 it out carefully." 
 
 There was nothing to do but to choose another tree 
 trunk. This time he selected a much smaller one, and one 
 that lay at the top of the little slope or incline from the 
 bank of the creek. After another weary six months of 
 work he had his second boat ready for launching. With 
 a good stout lever he gave it a start, when it rolled quickly 
 down into the water. Robinson again wept for joy. 
 Of all his projects this had cost him the most work and 
 pains and at last to see his plans successful filled him with 
 delight. 
 
 The next problem was how to make it go. He had no 
 certain knowledge how far it was around the island, but 
 he knew it was farther than he wanted to row or paddle 
 his boat. Yet he knew from the way the wind blew that 
 he could not always depend upon a sail to help him. He 
 must become skillful in paddling his boat. A sail too 
 would be very helpful at times. He imagined how 
 pleasant it would be sitting in the boat sailing along with 
 a gentle wind. " When the wind is favorable," he thought, 
 "I will only have to steer with my paddle." 
 
 So he set about weaving a sail of his sisal fibre. To 
 do this he had to make a much larger loom than he had
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 153 
 
 yet used. His sail must be at least four feet square. 
 He was now so skilled in weaving that this was soon 
 finished. He then made plenty of string, cord, and rope, 
 put in a mast and was ready to sail. But he did not 
 venture far away until he had spent weeks and weeks 
 in learning to steer, sail, and paddle his boat. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Docs the wind always blow here from the same direction? 
 It does in that part of the world where Robinson's Island is. It 
 blows from the northeast. On which side of the island is Robin- 
 son's shelter? On which side of the island would his ship be 
 blown by the wind? Have you any idea of the shape of the island? 
 
 (b) How the Indians made boats or canoes, Hiawatha. The 
 different materials used. Canoes of birch bark, of hollowed out 
 logs. What tools they used. How they propelled them. Parts 
 of a boat, rudder, prow, stern. Different ways of propulsion, row- 
 ing, paddling, sailing. Names of different kinds of boats. Modem 
 t)oats, rowboats, launches, ships, steamers, etc. Did the Indians 
 use sails? 
 
 (c) What is the word that tells how Robinson acted about his 
 first boat? Yes he was heedless, thoughtless, rash, careless. He did 
 not sit down and think his work out carefully. He was not thought- 
 ful and careful. Robinson has shown this from the first. Had he 
 not been rash and heedless he would not have been there. How are 
 you going to show that you have learned to be thoughtful from 
 Robinson's failure ? Tell one thing you are going to be more care- 
 ful about.

 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (a) Make a drawing of Robinson's canoe. Study pictures of 
 canoes or may be you have seen little birch bark canoes bought 
 from the Indians. Picture Robinson sailing his boat near the shore. 
 Make a careful drawing of the island and locate Robinson's shelter 
 and bower on it. 
 
 (b) Take a piece of wood about four inches square and eight 
 inches long and try to make a miniature canoe. Weave a sail and 
 cordage. Make a mast and set it.

 ROBINSON AS A SAILOR 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What do you think Robinson will now do with his boat? When 
 will he go? What would you do with it? Do you think he has 
 any notion of escaping from the island? Would it be safe to start 
 out for the nearest land in so small a boat? What danger would 
 there be? If Robinson's shelter is on the southeast comer which 
 way should he go to sail around his island, so that he may have the 
 help of the wind ? Is there danger of being blown out to sea ? Will 
 he not need to be careful of that ? Will he start North or South ? 
 
 What will he see on a journey? Will the shore be high and 
 rocky all the way? Or low with sandy beaches? Will not the 
 shore be lower and the wind more gentle on the West side of the 
 Island ? 
 
 Write a description of Robinson's journey around the island. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Ever since Robinson had finished his boat he had been 
 eager to make a tour of his island. He had indeed made 
 a journey by land. But the deep forests and tangled 
 vines made it very difficult to travel. His journeys had 
 shown him but a small part of the land. He wished to 
 know all about the land of which he, so far as he knew, 
 was the sole master. 
 
 His first care was to fit up his boat with provisions. 
 155
 
 156 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 He made some large baskets in which to carry food and a 
 large covered jar for water. These he stored in the bow 
 and the stem of his boat. He fastened his parasol on the 
 stern for a shelter from the sun. He baked up a quantity 
 of cakes or loaves of bread and packed them in his bas- 
 kets. He had woven these so carefully that they would 
 almost hold water. 
 
 At last all was ready. It was on the sixth day of 
 November in the sixth year of his life on the island that 
 Robinson hoisted his sail and set out upon his voyage of 
 discovery. He had waited until the wind was gentle 
 and blowing as far easterly as it does at that place. He 
 scudded along bravely running with the land toward the 
 East and North. All went well until he came to a low 
 reef or ledge of rocks nmning far out to sea in a north- 
 easterly direction. 
 
 When Robinson observed this he went on shore and 
 climbed to a high point to see if it was safe to venture. 
 He was afraid of hidden currents, or streams of water. 
 These might carry him away from the shore and prevent 
 him from getting around the point. 
 
 He did indeed observe that there was a current running 
 out to sea past the ledge, but he thought he could by care- 
 ful paddling keep his boat from striking the rock. If 
 he could once get beyond the ledge, the wind would help 
 him double or get around the point. Indeed the danger 
 was that the wind would blow him on to the rocks. 
 
 He waited for two days for a gentle wind. At last 
 without sail he pushed his boat into the current and was 
 born swiftly seaward. He found the current much 
 stronger than he thought it would be. It rushed his 
 frail boat on past the point of the rocks and out into 
 the sea. Try as best he might he could not change its
 
 THE TEACHER'S .ROBINSON CRUSOE 157 
 
 course. He was steadily going out to sea. He gave 
 himself up for lost. He reproached himself for being so 
 rash and foolhardy as to trust his fortunes in so frail a 
 craft. How dear at this time seemed the island to him! 
 The wind which he had depended on to help him at this 
 point had died down so that it was at the mercy of the 
 current. He kept urging his boat to the westward as much 
 as possible with all his strength hoping that a breeze would 
 fmally spring up. 
 
 He struggled on bravely until about noon. He had been 
 carried out a great distance into the sea, but not so far 
 as to lose sight of the land. All at once he felt the breeze 
 freshening up. It caught his sail and soon his boat was 
 cutting across the current. He did not have to go far 
 before he was free from it and making headway for the 
 island, which he reached about four o'clock in the after- 
 noon. 
 
 He found himself on the northern shore of the island, 
 but before long the shore ran away to the southward 
 again. He ran briskly along the west side until he found 
 a Uttle bay or cove. He determined to enter this, draw 
 up his boat on shore and make his way back home across 
 the island on foot. He was almost exhausted with his 
 great labor and worn out with anxiety. 
 
 In the centre of the arms of the cove he found a little 
 creek entering the sea. He paddled into this and found 
 a good place to hide his boat. 
 
 As soon as Robinson was again on land he fell on his 
 knees and with tears in his eyes thanked God for his de- 
 liverance. The island which had seemed to him a prison 
 now seemed the fairest and dearest place in the world. 
 
 Having made his boat safe he started back toward his 
 shelter. But he was too tired to go far. He soon came
 
 IS8 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 to a little grove of trees beneath which he laid himself 
 down and soon was fast asleep. 
 
 You can imagine with what surprise Robinson was 
 awakened out of his sleep by a voice calling his name. 
 "Robinson, Robinson Crusoe," it said, "poor Robin- 
 son Cruose! Where are you Robinson, where have you 
 been?" 
 
 He was so fast asleep that he did not at first rouse up 
 entirely and thought he was dreaming. But the voice 
 kept calling, "Robinson, Robinson, poor Robinson 
 Crusoe!" He was greatly frightened and started up. 
 But no sooner were his eyes opened then he saw his parrot 
 sitting on a branch of a tree. He knew at once the source 
 of the voice. 
 
 Polly had missed her master and was also exploring the 
 island. It was a pleasant surprise. She immediately 
 flew to him and lit on his shoulder. She showed in many 
 ways how glad she was to see him and kept saying, "Poor 
 Robinson, poor Robinson Crusoe!" 
 
 Robinson remained here over night and the next morn- 
 ing made his way back to the shelter. Up to this time 
 Robinson had never seen any dangerous animals on the 
 island. He had grown used to life there and went about 
 without fear of animals. But as he was returning across 
 a little opening, he saw a clump of palms in the centre 
 of the opening, swaying about. He did not at first see 
 what caused this, but soon there was thrust out the head 
 of a great serpent. Its jaws were open and its eyes were 
 fixed on a poor terrified little rabbit. The rabbit seemed 
 rooted to the spot. It could not stir a muscle and was 
 soon caught in the folds of the great snake. 
 
 This sight made Robinson greatly afraid. He wanted 
 to rush to the rescue of the rabbit, but what could he do
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 159 
 
 against such a foe? He resolved in the future to keep 
 a more careful watch and always to sleep in his bower. 
 
 Robinson had enough of exploring for some time. 
 He was contented to remain at home. He made many 
 things he needed. He had saved all the skins of the 
 goats he had killed for meat and all that had died from 
 any cause. These he made into rugs for his bed. He 
 kept at his loom too, for he was anxious to weave enough 
 of his coarse cloth to make him a suit of clothes. He 
 learned how to braid mats and rugs out of his fibre, and 
 finally replaced his awkward hat and parasol with others 
 braided very skillfully from the long grasses that grew 
 so abundantly in the marshy places. 
 
 Another thing that Robinson was now able to make 
 or weave out of his fibre was a hammock. He had slept 
 all this time on a bed made of poles laid lengthwise and 
 thickly covered with the skins of goats and rabbits. 
 
 Now he could have a comfortable place to sleep. He 
 did not stop until he had made two. One was for the 
 bower and the other was for use out-of-doors. When his 
 work was done in the evening or in the heat of the mid- 
 day he would lie in it at full length under the shade of 
 the trees. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Winds, regular or constant. Wind-zones, ocean currents, 
 snakes that crush their prey, boa constrictors. 
 
 (b) How do sail-boats sail against the wind? Could Robinson 
 have sailed around the island starting in the other direction ? Would 
 there not have been more danger from being blown out to sea ? Do

 Would not the western side of the island have been a pleasanter 
 place for Robinson's abode? 
 
 Do you know of any other man that made a voyage of discovery?

 XXXV 
 A DISCOVERY 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Do you think that Robinson has found out all about the island ? 
 Do you suppose it is entirely unknown to other men, savages or 
 Indians? Will not savage men from the mainland visit it? Will 
 not ships go by and perhaps some of them stop to see the island ? 
 
 Which side of the island was toward the mainland? Was the 
 land east or west of the island ? Write a story about Robinson's 
 meeting savage Indians and what happened. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson could not forget his boat. It seemed a com- 
 panion. "It may be the means of my escape from this 
 place," he thought. He took frequent journeys across 
 the island to where his little boat lay in the cove. He 
 would start out in the morning and walk over to the west 
 side of the island, take his boat and have a pleasant little 
 sail. He always returned home before dark, for to tell 
 the truth, Robinson was a coward. He was as timid as 
 a hare. He was afraid of everything and spent many 
 nights without sleep because of fear. 
 
 It was while on one of his visits to his boat that Robin- 
 son made a discovery that changed his whole life. It 
 happened one day, about noon when he was going toward 
 his boat that he with great surprise saw the print of a man's 
 
 i6i
 
 i62 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 naked foot on the shore in the sand. He stood like one 
 rooted to the ground. He could not move, so great was 
 his surprise and fear. He listened, looked around, but 
 could hear nor see nothing. He went up to a little hill 
 to look further, but nothing was in sight. There was but 
 the one footprint. There was no doubt about it, there 
 it was, foot, toes, heel and every part of a foot. Robin- 
 son tried to think how it might have gotten there, but he 
 could not. It was a mystery. He was greatly afraid 
 and started at once for his shelter. He ran like one pur- 
 sued. At every little way he would look behind to see 
 if anyone was following him. 
 
 Never a frightened rabbit ran to his hiding place with 
 more terror than Robinson ran to his cave. He did not 
 sleep that night for fear and remained in his shelter for 
 three days, never venturing out. But his food was growing 
 short and his goats needed to be milked. He finally 
 with a thousand wild fancies forced himself to go about 
 his duties. 
 
 But he could not get the footprint out of his mind. He 
 spent many sad and fearful days thinking about it. "How 
 could it have gotten there? Whose was it? Was the 
 owner savage or not ? What did he want on the island ?" 
 were some of the questions that haunted him. 
 
 "Perhaps," he thought one day, "I just imagined I 
 saw a footprint, or perhaps it was one of my own that I 
 have made when going to sail my boat." He took courage 
 at this and began to go about the island again. But he 
 went in great fear, always looking behind him. He was 
 always ready to run at the first sign of danger. He had 
 made himself a large strong new bow and plenty of arrows. 
 He carried these in a quiver he had made from his cloth. 
 He fashioned too a sharp-pointed, lance-like weapon
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 163 
 
 which he hurled with a kind of sling. In his belt he car- 
 ried some new sharpened stone knives. He had found 
 a better kind of rock out of which to make his knives. 
 It resembled glass and could be brought to a tine, keen 
 edge. 
 
 Armed thus, he began to have more confidence. He 
 had a strong desire to see the footprint again and make 
 up his mind about it. He wished to measure it. In this 
 way he could tell certainly whether it was a chance print 
 of his own foot or not. So after a few days, he again 
 ventured across the island. Alas, on measuring the print 
 it was much larger than his own! There could no longer 
 be any doubt but that it belonged to someone else. 
 
 Again great fear fell on poor Robinson. He shook 
 with cold and fright. He resolved to make himself more 
 secure against attack. 
 
 He cut and carried willow stakes and set them in a 
 thick hedge around in front of his shelter. This was 
 outside the first and enclosed it. In a season or two these 
 had grown to such a height as to shut out all view of his 
 home from sight to one coming to it from the front. 
 
 His flock of goats gave him many troubled thoughts. 
 His goats were his greatest treasure. From them he ob- 
 tained without trouble his meat, his milk and butter. 
 
 "What if they were discovered and killed or carried 
 away?" He resolved to divide his herd into three parts 
 and secrete these in separate fenced pastures in different 
 parts of the island. His herd of goats now numbered 
 twenty-five. He made thorough search about the island 
 for the most secluded and best hidden spots where he could 
 fence in a pasture. 
 
 One day as he was exploring on the west side of the island 
 to find another open space for a goat field, he thought he
 
 i64 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 spied away out to sea a boat. He looked long and anx- 
 iously and yet he was not sure that it was a boat he saw. 
 But how easy thought Robinson for the people of the 
 main land which must be at no great distance to the 
 westward to come across to this side of the island in fair 
 weather. He thought too, how fortunate he was to 
 have been cast on the east side of the island. For there 
 he had his shelter in the very safest part. 
 
 As he was coming down from a hill where he had gone 
 to get a better view of the sea he made another discovery. 
 About him everywhere at the foot of the hill were bones 
 of all kinds. Near by too, were charcoal and ashes. 
 There could be no mistake, the place was visited by human 
 beings. These were very likely savages. Everything 
 showed that they came for the purpose of feasting and 
 not for plundering. It was very likely that they neither 
 sought anything on the island nor expected it. 
 
 This thought greatly relieved Robinson. He returned 
 home in a very thankful and composed state of mind. 
 He had now been on the island almost eighteen years and 
 had not been discovered. Yet, no doubt the island had 
 been visited many times by the savages since he had been 
 there. 
 
 In a short time his fear of discovery wore off and he 
 began to live just as he did before his discovery. 
 
 He took, however, greater precaution against surprise. 
 He always carried his bow and arrows, his lance and knives. 
 He was also very careful about making a great smoke 
 from his fire. He burned a great quantity of wood in a 
 pit and made charcoal. With this material he had a fine 
 fire with a very little smoke. Every day also he went 
 to the top of the hill back of his shelter in order to discover 
 if possible the approach of savages.

 than of animals.

 Do you think Robinson will see the savages that have visited the 
 island. What will they be like? What will they do? How will 
 they be dressed? What will Robinson do? Will he fight them?

 panion ? Write out the story of The Landing of the Savages and 
 what happened. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Another year passed by, Robinson longed more and 
 more to get avi^ay from the island. Year after year he 
 had hoped and watched in vain for a passing ship. Every 
 day he would scan the waters that held him prisoner 
 for the welcome sight of a sail. He had been disap- 
 pointed. Now his only hope was to escape to the main 
 land in some way. He feared the savages. He had heard 
 stories of their being cannibals. But if they could come 
 to his island in their canoes against the prevailing wind, 
 why could he not get to the main land with it in his favor ? 
 
 Strange as it may be, Robinson began to wish for the 
 return of the savages. He hoped to watch them at a dis- 
 tance and find out something about their customs. More 
 especially he wished that he might capture one of them. 
 i66
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 167 
 
 He had two reasons for this. In the first place he would 
 have a companion. He pictured fondly how he would 
 teach him gentle manners and the English speech. And 
 too, the com})anion would be able to help him. Besides 
 this he longed above all to know more of the main land 
 and whether it would be safe to go there. He wanted to 
 find out in what kind of boats they made the voyage. 
 He thought that if he had such a person he would have 
 someone to show him the way to reach the land. 
 
 The more he thought, the more anxious he became to 
 sec the savages on the island. He thought so much about 
 it by day that he dreamed about it at night. One night 
 he dreamed that the savages came, drew their boats upon 
 the shore and began to prepare their feast. As he watched 
 them one of their number broke away from his fellows 
 and came straight toward his hiding-place. Robinson 
 thought he rushed out, drove away those that followed 
 the fleeing man and rescued him. This dream made a 
 deep impression upon him and made him await the 
 coming of the savages with great ho])es and eagerness. 
 
 It was more than eighteen months after he had formed 
 this plan of capturing one of the savages before the 
 savages made their appearance. Robinson was sur- 
 prised one morning to see no less than five canoes drawn 
 up on the shore at a point on his side of the island about 
 two miles below his shelter, to the south. The people 
 that had come in them were on shore and out of sight. 
 Robinson went back to his shelter to make his plans. 
 He made up his mind that he would be foolish to attack 
 them. There must be twenty-five or thirty of them. 
 He finally went to a point where he could see farther 
 inland and soon caught sight of a crowd of about thirty 
 savages. They were naked and dancing around and
 
 i68 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 around in a circle. All the while they were singing and 
 making hideous noises. There was a fire in the center 
 of the ring of savages. "They are cooking their feast," 
 thought Robinson. "Maybe I can surprise them while 
 they eat and rush in and seize one." But this seemed 
 too great a risk to run. He had no weapons but his bow 
 and arrows, his lance and knife. What could he do 
 against so great a number? 
 
 But fortune favored his plans. As he gazed at them 
 from his safe distance he saw one of their number break 
 away from the rest and run with utmost speed directly 
 toward his hiding-place. At once two other savages 
 pursued him. They had no weapons but clubs. They 
 ran with great swiftness, but the man in front was steadily 
 gaining ground. 
 
 Robinson now to tell the truth was dreadfully frightened 
 to see the savage run directly toward him and his shelter. 
 He kept his place however, and watched the race. The 
 man running away ran along the shore and would soon 
 come to the little creek that emptied into the sea below 
 his home. Robinson saw that the savage would have 
 to swim this to escape. He ran down thither and con- 
 cealed himself behind a tree and waited for the fugitive 
 to come up. As he did so, the fleeing savage plunged in 
 and swam across with a few strong strokes. When he 
 was well on the bank, Robinson presented himself and 
 made signs to him to come to him and he would help him. 
 The savage was at first almost overcome with astonish- 
 ment and fright, for Robinson presented a very unusual 
 sight. The savage at once ran to him and fell down at 
 his feet. Indeed so great was his fright and distress that 
 he placed one of Robinson's feet upon his neck in sign that 
 be yielded up his life into his hands. Robinson raised
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 169 
 
 him up and motioned for him to take the lance and help 
 defend them against the men, now coming up. They 
 hid behind trees and waited for them to swim across the 
 stream. But this they did not do. When they reached 
 the creek, they could see nothing of their runaway. They 
 very slowly turned and went back to their companions. 
 
 Robinson was well content not to let them know that 
 there was any one on the island. He feared they might 
 return and destroy his shelter and fields. 
 
 Robinson took the savage to his shelter and gave him 
 bread and raisins to eat, and a cup of water to drink. He 
 was very hungry and ate greedily. After he had eaten, 
 Robinson made signs for him to lie down and sleep, for 
 the Indian was nearly tired out with his long and swift run. 
 
 He was a handsome fellow of his race. His limbs were 
 large, straight and strong. He had a good face. His 
 hair was long and black, his forehead high, and his eyes 
 bright. His skin was not black but of an olive color. 
 His teeth were fine set and as white as ivory. 
 
 He slept about an hour; when he awoke he came run- 
 ning to Robinson and again made signs to him that he 
 was his slave. "You saved my life," he seemed to say, 
 "and now I will serve you." Robinson named him Friday 
 at once, forth at was the day on which the great event of 
 his escape had taken place. 
 
 Robinson's next care was to fit him out with some 
 clothing. He had by this time several suits made of 
 his coarse cloth. He soon had Friday dressed in one of 
 the old ones, with a straw or braided hat on his head. 
 He did not think it safe to allow Friday to sleep with 
 him in the bower. He made a little tent for him inside 
 the enclosure. This was covered with goatskins and made 
 a very good protection from both heat and rain.

 Robinson took care (o ktcp all his kni\cs and weapons 
 near him in the bower. But his fears that Friday might 
 harm him were unfounded. Friday from the first was 
 faithful to his master. He was sweet and obedient in 
 all things.' He seemed to look upon Robinson with the 
 love of a child for father and never tired of serving him. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) What is the name of the mainland to which Robinson 
 planned to escape? Was it really the mainland or another island? 
 An island (Trinitlad) lay between Tobago, Roliinson's Island, and 
 the mainland. To what country does this island now belong? What 
 are the natives of these Caribbee Islands called ? 
 
 (ft) What are cannibals? It is the custom among savage or 
 primitive men to kill prisoners taken in war or to make slaves of 
 them. Savage men dance and feast to celebrate victory in battle. 
 Sometimes they kill their prisoners at this time. 
 
 (c) Do you not like Robinson because he did not kill any of the 
 savages? Could he have done so? Tell how he might have killed 
 the two men that pursued Friday? Would it have been right? 
 Was it right for the savages to kill prisoners taken in war? Savage 
 men do not think much about right and wrong. Robinson at first 
 wanted to kill the savages, but he took pity on them and spared their 
 lives. We praise him for this. He had a kind and good heart. 
 He pitied them. He did not hate them and seek to harm them as 
 many bad men would have done. 
 
 Was not Robinson kind to Friday? We should always be kind 
 to the helpless. Robinson was thoughtful. He gave Friday food 
 when he was hungry, water when he was thirsty and bade him 
 sleep when he was tired. He clothed him and made him a tent. 
 Do you Hke Robinson for this? Friday too is kind to his master. 
 Kindness always brings kindness. If we give kind deeds we will 
 get them in return.

 ROBINSON AS TEACHER 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Was Robinson a good scholar? Has he forgotten how to write? 
 What will Friday leam from him ? Does Friday know how to weave, 
 make pots, bake bread, raise com or weave cloth? Does he know 
 how to write or anything about the Bible? Friday will first have 
 to leam to talk Robinson's language. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 From Robinson's Diary 
 
 "I began to consider that having now two mouths to 
 feed instead of one, I must provide more ground for my 
 harvest and plant a larger quantity of corn that I used 
 to plant. So I marked out a larger piece of land and 
 began to fence it in. Friday worked not only very will- 
 ingly but very hard. I told him that it was for com 
 to make more bread because he was now with me. He 
 let me know that he was grateful for my kindness and 
 would work much harder if I would tell him what to do. 
 
 "This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this 
 place. Friday began to talk pretty well and understood 
 the names of almost all the things that I called for and of 
 all the places which I wished to send him. I was care- 
 ful to teach him all the things I knew. I showed him how 
 172
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 173 
 
 to plant and harvest com, how lo gather fibre, spin yam 
 and to weave it into cloth. He learned these things 
 quickly and became very skillful in making pots. He knew 
 something about this because at home he had seen the 
 women make them. He ornamented them with figures 
 of birds and flowers. I taught him about the true God. 
 But as for writing he could never do much with this. 
 I had no books and could not make him understand the 
 importance of writing. He began to talk a great deal 
 to me. This delighted me very much. I began to love 
 him exceedingly. He was so very honest and faithful. 
 
 "After I had taught him English I tried one day to find 
 out whether he had any wish to return to his own coun- 
 try and as I talked to him about it I saw his face light 
 up with joy and his eye sparkle. From this I had no 
 doubt but that Friday w^ould like to be in his own coun- 
 try again. This for a time made me sad to think how 
 eagerly he would leave me to be among his savage friends. 
 'Do you not wish you were back in your own country, 
 Friday?' I said to him one day. 'Yes,' he said, 'I 
 be much O, glad to be back in my country.' 'What 
 would you do there,' said I? 'Would you turn wild 
 again and do as the savages do?' He shook his head 
 and said very gravely, 'No, no, Friday tell them to live 
 good. He tell them to plant corn and live like white 
 mans.' 
 
 " One day when we were on the top of a hill on the west 
 side of the island, Friday suddenly began to jump and 
 dance about in great glee. I asked him what the matter 
 was. 'Oh, joy, oh, glad,' he said; 'there my country!' 
 The air was so clear that from this place, as I had before 
 discovered, land could be distinctly seen looking westward. 
 
 "I asked him how far it was from our island to his coun-
 
 174 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 try and whether their canoes were ever lost in coming and 
 going. He said that there was no danger. No canoes 
 were ever wrecked and that it was easy to get back and 
 forth. I asked him many things about his people and 
 country. He told me that away to the west of his country 
 there lived 'white mans like you.' I thought these must 
 be the people of Central America, and asked him how 
 I might come from this island and get among these white 
 men. He made me understand that I must have a large 
 boat as big as two canoes. 
 
 "I resolved at once to begin to make a boat large enough 
 for us to pass over to the land we could see lying to the 
 west and if possible to go on to the white man's country 
 Friday told me about. It took us nearly two months to 
 make our boat and rig her out with sails, masts, rudder, 
 and anchor. We had to weave our sails and twist our 
 rope. We burned out the canoe from a large fallen log. 
 We used a great stone tied securely to the end of a strong 
 rope for an anchor. 
 
 "When we had the boat in the water, Friday showed 
 great skill in rowing or paddling it. Fie had managed 
 boats ever since he was old enough, but he did not know 
 how to handle a sail or rudder. He learned very quickly, 
 however, to sail and steer the boat and soon was perfectly 
 at home in it. 
 
 "We made our boat safe by keeping it in the little cove 
 at the mouth of the creek. I had Friday to fetch rocks 
 and build a dock or place for landing. But the rainy 
 season was now coming on and we must wait for fair 
 weather. In the meantime I planned to lay by such 
 quantities of food as we would need to take along."

 ANOTHER SHIPWRECK 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Do you think a ship will ever come to the island? Do not ships 
 pass that way? Do you think Robinson gets oflf the island at all? 
 How does he finally get off? Does he get away in his boat or does 
 a ship come? Need we be surprised if another ship is wrecked 
 off the island just as Robinson's was? What became of Robinson's 
 ship ? Did he get anything from it ? Write out the story of another 
 ship being wrecked on the island. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 One evening Robinson sat in his shelter thinking of 
 his plans to escape to Friday's country. He was sad. 
 For, after all, this place was very dear to him. It was the 
 only home he had. Had he not made ever)1:hing with 
 his own hands? It was doubly dear to him on this ac- 
 count. He thought how it would grieve him to leave 
 his goats, his fields, and the many comforts he had here. 
 
 He had been telling Friday of his home in New York. 
 He told him of the great city, and of its many wonderful 
 sights. He told him of his country and people of his 
 flag and its history. All these things brought back memo- 
 ries of his boyhood and he wondered what changes had 
 come in his long absence. Friday listened to all Rob- 
 inson told him with wonderful intelligence. He was de- 
 176 - _
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 177 
 
 lighted in hearing Robinson tell of the wonders of the 
 great world, for he had never known anything about it. 
 As they talked Robinson noticed the approach of a storm. 
 The sky was getting black with clouds. The winds were 
 blowing a hurricane. The waves were coming in moun- 
 tain high. It reminded him of the eventful night now 
 twenty-five years ago when his ship was tossed up on the 
 shore like an egg shell and broken to pieces. 
 
 Suddenly there was a sound that made Robinson 
 start from his seat with the wildest alarm. Was it the 
 sound of a cannon from the ocean or the terrible crash 
 and war of the water on the rocks of the coast? There 
 it is again; it is a cannon! Some ship is in distress! 
 This is its signal! Robinson ran out and down to the 
 shore with Friday at his heels. 
 
 "Oh master!" said Friday, "can we not help? If 
 they only knew the island was here and how to steer into 
 the harbor beyond the point of land on the south." 
 Robinson was so excited that he scarcely knew what he 
 was doing. He ran up and down the shore calling wildly, 
 but the awful roar of the sea and wind drowned his cries. 
 Suddenly his thoughts came to him. "Quick, Friday, 
 get some fire in a pot. We will run to the point, gather 
 grass and wood, and make a fire there. Maybe we can 
 guide them into the harbor." 
 
 They soon had a great beacon light sending its welcome 
 greeting far over the sea. The pilot of the ship saw it 
 and steered his ship nearer and nearer. Robinson was 
 ready to shout for joy as the ship seemed about to make 
 the harbor. The ship had her sails torn in shreds and 
 her rudder broken. It was hard to steer her in such a 
 gale. On rounding the point, she was blown on the 
 rocks. With a frightful crash which could be heard above
 
 178 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 the din of the storm she struck and held fast. Robinson 
 could hear the cries of the men and the orders of the 
 officers. They were trying to get boats ready to put 
 off, but such was the confusion of the storm and the enor- 
 mous waves breaking over the deck that it could not be 
 done quickly. Before the men could get a boat into the 
 sea, and get into it, the ship gave a lurch to one side as 
 though about to sink. All the men jumped for one boat. 
 It was overburdened. The wind tossed it about. The 
 sea soon filled it and it went down and all were lost. 
 
 Robinson and Friday remained on the shore all night. 
 They watched to see if they could not help some poor 
 sailor that might cling to a plank and be blown on shore. 
 They saw no one. 
 
 At last they lay down, but they could not sleep. Many 
 times they sprang up and ran about for fear that some 
 poor fellow would need their help. At last morning 
 came. The storm ceased. Robinson and Friday searched 
 everywhere for the bodies of the sailors, but could find 
 none. But the wind had blown the ship in plain view, 
 and into shallow waters. It was lying on the bottom with 
 more than half its Inilk out of the water. The masts were 
 gone. It was a sad sight. No human being could be 
 seen on it 
 
 They were now rejoiced that they had their boat ready. 
 "Let us take it," said Robinson, "and go out to the ship. 
 It may be some person is still on the unfortunate ship." 
 They were soon by the ship's side. They rowed around 
 it until they saw a rope hanging down from the deck. 
 Robinson seized this and clambered up. Friday tied 
 the boat fast, and followed. Robinson opened the door 
 leading from the deck into the ship and went down. He 
 searched in all the cabins, and knocked at all the doors.
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 179 
 
 He called, but all was still. When he was satisfied that 
 every person on board had been drowned he we{)t bitterly. 
 Friday stood there with open and staring eyes. He 
 looked and looked. He was astonished at the large shij) 
 and at the wonderful things before him. They were in 
 the cabin where the passengers had been. There stood 
 trunks under the benches and clothes hung on the hooks 
 on the wall. One trunk was open. In it were tele- 
 scopes through which the travelers had looked at the 
 land. Robinson saw also paper, pens, penholders and 
 ink. Books were also near by. Robinson first took a 
 thick book. It was the Bible, out of which his mother 
 had so often taught him. Then they came to the 
 sailors' cabin. There hung muskets and swords and 
 bags of shot and cartridges. Then they went to the work- 
 room. There were saws, hammers, spades, shovels, 
 chisels, nails, bottles, and pails, knives and forks. And 
 something more, over which Robinson was most glad, 
 matches. At last they came into the store-room. There 
 lay bags of flour and barley, teas, lentils, beans and sugar. 
 Then Robinson embraced Friday in his great joy and 
 said to him, "How rich we are!" 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (b) Did Robinson do the best thing when ne built a fire on the 
 point? Maybe the ship was led on to the rocks in this way. Is it 
 safer for a ship out on the ocean or near shore in a storm ? 
 
 Have you seen a life-saving crew practicing? Our country keeps 
 companies of men at all dangerous places where ships may need 
 help. If a wreck occurs these men go out in their boats and take 
 care of the disabled ship, the passengers and the sailors. Some- 
 times the life saving crew shows great bravery in risking their lives 
 to save the people on board.

 SAVING THINGS FROM THE SHIP 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 What do you think Robinson will prize most and what will he 
 first take back with him ? Make a list of things you think Robin- 
 son will take from the ship. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 After Robinson had looked through the ship he began 
 to plan the way to get the tools and things he most wanted 
 on shore. He and Friday first carried everything together 
 that he wanted to take on shore. When they had done 
 this, he found he had the following things. Robinson 
 stood everything together that he needed most. 
 
 1 . A case of nails and screws. 
 
 2. Two iron axes and several hatchets. 
 
 3. A saw. 
 
 4. A small case of planes, tongs, augers, files, chisels, 
 etc. 
 
 5. A third case with iron brackets, hooks, hinges, etc. 
 
 6. A case of matches. 
 
 7. A barrel of gunpowder. 
 
 8. Two muskets and a pistol. 
 
 9. Several swords. 
 
 10. A bag of cartridges. 
 180
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE i8i 
 
 11. A large sail cloth and some rope. 
 
 12. A telescope. 
 
 By means of the ship's ropes, Robinson let everything 
 down into his boat. He himself took the Bible and then 
 they rowed to the shore, and unloaded the boat. Every- 
 thing was put into the bower where rain could not harm it. 
 By the time they had this done, night was coming on and 
 they decided to do no more that day, but wait until the 
 next day. 
 
 "We must work fast," said Robinson. "The first 
 storm is likely to break the ship in pieces and destroy 
 everything in it." 
 
 The next morning early they ate a hastily prepared 
 breakfast and were off to the boat. Neither Robinson 
 nor Friday stopped for their noon day lunch. "A storm 
 is brewing," said Robinson, "the air is calm, the sky is 
 overcast with clouds, the heat is oppressive. We 
 must hurry." With the utmost diligence they rowed 
 back and forth all day. They made nine trips. They 
 had now on shore a surprising quantity of all kinds of 
 tools, goods and weapons. They had all kinds of ware 
 to use in the kitchen, clothes, and food. Robinson prized 
 a little four-wheeled wagon and a whetstone. 
 
 But in looking over his stores, Robinson suddenly dis- 
 covered that he had no needles nor thread. They went 
 at once to procure these important articles. In looking 
 for needles and thread, Robinson found a small trunk full 
 of money and valuable stones. There were diamonds, 
 rubies, pearls, and much gold. Robinson pushed it to 
 one side. "What can I do with riches on this island? I 
 would give them all for some needles and thread," he 
 said to Friday. But on second thought he took the trunk
 
 1&2 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 and its contents along with him to his cave. For in the 
 trunk were also letters and writings. "Perhaps," he said, 
 "these tell to whom the valuables belong and I can re- 
 turn them some time." 
 
 Robinson at last found a case containing everything one 
 could need with which to cut and sew cloth. There were 
 scissors, thread, needles, thimbles, tapes, and buttons. 
 But now the wind was rising and they must hurry. They 
 were nearly ready for departure. They were passing 
 through a part of the ship not before visited. They were 
 surprised to hear a sound coming from a room whose door 
 was kept shut by a heap of stuff that had been thrown 
 against it by the violent pitching of the ship in the storm. 
 Robinson and Friday cleared away the rubbish and were 
 surprised to find a dog almost drowned. He was so weak 
 from want of food that his cries could be heard a short 
 distance only. Robinson took him tenderly in his arms 
 and carried him to the boat, while Friday carried the 
 sewing case and the trunk. 
 
 The wind was now blowing a gale. A few yards from 
 the ship they were in great danger. Robinson grasped 
 the rudder and made Friday stand ready to cut away the 
 mast in case they found the wind too strong. With the 
 greatest difficulty they finally made the little cove at the 
 mouth of the creek and were soon landed with their precious 
 cargo. The next morning they eagerly searched the 
 waters for the ship. Not even their field glasses could 
 reveal anything of it. Some planks, a mast, and parts of 
 a small boat were blown on shore. All else had dis- 
 appeared. 
 
 Robinson set to work at once to make a door for his 
 bower out of the pine wood cast up by the waves. How 
 easy the work proceeded with saws, hammers, augers,
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 183 
 
 squares, planes, nails, hinges, and screws! With the 
 wagon loo, Friday could now gather his corn quickly and 
 easily or haul in a great quantity of grapes to dry for 
 raisins. 
 
 Friday had never seen a gun. He did not know the use 
 of firearms. The muskets that Robinson had brought 
 from the ship were a great mystery to him. Robinson 
 showed him their use. He showed how they could de- 
 fend themselves. He told Friday that these weapons 
 would kill at a distance. He took some powder and 
 touched a match to it. Friday was greatly frightened. 
 Robinson then proceeded to load the gun. He put ui 
 some powder, a ball of lead or bullet. Then at the 
 hammer he placed a little cap which gave a flash when 
 struck. This ignited the powder. When all was in 
 readiness Robinson bade Friday follow him. They 
 went slowly out into the forest along the stream. Soon 
 Robinson espied a rabbit silting under a clump of grass. 
 Robinson raised his gun, took careful aim, pressed the 
 trigger. There was a flash and loud report and there 
 lay the rabbit dead. But Friday too, was lying on the 
 ground. He had fainted from astonishment and fright. 
 Robinson dropped his gun and raised the poor fellow up 
 to a silting position. He quickly recovered. He ran to 
 get the rabbit. He examined it carefully. Robinson at 
 last pointed out the hole the bullet had made and the 
 mystery of the way the rabbit was killed was solved. Robin- 
 son had lived alone so long that he had learned to love 
 every living creature on the island. He never harmed 
 anything except when he needed food. He had lived 
 so quietly that the birds and animals did not fear him. 
 They lived near his shelter and seemed to know him. 
 
 Robinson was delighted with his new tools and weapons.
 
 i84 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 But they reminded him of home. Nothing that he had 
 seen in all the time he had been on the island so turned 
 his thoughts toward home and friends. Robinson v/ould 
 sit for hours thinking of the past and making plans for 
 the future. He was homesick. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (a) Indications of a storm. Children make weather observa- 
 tion. The usual order of coming on of a cyclone or spell of weather. 
 (i) Wind S. E. ten or twelve hours. Cloudiness increases. Winds 
 slow down, rain comes on. Storm passes over. Winds change to 
 West and northwest and increase in strength. 
 
 (b) What kind of tools had Robinson before the shipwreck? 
 What material were they made of? We call the time when men 
 had nothing but stone tools, the Time of Stone or Stone Age. At 
 one time men did not know how to use any material but stone for 
 tools. Then they used bronze and next iron. Our time is the Age 
 of Iron. The ship and its contents changed Robinson from the Age 
 of Stone to the Age of Iron. It changed him to living as a civilized 
 man lives. Guns, kinds of, and uses. 
 
 What is a telescope? A small one with double glass is called a 
 field glass. Will not Robinson prize this? He can now watch for 
 passing ships from his hill. He can see much farther. 
 
 What trades does Robinson now practice ? What do we call one 
 that makes pots? That weaves cloth? Makes hats? Makes 
 bread? Does hunting? Sails ships? Does Robinson now have 
 to do so many different things? Friday will do some things for him. 
 Does your papa have to do as many different things as Robinson 
 did? Why did Robinson have to do so many things? Why does 
 not your papa have to do so many different things? Do savages 
 have to do more or fewer different things than civilized men? Do 
 savage men have trades? Did Friday have a trade? How many 
 different trades made the tools Robinson got from the ship? 
 
 (c) Do you like Robinson because he was kind to the dog? 
 Was Robinson kind-hearted or cruel? Will a kind man mistreat 
 any animal? Are there any animals we should kill? Poisonous
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 i8S 
 
 snakes? Few snakes are poisonous. Most snakes are very useful 
 in destroying injurious insects. Do we not like Robinson because 
 he did not kill animals for sport or fun ? Even savage men do not 
 kill animals for fun or sport. They hunt them for food. Animals 
 that have never been hunted are tame. Robinson lived with the 
 animals. They loved him and trusted him. 
 
 PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT 
 
 (a) Study different kinds of ships and draw one you think would 
 resemble the one that was wrecked off Robinson's Island? Make a 
 picture showing Robinson shooting the rabbit. Don't forget the dog. 
 Study the drawing of dogs. Learn to draw them well.

 THE RETURN OF THE SAVAGES 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Will not Robinson now make plans to escape? What will he do ? 
 Will he dare to trust himself in the boat he made? Will he be 
 afraid that the savages will kill him? Will not Friday protect him 
 from them? Will they build a new boat or remodel the one they 
 have, now that they have tools? Have you thought that maybe the 
 savages will return and upset Robinson's plan to escape? Write 
 out about the preparations for escape and an unexpected visit of the 
 savages. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Robinson now renewed his plans for escaping from the 
 island to Friday's country. They first rebuilt their boat 
 with their new tools. They hollowed out the center till 
 the sides were thin toward the top. They shaped her 
 sides and keel. They made her prow sharp so that 
 she would cut the water easily. They made a new mast, 
 strong and tall and shapely. They made larger and 
 stronger sails and ropes. They made two pairs of extra 
 oars. They made boxes and cupboards in the prow 
 and stern for keeping their fresh water and provisions. 
 Friday's eyes sparkled with joy when it was done. He 
 hoped he would now be able to return to his own island 
 and parents. Robinson noticed his joy and asked him, 
 
 187
 
 i88 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 "Do you want to return to your own people?" "Yes," 
 said Friday, "very much." "Would you trust yourself 
 in this boat?" "Yes," said Friday. "Very well," said 
 his master, "you-hav^i may have it and start home when 
 you please." "Yes Master, but you come too, my people 
 will not hurt you." Robinson resolved to venture over 
 to Friday's land with him. 
 
 But before their preparations were complete the rainy 
 season of our fall set in. They resolved to wait until the 
 weather was settled and as soon as the rainy season was 
 over to set out. They ran their boat well up into the creek 
 and covered it well with a large tarpaulin made of sail- 
 cloth obtained from the ship. 
 
 Robinson had now been on the island twenty-seven 
 years. For the last three years he had lived happily 
 with his companion Friday. Every year in September, 
 Robinson celebrated the day his life was saved and he 
 was thrown up on the island. Robinson celebrated it 
 this year with more than the usual thankfulness. He 
 thought that it would be his last anniversary on the 
 island. 
 
 One morning, Friday had gone to the beach to find a 
 turtle. Soon he came running back out of breath. "Oh 
 Master," he cried, "they are coming, they are coming 
 to take me prisoner!" He was trembling with fright. 
 
 "We must take our guns and defend ourselves," said 
 Robinson. "But we will not kill anyone unless they 
 attack us." This quieted Friday. They loaded four 
 muskets and three pistols. Robinson put the pistols 
 in his belt where he also fastened a sword. He gave Fri- 
 day a pistol and a musket, for Friday had learned to shoot 
 well. Besides Friday carried a bag of powder and bul- 
 lets. Robinson took his field glasses and saw twenty-
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 189 
 
 one savages with two prisoners. The prisoners were 
 bound and lying on the ground. This was a war party 
 celebrating a victory with a feast. They probably in- 
 tended to kill their prisoners. "We must save the lives 
 of those men," said Robinson. 
 
 The savages this time had landed quite near Robin- 
 son's shelter, not more than a half mile below the creek's 
 mouth. Soon he and Friday started off. Robinson 
 commanded Friday to follow quietly and not to speak or 
 shoot. "We will surprise them and give them a good scare," 
 said Robinson. When yet a considerable distance away 
 they could hear the savages yelling and screaming. Some 
 of them were dancing their war dance. Their faces and 
 bodies were painted to make them look terrible to their 
 enemies. They were dancing around their prisoners 
 with hideous cries and gestures. They could now see 
 the prisoners plainly. One had a beard and was plainly 
 a white man. Robinson was surprised and determined 
 to save him at all risks. "Get your gun ready to fire," 
 he said to Friday, and when I say the word let us run 
 forward yelling and firing our guns over their heads." 
 This will fill them with such fright that they will take to 
 their heels and boats and get away as soon as possible. 
 In the scramble and confusion we will rush in and rescue 
 the prisoners. This plan did not please Friday at all. 
 His savage blood was up and he wanted to kill all he 
 could. "Let's fire on them," he said. "Let's kill all but 
 the prisoners." "No, no," said Robinson, "it's always 
 wrong to take life unless it cannot be avoided to save 
 one's own. Let's try my plan first." 
 
 With great reluctance Friday consented. At a signal 
 from Robinson they rushed forward, and when in plain 
 sight they fired off their muskets in the air, If the ground
 
 igo THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 had suddenly exploded beneath their feet there could have 
 been no more confusion, astonishment, and fright. A 
 few took to their heels. Others lay as if dead. They had 
 swooned from fright. But as Robinson came up they 
 jumped to their feet and pushed into the boats leaving 
 the prisoners behind. Robinson and Friday still rushed 
 forward and fired their remaining loaded guns and pistols 
 in the air. The savages made all haste to get into their 
 boats and push off. Soon they were well out to sea, 
 paddling rapidly for the west. Robinson reloaded his 
 arms and gave them a farewell volley, but not a soul was 
 killed or even wounded. This gave Robinson great 
 pleasure. He had accomplished his purpose without 
 bloodshed. 
 
 They could now turn to the prisoners. Robinson ran 
 back to them and cjuickly cut their ropes. Robinson 
 asked the white man who he was, but the man was too 
 weak to answer. Robinson gave him a piece of bread. 
 
 The fear of death being removed, the white man soon 
 grew stronger. When Friday came running back from 
 watching the boats and saw the savage that had been a 
 prisoner he gave a loud yell. He threw his arms around 
 the man, kissed him and laughed and cried for joy. He 
 put his head on his breast and hugged him again and 
 again. Robinson was greatly surprised and puzzled. 
 He asked Friday what his actions meant. But so intent 
 was Friday that he got no answer. At last Friday re- 
 covered far enough from his great joy to say with face 
 beaming with delight, "Oh, Master, this man is my dear 
 father." They at once began a long conversation, each 
 one told his story. Suddenly Friday jumped up and said, 
 "How foolish I am, I have not thought to give my father 
 anything to eat and drink. He must be nearly starred."
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 191 
 
 And away he ran toward the shelter and was soon back 
 with food and water to drink. 
 
 Robinson learned through Friday from his father 
 that the white man was a Spaniard, that he had been 
 captured by the tribe that had a battle with Friday's 
 people. The Spaniard was one of sixteen men that had 
 been saved by Friday's people from a wrecked ship. 
 
 So weak were the prisoners that they could not walk 
 to the shelter. Robinson and Friday made a litter and 
 carried them one after the other. When once there, 
 Friday prepared some rich rice soup. The prisoners 
 ate heartily and in a few days were strong enough to go 
 about the island. 
 
 THINGS TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT 
 
 (c) Could Robinson have killed the savages without danger to 
 himself? He did not wish to do this. What words describe his 
 conduct? Kind? Good? Thoughtful? Considerate? Merci- 
 ful? What words would tell the opposite kind of conduct? 
 
 Do you like Friday's joy on finding his father? Friday was good 
 to his father. He was a good son. He loved his father. He 
 obeyed his parents.

 PREPARATION 
 
 Will not Robinson now carry out his plans of escape ? How will 
 his new companions change his plans? Will they help or hinder 
 him ? How do you now imagine Robinson will get away from the 
 island ? Will he go in his boat or will a ship come ? Will not Robin- 
 son plan to help the fifteen comrades of the Spaniard who are help- 
 less in Friday's country? Does not Robinson always help others 
 first? 
 
 Write out a story of what changes Robinson makes in his plans 
 and how at last he is delivered. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 Friday had not forgotten the plan for going to his home. 
 He would often mention it and spent hours talking about 
 it during the long rainy season. But now that the Span- 
 iard and Friday's father had come with the family, Robin- 
 son felt he must change his plans a little. He felt very 
 sorry for the Spaniards left in Friday's country. They 
 did not have enough to eat and were sick and sad besides. 
 He talked the matter over with the Spaniard many times. 
 They at last planned to send for them. The Spaniard 
 and Friday's father were to go. Robinson was for doing 
 it at once. But the Spaniard advised delay. "How can 
 we get food for ourselves and fifteen others? Your 
 
 193
 
 194 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 small store will soon be used up," he argued. Robinson 
 at last saw that this difficulty must be overcome. There 
 was just one thing to do, and this, to delay their de- 
 parture until a new crop of corn could be raised. This 
 would take six months. 
 
 But at it they went. The four men could do much and 
 work fast. They cleared more ground and planted all 
 the seed corn they could spare from their store. Be- 
 sides this they sowed about twelve bushels of barley 
 they had gotten in the ship. 
 
 The care for so much crop, its harvesting and storing 
 away, kept them very busy for the season. Robinson 
 not only did this, but also increased his flock of goats by 
 catching kids and putting them in his pasture. He 
 gathered too, all the grapes he could and dried them on the 
 branches of trees. 
 
 At the end of the harvesting season, they made ready 
 their boat. They filled it with all the bread it could well 
 carry. They put in raisins and fresh water. Robinson 
 gave the Spaniard and Friday's father each a musket 
 and plenty of powder and bullets. Now, all was ready. 
 Friday gave his father a loving farewell. He stretched 
 out his arms towards him as the boat moved away. The 
 Spaniard and Robinson waved their hats and they were 
 off. 
 
 They promised to be back in eight or nine days. Robin- 
 son and Friday made every preparation to receive the 
 guests. They were to have a home not far from Robin- 
 son's built of poles, and thatched with the long marsh 
 grasses, like Robinson's bower. There was no need of 
 hiding or defending it. It did not take long to fix it up. 
 
 Eight days had now passed since the boat had left. 
 Friday could hardly restrain himself longer. He watched
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 195 
 
 the ocean all the time. He would go to the top of the 
 hill with the field glasses every hour during the day to 
 catch a first glimpse of them. 
 
 On the ninth day, as Friday put up his glasses to search 
 the waters he dropped them with a yell of surprise. He 
 tore down the hill with the utmost speed and rushed up to 
 Robinson as one gone mad. "Look, look, oh Master!" 
 he cried, "a big ship; a big ship way out on the sea!" 
 Robinson took the glasses and sure enough there within 
 hailing distance was a large ocean going vessel. Robin- 
 son was overcome with excitement. 
 
 For twenty-eight years his aching eyes had scanned the 
 waters for this welcome sight. His joy was boundless. 
 The ship looked like an American. Yes, there floated 
 the American flag! How welcome a sight to Robinson. 
 He could not utter a word. Tears filled his eyes and 
 streamed down his cheeks. He would soon have news 
 from home. He ran to the shore and shot off a gun to 
 attract the attention of those on board. He heard an- 
 swering shots at once. 
 
 Soon a boat was lowered and in it three men rowed 
 toward the shore. It was the captain himself and two 
 sailors. The captain was astonished to find a man in 
 the lonely island. Robinson told how it all had happened 
 and how he would like to return home. To his un- 
 speakable delight the captain told him that the ship was 
 bound for New York and would take him along free of 
 charge, but he must leave that day. The ship could 
 not be delayed on its course. Of course Robinson must 
 go. Friday was beside himself with grief. He did not 
 want to be left behind alone. He did not know that the 
 Spaniards would ever return. Something might happen 
 to them on the sea. But before the eventful day the
 
 196 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 Spaniards landed. They brought word that Friday's 
 father had died after his return home. Friday was thrown 
 into a fit of grief at the news. He wept and repeated over 
 and over his praise of the good man.

 ROBINSON AT HOME 
 
 PREPARATION 
 
 Will not Robinson feel sorry to leave his home on the island? 
 What will he do with his many things? What will he find at home? 
 
 Will he know the place ? Will he meet his parents again ? What 
 will he do the rest of his life ? Write out a description of his arrival 
 at home. 
 
 PRESENTATION 
 
 It was with a sad heart that Robinson made ready to 
 
 leave. Every familiar place seemed now doubly dear 
 
 to him. He went from one to another with tears in his 
 
 eyes. Here lay his home. Here were his fields, his 
 
 crops and his goats. Everything was the work of his 
 
 own hands. He had made them aU. Which should 
 
 he take? He hesitated long. He must take home some 
 
 of his belongings to show the people at home. And there 
 
 were his parrot and the dog which had won a place in 
 
 Robnison's heart. He decided to take them along. At 
 
 length he got together his diary, his parasol, his Bible, 
 
 his treasures, a suit of clothes, his dog, and a hat. He 
 
 had saved too his bow and arrows. These he decided 
 
 to take along. Everything else he gave to his good man 
 
 Friday and the Spaniard who wished to be allowed to 
 
 remain on the island.

 ipS THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 
 
 Robinson kissed Friday tenderly. He with great 
 effort finally tore himself away and ran to the shore where 
 the ship's boat awaited him. But Robinson had not 
 counted on the strength of Friday's love for him. Robin- 
 son's boat had not yet reached the ship when Friday 
 sprang into the water and swam after him shouting, 
 "Master, take me with you, I would rather die than stay 
 here without you." Robinson was touched at the devo- 
 tion showed by the faithful Friday, and gave orders to 
 turn the boat back and take him on board. The anchor 
 was raised. The ship started on her way to the home 
 Robinson had left so long ago. 
 
 The wind was favorable and in seven weeks the spires 
 and high buildings of New York were in sight. His 
 vessel came slowly up to the wharf where he had taken 
 ship so many years ago. Here too, he had played and 
 idled his time away. He remembered it all. His idle- 
 ness and playing truant came back in sad memories. 
 Before Robinson and Friday landed, their good friend 
 the captain gave them each a new suit of clothes. 
 
 Everything had changed. He scarcely knew the place. 
 He was astonished and confused by the din, hurry and 
 bustle of a great city. Friday seemed dazed by it all and 
 clung to Robinson's side. The buildings were so tall, 
 the street cars, the carriages were different. Everywhere 
 there were iron machines, casting out smoke, puffing and 
 running about on iron rails. Robinson had never seen 
 these. 
 
 Robinson, however, did not stop to admire; he pushed 
 on to a certain street and house where lived his parents 
 at the time of his departure. It was with difficulty that 
 he found the place. It was now in the heart of the city. 
 Upon inquiry he found, after much searching, that his
 
 THE TEACHER'S ROBINSON CRUSOE 199 
 
 father had removed his store and home to another part of 
 the city, his mother had died of grief for her disobedient 
 son. Robinson was sorely grieved at this. He had 
 hoped to see her and tell her how sorry he was that he 
 had caused her so much anxiety and sorrow. 
 
 When he had found the place where his father lived 
 he stole quietly up to the house and opened the door. 
 His father, now a gray-haired man, bent with age and sor- 
 row, was sitting in his arm-chair reading. Robinson 
 came forward, but his father did not recognize him. 
 "Who are you?" he said. "I am Robinson, your long- 
 lost son." He knelt by his father's side and asked for- 
 giveness for all the trouble he had caused. His father 
 was overcome. He could not speak. He drew Robinson 
 with feeble hands to his breast. "My son, I forgive 
 you," he said. 
 
 Robinson's boyhood friends heard 01 his strange re- 
 turn. They had thought him dead long ago. They 
 never tired of hearing him tell his strange story. They 
 pitied him in his misfortune. But Robinson told them 
 that it all happened to him because he was idle and 
 disobedient in his youth. 
 
 Robinson at once relieved his father at the store. The 
 business thrived. His father died. He soon had a home 
 of his own with a happy family. Friday, the dog, and the 
 parrot lived in it, dearly beloved and cared for by their 
 master, the rest of their days. In the home there is a 
 young Robinson who loves to hear his father read from his 
 diary of the wonderful things that happened on the island. 
 
 Robinson tried many times to find the rightful owner 
 of the gold and jewels, but never succeeded. At last 
 he gave it to a school where boys with idle habits were 
 taught to lead useful and industrious lives.
