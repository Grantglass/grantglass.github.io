ROBINSON CRUSOE'S PREFACE.
AS the design of everything is said to be first in the
intention, and last in the execution, so I come
now to acknowledge to my reader that the pre-
sent work is not merely the product of the two first
volumes, but the two first volumes may rather be called
the product of this. The fable is always made for the
moral, not the moral for the fable.
I have heard that the envious and ill-disposed part of
the world have raised some objections against the two
first volumes, on pretence, for want of a better reason,
that (as they say) the story is feigned, that the names
are borrowed, and that it is all a romance; that there
never were any such man or place, or circumstances in
any man's life; that it is all formed and embellished by
invention to impose upon the world. I, Robinson Crusoe, being at this time in perfect
and sound mind and memory, thanks be to God there-
for, do hereby declare their objection is an invention
scandalous in design, and false in fact; and do affirm
that the story, though allegorical, is also historical; and
that it is the beautiful representation of a life of un-
exampled misfortunes, and of a variety not to be met
with in the world, sincerely adapted to and intended for
the common good of mankind, and designed at first, as it
is now farther applied, to the most serious uses possible.
L
x robinson crusoe's preface.
Farther, that there is a man alive, and well known
too, the actions of whose life are the just subject of
these volumes, and to whom all or most part of the
story most directly alludes; this may be depended
upon for truth, and to this I set my name. The famous "History of Don Quixote," a work
which thousands read with pleasure, to one that knows
the meaning of it, was an emblematic history of, and a
just satire upon, the Duke de Medina Sidonia, a person
very remarkable at that time in Spain. To those who
knew the original, the figures were lively and easily
discovered themselves, as they are also here, and the
images were just; and therefore, when a malicious but
foolish writer, in the abundance of his gall, spoke of the
quixotism of R. Crusoe, as he called it, he showed,
evidently, that he knew nothing of what he said; and
perhaps will be a little startled when I shall tell him
that what he meant for a satire was the greatest of
panegyrics.
Without letting the reader into a nearer explication
of the matter, I proceed to let him know, that the
happy deductions I have employed myself to make,
from all the circumstances of my story, will abundantly
make him amends for his not having the emblem ex-
plained by the original; and that when in my obser-
vations and reflections of any kind in this volume I
mention my solitudes and retirements, and allude to
the circumstances of the former story, all those parts
of the story are real facts in my history, whatever
borrowed lights they may be represented by. Thus
the fright and fancies which succeeded the story of
the print of a man's foot, and surprise of the old goat,
and the thing rolling on my bed, and my jumping out
in a fright, are all histories and real stories; as are
likewise the dream of being taken by messengers, being
arrested by officers, the manner of being driven on ROBINSON CRUSOE'S PREFACE. XI
shore by the surge of the sea, the ship on fire, the
description of starving, the story of my man Friday,
and many more most material passages observed here,
and on which any religious reflections are made, are all
historical and true in fact. It is most real that I had
a parrot and taught it to call me by my name; such a
servant a savage, and afterwards a Christian, and that
his name was called Friday, and that he was ravished
from me by force, and died in the hands that took
him, which I represent by being killed; this is all
literally true, and should I enter into discoveries many
alive can testify them. His other conduct and assist-
ance to me also have just references in all their parts
to the helps I had from that faithful savage in my
real solitudes and disasters.
The story of the bear in the tree, and the fight with
the wolves in the snow, is likewise matter of real
history; and, in a word, the "Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe" are one whole scheme of a real life of eight
and twenty years, spent in the most wandering, deso-
late, and afflicting circumstances that ever man went
through, and in which I have lived so long in a life of
wonders, in continued storms, fought with the worst
kind of savages and man-eaters; by unaccountable
surprising incidents, fed by miracles greater than that of
ravens; suffered all manner of violences and oppressions,
injurious reproaches, contempt of men, attacks of devils,
corrections from Heaven, and oppositions on earth; have
had innumerable upsand downs in matters of fortune,
been in slavery worse than Turkish, escaped by an ex-
quisite management, as that in the story of Xury, and
the boat at Sallee; been taken up at sea in distress,
raised again and depressed again, and that oftener perhaps in one man's life than ever was known be-
fore; shipwrecked often, though more by land than
by sea. In a word, there is not a circumstance in the imaginary story but has its just allusion to a real story,
and chimes part for part and step for step with the
inimitable Life of Robinson Crusoe. In like manner, when in these reflections I speak of
the times and circumstances of particular actions done,
or incidents which happened, in my solitude and island-life, an impartial reader will be so just to take it as
it is, viz., that it is spoken or intended of that part
of the real story which the island-life is a just allu-
sion to; and in this the story is not only illustrated,
but the real part I think most justly approved. For
example, in the latter part of this work called the
Vision, I begin thus: "When I was in my island-kingdom I had abundance of strange notions of my
seeing apparitions," &c. All these reflections are just
history of a state of forced confinement, which in my
real history is represented by a confined retreat in
an island; and it is as reasonable to represent one
kind of imprisonment by another, as it is to represent
anything that really exists by that which exists not.
The story of my fright with something on my bed was
word for word a history of what happened, and indeed
all those things received very little alteration, except
what necessarily attends removing the scene from one
place to another.
My observations upon solitude are the same; and I
think I need say no more than that the same remark is
to be made upon all the references made here to the
transactions of the former volumes, and the reader is
desired to allow for it as he goes on.
Besides all this, here is the just and only good end
of all parable or allegoric history brought to pass,
viz., for moral and religious improvement. Here is
invincible patience recommended under the worst of
misery, indefatigable application and undaunted reso-
lution under the greatest and most discouraging cir-
cumstances; I say, these are recommended as the
only way to work through those miseries, and their
success appears sufficient to support the most dead-
hearted creature in the world.
Had the common way of writing a man's private
history been taken, and I had given you the conduct or
life of a man you knew, and whose misfortunes and in-
firmities perhaps you had sometimes unjustly triumphed
over, all I could have said would have yielded no diver-
sion, and perhaps scarce have obtained a reading, or at
best no attention; the teacher, like a greater, having
no honour in his own country. Facts that are formed
to touch the mind must be done a great way off, and by
somebody never heard of. Even the miracles of the
blessed Saviour of the world suffered scorn and con-
tempt, when it was reflected that they were done by the
carpenter's son; one whose family and original they
had a mean opinion of, and whose brothers and sisters
were ordinary people like themselves.
There even yet remains a question whether the in-
struction of these things will take place, when you are
supposing the scene, which is placed so far off, had its
original so near home.
But I am far from being anxious about that, seeing,
I am well assured, that if the obstinacy of our age
should shut their ears against the just reflections made
in this volume upon the transactions taken notice of in
the former, there will come an age when the minds of
men shall be more flexible, when the prejudices of their
fathers shall have no place, and when the rules of virtue
and religion, justly recommended, shall be more grate-
fully accepted than they may be now, that our children
may rise up in judgment against their fathers, and one
generation be edified by the same teaching which
another generation had despised.

THE PUBLISHER'S INTRODUCTION.
THE publishing this extraordinary volume will
appear to be no presumption, when it shall be
remembered with what unexpected good and
evil will the former volumes have been accepted in
the world.
If the foundation has been so well laid, the structure
cannot but be expected to bear a proportion; and while
the parable has been so diverting, the moral must cer-
tainly be equally agreeable.
The success the two former parts have met with
has been known by the envy it has brought upon the
editor, expressed in a thousand hard words from the
men of trade—the effect of that regret which they
entertained at their having no share in it. And I must
do the author the justice to say, that not a dog has
wagged his tongue at the work itself, nor has a word
been said to lessen the value of it, but which has been
the visible effect of that envy at the good fortune of
the bookseller.
The riddle is now expounded, and the intelligent
reader may see clearly the end and design of the whole
work; that it is calculated for, and dedicated to, the
improvement and instruction of mankind in the ways of
virtue and piety, by representing the various circum-
stances to which mankind is exposed, and encouraging

such as fall into ordinary or extraordinary casualties of
life, how to work through difficulties with unwearied
diligence and application, and look up to Providence
for success.
The observations and reflections, that take up this
volume, crown the work; if the doctrine has been
accepted, the application must of necessity please; and
the author shows now, that he has learned sufficient
experience how to make other men wise and himself
happy.
The moral of the fable, as the author calls it, is
most instructing; and those who challenged him most
maliciously, with not making his pen useful, will have
leisure to reflect, that they passed their censure too
soon, and, like Solomon's fool, judged of the matter
before they heard it.
Those whose avarice, prevailing over their honesty,
had invaded the property of this book by a corrupt
abridgment, have both failed in their hope and been
ashamed of the fact; shifting off the guilt, as well as
they could, though weakly, from one to another. The
principal pirate is gone to his place, and we say no
more of him—De mortuis nil nisi bonum: it is satis-
faction enough that the attempt has proved abortive, as
the baseness of the design might give them reason to
expect it would.
SERIOUS REFLECTIONS
ROBINSON CRUSOE
INTRODUCTION
I MUST have made very little use of my solitary and
wandering years if, after such a scene of wonders,
as my life may be justly called, I had nothing to
say, and had made no observations which might be
useful and instructing, as well as pleasant and diverting,
to those that are to come after me.
Chapter t.
Of Solitude.
How incapable to make us happy, and how unqualified
to a Christian life.
IHAVE frequently looked back, you may be sure,
and that with different thoughts, upon the notions
of a long tedious life of solitude, which I have
represented to the world, and of which you must have III. A
2 SERIOUS REFLECTIONS OF
formed some ideas, from the life of a man in an
island. Sometimes I have wondered how it could be
supported, especially for the first years, when the change
was violent and imposed, and nature unacquainted with
anything like it. Sometimes I have as much wondered
why it should be any grievance or affliction, seeing upon
the whole view of the stage of life which we act upon
in this world it seems to me that life in general is, or
ought to be, but one universal act of solitude; but I
find it is natural to judge of happiness by its suiting or
not suiting our own inclinations. Everything revolves
in our minds by innumerable circular motions, all
centering in ourselves. We judge of prosperity and of
affliction, joy and sorrow, poverty, riches, and all the
various scenes of life—I say, we judge of them by
ourselves. Thither we bring them home, as meats
touch the palate, by which we try them; the gay
part of the world, or the heavy part; it is all one,
they only call it pleasant or unpleasant, as they suit our
taste.
The world, I say, is nothing to us but as it is more
or less to our relish. All reflection is carried home,
and our dear self is, in one respect, the end of living.
Hence man may be properly said to be alone in the
midst of the crowds and hurry of men and business.
All the reflections which he makes are to himself; all
that is pleasant he embraces for himself; all that is
irksome and grievous is tasted but by his own palate.
What are the sorrows of other men to us, and what
their joy? Something we may be touched indeed with
by the power of sympathy, and a secret turn of the
affections; but all the solid reflection is directed to
ourselves. Our meditations are all solitude in perfec-
tion; our passions are all exercised in retirement; we
love, we hate, we covet, we enjoy, all in privacy and
solitude. All that we communicate of those things to any other is but for their assistance in the pursuit of
our desires; the end is at home; the enjoyment, the
contemplation, is all solitude and retirement; it is for
ourselves we enjoy, and for ourselves we suffer.
What, then, is the silence of life? And how is it afflicting while a man has the voice of his soul to speak to God and to himself? That man can never want
conversation who is company for himself, and he that cannot converse profitably with himself is not fit for any conversation at all. And yet there are many good reasons why a life of solitude, as solitude is now understood by the age, is not at all suited to the life of a
Christian or of a wise man. Without inquiring, there-
fore, into the advantages of solitude, and how it is to
be managed, I desire to be heard concerning what
solitude really is; for I must confess I have different
notions about it, far from those which are generally
understood in the world, and far from all those notions
upon which those people in the primitive times, and
since that also, acted; who separated themselves into
deserts and unfrequented places, or confined them-
selves to cells, monasteries, and the like, retired, as
they call it, from the world. All which, I think,
have nothing of the thing I call solitude in them, nor
do they answer any of the true ends of solitude, much
less those ends which are pretended to be sought after
by those who have talked most of those retreats from
the world.
As for confinement in an island, if the scene was
placed there for this very end, it were not at all amiss.
I must acknowledge there was confinement from the
enjoyments of the world, and restraint from human
society. But all that was no solitude; indeed no part
of it was so, except that which, as in my story, I
applied to the contemplation of sublime things, and
that was but a very little, as my readers well know, compared to what a length of years my forced retreat
lasted.
It is evident then that, as I see nothing but what is
far from being retired in the forced retreat of an island,
the thoughts being in no composure suitable to a retired
condition—no, not for a great while; so I can affirm,
that I enjoy much more solitude in the middle of the
greatest collection of mankind in the world, I mean, at
London, while I am writing this, than ever I could say
I enjoyed in eight and twenty years' confinement to a
desolate island.
I have heard of a man that, upon some extraordinary
disgust which he took at the unsuitable conversation of
some of his nearest relations, whose society he could
not avoid, suddenly resolved never to speak any more.
He kept his resolution most rigorously many years;
not all the tears or entreaties of his friends — no, not of
his wife and children— could prevail with him to break
his silence. It seems it was their ill-behaviour to him,
at first, that was the occasion of it; for they treated
him with provoking language, which frequently put him
into undecent passions, and urged him to rash replies;
and he took this severe way to punish himself for being
provoked, and to punish them for provoking him. But
the severity was unjustifiable; it ruined his family, and
broke up his house. His wife could not bear it, and
after endeavouring, by all the ways possible, to alter
his rigid silence, went first away from him, and after-
wards away from herself, turning melancholy and dis-
tracted. His children separated, some one way and
some another way; and only one daughter, who loved
her father above all the rest, kept with him, tended
him, talked to him by signs, and lived almost dumb
like her father near twenty-nine years with him; till
being very sick, and in a high fever, delirious as we call
it, or light-headed, he broke his silence, not knowing when he did it, and spoke, though wildly at first.
He recovered of the illness afterwards, and frequently
talked with his daughter, but not much, and very
seldom to anybody else.
Yet this man did not live a silent life with respect to
himself; he read continually, and wrote down many
excellent things, which deserved to have appeared in
the world, and was often heard to pray to God in his
solitudes very audibly and with great fervency; but
the unjustice which his rash vow — if it was a vow — of
silence was to his family, and the length he carried it,
was so unjustifiable another way, that I cannot say his
instructions could have much force in them.
Had he been a single man, had he wandered into a
strange country or place where the circumstance of it
had been no scandal, his vow of silence might have
been as commendable and, as I think, much more than
any of the primitive Christians' vows of solitude were,
whose retreat into the wilderness, and giving themselves
up to prayer and contemplation, shunning human society
and the like, was so much esteemed by the primitive
fathers; and from whence our religious houses and
orders of religious people were first derived.
The Jews said John the Baptist had a devil because
he affected solitude and retirement; and they took it
from an old proverb they had in the world at that time,
that "every solitary person must be an angel or a
devil."
A man under a vow of perpetual silence, if but
rigorously observed, would be, even on the Exchange
of London, as perfectly retired from the world as a
hermit in his cell, or a solitaire in the deserts of Arabia;
and if he is able to observe it rigorously, may reap all
the advantages of those solitudes without the unjusti-
fiable part of such a life, and without the austerities of
a life among brutes. For the soul of a man, under a due and regular conduct, is as capable of reserving
itself, or separating itself from the rest of human society,
in the midst of a throng, as it is when banished into a
desolate island.
The truth is, that all those religious hermit-like
solitudes, which men value themselves so much upon, are
but an acknowledgment of the defect or imperfection
of our resolutions, our incapacity to bind ourselves to
needful restraints, or rigorously to observe the limitations
we have vowed ourselves to observe. Or, take it thus,
that the man first resolving that it would be his felicity
to be entirely given up to conversing only with heaven
and heavenly things, to be separated to prayer and good
works, but being sensible how ill such a life will agree
with flesh and blood, causes his soul to commit a rape
upon his body, and to carry it by force, as it were, into
a desert, or into a religious retirement, from whence it
cannot return, and where it is impossible for it to have
any converse with mankind, other than with such as are
under the same vows and the same banishment. The
folly of this is evident many ways.
I shall bring it home to the case in hand thus:
Christians may, without doubt, come to enjoy all the
desirable advantages of solitude by a strict retirement
and exact government of their thoughts, without any
of these formalities, rigours, and apparent mortifications,
which I think I justly call a rape upon human nature,
and consequently without the breach of Christian duties,
which they necessarily carry with them, such as reject-
ing Christian communion, sacraments, ordinances, and
the like.
There is no need of a wilderness to wander among
wild beasts, no necessity of a cell on the top of a
mountain, or a desolate island in the sea; if the mind
be confined, if the soul be truly master of itself, all is
safe; for it is certainly and effectually master of the -
body, and what signify retreats, especially a forced
retreat as mine was? The anxiety of my circum-
stances there, I can assure you, was such for a time
as was very unsuitable to heavenly meditations, and even
when that was got over, the frequent alarms from the
savages put the soul sometimes to such extremities of
fear and horror, that all manner of temper was lost,
and I was no more fit for religious exercises than a
sick man is fit for labour.
Divine contemplations require a composure of soul,
uninterrupted by any extraordinary motions or disorders
of the passions; and this, I say, is much easier to be
obtained and enjoyed in the ordinary course of life,
than in monkish cells and forcible retreats.
The business is to get a retired soul, a frame of
mind truly elevated above the world, and then we may
be alone whenever we please, in the greatest apparent
hurry of business or company. If the thoughts are
free, and rightly unengaged, what imports the employ-
ment the body is engaged in? Does not the soul act
by a differing agency, and is not the body the servant,
nay, the slave of the soul? Has the body hands to
act, or feet to walk, or tongue to speak, but by the
agency of the understanding and will, which are the
two deputies of the soul's power? Are not all the
affections and all the passions, which so universally
agitate, direct, and possess the body, are they not all
seated in the soul? What have we to do then, more
or less, but to get the soul into a superior direction and
elevation? There is no need to prescribe the body to
this or that situation; the hands, or feet, or tongue
can no more disturb the retirement of the soul, than a
man having money in his pocket can take it out, or
pay it, or dispose of it by his hand, without his own
knowledge.
It is the soul's being entangled by outward objects that interrupts its contemplation of Divine objects, which
is the excuse for these solitudes, and makes the removing
the body from those outward objects seemingly neces-
sary; but what is there of religion in all this? For
example, a vicious inclination removed from the object
is still a vicious inclination, and contracts the same
guilt as if the object were at hand; for if, as our Saviour
says, "He that looketh on a woman to lust after her"
—that is, to desire her unlawfully — has committed the
adultery already, so it will be no inverting our Saviour's
meaning to say that he that thinketh of a woman to
desire her unlawfully has committed adultery with her
already, though he has not looked on her, or has not
seen her at that time. And how shall this thinking of
her be removed by transporting the body? It must
be removed by the change in the soul, by bringing the
mind to be above the power or reach of the allure-
ment, and to an absolute mastership over the wicked
desire; otherwise the vicious desire remains, as the
force remains in the gunpowder, and will exert itself
whenever touched with the fire.
All motions to good or evil are in the soul. Out-
ward objects are but second causes; and though, it is
true, separating the man from the object is the way to
make any act impossible to be committed, yet where
the guilt does not lie in the act only, but in the inten-
tion or desire to commit it, that separation is nothing at
all, and effects nothing at all. There may be as much
adultery committed in a monastery, where a woman
never comes, as in any other place, and perhaps is so.
The abstaining from evil, therefore, depends not only
and wholly upon limiting or confining the man's actions,
but upon the man's limiting and confining his desires;
seeing to desire to sin is to sin; and the fact which we
would commit if we had opportunity is really com-
mitted, and must be answered for as such. What, then, is thereof religion, I say, in forced retirements
from the world, and vows of silence or solitude?
They are all nothing. 'Tis a retired soul that alone
is fit for contemplation, and it is the conquest of our
desires to sin that is the only human preservative
against sin.
It was a great while after I came into human society
that I felt some regret at the loss of the solitary hours
and retirements I had in the island; but when I came
to reflect upon some ill-spent time, even in my soli-
tudes, I found reason to see what I have said above—
that a man may sin alone several ways, and find subject
of repentance for his solitary crimes as well as he may
in the midst of a populous city.
The excellency of any state of life consists in its
freedom from crime; and it is evident to our experi-
ence that some society may be better adapted to a
rectitude of life than a complete solitude and retire-
ment. Some have said that next to no company, good
company is best; but it is my opinion, that next to
good company, no company is best; for as it is certain
that no company is better than bad company, so 'tis
as certain that good company is much better than no
company.
In solitude a man converses with himself, and as~a~~[
wise man said, he is not always sure that he does not converse with his enemy; but he that is in good company is sure to be always among his friends. ,,- A
The company of religious and good men is a constant
restraint from evil, and an encouragement to a religious
life. You have there the beauty of religion exemplified;
you never want as well instruction in, as example for,
all that is good; you have a contempt of evil things
constantly recommended, and the affections moved to
delight in what is good by hourly imitation. If we are
alone we want all these, and are led right or led wrong, as the temper of the mind, which is sometimes too
much the guide of our actions as well as thoughts,
happens to be constituted at that time. Here we have
no restraint upon our thoughts but from ourselves, no
restraint upon our actions but from our own consciences,
and nothing to assist us in our mortifications of our
desires, or in directing our desires, but our own reflec-
tions, which, after all, may often err, often be pre-
possessed.
If you would retreat from the world, then be sure
to retreat to good company, retreat to good books, and
retreat to good thoughts; these will always assist one
another, and always join to assist him that flies to them
in his meditations, direct him to just reflections, and
mutually encourage him against whatever may attack
him from within him or without him; whereas to
retreat from the world, as it is called, is to retreat from
good men, who are our best friends. Besides, to
retreat, as we call it, to an entire perfect solitude, is to
retreat from the public worship of God, to forsake the
assemblies, and, in a word, is unlawful, because it
obliges us to abandon those things which we are com-
manded to do.
S" Solitude, therefore, as I understand by it, a retreat
from human society, on a religious or philosophical
account, is a mere cheat; it neither can answer the end
it proposes, or qualify us for the duties of religion,
which we are commanded to perform, and is therefore
both irreligious in itself, and inconsistent with a Christian
life many ways. Let the man that would reap the
advantage of solitude, and that understands the meaning
of the word, learn to retire into himself. Serious
meditation is the essence of solitude; all the retreats
into woods and deserts are short of this; and though a
man that is perfectly master of this retirement may be
a little in danger of quietism, that is to say, of an 
affectation of reservedness, yet it may be a slander upon
him in the main, and he may make himself amends
upon the world by the blessed calm of his soul, which
they perhaps who appear more cheerful may have
little of.
Retiring into deserts in the first days of religion, and
into abbeys and monasteries since, what have they been,
or what have they been able to do, towards purchasing
the retirement I speak of? They have indeed been
things to be reckoned among austerities and acts of
mortification, and so far might be commendable; but I
must insist upon it, that a retired soul is not affected
with them any more than with the hurries of company
and society. When the soul of a man is powerfully
engaged in any particular subject, 'tis like that of St. Paul, wrapt up, whether it be into the third heaven, or
to any degree of lower exaltation. Such a man may
well say with the apostle above, "Whether I was in
the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell." It was
in such a wrapt-up state, that I conceived what I call
my vision of the angelical world, of which I have here
subjoined a very little part.
Is it rational to believe, that a mind exalted so far
above the state of things with which we ordinarily con-
verse, should not be capable of a separation from them,
which, in a word, is the utmost extent of solitude?
Let such never afflict themselves that they cannot
retreat from the world; let them learn to retreat in
the world, and they shall enjoy a perfect solitude, as
complete, to all intents and purposes, as if they were to
live in the cupola of St. Paul's, or as if they were to live
upon the top of Cheviot Hill in Northumberland.
They that cannot be retired in this manner must not
only retire from the world, but out of the world, before
they can arrive to any true solitude. Man is a creature
so formed for society, that it may not only be said that it is not good for him to be alone, but 'tis really im-
possible he should be alone. We are so continually in
need of one another, nay, in such absolute necessity of
assistance from one another, that those who have pre-
tended to give us the lives and manner of the solitaires,
as they call them, who separated themselves from man-
kind, and wandered in the deserts of Arabia and Lybia,
are frequently put to the trouble of bringing the angels
down from heaven to do one drudgery or another for
them, forming imaginary miracles to make the life
of a true solitaire possible. Sometimes they have no
bread, sometimes no water, for a long time together,
and then a miracle is brought upon the stage, to make
them live so long without food; at other times they
have angels come to be their cooks, and bring them
roast-meat; to be their physicians, to bring them
physic, and the like. If St. Hilary comes in his
wanderings to the river Nile, an humble crocodile is
brought to carry him over upon his back; though they
do not tell us whether the crocodile asked him to ride,
or he asked the crocodile, or by what means they came
to be so familiar with one another. And what is all
this to the retirement of the soul, with which it con-
verses in heaven in the midst of infinite crowds of men,
and to whom the nearest of other objects is nothing at
all, any more than the objects of mountains and deserts,
lions and leopards, and the like, were to those that
banished themselves to Arabia?
Besides, in a state of life where circumstances are
easy, and provision for the necessaries of life, which
the best saint cannot support the want of, is quietly and
plentifully made, has not the mind infinitely more room
to withdraw from the world, than when at best it must
wander for its daily food, though it were but the pro-
duct of the field?
Let no man plead he wants retirement, that he loves solitude, but cannot enjoy it because of the embarrass-
ment of the world; 'tis all a delusion; if he loves it,
if he desires it, he may have it when, where, and as
often as he pleases, let his hurries, his labours, or his
afflictions be what they will; it is not the want of an op-
portunity for solitude, but the want of a capacity of being
solitary, that is the case in all the circumstances of life.
I knew a poor but good man, who, though he was
a labourer, was a man of sense and religion, who, being
hard at work with some other men removing a great
quantity of earth to raise a bank against the side of a
pond, was one day so out of himself, and wrapt up in
a perfect application of his mind to a very serious
subject, that the poor man drove himself and his
wheelbarrow into the pond, and could not recover
himself till help came to him. This man was cer-
tainly capable of a perfect solitude, and perhaps really
enjoyed it, for, as I have often heard him say, he
lived alone in the world: (1) Had no family to
embarrass his affections;(2) his low circumstances
placed him below the observation of the upper degrees
of mankind;(3) and his reserved meditations placed
him above the wicked part, who were those in a sphere
equal to himself, among whom, as he said, and is most
true, it was very hard to find a sober man, much less a
good man; so that he lived really alone in the world,
applied himself to labour for his subsistence, had no
other business with mankind but for necessaries of life,
and conversed in heaven as effectually, and, I believe,
every way as divinely, as St. Hilary did in the deserts
of Lybia among the lions and crocodiles.
If this retirement, which they call solitude, consisted
only of separating the person from the world — that is
to say, from human society — it were itself a very mean
thing, and would every way as well be supplied by
removing from a place where a man is known to a place where he is not known, and there accustom him-
self to a retired life, making no new acquaintance, and
only making the use of mankind which I have already
spoken of, namely, for convenience and supply of neces-
sary food; and I think of the two that such a man, or
a man so retired, may have more opportunity to be an
entire recluse, and may enjoy more real solitude than a
man in a desert. For example :—
In the solitude I speak of, a man has no more to do
for the necessaries of life than to receive them from the
hands of those that are to furnish them, and pay them
for so doing; whereas in the solitude of deserts and
wandering lives, from whence all our monkish devotion
springs, they had every day their food, such as it was,
to seek, or the load of it to carry, and except where,
as is said, they put Providence to the operation of a
miracle to furnish it, they had frequently difficulties
enough to sustain life; and if we may believe history,
many of them were starved to death for mere hunger
or thirst, and as often the latter as the former.
Those that had recourse to these solitudes merely as
a mortification of their bodies, as I observed before,
and delivering themselves from the temptations which
society exposed them to, had more room for the pre-
tence, indeed, than those who allege that they did it
to give up themselves to prayer and meditation. The
first might have some reason in nature for the fact, as
men's tempers and constitutions might lead; some
having an inordinate appetite to crime, some addicted by
nature to one ill habit, some to another, though the
Christian religion does not guide us to those methods
of putting a force upon our bodies to subdue the
violence of inordinate appetite. The blessed apostle
St. Paul seems to have been in this circumstance when
being assaulted with what is called in the text "a
thorn in the flesh;" be it what it will that is meant there, it is not to my purpose, but he prayed to the
Lord thrice; that was the first method the apostle
took, and thereby set a pious example to all those who
are assaulted by any temptation. He did not imme-
diately fly to austerities and bodily modifications, sepa-
rating himself from mankind, or flying into the desert
to give himself up to fasting, and a retreat from the
world, which is the object of all private snare, but he
applied himself by serious prayer to Him who had
taught us to pray, "Lead us not into temptation."
And the answer likewise is instructing in the case; he
was not driven out as Nebuchadnezzar into the desert
—he was not commanded to retire into the wilderness
that he might be free from the temptation; nothing
less; but the answer was, "My grace is sufficient for
thee"— sufficient without the help of artificial morti-
fication.
So that even in the case of these forcible morti-
fications they are not required, much less directed, for
helps to meditation; for if meditation could not be
practised beneficially, and to all the intents and pur-
poses for which it was ordained a duty, without flying
from the face of human society, the life of man would
be very unhappy.
But doubtless the contrary is evident, and all the
parts of a complete solitude are to be as effectually
enjoyed, if we please, and sufficient grace assisting,
even in the most populous cities, among the hurries of
conversation and gallantry of a court, or the noise and
business of a camp, as in the deserts of Arabia and
Lybia, or in the desolate life of an uninhabited island.

Chapter ii
An Essay upon Honesty.
WHEN I first came home to my own country,
and began to sit down and look back upon
the past circumstances of my wandering state,
as you will in charity suppose I could not but do very
often, the very prosperity I enjoyed led me most
naturally to reflect upon the particular steps by which
I arrived to it. The condition I was in was very
happy, speaking of human felicity; the former captivity
I had suffered made my liberty sweeter to me; and
to find myself jumped into easy circumstances at once,
from a condition below the common rate of life, made
it still sweeter.
One time as I was upon my inquiries into the happy
concurrence of the causes which had brought the event
of my prosperity to pass, as an effect, it occurred to
my thoughts how much of it all depended, under the
disposition of Providence, upon the principle of honesty
which I met with in almost all the people whom it
was my lot to be concerned with in my private and
particular affairs; and I that had met with such extra-
ordinary instances of the knavery and villainy of men's
natures in other circumstances, could not but be some-
thing taken up with the miracles of honesty that I had
met with among the several people I had had to do
with, I mean, those whom I had more particularly to
do with in the articles of my liberty, estate, or effects,
which fell into their hands. I began with my most trusty and faithful widow, the
captain's wife with whom I first went to the coast of
Africa, and to whom I entrusted ^200, being the
gain I had made in my first adventures to Guinea,
as in the first volume, page 18, appears.
She was left a widow, and in but indifferent circum-
stances; but when I sent to her so far off as the Brazils,
where I was in such a condition as she might have
reasonably believed I should never have been able to
come myself, and if I had, might be in no con-
dition to recover it of her, and having myself nothing
to show under her hand for the trust, yet she was so
just that she sent the full value of what I wrote for,
being ^ioo; and to show, as far as in her lay, her
sincere honest concern for my good, put in among
many necessary things which I did not write for, I
say, put in two Bibles, besides other good books, for my
reading and instruction, as she said afterwards, in Popish
and heathen countries, where I might chance to fall.
Honesty not only leads to discharge every debt and
every trust to our neighbour, so far as is justly to be
demanded, but an honest man acknowledges himself
debtor to all mankind, for so much good to be done for
them, whether for soul or body, as Providence puts an
opportunity into his hands to do. In order to dis-
charge this debt, he studies continually for opportunity
to do all the acts of kindness and beneficence that is
possible for him to do; and though very few consider it, a
man is not a completely honest man that does not do this. Upon this consideration I question much whether a
covetous, narrow, stingy man, as we call him, one who
gives himself up to himself, as born for himself only,
and who declines the advantages and opportunities of
doing good, I mean extremely so — I say, I much ques-
tion whether such a man can be an honest man; nay,
I am satisfied he cannot be an honest man, for though
he may pay every man his own, and be just, as he thinks
it, to a farthing, yet this is part of the justice which, in
the common phrase, is the greatest injustice. This is
one meaning of that saying, summumjus, summa injuria. To pay every man their own is the common law in. b
of honesty, but to do good to all mankind, as far as you
are able, is the chancery law of honesty j and though,
in common law or justice, as I call it, mankind can
have no claim upon us if we do but just pay our debts,
yet in heaven's chancery they will have relief against us,
for they have a demand in equity of all the good to be
done them that it is in our power to do, and this
chancery court, or court of equity, is held in every man's
breast —'tis a true court of conscience, and every man's
conscience is a lord chancellor to him. If he has not
performed, if he has not paid this debt, conscience will
decree him to pay it, on the penalty of declaring him a
dishonest man, even in his own opinion; and if he
still refuses to comply, will proceed by all the legal
steps of a court of conscience process, till at last it will
issue out a writ of rebellion against him, and proclaim
him a rebel to nature and his own conscience.
But this is by the way, and is occasioned by the
observations I have made of many people who think they
are mighty honest if they pay their debts, and owe no
man anything, as they call it; at the same time, like
true misers, who lay up all for themselves, they think
nothing of the debt of charity and beneficence which
they owe to all mankind.
Rich men are their Maker's freeholders; they enjoy
freely the estate He has given them possession of, with
all the rents, profits, and emoluments, but charged with
a fee-farm rent to the younger children of the family,
namely, the poor; or if you will, you may call them
God's copy-holders, paying a quit-rent to the lord of
the manor, which quit-rent he has assigned for the use
of the rest of mankind, to be paid in a constant dis-
charge of all good offices, friendly, kind, and generous
actions; and he that will notpay his rent cannot be an
honest man, any more than he that would not pay his
other just debts.

The Scripture concurs exactly with this notion of
mine; the miser is called by the prophet Isaiah a
vile person, one that works iniquity, and practises
hypocrisy, and utters error before the Lord (Isaiah
xxxii. 6). How does this appear? The very next
words explain it. "He makes empty the soul of the
hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to
fail." But lest this should seem a strained text, let us
read on, both before and after verse 5. "The vile
person shall no more be called liberal, nor the churl
said to be bountiful." Here the opposite to a liberal
man is called a vile person, and the opposite to a bounti-
ful man is called a churl; and in the verse following,
the same vile person, as opposed to the liberal man,
is called a wicked man, and the liberal man is set up
a pattern for us all, in opposition to the vile, churlish,
covetous wretch. — Vers. 7, 8. "The instruments also
of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to
destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
needy speaketh right; but the liberal deviseth liberal
things, and by liberal things shall he stand."
In a word, I think my opinion justified by this text,
that a churl, a morose, sour disposition, a covetous,
avaricious, selfish-principled man, cannot be an honest
man: he does not pay the common debt of mankind to
one another, nor the fee-farm or quit-rent of his estate
to God, who is his great landlord or lord of the manor,
and who has charged the debt upon him. I know
the miser will laugh at this notion, but I speak my own
opinion, let it go as far as reason will carry it.
I come back to the examples I was giving in my
private case. As the widow was honest to me, so
was my good Portuguese captain; and it is this man's
original honesty that makes me speak of the honest
man's debt to mankind. It was honesty, a generous
honesty, that led the poor man to take me up at sea, which, if he had neglected, my boy Xury and 1 had
perished together; it was no debt to me in particular,
but a debt to mankind, that he paid in that action, and
yet he could not have been an honest man without it.
You will say, if he had gone away and left me, he had
been barbarous and inhuman, and deserved to be left to
perish himself in the like distress; but, I say, this is
not all the case; custom and the nature of the thing
leads us to say it would have been hard-hearted and
inhuman, but conscience will tell any man that it was a
debt, and he could not but be condemned by the court
of conscience in his own breast if the had omitted it—
nay, in the sight of Heaven he had tacitly killed us, and
had been as guilty of our death as a murderer, for he
that refuses to save a life thrown into his hands takes it
away; and if there is a just retribution in a future state,
if blood is at all required there, the blood of every man,
woman, and child whom we could have saved, and did
not, shall be reckoned to us at that day as spilt by our
own hands; for leaving life in a posture in which it must
inevitably perish, is without question causing it to perish,
and will be called so then, by whatever gilded dressed-up words we may express and conceal it now.
But I go farther, for my good Portuguese went
farther with me; he not only paid the debt he owed
to Heaven in saving our lives, but he went farther — he
took nothing of what I had, though, in the common
right of the sea, it was all his due for salvage, as the
sailors call it; but he gave me the value of everything,
bought my boat, which he might have turned adrift,
my boy Xury, who was not my slave by any right, or,
if he had, became free from that time; and the life of
Xury, which he had saved, as a servant, was his own,
yet he bought everything of me for the full value, and
took nothing of me, no, not for my passage.
Here was the liberal man devising liberal things, and the sequel made good the promissory text, for by
these liberal things the honest liberal man might be
truly said to stand. When I came to reward him at
my coming to Lisbon to sell my plantation at Brazil,
then he being poor and reduced, and not able to pay
even what he owed me, I gave him a reward sufficient
to make his circumstances easy all his life after.
The bounty of this man to me, when first he took
me up out of the sea, was the highest and most com-
plete act of honesty — a generous honesty, laying hold
of an opportunity to do good to an object offered by
the providence of Heaven, and thereby acknowledging
the debt he had to pay to his Maker in the persons of
His most distressed creatures.
And here also let me remind my readers of what,
perhaps, they seldom much regard; it is not only a
gift from Heaven to us to be put in a condition of
doing good, but 'tis a gift, and a favour from Heaven,
to have an opportunity of doing the good we are in
a condition to do, and we ought to close with the
opportunity, as a particular gift from above, and be as
thankful for it, I say, as thankful for the occasion of
doing good, as for the ability.
I might mention here the honesty of my fellow-
planter in the Brazils, and of the two merchants and
their sons, by whose integrity I had my share in the
plantation preserved and taken care of; as also the
honesty of the public treasurer for the church there,
and the like; but I am carried off in my thoughts, to
enlarge upon this noble principle, from the two examples
I have already mentioned, viz., the Guinea captain's
widow and the Portuguese; and this in particular,
because, since I came to England to reside, I have met
with abundance of disputes about honesty, especially in
cases where honest men come to be unhappy men,
when they fall into such circumstances as they cannot be honest, or rather, cannot show the principle of
honesty which is really at the bottom of all their
actions, and which, but for those circumstances which
entirely disable them, would certainly show itself in
every branch of their lives; such men I have too often
seen branded for knaves by those who, if they come
into the same condition, would perhaps do the same
things, or worse than they may have done. Both my widow and my Portuguese captain fell
into low circumstances, so that they could not make
good to me my money that was in their hands; and
yet both of them showed to me that they had not only a
principle of justice, but of generous honesty too, when
the opportunity was put into their hands to do so.
This put me upon inquiring and debating with
myself what this subtle and imperceptible thing called
honesty is, and how it might be described, setting
down my thoughts at several times, as objects pre-
sented, that posterity, if they think them worth while,
may find them both useful and diverting. And first,
I thought it not improper to lay down the conditions
upon which I am to enter upon that description, that
I may not be mistaken, but be allowed to explain
what I mean by honesty, before I undertake to enter
upon any discourses or observations about it.
And to come directly to it, for I would make as
few preambles as possible, I shall crave the liberty, in
all the following discourse, to take the term honesty,
as I think all English expressions ought to be taken,
namely, honestly, in the common acceptation of the
word, the general vulgar sense of it, without any
circumlocutions or double-entendres whatsoever; for I
desire to speak plainly and sincerely. Indeed, as I
have no talent at hard words, so I have no great vene-
ration for etymologies, especially in English, but
since I am treating of honesty, I desire to do it, as I say above, honestly, according to the genuine significa-
tion of the thing.
Neither shall I examine whether honesty be a
natural or an acquired virtue — whether a habit or a
quality — whether inherent or accidental: all the philo-
sophical part of it I choose to omit.
Neither shall I examine it as it extends to spirituals
and looks towards religion; if we inquire about honesty
towards God, I readily allow all men are born knaves,
villains, thieves, and murderers, and nothing but the
restraining power of Providence withholds us all from
showing ourselves such on all occasions.
No man can be just to his Maker; if he could, all
our creeds and confessions, litanies and supplications,
were ridiculous contradictions and impertinences, in-
consistent with themselves, and with the whole tenor
of human life.
In all the ensuing discourse, therefore, I am to be
understood of honesty, as it regards mankind among
themselves, as it looks from one man to another, in
those necessary parts of man's life, his conversation
and negotiation, trusts, friendships, and all the inci-
dents of human affairs.
The plainness I profess, both in style and method,
seems to me to have some suitable analogy to the sub-
ject, honesty, and therefore is absolutely necessary to
be strictly followed; and I must own, I am the better
reconciled, on this very account, to a natural infirmity
of homely plain writing, in that I think the plainness
of expression, which I am condemned to, will give no
disadvantage to my subject, since honesty shows the
most beautiful, and the more like honesty, when arti-
fice is dismissed, and she is honestly seen by her own
light only; likewise the same sincerity is required in
the reader, and he that reads this essay without
honesty, will never understand it right; she must, I r
say, be viewed by her own light. If prejudice, parti-
ality, or private opinions stand in the way, the man's
a reading knave, he is not honest to the subject; and
upon such an one all the labour is lost—this work is
of no use to him, and, by my consent, the bookseller
should give him his money again.
If any man, from his private ill-nature, takes excep-
tions at me, poor, wild, wicked Robinson Crusoe, for
prating of such subjects as this is, and shall call either
my sins or misfortunes to remembrance, in prejudice of
what he reads, supposing me thereby unqualified to
defend so noble a subject as this of honesty, or, at
least, to handle it honestly, I take the freedom to tell
such, that those very wild wicked doings and mistakes
of mine render me the properest man alive to give
warning to others, as the man that has been sick is half
a physician. Besides, the confession which I all along
make of my early errors, and which Providence, you
see, found me leisure enough to repent of, and, I hope,
gave me assistance to do it effectually, assists to qualify
me for the present undertaking, as well to recommend
that rectitude of soul which I call honesty to others, as
to warn those who are subject to mistake it, either in
themselves or others. Heaven itself receives those who
sincerely repent into the same state of acceptance as if
they had not sinned at all, and so should we also.
They who repent, and their ill lives amend,
Stand next to those who never did offend.
Nor do I think a man ought to be afraid or ashamed
to own and acknowledge his follies and mistakes, but
rather to think it a debt which honesty obliges him to
pay; besides, our infirmities and errors, to which all
men are equally subject, when recovered from, leave such impressions behind them on those who sincerely
repent of them, that they are always the forwardest 
to accuse and reproach themselves. No man need
advise them or lead them; and this gives the greatest
discovery of the honesty of the man's heart, and sin-
cerity of principles. Some people tell us they think
they need not make any open acknowledgment of their
follies, and 'tis a cruelty to exact it of them—that they
could rather die than submit to it — that their spirits
are too great for it — that they are more afraid to come
to such public confessions and recognitions than they
would be to meet a cannon bullet, or to face an enemy.
But this is a poor mistaken piece of false bravery; all
shame is cowardice, as an eminent poet tells us that
all courage is fear; the bravest spirit is the best qualified
for a penitent. 'Tis a strange thing that we should
not be ashamed to offend, but should be ashamed to
repent; not afraid to sin, but afraid to confess. This
very thought extorted the following lines from a friend
of mine, with whom I discoursed upon this head:—
Among the worst of cowards let him be named,
Who, having sinned, 's afraid to be ashamed;
And to mistaken courage he's betrayed,
Who, having sinned, 's ashamed to be afraid. But to leave the point of courage and cowardice in
our repenting of our offences, I bring it back to the
very point I am upon, namely, that of honesty. A
man cannot be truly an honest man without acknow-
ledging the mistakes he has made, particularly without
acknowledging the wrong done to his neighbour; and
why, pray, is justice less required in his acknowledg-
ment to his Maker? He, then, that will be honest
must dare to confess he has been a knave; for, as
above, speaking of our behaviour to God, we have
been all knaves, and all dishonest; and if we come to
speak strictly, perhaps it would hold in our behaviour
to one another also, for where's the man that is not
chargeable by some or other of his neighbours, or by '
himself, with doing wrong, with some oppression or
injury, either of the tongue or of the hands?
I might enlarge here upon the honesty of the tongue,
a thing some people, who call themselves very honest
men, keep a very slender guard upon, I mean, as to
evil-speaking, and of all evil-speaking that worst kind
of it, the speaking hard and unjust things of one
another.
This is certainly intended by the command of God,
which is so express and emphatic, Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour; at least that part
which is what we call slander, raising an injurious and
false charge upon the character and conduct of our
neighbour, and spreading it for truth. But this is not all; that honesty I am speaking of
respects all detraction, all outrageous assaults of the
tongue; reproach is as really a part of dishonesty as
slander, and though not so aggravated in degree, yet
'tis the same in kind.
There is a kind of murder that may be committed
with the tongue, that is in its nature as cruel as that of
the hand. This can never be the practice of an honest
man; nay, he that practises it cannot be an honest man.
But perhaps I may come to this again, but I must
go back to explain myself upon the subject a little
farther in the general, and then you shall hear more of
me as to the particulars.
Of Honesty in General.
I have always observed, that however few the real
honest men are, yet every man thinks himself and
proclaims himself an honest man. Honesty, like
heaven, has all men's good word, and all men pretend
to a share of it; so general is the claim, that like a
jest which is spoiled by the repetition, 'tis grown of no value for a man to swear by his faith, which is, in
its original meaning, by his honesty, and ought to be
understood so.
Like heaven, too, 'tis little understood by those
who pretend most to it; 'tis too often squared accord-
ing to men's private interest, though at the same time
the latitude which some men give themselves is incon-
sistent with its nature.
Honesty is a general probity of mind, an aptitude
to act justly and honourably in all cases, religious and
civil, and to all persons, superior or inferior; neither
is ability or disability to act so any part of the thing
itself in this sense.
It may be distinguished into justice and equity, or,
if you will, into debt and honour, for both make up
but one honesty.
Exact justice is a debt to all our fellow-creatures;and honourable, generous justice is derived from that
golden rule, Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris;and all this put together, makes up honesty; honour,
indeed, is a higher word for it, but 'tis the same thing,
and
Differs from justice only in the name,
For honesty and honour are the same.
This honesty is of so qualifying a nature, that 'tis
the most denominative of all possible virtues; an
honest man is the best title can be given in the world;
all other titles are empty and ridiculous without it, and
no title can be really scandalous if this remain. Tis the capital letter, by which a man's character will be
known, when private qualities and accomplishments
are worm-eaten by time; without it a man can neither
be a Christian or a gentleman. A man may be a
poor honest man, an unfortunate honest man; but a
Christian knave, or a gentleman knave, is a contradic-
tion. A man forfeits his character and his family by r
knavery, and his escutcheon ought to have a particular
blot, like that of bastardy. When a gentleman loses
his honesty, he ceases to be a gentleman, commences
rake from that minute, and ought to be used like one.
Honesty has such a general character in the minds
of men, that the worst of men, who neither practise or
pretend to any part of it, will yet value it in others;
no man ever could be so out of love with it as to
desire his posterity should be without it; nay, such
is the veneration all men have for it, that the general
blessing of a father to his son is, "Pray God make thee
an honest man."
Indeed, so general is the value of it, and so well
known, that it seems needless to say anything in behalf
of it. So far as it is found upon earth, so much of
the first rectitude of nature and of the image of God
seems to be restored to mankind.
The greatest mischief which to me seems to attend
this virtue, like the thorn about the rose, which pricks
the finger of those who meddle with it, is pride; 'tis
a hard thing for a man to be very honest, and not be
proud of it; and though he who is really honest has,
as we say, something to be proud of, yet I take this
honesty to be in a great deal of danger who values
himself too much upon it.
True honest honesty, if I may be allowed such an
expression, has the least relation to pride of any view
in the world; 'tis all simple, plain, genuine, and
sincere; and if I hear a man boast of his honesty, I
cannot help having some fears for him, at least, that
'tis sickly and languishing.
Honesty is a little tender plant, not known to all
who have skill in simples, thick sowed, as they say, and
thin come up; 'tis nice ofgrowth, it seldom thrives in
a very fat soil, and yet a very poor ground, too, is apt
to starve it, unless it has taken very good root. When it once takes to a piece of ground, it will never be quite
destroyed; it may be choked with the weeds of pros-
perity, and sometimes 'tis so scorched up with the
droughts of poverty and necessity, that it seems as if it
were quite dead and gone; but it always revives upon
the least mild weather, and if some showers of plenty
fall, it makes full reparation for the loss the gardener
had in his crop.
There is an ugly weed, called cunning, which is
very pernicious to it, and which particularly injures it,
by hiding it from our discovery, and making it hard to
find. This is so like honesty, that many a man has
been deceived with it, and has taken one for t'other
in the market; nay, I have heard of some who have
planted this wild honesty, as we may call it, in their
own ground, have made use of it in their friendships
and dealings, and thought it had been the true plant,
but they always lost credit by it. And that was not
the worst neither, for they had the loss who dealt with
them, and who chaffered for a counterfeit commodity;
and we find many deceived so still, which is the occa-
sion there is such an outcry about false friends, and
about sharping and tricking in men's ordinary dealings
in the world.
This true honesty, too, has some little difference in
it, according to the soil or climate in which it grows,
and your simplers have had some disputes about the sorts
of it; nay, there have been great heats about the several
kinds of this plant, which grows in different countries,
and some call that honesty which others say is not; as,
particularly, they say, there is a sort of honesty in my
country, Yorkshire honesty, which differs very much
from that which is found in these southern parts about
London; then there is a sort of Scots honesty, which
they say is a meaner sort than that of Yorkshire; and in
New England I have heard they have a kind of honesty r
which is worse than the Scottish, and little better than
the wild honesty called cunning, which I mentioned
before. On the other hand, they tell us that in some
parts of Asia, at Smyrna, and at Constantinople, the
Turks have a better sort of honesty than any of us. I
am sorry our Turkey Company have not imported some
of it, that we might try whether it would thrive here or
no. 'Tis a little odd to me it should grow to such
a perfection in Turkey, because it has always been
observed to thrive best where it is sowed with a sort of
grain called religion; indeed, they never thrive in these
parts of the world so well apart as they do together.
And for this reason, I must own, I have found that
Scots honesty, as above, to be of a very good kind.
How it is in Turkey I know not, for, in all my travels,
I never set my foot in the Grand Seignior's dominions.
But to waive allegories; disputes about what is or is
not honesty are dangerous to honesty itself, for no case
can be doubtful which does not border upon the fron-
tiers of dishonesty; and he that resolves not to be
drowned had best never come near the brink of the
water.
That man who will do nothing but what is barely
honest, is in great danger. It is certainly just for me
to do everything the law justifies, but if I should only
square my actions by what is literally lawful, I must
throw every debtor, though he be poor, in prison, and
never release him till he has paid the uttermost farthing;
I must hang every malefactor without mercy; I must
exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture of
every indenture. In short, I must be uneasy to all
mankind, and make them so to me; and in a word, be
a very knave too, as well as a tyrant, for cruelty is not
honesty.
Therefore, the Sovereign Judge of every man's
honesty has laid us down a general rule, to which all the particulars are resolved, Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne
feceris. This is a part of that honesty I am treating of,
and which indeed is the more essential of the two;
this is the test of behaviour, and the grand article to
have recourse to when laws are silent.
I have heard some men argue, that they are not
bound to any such considerations of the indigence of
persons as lead to concessions of time, or compositions
with them for debts; that 'tis all ex gratia, or the effects
of policy, because circumstances lead them to judge
it better to take what they can get than lose the
whole.
Speaking of the letter of the law, I allow that they
may be in the right.
On the other hand, a man who gives a bond for a debt,
pleads he is answerable for no more than the law will
force him to; that is, he may defend a suit, stand out
to the last extremity, and at last keep out of the way,
so as not to have judgment or execution served on him;
he may secure his estate from the execution, as well as
his person, and so never pay the debt at all, and yet in
the eye of the law be an honest man; and this part of
legal literal honesty is supported only by the other,
namely, the cruel part; for really such a man, speaking
in the sense of common justice, is a knave; he ought
to act according to the true intent and meaning of his
obligation, and in the right of a debtor to a creditor,
which is to pay him his money when it became due,
not stand out to the last, because he cannot be forced
to it sooner.
The laws of the country indeed allow such actions
as the laws of conscience can by no means allow, as in
this case of the creditor suing for his debt, and the
debtor not paying it till he is forced by law. The
argument made use of to vindicate the morality of such
a practice, stands thus :—
If a man trusts me with his money or goods upon my
common credit, or upon my word, he then takes me for
his money, and depends both upon my ability and my
honesty; but if he comes and demands my bond, he
quits his dependence upon my honesty, and takes the
law for his security; so that the language of such an
action is, he will have a bond, that it may be in his
power to make me pay him whether I will or no; and
as for my honesty, he'll have nothing to do with it;
what relief, then, I can have against this bond by the
same law to which the person refers himself, is as legal
an action on my side as the other man's suing for his
own is on his.
And thus the letter of the law will ruin the honesty
of both debtor and creditor, and yet both shall be
justified too.
But if I may give my opinion in this case, neither of
these are the honest man I am speaking of; for honesty
does not consist of negatives, and 'tis not sufficient to do
my neighbour no personal injury in the strict sense and
letter of the law; but I am bound, where cases and
circumstances make other measures reasonable, to have
such regard to these cases and circumstances as reason
requires. Thus, to begin with the creditor to the
debtor, reason requires that where a man is reduced to
extremities, he should not be destroyed for debt; and
what is unreasonable cannot be honest.
Debt is no capital crime, nor ever was; and starving
men in prison, a punishment worse than the gallows,
seems to be a thing so severe as it ought not to be in the
power of a creditor to inflict it. The laws of God never
tolerated such a method of treating debtors as we have
since thought proper, I won't say honest, to put in
practice; but since the politics of the nation have left
the debtor so much at mercy by the letter of the law,
'tis honest, with respect to the law, to proceed so; yet compassion is in this case thought reasonable — why
shouldst thou take his bed from under him? says the
text; which implies, 'tis unnatural and unreasonable.
I have heard some men insist upon it, that if a man
be sued wrongfully at law, he ought rather to submit to
the injury than oppose the wrong by the same law; and
yet I never found those gentlemen so passive in matters
of law, but they would sue a debtor at law if they
could not otherwise obtain their right.
I confess I cannot blame them for the last, but I
blame them for pretending to the first. I am not
arguing against recovering a just debt by a just law,
where the person is able but unwilling to be honest; but
I think pursuing the debtor to all extremities, to the
turning his wife and children into the street, expressed
in the Scripture by taking his bed from under him, and
by keeping the debtor in prison when really he is not
able to pay it — there is something of cruelty in it, and
the honest man I am speaking of can never do it.
But some may object, if I must serve all mankind as
I would be served in like case, then I must relieve every
beggar and release every poor debtor; for if I was a
beggar I would be relieved, and if I was in prison I
would be released; and so I must give away all I have.
This is inverting the argument; for the meaning is in
the negative still, do not to another anything, or put no
hardship upon another, which you would not allow to
be just if you were in their case.
Honesty is equity, every man is lord-chancellor to
himself; and if he would consult that principle within
him would find reason as fair an advocate for his neigh-
bour as for himself. But I proceed.
Of the Trial of Honesty.
Necessity makes an honest man a knave; and if the
world was to be the judge according to the common
I
r
III. Creceived notion, there would not be an honest poor man
left alive.
A rich man is an honest man — no thanks to him;
for he would be a double knave to cheat mankind when
he had no need of it: he has no occasion to press upon
his integrity, nor so much as touch upon the borders
of dishonesty. Tell me of a man that is a very honest
man, for he pays everybody punctually, runs into no-
body's debt, does no man any wrong; very well—what
circumstances is he in? Why, he has a good estate, a
fine yearly income, and no business to do. The devil
must have full possession of this man if he should be a
knave, for no man commits evil for the sake of it; even
the devil himself has some farther design in sinning than
barely the wicked part of it. No man is so hardened
in crimes as to commit them for the mere pleasure of
the fact—there is always some vice gratified; ambition,
pride, or avarice makes rich men knaves, and necessity
the poor. But to go on with this rich honest man;
his neighbour, a thriving merchant, and whose honesty
had as untainted a character as he can pretend to, has
a rich ship cast away, or a factor abroad broke in his
debt, and his bills come back protested, and he fails—
is fain to abscond and make a composition. Our rich
honest man flies out upon him presently — he is a knave,
a rogue, and don't pay people what he owes them; and
we should have a law that he that runs into debt farther
than he is able to pay should be hanged, and the like.
If the poor man is laid hold on by some creditor, and
put in prison —ay, there let him lie, he deserves it;
'twill be an example to keep others from the like.
And now, when all is done, this broken merchant may
be as honest a man as the other.
You say you are an honest man: how do you know
it? Did you ever want bread, and had your neigh-
bour's loaf in your keeping, and would starve rather than eat it? Was youever arrested, and being not able
by yourself or friends to make peace with your plain-
tiff, and at the same time having another man's money
in your cash chest committed to your keeping, suffered
yourself to be carried to gaol rather than break bulk and
break in upon your trust? God Himself has declared
that the power of extremity is irresistible, and that so,
as to our integrity, that He has bid us not despise the
thief that steals in such a case; not that the man is less
a thief, or the fact less dishonest. But the text is most
remarkably worded for instruction in this point; don't
you despise the man, but remember, if you were driven
to the same exigence, you would be the same man and
do the same thing, though now you fancy your principle
so good; therefore, whatever his crime may be as to
God, don't reproach him with it here; but you that
think you stand, take heed lest you fall.
I am of the opinion that I could state a circumstance
in which there is not one man in the world would be
honest. Necessity is above the power of human nature,
and for Providence to suffer a man to fall into that
necessity is to suffer him to sin, because nature is not
furnished with power to defend itself, nor is grace itself
able to fortify the mind against it.
What shall we say to five men in a boat at sea,
without provision, calling a council together, and re-
solving to kill one of themselves for the others to feed
on, and eat him? With what face could the four look
up and crave a blessing on that meat? With what
heart give thanks after it? And yet this has been done
by honest men, and I believe the most honest man in the
world might be forced to it; yet here is no manner of
pretence, but necessity, to palliate the crime. If it be
argued it was the loss of one man to save the four, it is
answered, but what authority to make him die to save
their lives? How came the man to owe them such a '
debt? 'Twas robbery and murder; 'twas robbing him
of his life, which was his property, to preserve mine;
'tis murder, by taking away the life of an innocent
man; and at best 'twas doing evil that good may come,
which is expressly forbidden.
But there is a kind of equity pleaded in this case.
Generally, when men are brought to such a pass, they
cast lots who shall be the man, and the voluntary con-
sent of the party makes it lawful (God Himself being
supposed to determine who shall be the man), which I
deny; for it is in no man's power legally to consent to
such a lot; no man has a right to give away his own
life; he may forfeit it to the law and lose it, but that's
a crime against himself, as well as against the law; and
the four men might by our law have been tried and
hanged for murder. All that can be said is, that
necessity makes the highest crimes lawful, and things
evil in their own nature are made practicable by it.
From these extremes of necessity we come to lighter
degrees of it, and so let us bring our honest man to
some exigencies. He would not wrong any man of a
farthing; he could not sleep if he should be in any-
body's debt; and he cannot be an honest man that can.
That we may see now whether this man's honesty
lies any deeper than his neighbour's, turn the scale of his
fortune a little. His father left him a good estate; but
here come some relations, and they trump up a title to
his lands, and serve ejectments upon his tenants, and
so the man gets into trouble, hurry of business, and the
law. The extravagant charges of the law sink him of
all his ready money, and, his rents being stopped, the
first breach he makes upon his honesty (that is, by his
former rules), he goes to a friend to borrow money,
tells him this matter will be over, he hopes, quickly,
and he shall have his rents to receive, and then he will
pay him again; and really he intends to do so. But here comes a disappointment; the trial comes on, and he is
cast, and his title to the estate proves defective; his
father was cheated, and he not only loses the estate,
but is called upon for the arrears of the rent he has
received; and, in short, the man is undone, and has not
a penny to buy bread or help himself, and, besides this,
cannot pay the money he borrowed. Now, turn to his neighbour the merchant, whom he
had so loudly called knave for breaking in his trade;
he by this time has made up with his creditors and
got abroad again, and he meets him in the street in his
dejected circumstances. "Well," says the merchant,
"and why don't you pay my cousin, your old neighbour,
the money you borrowed of him ?" —" Truly," says
he, "because I have lost all my estate, and can't pay;
nay, I have nothing to live on."—" Well, but, re-
turns the merchant, "wan't you a knave to borrow
money, and now can't pay it ?" —" Why, truly," says
the gentleman, "when I borrowed it I really designed
to be honest, and did not question but I should have my
estate again, and then I had been able also, and would
have paid him to a penny, but it has proved otherwise;
and though I would pay him if I had it, yet I am not
able." —"Well, but," says the merchant again, "did
you not call me knave, though I lost my estate abroad
by unavoidable disasters, as you have lost yours at
home? Did you not upbraid me because I could not
pay? I would have paid everybody, if I could, as well
as you." —" Why, truly," says the gentleman, "I was
a fool; I did not consider what it was to be brought
to necessity; I ask your pardon."
Now, let's carry on this story. The merchant
compounds with his creditors, and paying every one
a just proportion as far as 'twill go, gets himself dis-
charged; and being bred to business, and industrious,
falls into trade again, and raises himself to good circum-
stances, and at last a lucky voyage or some hit of trade
sets him above the world again. The man, remembering
his former debts, and retaining his principle of honesty,
calls his old creditors together, and though he was
formerly discharged from them all, voluntarily pays
them the remainder of their debts. The gentleman
being bred to no business, and his fortune desperate,
goes abroad and gets into the army, and behaving
himself well, is made an officer, and, still rising by his
merit, becomes a great man; but in his new condition
troubles not his head with his former debts in his native
country, but settles in the court and favour of the prince
under whom he has made his fortunes, and there sets
up for the same honest man he did before.
I think I need not ask which of these two is the
honest man, any more than which was the honest
penitent, the Pharisee or the publican.
Honesty, like friendship, is tried in affliction; and
he that cries out loudest against those who in the time
of this trial are forced to give ground, would perhaps
yield as far in the like shock of misfortune.
To be honest when peace and plenty flow upon our
hands, is owing to the blessing of our parents; but to
be honest when circumstances grow narrow, relations
turbulent and quarrelsome, when poverty stares at us,
and the world threatens, this blessing is from Heaven,
and can only be supported from thence. God Almighty
is very little beholding to them who will serve Him
just as long as He feeds them. 'Twas a strong argument
the devil used in that dialogue between Satan and his
Maker about Job. "Yes, he is a mighty good man,
and a mighty just man, and well he may while you
give him everything he wants: I would serve you
myself, and be as true to you as Job, if you would be
as kind and as bountiful to me as you are to him: but
now, do but lay your finger on him; do but stop your 
hand a little, and cut him short; strip him a little, and
make him like one of those poor fellows that now bow
to him, and you will quickly see your good man be
like other men; nay, the passion he will be in at his
losses will make him curse you to your face." Tis true the devil was mistaken in the man, but the argument
had a great deal of probability in it, and the moral
may be drawn, both from the argument and from the
consequences:
1. That 'tis an easy thing to maintain the character
of honesty and uprightness when a man has no business
to be employed in, and no want to press him.
2. That when exigencies and distresses pinch a
man, then is the time to prove the honesty of his
principle.
The prosperous honest man can only by boasting
tell the world he is honest, but the distressed and
ruined honest man hears other people tell him he is
honest.
In this case, therefore, since allowance must be made
for human infirmities, we are to distinguish between an
accident and a practice. I am not pleading to encourage
any man to make no scruple of trespassing upon his
honesty in time of necessity; but I cannot condemn
every man for a knave who by unusual pressures, straits,
difficulties, or other temptation, has been left to slip
and do an ill action, as we call it, which perhaps this
person would never have stooped to if the exigence had
not been too great for his resolution. The Scripture
says of David, "He was a man after God's own
heart;" and yet we have several things recorded of
him, which, according to the modern way of censuring
people in this age, would have given him the character
of a very ill man. But I conceive the testimony of
David's uprightness, given us so authentically from the
Scripture, is given from this very rule, that the inclina-
tion of his heart and the general bent of his practice
were to serve and obey his great Sovereign Benefactor,
however human frailty, backed with extremities of
circumstances or powerful temptations, might betray
him to commit actions which he would not otherwise
have done. The falling into a crime will not denomi-
nate a man dishonest; for humanum est errare. The
character of a man ought to be taken from the general
tenor of his behaviour, and from his allowed practice.
David took the shew-bread from the priests, which it
was not lawful for him to eat. David knew that God,
who commanded the shew-bread should not be eaten,
had, however, commanded him by the law of Nature
not to be starved, and therefore, pressed by his hunger,
he ventures upon the commandment. And the Scrip-
ture is very remarkable in expressing it, "David, when
he was an hungry." And the occasion for which our
blessed Lord Himself quoted this text is very remark-
able, viz., to prove that things otherwise unlawful may
be made lawful by necessity.—Matt. xii. 4.
Another time, David in his passion resolves the
destruction of Nabal and all his family, which, without
doubt, was a great sin; and the principle which he
went upon, to wit, revenge for his churlish and saucy
answer to him, was still a greater sin; but the tempta-
tion, backed by the strength of his passion, had the
better of him at that time; and this upright, honest
man had murdered Nabal and all his house if God had
not prevented him.
Many instances of like nature the Scripture has left
upon record, giving testimony to the character of good
men, from the general practice and bent of their hearts,
without leaving any reproach upon them for particular
failings, though those sins have been extraordinary
provoking, and in their circumstances scandalous
enough.

If any man would be so weak as from hence to draw
encouragement to allow himself in easy trespasses upon
his honesty, on the pretence of necessities, let him go
on with me to the further end of this observation, and
find room for it if he can.
If ever the honest man I speak of, by whatsoever
exigence or weakness, thus slips from the principle of
his integrity, he never fails to express his own dislike
of it; he acknowledges upon all occasions, both to God
and to man, his having been overcome, and been
prevailed upon to do what he does not approve of;
he is too much ashamed of his own infirmity to pretend
to vindicate the action, and he certainly is restored to
the first regulation of his principles as soon as the
temptation is over. No man is fonder to accuse him
than he is to accuse himself, and he has always upon him
the sincere marks of a penitent.
Tis plain from hence that the principle of the man's
integrity is not destroyed, however he may have fallen,
though seven times a day; and I must, while I live,
reckon him for an honest man.
Nor am I going about to suppose that the extremities
and exigencies which have pressed men of the best
principles to do what at another time they would not
do, make those actions become less sinful, either in
their own nature or circumstances. The guilt of a
crime with respect to its being a crime, viz., an offence
against God, is not removed by the circumstances of
necessity. It is without doubt a sin for me to steal
another man's food, though it was to supply starving
nature; for how do I know whether he whose food
I steal may not be in as much danger of starving for
want of it as I? And if not, 'tis taking to my own
use what I have no right to, and taking it by force or
fraud; and the question is not as to the right or wrong,
whether I have a necessity to eat this man's bread or '
no, but whether it be his or my own? If it be his,
and not my own, I cannot do it without a manifest
contempt of God's law, and breaking the eighth article
of it, "Thou shalt not steal." Thus, as to God, the
crime is evident, let the necessity be what it will.
But when we are considering human nature sub-
jected, by the consequences of Adam's transgression,
to frailty and infirmity, and regarding things from man
to man, the exigencies and extremities of straitened
circumstances seem to me to be most prevailing
arguments why the denomination of a man's general
character ought not by his fellow-mortals (subject to
the same infirmities) to be gathered from his mistakes,
his errors, or failings; no, not from his being guilty of
any extraordinary sin, but from the manner and method
of his behaviour. Does he go on to commit frauds,
and make a practice of his sin? Is it a distress i Is
it a storm of affliction and poverty has driven him upon
the lee-shore of temptation? Or is the sin the port he
steered for? A shipmay by stress of weather be driven
upon sands and dangerous places, and the skill of the
pilot not be blamable; but he that runs against the
wind, and without any necessity, upon a shelf which
he sees before him, must do it on purpose to destroy
the vessel, and ruin the voyage.
In short, if no man can be called honest but he who
is never overcome to fall into any breach of this recti-
tude of life, none but he who is sufficiently fortified
against all possibility of being tempted by prospects,
or driven by distress, to make any trespass upon his
integrity — woe be unto me that write, and to most
that read! where shall we find the honest man?
The Scripture is particularly expressive of this in
the words, "The righteous man falleth seven times a
day, and riseth again." Why, this is very strange; if
a man come to commit seven crimes in a day, that is, 
many, for the meaning is indefinite, can this be an
honest man? What says the world of him? Hang
him; he is a knave, a rascal, a dishonest fellow.
This is the judgment of men; but in the judgment of
Scripture this may be a righteous man.
The main design of this head, and the proper appli-
cation of it, is to tell us we ought not to be too hasty
to brand our brother for his sins, his infirmities, or
misfortunes, since he that is dishonest in your eyes, by
a casual or other crime which he commits, may rise
from that disaster by a sincere repentance, and be to-
morrow an honester man than thyself in the eyes of
his Maker.
But here I am assaulted with another censorious
honest man. Here you talk of falling to-day, and
rising again to-morrow; sinning and repenting; why,
here is a fellow has cheated me of 56*500, and he
comes canting to me of his repentance, tells me he
hopes God has forgiven him, and it would be hard for
me to call to remembrance what God has wiped out;
he is heartily sorry for the fault, and the like, and
begs my pardon, that is, begs my estate indeed. For
what is all this to my money? Let him pay me, and I
will forgive him too. God may forgive him the sin,
but that's nothing to my debt.
Why, truly, in answer to this in part, you are in
the right if the man be able to make you any satisfac-
tion, and does not do it; for I question not, but every
trespass of this nature requires restitution as well as
repentance; restitution as far as the possible power of
the party extends; and if the last be not found, the
first is not likely to be sincere.
But if the man either is not able to make you any
restitution at all, or does make you restitution to the
utmost of his capacity, and then comes and says as
before, then the poor man is in the right, and you in r
the wrong; for I make no question likewise to affirm,
and could prove it by unanswerable arguments, he may
be an honest man who cannot pay his debts, but he
cannot be an honest man who can, and does not.
Innumerable accidents reduce men from plentiful
fortunes to mean and low circumstances; some pro-
cured by their own vices and intemperance; some by
infirmities, ignorance, and mere want of judgment to
manage their affairs; some by the frauds and cheats of
other men; some by mere casualty and unavoidable
accidents, wherein the sovereignty of Providence shows
us, that the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the
strong, or riches to men of understanding. First, some by vices and intemperance are reduced
to poverty and distress. Our honest man cannot fall
in the misfortunes of this class, because there the very
poverty is a sin, being produced from a sinful cause.
As it is far from being allowed as an excuse to a mur-
derer to say he was in drink, because it is excusing a
crime with a crime, so for a man to ruin his fortunes,
as the prodigal in the Gospel, with riotous living, all the
effects are wicked and dishonest, as they partake of the
dishonesty of the cause from whence they proceed; for
he cannot be an honest man who wants wherewith to
pay his debts after having spent what should have dis-
charged them in luxury and debauches.
Secondly, some by ignorance and want of judgment
to manage their affairs are brought to poverty and dis-
tress. These may be honest men, notwithstanding
their weakness, for I won't undertake that none of our
honest men shall be fools. Tis true the good man is
the wise man as to the main part of wisdom, which is
included in his piety; but many a religious man, who
would not do any wrong wilfully to his neighbour, is
obliged at last to injure both his own family and other
people's for want of discretion to guide him in his 
affairs, and to judge for himself; and therefore I dare
not tax all our fools with being knaves, nor will I say
but such a man may be honest. Some will say that
such a man should not venture into business which he
is not able to manage, and therefore 'twas the vice of
his understanding, and, like the case in the first article,
is excusing a fault with a fault.
I cannot allow this, for if I am asked why a fool
ventures into trade, I answer, because he is a fool, not
because he is a knave.
If fools could their own ignorance discern,
They'd be no longer fools, because they'd learn.
If you would convince a man that he wants discre-
tion, you must give him discretion to be convinced;
till then he cannot know he has it not, because he has
it not. No man is answerable either to God or man
for that which he never was master of. The most
proper expression that ever I met with in this nature,
was of a certain idiot or natural which a gentleman of
my acquaintance kept in his family, who being on his
deathbed, was observed to be very pensive and much
concerned about dying. The gentleman sent a minister
to him, who, as well as he could to his understanding,
discoursed with him about death and judgment to come.
The poor creature, who was hardly ever able to give a
rational answer to a question before, after hearing him
very attentively, broke out into tears with this expres-
sion—that he hoped God would not require anything of
him that He had not given him judgment to understand.
Whatever it may be as to the soul, I am positive, in the
case of human affairs, no man is answerable to man for
any more than his discretion. Events are not in our
power; a man may be nicely honest in life, though he
may be weak enough in judgment.
Thirdly, some are ruined, and are yet merely passive, being either defrauded and cheated by knaves, or plun-
dered and rifled by thieves, or by immediate casualties,
as fire, enemies, storms, floods, and the like; these are
things which neither touch the man's honesty nor his
discretion. Thus Job was, by God's permission and the
agency of the devil, reduced in a moment from a plenti-
ful estate to be as naked as he came out of his mother's
womb. I would fain ask those who say no man can be
an honest man if he does not pay his debts, who paid
Job's debts if he owed any, and where was his dis-
honesty if he did not pay them? I still readily grant that
he cannot be an honest man who does not pay his debts
if he can; but if otherwise, then the words ought to be
altered, and they should say, he cannot be an honest
man who borrows any money, or buys anything upon
his credit; and this cannot be true.
But since I have led myself into the argument, I
cannot but make a small digression concerning people
who fail in trade. I conceive the greatest error of such
is their terror about breaking, by which they are tempted
while their credit is good, though their bottom be
naught, to push farther in, expecting, or at least hoping,
by the profits of some happy voyage, or some lucky
hit, as they call it, to retrieve their circumstances, and
stand their ground.
I must confess I cannot vindicate the honesty of this;
for he who, knowing his circumstances to be once
naught, and his bottom worn out, ought not in justice
to enter into any man's debt, for then he trades on their
risk, not on his own, and yet trades for his own profits,
not theirs. This is not fair, because he deceives the
creditor, who ventures his estate on that bottom which
he supposes to be good, and the other knows it not.
Nay, though he really pays this creditor, he is not
honest; for, in conscience, his former creditors had
a right to all his effects in proportion to their debts; and if he really pays one all, and the rest but a share,
'tis a wrong to the whole.
I would therefore advise all tradesmen who find
their circumstances declining, as soon, at least, as they
first discern themselves to be incapable of paying their
debts, if not while yet they can pay every one all,
make a full stop, and call all people together; if there
is enough to pay them all, let them have it; if not let
them have their just shares of it. By this means you
will certainly have God's blessing, and the character
of an honest man left to begin again with; and credi-
tors are often prevailed with, in consideration of such
a generous honesty, to throw back something to put
such a man in a posture to live again, or by further
voluntary credit and friendship to uphold him. This
is much better also with respect to interest, as well as
honesty, than to run on to all extremities, till the
burden falls too heavy either for debtor or creditor to
bear. This would prevent many of the extremities,
which, I say, puts the honesty of a man to so extra-
ordinary a trial.
An honest principle would certainly dictate to the
man, if it were consulted with, that when he knows he
is not able to pay, it is not lawful for him to borrow.
Taking credit is a promise of payment: a promise of
payment is tacitly understood, and he cannot be honest
who promises what he knows he cannot perform, as I
shall note more at large on another head. But if the
man be paid, yet it was not an honest act; 'twas de-
ceiving the man, and making him run a greater risk
than he knew of, and such a risk as he would not have
run had he known your circumstances and bottom as
you do; so that here is deceit upon deceit.
This I know is a disputed point, and a thing which
a great many practise who pass for very honest men in
the world, but I like it not the better for that; I am very positive, that he who takes my goods on the foot
of his credit, when, if he should die the next day, he
knows his estate will not pay me five shillings in the
pound, though he should not die, but does pay me at
the time appointed, is as much guilty of a fraud as if
he actually robbed my house. Credit is a received
opinion of a man's honesty and ability, his willingness
to pay, and his having wherewith to pay; and he who
wants either of these, his credit is lame. Men won't
sell their goods to a litigious, quarrelsome man, though
he be never so rich, nor to a needy man, though he be
never so honest. Now if all the world believe that I
am honest and able, and I know that I am not the
last, I cannot be the first if I take their goods upon
credit; 'tis vain to pretend men trade upon the general
risk of men's appearance, and the credit of common
fame, and all men have an equal hazard. I say no;
men may venture their estates in the hands of a flourish-
ing bankrupt, and he by virtue of his yet unshaken
credit is trusted; but he cannot be honest that takes
this credit, because he knows his circumstances are
quite otherwise than they are supposed to be, that the
man is deceived, and he is privy to the deceit. This digression is not so remote from the purpose
as I expected when I began it: the honesty that I am
speaking of chiefly respects matters of commerce, of
which credit and payment of debt are the most con-
siderable branches.
There is another article in trade, which many very
honest men have made familiar to themselves, which
yet, I think, is in no case to be defended, and that is
relating to counterfeit money. Custom, before the old
money was suppressed in England, had prevailed so
far upon honesty, that I have seen some men put all
their brass money among their running cash, to be told
over in every sum they paid, in order to have somebody 
or other take it; I have heard many people own they
made no scruple of it, but I could never find them
give one good reason to justify the honesty of it.
First, they say it comes for money, and it ought to
go so: to which I answer, that is just as good a
reason as this: A has cheated me, and therefore I
may cheat B. If I have received a sum of money for
good, and knowing not that any of it is otherwise
offer it in payment to another, this is just and honest;
but if, on this other man's telling it over, he returns
me a piece of brass or counterfeit money which I
change again, and afterwards, knowing this to be
such, offer the same piece to another, I know no
worse fraud in its degree in the world, and I doubt
not to prove it so beyond contradiction.
If the first person did not take this piece of money,
it was because, being both watchful and skilful, he
could discover it; and if I offer it to another, 'tis
with an expectation that he, being either less watchful
or less skilful, shall overlook it, and so I shall make
an advantage of my neighbour's ignorance, or want of
care.
I'll put some parallel cases to this, to illustrate it.
Suppose a blind man comes into a shop to buy goods
of me, and giving me a guinea to change, I shall give
him the remainder in bad money, would not everybody
say 'twas a barbarous thing? Why, the other is all
one, for if the person be ignorant of money, he is blind
as to the point in hand; and nothing can be more
unfair than to take the advantage.
Suppose, again, a young boy or a servant newly
entered in trade is sent to buy goods, and by his
master's order he asks for such a commodity; and
you, presuming upon the rawness of the messenger,
deliver a sort of a meaner quality, and take the full
price of him; would you grudge to be used scurvily /"
III. D
for such a trick? Why, no less or better is offering
brass for silver, presuming only the want of care or
skill in the receiver shall pass it unobserved.
"Ay, but," says a learned tradesman, who would
be thought honester than ordinary, "I always change
it again, if it be brought back." Yes, sir, so does a
pickpocket give you your handkerchief again when
you have fastened on him, and threatened him with
the mob. The matter, in short, is this: if the man
whom you have cheated can cheat nobody else, then
no thanks to you; when he comes to you, and charges
the fraud upon you, you'll make satisfaction, because,
if you won't, the law will compel you to it.
But if the fraud may be carried on, as you are mani-
festly willing, consenting, and instrumental in it that
it should, behold the consequence: your first sin
against honesty is multiplied in all the hands through
whom this piece of bad money knowingly so passes,
till at last it happens to go single to a poor man that
can't put it off, and the wrong and injury may issue
where it was wanted to buy bread for a starving
family.
All the excuses I could ever meet with could never
satisfy me that it can consist with honesty to put brass
or copper away for gold or silver, any more than it
would to give a blind messenger sand instead of sugar,
or brown bread instead of white.
Of Honesty In Promises.
"A man is known by his word, and an ox by his
horns," says an old English proverb. If I understand
the true meaning of it, 'tis that the honesty of a man
is known by his punctually observing his word, as
naturally and plainly as any creature is known by the
most obvious distinction. 'Tis the peculiar quality of 
an honest man, the distinguishing mark to know him
by. His word or promise is as sacred to him in all
his affairs in the world as the strongest obligation which
can be laid on him; nor is it a thing formed by him
from settled resolutions, or measures of policy taken
up of course to raise or fix his reputation, but it is the
native produce of his honest principle; 'tis the con-
sequence, and his honesty is the cause; he ceases to be
honest when he ceases to preserve this solemn regard
to his word.
If he gives his word, any man may depend upon it
for the safety of his life or estate; he scorns to prevari-
cate or shift himself off from the punctual observance
of it, though it be to his loss.
I can't abate an honest man an inch in the punctual
observance of a promise made upon parole if it be in the
man's possible power to perform it, because there seems
to be something too base to consist with honesty in the
very nature of a man that can go back from his word.
The reverence our ancestors paid to their promises,
or word passed, I am of the opinion, gave that remark-
able brand of infamy and scandal upon the affront of
giving the lie. A gentleman, which is, in short, the
modern term for an honest man, or a man of honour,
cannot receive a greater reproach than to be told he
lies; that is, that he forfeits his word, breaks his
veracity; for the minute he does that he ungentlemans
himself, disgraces the blood of his family, degenerates
from his ancestors, and commences rake, scoundrel,
and anything.
Some people, who have run their points of honour to
the extremes, are of the opinion that this affront of the
lie ought not to be given to anything they call a gentle-
man, or that calls himself so, till he has so far exposed
himself to all other degrees of infamy as to bear kicking
or caning, and the like; that after this, when he breaks .
his word, he may be told he lies, or anything else; but
till then the very thing itself is so intolerable an abuse,
that the person who ventures to trespass so foully on
the rules of good manners deserves not the honour of
fair play for his life; but as some beasts of prey are
refused the fair law of the field, and are knocked down
in every hedge, so these, like bullies and mere rakes,
may be pistolled in the dark and stabbed at the corner
of an alley; that is to say, any measure may be used
with them to dismiss them from the society of mankind,
as fellows not sufferable in the commonwealth of good
manners.
I do not argue for these extremes; but I instance in
this to testify the veneration all good men have for the
word or promise of an honest man, and the esteem
which the integrity of the mind, expressed by a zealous
regard to the words of the mouth, has obtained in the
world. The French, when they express themselves
in vindication of their honour, always bring it about
by this, Je suis homme de parole, I am an honest
man, or a man of my word; that is, I am a man
that may be trusted upon my parole, for I never break
my word.
Such was the value put upon the promises of men in
former time, that a promise of payment of money was
recoverable in our courts by law, till the inconveniences
proved so many that an Act was made on purpose to
restrain it to a sum under ten pounds. But to this day
if a man promises marriage to a woman, especially if
she has granted him any favours upon that condition,
the laws of the land, which therein have regard to the
laws of honour, will oblige him to make it good, and
allow it to be a sufficient plea to forbid his marrying
with anybody else. There are innumerable instances of the veneration all
nations pay to the expressive article of human veracity. In the war you meet with frequent instances of prisoners
dismissed by a generous enemy upon their parole, either
to pay their ransom, or to procure such or such condi-
tions, or come back and surrender themselves prisoners;
and he that should forfeit this parole would be posted
in the enemy's army, and hissed out of his own.
I know nothing a wise man would not choose to do
rather than, by breaking his word, give the world such
an undeniable testimony of his being a knave. This is
that good name which Solomon says is better than life,
and is a precious ointment, and which when a man has
once lost he has nothing left worth keeping. A man
may even hang himself out of the way, for no man that
looks like a man will keep his company.
When a man has once come to breaking his word,
no man that has any value for his reputation cares to be
seen in his company; but all good men shun him, as if
he were infected with the plague.
There are men, indeed, who will be exceeding
punctual to their words and promises, who yet cannot
be called honest men, because they have other vices and
excursions that render them otherways wicked. These
give their testimony to the beauty of honesty by choosing
it as the best mask to put a gloss upon their actions, and
conceal the other deformities of their lives; and so
honesty, like religion, is made use of to disguise the
hypocrite, and raise a reputation upon the shadow, by
the advantage it takes of the real esteem the world has
of the substance. I say of this counterfeit honesty, as
is said of religion in like cases. If honesty was not the
most excellent attainment, 'twould not be made use of
as the most specious pretence; nor is there a more
exquisite way for a man to play the hypocrite, than to
pretend an extraordinary zeal to the performance of his
promises; because, when the opinion of any man's
honesty that way has spread in the thoughts of men, f
there is nothing so great but they will trust him with,
nor so hard but they will do it for him.
All men reverence an honest man: the knaves stand
in awe of him, fools adore him, and wise men love him;
and thus is virtue its own reward.
Honest men are in more danger from this one
hypocrite than from twenty open knaves; for these have
a mark placed upon them by their general character, as
a buoy upon a rock to warn strangers from venturing
upon it. But the hypocrites are like a pit covered
over, like shoals under water, and danger concealed
which cannot be seen. I must confess I have found
these the most dangerous, and have too deeply suffered
by throwing myself on their protestations of honesty.
The esteem I always entertained of the most beautiful
gift God has bestowed, or man could receive, has
made me the easier to be deceived with the resemblance
of it.
So much as I, or any one else, by the viciousness of
our own nature, or the prevailing force of accidents,
snares, and temptations, have deviated from this shining
principle, so far as we have been foolish as well as
wicked, so much we have to repent of towards our
Maker, and be ashamed of towards our neighbour.
For my part, I am never backward to own, let who
will be the reader of these sheets, that to the dishonour
of my Maker, and the just scandal of my own honesty,
I have not paid that due regard to the rectitude of this
principle which my own knowledge has owned to be its
due; let those who have been juster to themselves, and
to the Giver of it, rejoice in the happiness, rather than
triumph over the infirmity.
But let them be sure they have been juster on their
own parts; let them be positive that their own integrity
is untainted, and would abide all the trials and racks
that a ruined fortune, strong temptations, and deep 
distresses, could bring it into; let them not boast till
these dangers are past, and they put their armour off;
and if they can do it, then I will freely acknowledge
they have less need of repentance than I.
Not that I pretend, as I noted before, and shall
often repeat, that these circumstances render my fail-
ing, or any man's else, the less a sin, but they make
the reason why we that have fallen should rather be
pitied than reproached by those who think they stand,
because, when the same assaults are made upon the
chastity of their honour, it may be every jot as likely
to be prostituted as their neighbour's.
And such is the folly of scandal, as well as the
blindness of malice, that it seldom fixes reproach upon
the right foot. I have seen so much of it, with respect
to other people, as well as to myself, that it gives me
a very scoundrel opinion of all those people whom I
find forward to load their neighbours with reproach.
Nothing is more frequent in this case than to run away
with a piece of a man's character, in which they err,
and do him wrong, and leave that part of him un-
touched which is really black, and would bear it; this
makes me sometimes, when with the humblest and
most abasing thoughts of myself I look up, and be-
twixt God and my own soul, cry out, "What a
wretch am I!" at the same time smile at the hare-
brained enemy, whose tongue, tipped with malice, runs
ahead of his understanding, and missing the crimes
for which I deserve more than he can inflict, reproaches
me with those I never committed. Methinks I am
ready to call him back, like the huntsman, when the
dogs run upon the foil, and say, "Hold, hold, you are
wrong; take him here, and you have him."
I question not but 'tis the same with other people;
for when malice is in the heart, reproach generally goes
a mile before consideration, and where is the honesty of the man all this while? This is trampling upon my
pride, ted majori fastu, but with greater pride; 'tis
exposing my dishonesty, but with the highest knavery;
'tis a method no honest man will take, and when taken,
no honest man regards; wherefore, let none of these
sons of slander take satisfaction in the frequent ac-
knowledgments I am always ready to make of my own
failing, for that humility with which I always find
cause to look into my own heart, where I see others
worse, and more guilty of crimes than they can lay to
my charge, yet makes me look back upon their weak-
ness with the last contempt, who fix their impotent
charges where there is not room to take hold, and
run away with the air and shadow of crimes never
committed.
I have instanced this, not at all on my own account,
for 'tis not worth while, for if I am injured, what's
that to troubling the world with when I am forgotten?
But while I am examining the nicest article in the
world, honesty, I cannot but lay down these three
heads from the preceding observations :—
1. He who is forward to reproach the infirmities of
other men's honesty, is very near a breach of his own.
2. He that hastily reproaches another without suffi-
cient ground, cannot be an honest man.
3. Where there may be sufficient ground of reproach,
yet an honest man is always tender of his neighbour's
character from the sense of his own frailty.
But I return to honesty, as it affects a man's pledging
his word, which is the counterpart of his principle, and
this because, as I said, I should chiefly regard this
honesty as it concerns human affairs, conversation, and
negotiation.
And here I meet with a tradesman come just in
from dunning one of his neighbours. "Well, I have
been at a place for money," says he, "but I can get 
none. There's such an one, he passes for an honest
man, but I am sure he is a great rogue to me, for he
has promised me my money a long time, but puts me
off still from time to time; he makes no more of
breaking his word, than of drinking a glass of beer. I
am sure he has told me forty lies already. This is
one of your honest men; if all such honest men were
hanged, we should have a better trade." And thus he
runs on.
If all such honest men were hanged, they that were
left might have a better trade; but how many of them
would there be?
Now, though I shall in no way vindicate men's
hasty promises absolutely to perform what is doubtful
in the event, yet I cannot agree that every man who,
having promised a payment, does not perform it to his
time, is a knave or a liar. If it were so, the Lord
have mercy upon three parts of the city.
Wherefore, to state this matter clearly, it must be
taken a little to pieces, and the articles spoken to apart.
First. Without question, when a man makes a
promise of payment to another on a set day, knowing
in his own thoughts that it is not probable he should be
capable to comply with it, or really designing not to com-
ply with it, or not endeavouring to comply with it, 'tis
a deceit put upon the party, 'tis a premeditated formal lie,
the man that made it is a stranger to honesty; he is a
knave, and everything that is base and bad. But,
Secondly. Promises ought to be understood, both
by the person to whom and the person by whom they
are made, as liable to those contingencies that all human
affairs and persons are liable to, as death, accidents,
disappointments, and disorder. Thus, if a man who
ought to pay me to-day tells me, "Sir, I cannot
comply with you to-day; but if you call for it next
week, you shall have it;" if I may put this answei

into plainer English, and I suppose the man to be an
honest man, I cannot understand his meaning otherwise
than thus :—
"Sir, I acknowledge your money is due. I have
not cash enough by me to pay you to-day, but I have
several running bills, and several persons who have
promised me money, which I doubt not I shall receive
against such a time; and if you call then, I make no
question but I shall be able to do it; and if it is
possible for me to pay you, I will do it at that time
without fail."
I confess it were as well to express themselves thus
at large in all the appointments people make for pay-
ment, and would the persons who make them consider
it, they would do so; but custom has prevailed in our
general way of speaking, whereby all things that are
subject to the common known contingents of life, or
visible in the circumstances of the case, are understood
without beingexpressed. For example:—
I make an appointment of meeting a man positively
at such a town, such a certain day or hour. If I were
talking to a Turk or a pagan that knows nothing, or
believes nothing of supreme Providence, I would say—
If the Lord of heaven and earth, that governs all my
actions, please to preserve and permit me. But when
I am talking to a Christian, it should seem to be so
universally supposed that every appointment is subjected
and submits to the government of Providence, that the
repetition would be needless; and that when a man
promises positively to meet, 'tis with a general sub-
intelligitur, a reserve as natural as Nature itself, to the
Divine permission. All men know, that unless I am
alive I cannot come there, or if I am taken sick, both
which may easily happen, I shall disappoint him. And,
therefore, if he should urge me again to come without
fail, and I should reply, "I won't fail if I am alive 
and well," the man ought to take it for an affront, and
ask me if I take him for a fool, to think if I am taken
sick, I should come with my bed at my back, or if
death should intervene, he had occasion to speak with
my ghost.
In this sense, a tradesman who promises payment of
money at a set time; first, 'tis supposed he has it not
now in his hands, because he puts off the person
demanding to a further day, and promises to comply
with it then. This promise, therefore, can be under-
stood no otherwise than that he expects to receive
money by that time. Now, if this man, by the like
disappointments from other men, or any other involun-
tary casualty, is really and bondfide unable to comply
with the time of promised payment, I cannot see but
this may befall an honest man, and he neither designing
to fail when he promised, not being able to prevent
the accident that obliged him to do it, nor in any way
voluntary in the breach, is not, in my opinion, guilty
of a lie, or breach of his honour, though he did not
make those verbal reserves in the promises he had
given.
If every man who cannot comply with promised
payments should be thus branded with lying and dis-
honesty, then let him who is without the sin cast the
stone, for nobody else ought to do it.
'Tis true, there is a difference between an accident
and a practice; that is, in short, there is a difference
between him who meets with a great many occasions
thus to break his word, and he that meets with but few;
but if it bea crime, he that commits it once is no more
an honest man than he that commits it forty times; and
if it be not a crime, he that does it forty times is as
honest as he that has occasion to do it but once.
But let no man take encouragement from hence to
be prodigal of his word, and slack in his performance; .
r
for this nice path is so near the edge of the pit of knavery,
that the least slip lets you fall in.
These promises must have abundance of circumstances
to bring the honest man out of the scandal.
As, first. The disappointments which occasioned
this breach of his word must have been unforeseen and
unexpected, otherwise the expectation of performing
his promise was ill grounded, and then his honesty is
answerable for the very making the promise, as well as
the breaking it.
Second. No endeavours must be wanting to comply
with the promise, otherwise 'tis wrong to say, "I am
disappointed, and can't make good my word." The
man ought to say, "Sir, I have disappointed myself by
my negligence or wilfulness, and have obliged myself
to break my word;" or, in English, "Sir, I am a
knave; for though I made you a promise which I
might have performed, I took no care about it, not
valuing the forfeiture of my word."
If, then, the case is so nice, though, in the strictness
of speaking, such a disappointment may oblige an honest
man to break his word, yet every honest man, who
would preserve that character to himself, ought to be
the more wary, and industriously avoid making such
absolute unconditional promises, because we are to avoid
the circumstances of offence.
But as to the nature of the thing, 'tis plain to me
that a man may in such cases be obliged to break his
word unwillingly; and nothing can be a fraud or dis-
honest action in that case, which is not either voluntary
in itself, or the occasion voluntarily procured.
Of Relative Honesty.
As honesty is simple and plain, without gloss and
pretence, so it is universal. He that may uphold an untainted reputation in one particular, may be justly
branded with infamy in another. A man may be
punctual in his dealings, and a knave in his relations;
honest in his warehouse, and a knave at his fireside;
he may be a saint in his company, a devil in his family;
true to his word, and false to his friendship; but who-
soever he be, he is no honest man. An honest man
is all of a piece the whole contexture of his life; his
general conduct is genuine, and squared according to
the rules of honesty; he never runs into extremes and
excesses on one hand or other.
I confess I find this thing which they call relative
honesty very little thought of in the world, and that
which is still worse, 'tis very little understood. I'll
bring it down to but a few examples, some of which
frequently happen among us, and will therefore be the
more familiarly received.
There are relative obligations entailed on us in our
family circumstances, which are just debts, and must
be paid, and which, in a word, a man can no more be
honest if he does not make conscience of discharging,
than he can in the case of the most unquestionable debts
between man and man.
The debts from children to parents, and from wives
to their husbands, are in a manner relatively changed,
and the obligation transferred into the order of religious
duties. God, the guide and commander of all subordi-
nation, has, as it were, taken that part into His own
hand. 'Tis rather called a duty to Him than a relative
duty only. But if men take this for a discharge to
them of all relative obligations to wives and to children,
or that God had less required one than the other, they
must act upon very wrong principles.
Nature, indeed, dictates in general a man's providing
subsistence for his family, and he is declared to be so
far from a Christian that he is worse than an infidel that neglects it. But there are other parts of our
obligations which honesty calls upon us to perform.
A wife and children are creditors to the father of the
family, and he cannot be an honest man that does not
discharge his debt to them, any more than he could if
he did not repay money borrowed to a stranger; and
not to lead my reader on to intricate and disputed par-
ticulars, I instance principally in those that nobody can
dispute, as, first, education. By this I mean, not only
putting children to school, which some parents think is
all they have to do with or for their children, and in-
deed with some is all that they know how to do, or
are fit to do; I say, I do not mean this only, but
several other additional cares, as: (1.) Directing what
school, what parts of learning are proper for them,
what improvements they are to be taught; (2.) study-
ing the genius and capacities of their children in what
they teach them. Some children will voluntarily learn
one thing, and can never be forced to learn another,
and for want of which observing the genius of children
we have so many learned blockheads in the world, who
are mere scholars, pedants, and no more. (3.) But the
main part of this debt which relative honesty calls upon
us to pay to our children, is the debt of instruction, the
debt of government, the debt of example. He that
neglects to pay any of these to his family is a relative
knave, let him value himself upon his honesty in paying
his other debts as much as he will.
'Tis a strange notion men have of honesty and of their
being honest men, as if it related to nothing but trades-
men or men who borrow and lend, or that the title was
obtained by an ordinary observance of right and wrong
between man and man. 'Tis a great mistake; the
name of an honest man is neither so easily gained, nor
so soon lost as these men imagine. David was a very
honest man, notwithstanding his passion and revenge in the case of Nabal, his murder in the case of Uriah, or
his adultery in the case of Bathsheba. The intent and
main design of his life was upright; and whenever he
fell by the power of that temptation that overcame him,
he rose again by repentance.
Let no vain men flatter themselves with the pride of
their honesty in mere matters of debtor and creditor,
though that is also absolutely necessary and essential to
an honest man.
But trace this honest man home to his family. Is
he a tyrant or a churl to his wife? Is he a stranger to
the conduct and behaviour of his children? Is he an
Eli to their vices? Are they uninstructed, uncorrected,
unexhorted, ungoverned, or ill governed? That man
is a knave, a relative knave; he neither does his duty
to God, or pays the debt of a husband, or of a parent,
to his wife or his family.
Secondly, after the debt of education, there is the
debt of induction due from us to our children. The
debt from a parent is far from ending when the chil-
dren come from school, as the brutes who turn their
young off from them when they are just able to pick for
themselves. It is our business, doubtless, to introduce
them into the world, and to do it in such a manner as
suits the circumstances we are in, as to their supply,
and the inclinations and capacities of our children.
This is a debt the want of paying which makes many
children too justly reproach their parents with neglect-
ing them in their youth, and not giving them the neces-
sary introduction into the world, as might have qualified
them to struggle and shift for themselves.
Not to do this is to ruin our children negatively on
one hand, as doing it without judgment and without
regard to our family circumstances, and our children's
capacities, is a positive ruining them on the other. I
could very usefully run out this part into a long r"
discourse on the necessity there is of consulting the in-
clinations and capacities of our children in our placing
them out in the world. How many a martial spirit do
we find damned to trade, while we spoil many a good
porter, and convert the able limbs and bones of a block-
head into the figure of a long robe, or a gown and
cassock?
How many awkward clumsy fellows do we breed to
surgery or to music, whose fingers and joints Nature
originally designed, and plainly showed it us by their
size, were better suited for the blacksmith's sledge or the
carpenter's axe, the waterman's oar or the carman's whip?
Whence comes it to pass that we have so many
young men brought to the bar and to the pulpit with
stammering tongues, hesitations and impediments in
their speech, unmusical voices, and no common utter-
ance; while, on the other hand, Nature's cripples—
bow-legged, battle-hammed, and half-made creatures—are bred tumblers and dancing-masters?
I name these because they occur most in our com-
mon observation, and are all miserable examples, where
the children curse the knavery of their fathers in not
paying the debt they owed to them as parents, in put-
ting them to employments that had been suitable to
their capacities, and suitable to what Nature had cut
them out for.
I came into a public-house once in London, where
there was a black mulatto-looking man sitting, talking
very warmly among some gentlemen, who, I observed,
were listening very attentively to what he said, and I
sat myself down and did the like. 'Twas with great
pleasure I heard him discourse very handsomely on
several weighty subjects. I found he was a very good
scholar, had been very handsomely bred, and that
learning and study were his delight; and, more than
that, some of the best of science was at that time his employment. At length I took the freedom to ask him
if he was born in England?
He replied with a great deal of good humour in the
manner, but with an excess of resentment at his father,
and with tears in his eyes, "Yes, yes, sir, I am a true-born Englishman; to my father's shame be it spoken,
who, being an Englishman himself, could find it in his
heart to join himself to a negro woman, though he must
needs know the children he should beget would curse
the memory of such an action, and abhor his very name
for the sake of it. Yes, yes," says he, repeating it
again, "I am an Englishman, and born in lawful wed-
lock; happy had it been for me, though my father had
gone to the devil for whoredom, had he lain with a
cook-maid, or produced me from the meanest beggar-
woman in the street. My father might do the duty of
nature to his black wife; but, God knows, he did no
justice to his children. If it had not been for this
damned black face of mine," says he, then smiling, "I
had been bred to the law, or brought up in the study of
divinity; but my father gave me learning to no manner
of purpose, for he knew I should never be able to rise
by it to anything but a learned valet de chambre. What
he put me to school for I cannot imagine; he spoiled a
good tarpauling when he strove to make me a gentle-
man. When he had resolved to marry a slave and lie
with a slave, he should have begot slaves, and let us
have been bred as we were born; but he has twice
ruined me — first, with getting me a frightful face, and
then going to paint a gentleman upon me."
It was a most affecting discourse indeed, and as such
I record it; and I found it ended in tears from the
person, who was in himself the most deserving, modest,
and judicious man that I ever met with under a negro
countenance in my life.
After this story I persuaded myself I need say no III. E
more to this case; the education of our children,
their instruction, and the introducing them into the
world, is a part of honesty, a debt we owe to them;
and he cannot be an honest man that does not, to
the utmost of his ability and judgment, endeavour to
pay it.
All the other relative obligations, which family
circumstances call for the discharge of, allow the same
method of arguing for, and are debts in their pro-
portion, and must be paid upon the same principle of
integrity. I have neither room nor is there any occasion
to enlarge upon them.
Chapter Hi.
Of the Immorality of Conversation, and the Vulgar
Errors of Behaviour.
CONVERSATION is the brightest and most
beautiful part of life; 'tis an emblem of the
enjoyment of a future state, for suitable society
is a heavenly life; 'tis that part of life by which man-
kind are not only distinguished from the inanimate
world, but by which they are distinguished from one
another. Perhaps I may be more particularly sensible
of the benefit and of the pleasure of it, having been so
effectually mortified with the want of it. But as I
take it to be one of the peculiars of the rational life
that man is a conversable creature, so it is his most
complete blessing in life to be blessed with suitable
persons about him to converse with. Bringing it down
from generals to particulars, nothing can recommend a
man more, nothing renders him more agreeable, nothing
can be a better character to give of one man to another, 
next to that of his being an honest and religious man,
than to say of him that he is very good company.
How delightful is it to see a man's face always
covered with smiles, and his soul shining continually in
the goodness of his temper; to see an air of humour
and pleasantness sit ever upon his brow, and to find
him on all occasions the same, ever agreeable to others
and to himself—a steady calm of mind, a clear head,
and serene thoughts always acting the mastership upon
him. Such a man has something angelic in his very
countenance; the life of such a man is one entire scene
of composure; 'tis an anticipation of the future state,
which we well represent by an eternal peace.
To such a man to be angry, is only to be just to
himself, and to act as he ought to do; to be troubled
or sad is only to act his reason, for as to being in a
passion he knows nothing of it; passion is a storm in
the mind, and this never happens to him; for all ex-
cesses, either of grief or of resentment, are foreigners,
and have no habitation with him. He is the only man
that can observe that Scripture heavenly dictate, "be
angry and sin not;" and if ever he is very angry, 'tis
with himself, for giving way to be angry with any
one else.
This is the truly agreeable person, and the only one
that can be called so in the world; his company is a
charm, and is rather wondered at than imitated. 'Tis
almost a virtue to envy such a man; and one is apt
innocently to grieve at him, when we see what is so
desirable in him, and cannot either find it or make it in
ourselves.
But take this with you in the character of this happy
man, namely, that he is always a good man, a religious
man. 'Tis a gross error to imagine that a soul blackened
with vice, loaded with crime, degenerated into im-
morality and folly, can be that man— can have this calm, serene soul, those clear thoughts, those constant
smiles upon his brow, and the steady agreeableness
and pleasantry in his temper, that I am speaking of;
there must be intervals of darkness upon such a mind.
Storms in the conscience will always lodge clouds upon
the countenance, and where the weather is hazy within
it can never be sunshine without; the smiles of a dis-
turbed mind are all but feigned and forged; there may
be a good disposition, but it will be too often and too
evidently interrupted by the recoils of the mind, to
leave the temper untouched and the humour free and
unconcerned; when the drum beats an alarm within,
it is impossible but the disturbance will be discovered
without.
Mark the man of crime; sit close to him in com-
pany; at the end of the most exuberant excursion of
his mirth, you will never fail to hear his reflecting
faculty whisper a sigh to him; he will shake it off, you
will see him check it and go on. Perhaps he sings it
off, but at the end of every song, nay, perhaps of every
stanza, it returns; a kind of involuntary sadness breaks
upon all his joy; he perceives it, rouses, despises it,
and goes on; but in the middle of a long laugh in drops
a sigh; it will be, it can be no otherwise; and I never
conversed closely with a man of levity in my life but I
could perceive it most plainly; 'tis a kind of respiration
natural to a stifled conviction — a hesitation that is the
consequence of a captivated virtue, a little insurrection
in the soul against the tyranny of profligate principles.
But in the good man the calm is complete — it is all
nature, no counterfeit; he is always in humour, because
he is always composed:
He's calm without, because he's clear within.
A stated composure of mind can really proceed from
nothing but a fund of virtue; and this is the reason 
why it is my opinion that the common saying, that
content of mind is happiness, is a vulgar mistake, unless
it be granted that this content is first founded on such a
basis as the mind ought to be contented with, for other-
wise a lunatic in Bedlam is a completely happy man;
he sings in his hutch, and dances in his chain, and is as
contented as any man living. The possession or power
which that vapour or delirium has upon his brain makes
him fancy himself a prince, a monarch, a statesman, or
just what he pleases to be; as a certain duchess is said
to have believed herself to be an empress, has her foot-
men drawn up, with javelins, and dressed in antic
habits, that she may see them through a window, and
believe them to be her guards; is served upon the knee,
called her majesty, imperial majesty, and the like; and
with this splendour her distempered mind is deluded,
forming ideas of things which are not, and at the same
time her eyes are shut to the eternal captivity of her cir-
cumstances; in which she is made a property to other
persons, her estate managed by guardianship, and she a
poor demented creature to the last degree, an object of
human compassion, and completely miserable.
The only contentment which entitles mankind to
any felicity is that which is founded upon virtue and
just principles, for contentment is nothing more or less
than what we call peace; and what peace where crime
possesses the mind, which is attended, as a natural
consequence, with torment and disquiet? What peace
where the harmony of the soul is broken by constant
regret and self-reproaches? What peace in a mind
under constant apprehensions and terrors of something
yet attending to render them miserable; and all this is
inseparable from a life of crime:
For where there's guilt, there always will be fear.
Peace of mind makes a halcyon upon the countenance, r
I
i
it gilds the face with a cheerful aspect, such as nothing
else can procure; and which indeed, as above, it is
impossible effectually to counterfeit.
Bow, mighty reason, to thy Maker's name,
For God and Peace are just the same;
Heaven is the emanation of His face,
And want of peace makes hell in ev'ry place. Tell us, ye men of notion, tell us why
You seek for bliss and wild prosperity
In storms and tempests, feuds and war —
Is happiness to be expected there?
Tell us what sort of happiness
Can men in want of peace possess?
Blest charm of Peace, how sweet are all those hours
We spend in thy society 1
Afflictions lose their acid powers,
And turn to joys when join'd to thee.
The darkest article of life with peace Is but the gate of happiness;Death in his blackest shapes can never fright, Thou can'st see day beyond his night;The smile of Peace can calm the frown of Fate, And, spite of death, can life anticipate, Nay, hell itself, could it admit of peace, Would change its nature, and its name would cease;The bright transforming blessing would destroy The life of death, and damn the place to joy;The metamorphosis would be so strange,
'Twould fright the devils, and make them bless the change;Or else the brightness would be so intense
They'd shun the light, and fly from thence.
Let heav'n, that unknown happiness,
Be what it will, 'tis best described by peace.
No storms without, or storms within;
No fear, no danger there, because no sin:
'Tis bright essential happiness,
Because He dwells within whose name is Peace.
Who would not sacrifice for thee
All that men call felicity?
Since happiness is but an empty name,
A vapour without heat or flame,
But what from thy original derives—
And dies with thee, by whom it lives.
But I return to the subject of conversation, from
which this digression is made only to show that the
fund of agreeable conversation is, and can only be,
founded in virtue; this alone is the thing that keeps a
man always in humour, and always agreeable. They mistake much who think religion or a strict
morality discomposes the temper, sours the mind, and
unfits a man for conversation. Tis irrational to think
a man can't be bright unless he is wicked; it may as
well be said a man cannot be merry till he is mad, not
agreeable till he is offensive, not in humour till he is
out of himself. 'Tis clear to me no man can be truly
merry but he that is truly virtuous; wit is as consistent
with religion as religion is with good manners; nor is
there anything in the limitations of virtue and religion,
I mean the just restraints which religion and virtue lay
upon us in conversation, that should abate the pleasure
of it; on the contrary, they increase it. For example:
restraints from vicious and indecent discourses; there's
as little manners in those things as there is mirth in
them, nor indeed does religion or virtue rob conversa-
tion of one grain of true mirth. On the contrary, the
religious man is the only man fully qualified for mirth
and good humour, with this advantage, that when the
vicious and the virtuous man appears gay and merry, but
differ, as they must do, in the subject of their mirth,
you may always observe the virtuous man's mirth is
superior to the other, more suitable to him as a man,
as a gentleman, as a wise man, and as a good man; and,
generally speaking, the other will acknowledge it, at
least afterward, when his thoughts cool, and as his
reflections come in.
But what shall we do to correct the vices of conver-
sation? How shall we show men the picture of their
own behaviour? There is not a greater undertaking
in the world, or an attempt of more consequence to the good of mankind, than this; but 'tis as difficult also as
it is useful, and at best I shall make but a little progress
in it in this work: let others mend it.
Of Unfitting Ourselves for Conversation.
Before I enter upon the thing which I call the im-
morality of conversation, let me say a little about the
many weak and foolish ways by which men strive, as
it were, to unfit themselves for conversation. Human
infirmities furnish us with several things that help to
make us unconversable; we need not study to increase
the disadvantages we lie under on that score. Vice
and intemperance, not as a crime only, that I should
speak of by itself, but even as a distemper, unfit us for
conversation; they help to make us cynical, morose,
surly, and rude. Vicious people boast of their polite
carriage and their nice behaviour, how gay, how good-humoured, how agreeable! For a while it may be so;
but trace them as men of vice, follow them till they
come to years, and observe, while you live, you never
see the humour last, but they grow fiery, morose,
positive, and petulant. An ancient drunkard is a thing
indeed not often seen, because the vice has one good
faculty with it, viz., that it seldom hands them on to
old age; but an ancient and good-humoured drunkard
I think I never knew.
It seems strange that men should affect unfitting
themselves for society, and study to make themselves
unconversable, whereas their being truly sociable as
men is the thing which would most recommend them,
and that to the best of men, and best answers to the
highest felicity of life. Let no man value himself upon
being morose and cynical, sour and unconversable —'tis
the reverse of a good man; a truly religious man
follows the rule of the apostle —" Be affable, be courteous, be humble; in meekness esteeming every man
better than ourselves;" whereas conversation now is
the reverse of the Christian rule; 'tis interrupted with
conceitedness and affectation — a pride, esteeming our-
selves better than every man; and that which is worse
still, this happens generally when indeed the justice of
the case is against us, for where is the man who, thus
overruling himself, is not evidently inferior in merit to
all about him? Nay, and frequently those who put
most value upon themselves, have the least merit to
support it. Self-conceit is the bane of human society,
and, generally speaking, is the peculiar of those who
have the least to recommend them: 'tis the ruin of
conversation, and the destruction of all improvement;
for how should any man receive any advantage from the
conversation of others, who believes himself qualified
to teach them, and not to have occasion to learn any-
thing from them?
Nay, as the fool is generally the man that is con-
ceited most of his own wit, so that very conceit is the
ruin of him; it confirms him a fool all the days of his
life, for he that thinks himself a wise man is a fool,
and knows it not; nay, 'tis impossible he should con-
tinue to be a fool if he was but once convinced of his
folly:
If fools could their own ignorance discern,
They'd be no longer fools, because they'd learn.
It will be objected here, indeed, that folly and con-
ceit may be hurtful to conversation, may rob men of
the advantage of it, unfit one side for conversing, and
make it unprofitable, as well as unpleasant to the other;
but that this is nothing to the immorality of conversation;
that ignorance and conceit may be an infirmity, but is not
always a crime; that the mischief of men's being fools
is generally their own, but the mischief of their being knaves is to other people; and this is very true. But
certainly egregious folly merits one paragraph of rebuke;
perhaps it may touch the senses of some weak brethren
one time or other, and the labour may not be lost.
I never saw a more simple, or yet a more furious
irreconcilable quarrel, than once between two of the
most empty, conceited people that ever I knew in the
world; and it was upon one calling the other fool,
which, on both sides, was unhappily very true. They
fought upon the spot, but were parted by the company;
they challenged, and could not meet, their friends
getting notice of it; in short, it ruined them both;
they made new appointments, and at last deceived their
friends and fought again; they were both wounded,
and one died; the other fled the country, and never
returned. The first owned he was a fool, which was
indeed some diminution of his folly. I say he knew
himself to be a fool, but could not bear the other to
tell him so, who was more a fool than himself. The
other boldly asserted his own capacities to be infinitely
greater than they were, and despised the first to the
last degree, who indeed, if he had not more wit, had
more modesty than the other; but both, like fools,
fought about nothing, for such, indeed, the question about
their wit might very well have been called.
But it is true, after all, the want of a conversable
temper, if from a want or defect of sense, may be an
infirmity, not an immorality; that is to say, the cause
is not so in itself, but it may be so in its consequences
that way also, for the conversation of fools is vanity in
the abstract. I might here, indeed, find subject for a
large tract upon the infinite diversity of fools, and by
consequence the wondrous beauty of their conversation.
I have on this occasion reckoned up a list of about
seven and thirty several sorts of fools, besides Solomon's
fool, whom I take to be the wicked fool only; these I
R Vents
have diversified by their tempers and humours, and in
the infinite variety of their follies of several sorts, in
every one of which they rob themselves, and all that
keep them company, of the felicity of conversation,
there being nothing in them but emptiness, or a fulness
of what is ridiculous, and only qualified to be laughed
at or found fault with.
I have likewise described some of their conversation,
their vain repetitions, their catchwords, their laughings
and gestures, and adapted them to make the world
merry. I have thoughts of running it on into foreign
characters, and describe French, Spanish, Portuguese
fools, and fools of Russia, China, and the East Indies;
but as this is something remote from the design in hand,
which is more serious, and done on a much better view,
and likewise of an unmeasurable length, like the weighty
subject it is upon (for folly is a large field), so I refer
it to another opportunity.
The truth is, that part of conversation which I am
now to speak of, or which I mean by what I have said
upon this subject, is the weighty and serious part, and
is not the mere common talk, or a conversation which
fools are capable of; 'tis exercised in a solid and well-tempered frame, and when regulated, as it ought to be,
by virtue and good morals, is qualified to make man-
kind happy in the enjoyment of the best things and of
the best company; and therefore the evils that creep
into and corrupt this part of our conversation are of the
more fatal quality, and worth our exposing, that people
may see and shun them, and that conversation may be
restored among us to what it should be.
I. Of the Immorality of Conversation in General.
Some may object against the term, the immorality
of conversation, and think the word improper to the subject; but to save any critic the dearly beloved labour
of cavilling in favour of ill manners and unbecoming be-
haviour, I shall explain myself before I go any farther.
I call conversation immoral where the discourse is
indecent, where 'tis irreligious or profane, where 'tis
immodest or scandalous, or where 'tis slanderous and
abusive. In these and such cases, loqui est agere; thus
talking lewdly, or talking profanely, is an immodest
action. Such is the power of words, that mankind is
able to act as much evil by their tongues as by their
hands; the ideas that are formed in the mind from
what we hear are most piercing and permanent, and the
force of example in this case is not more powerful than
the force of argument.
Some of the worst sins are not to be committed but
by the tongue, as the sin of blasphemy, speaking treason
against the majesty of God, cursings and imprecations
among men, lies, slanders, and a vast variety of petty
excursions, which are grown modish by custom, and
seem too small to be reproved.
We are here in England, after many years' degene-
racy, arrived to a time wherein vice is in general dis-
countenanced by authority; God in mercy to the age
has inspired our government with a resolution to dis-
courage it; the king, now his wars are over, and his
foreign enemies allow him some rest, will, we hope,
declare war against this domestic enemy.
The late Queen Mary, of heavenly memory for
her piety and blessed example, appeared in her time
gallantly in the cause of virtue; magistrates were en-
couraged to punish vice, new laws made to restrain it,
and justice seemed to be at work to reclaim it. But
what can kings, or queens, or parliaments do? Laws
and proclamations are weak and useless things, unless
some secret influence can affect the practices of those
whom no laws can reach.

To make laws against words would be as fruitless as
to make a shelter against the lightning. There are so
many inlets to the breach that the informers would
be as numerous as the criminals, and the trespass as
frequent as the minutes we live in.
Conversation has received a general taint, and the
disease is become a charm. The way to cure it is
not by forcible restraints on particulars, but by some
general influence on the public practice. When a dis-
temper becomes pleasant to a patient he is the harder
to be cured; he has a sort of aversion to the remedy
because he has none to the disease. Our modern
people have such a passion for the mode, that if it be
but the fashion to be lewd, they will scandalise their
honour, debauch their bodies, and damn their souls to
be genteel. If the beaux talk blasphemy, the rest
will set up for atheists, and deny their Maker, to be
counted witty in the defence of it; when our trades-
men would be thought wise, and make themselves appear
nice and learned in their conversation, nothing will
satisfy them but to criticise upon things sacred, run up
to discuss the inscrutables of religion, search the arcana
even of heaven itself. The divinity of the Son of
God, the hypostatic union, the rational description of
the state everlasting, nay, the demonstrations of un-
demonstrable things, are the common subject of their
fancied affected capacities. Hence come heresies and delusions. Men affecting
to search into what is impossible they should clearly
discover, learn to doubt because they cannot describe,
and deny the existence because they cannot explain the
manner of what they inquire after; as if a thorough
impossibility of their acting by their sense upon objects
beyond its reach was an evidence against their being.
Thus, because the Trinity cannot appear to their
reasoning, they oppose their reasoning to its reality; f
they will divest the Son of God of His divinity, and of
the hypostatic union of the Godhead in the person of
Christ, because they cannot distinguish between the
actions done by Him in His mediatorial capacity, in
virtue of His office, and those actions which He did in
virtue of His omnipotence and Godhead.
This is not an immorality and error in conversation
only, or not so much so as I think it is a judgment
upon it, a blast from Heaven upon the arrogance of the
tongue. When proud men give themselves a loose to
talk blasphemously to be thought witty, their Maker
gives them up to suggest damnable errors till they begin
to believe them, and to broach their own wicked hints,
till they by custom learn to espouse and defend them,
as children tell feigned stories till they believe them to
be true. If our town fopperies were visible only in the
little excursions of dress and behaviour, it would be
satisfaction enough for a wise man either to pity or
laugh at them; but when wit is set on work, and
invention racked to find out methods how they may
be more than superlatively wicked, when all the
endowments of the mind and helps of art, with the
accomplishments of education, are ranged in battle
against Heaven, and joined in confederacy to make
mankind more wicked than ever the devil had the
impudence to desire of them, this calls out aloud
for the help of all the powers of government, and
all the strength of wit and virtue, to detect and
expose it.
Indeed I had some thoughts to leave upon record a
melancholy kind of genealogy of this horrid perfection
of vice, which so increases in our age, I mean as it
respects this nation, in which 'tis too ancient, indeed,
to trace it back to its original; yet since its visible
increase has been within the reach of our own memory,
and it is, as I may say, the adopted child of our age, 
we may judge of the extent of its influence, and may
take a short view of it in miniature. None, indeed,
can judge of the extent of its influence but such as have
conversed with all sorts of people, from the court to
the plough-tail, where you may too sadly see the effect
of it in the general debauching both the principles
and practice of all sorts and degrees of this nation;
but it will be an ungrateful task; it would lead me to
the characters of persons, and to write satires upon
the times, as well those past as those present, which,
indeed, is not my business in this work, and there-
fore I throw by some keen observations which I had
made upon this subject, my business here, or at least
my design, being rather to instruct the age than to
reproach it; and as for the dead, they are gone to
their place.
St. Augustine observes, De civitate Dei, that the
ancients justified their liberty in all excesses of vice
which they practised in those times from the patterns
of their gods; that the stories of the rapes and incest
of Jupiter, the lewdness of Venus and Mars, and the
like, made those crimes appear less heinous, since people
had them frequently in the histories of the deities they
worshipped, and that they must of necessity be lawful,
seeing they were practised by those famous persons
whom they had placed above the skies, and thought fit
to adore.
If modern times have received unhappy impressions
from vicious courts, and princes have not taken the
needful caution not to guide to evil by their example,
instead of turning this into satire upon those that are
past, I choose to give it another turn, which our kings,
and people too, in time to come may make good use of,
and I hope will not be offended at supposing that they
will do so. 1. To kings or sovereigns in future reigns; for I am not in this intending the present reign: It may
without offence be said, that they have a glorious
advantage put into their hands to honour their
Maker, and advantage their people, to the
immortal glory of their own memory, by prompt-
ing virtue and discouraging vice by their happy
examples; by removing the vicious habits of
conversation from the court-modes, and making
vice unfashionable as it is unseemly. Why may
not the royal example go as far to reform a
nation as it has formerly done to debauch and
ruin it? But as this respects the heads* of the
people, I desire to speak it with the deference
of a subject, and close this discourse with only
saying, that I pray and wish it may be so. 2. To the people, with more freedom, I apply it thus: Let past examples be what they will, the
present reign encourages no crime; why then
should our modern conversation receive this
taint? Why should we be volunteers in the
devil's service while the power we are under
gives us neither precept or example? If we
are guilty, 'tis by mere choice; the crime is all
our own, and we are patterns to ourselves.
II. Of Reforming the Errors of Conversation.
But I leave this part as less grateful, and perhaps not
more significant than what I have yet to say upon this
subject; 'tis not so absolutely material to inquire how
his conversation came first to be corrupted, as how it shall
be reformed or recovered. The question before us is,
by what method to retrieve this miserable defection,
* This was all written in King William's reign, and refers to
that time. [Defoe.]
and to bring back the nation to some tolerable degree
of good manners, that morality at least may regain
its authority, and virtue and sobriety be valued again
as it ought to be. This, I say, is a difficult thing to
direct.
- Facilis descensus Averno:
Sed revocare gradum,
Hoc opus, hie labor est.— Virg. Aineid, vi.
Englished thus:
It is easy into hell to fall,
But to get back from thence is all.
The method might be easier prescribed than practised,
though it cannot be perfectly prescribed neither. Some-
thing may, however, be said by way of observation;
perhaps other well-wishers may hereafter throw their
mites into this treasury, and some zealous reformers
may at last make the attempt upon these foundations.
1. A strict execution of the laws against vice. We
have already and are every day making very good laws
to reform the people; but the benefit of laws consists
in the executive power, which if not vigorously put
forth, laws become useless, and it were better they were
not made at all. I was once going to have added here a
treatise, intituled, "An Essay upon the Insignificancy
of Laws and Acts of Parliament in England;" but
upon second thoughts, resolving to mingle no satire
with my serious observations, I omitted this also. The
deficiency of our laws is chiefly in the want of laws to
reform the lawmakers, that the wheel of executive
justice might be kept going. Of what use else can
laws be?
2. An exemplary behaviour in our gentry, after
whose copy the poor people generally write; not but
that I acknowledge it will be harder to reform a nation
than it would be to debauch it, though virtue should

obtain upon custom, and become the fashion, because
inclination does not stand neuter; but it would be a
great step to this reformation if we could all join to
discourage immorality by example. That if a man will
be drunk or lewd, he shall, as a thief robs a house, do
it in the dark, and be ashamed of it. If these two
heads were brought to pass, I question not but refor-
mation would come to such an height, that if a poor
man happened to be drunk he should come and desire
the constable to set him in the stocks for fear of a
worse punishment; and if a rich man swore an oath in
his passion, he should send his footman to the next
justice of the peace with his fine and get a discharge
for fear of being informed against and exposed.
In order to the furthering this great work it would
be very necessary, if possible, to draw the picture of our
modern vices, to let mankind see by a true light what
they are doing, and how ugly a phiz the mistress they
court really appears with when inclination, which paints
her in different colours, is taken off.
It will be impossible to bring vice out of fashion if
we cannot bring men to an understanding of what it
really is; but could we prevail upon a man to examine his
vice, to dissect its parts, and view the anatomy of it; to
see how disagreeable it is to him as a man, as a gentleman,
or as a Christian; how despicable and contemptible in
its highest fruition; how destructive to his senses, estate,
and reputation; how dishonourable, and how beastly,
in its public appearances: such a man would certainly be
out of love with it; and be but mankind once out of
love with vice, the reformation is half brought to pass.
I shall not pretend to invade the province of the
learned, nor offer one argument from Scripture or
Providence; for I am supposed to be talking to men
that doubt or deny them both. Divinity is not my
talent, nor ever like to be my profession; the charge of 
priestcraft and schoolmen would not lie against me;
besides, it is not the way of talking that the world
relishes at this time; in a word, talking Scripture is
out of fashion. But I must crave leave to tell my
reader that if there were no God or Providence, devil
or future state, yet they ought not to be drunken and
lewd, passionate, revengeful, or immoral; 'tis so un-
natural, so unruly, so ungenteel, so foolish and foppish,
that no wise man, as a man, can justify it so much as
to his own reason or the memory of his ancestors. I
suppose myself talking to men that have nothing to do
with God, and desire He should have nothing to do
with them; and yet even to such a vicious conversation,
looked on without the gust of inclination, would appear
too brutish to be meddled with, if we will but choose
like men, not to say like Christians. Virtue and
morality is more agreeable to human nature, more manly
than vice and intemperance; 'tis more suitable to all
the ends of life, to the being of society, to the public
peace of families, as well as nations. Mankind would
rather be virtuous than vicious, if they were to choose
only for their own ease and convenience. Vice tends
to oppression, war, and confusion; virtue is peaceable
and honest; vice is a poison to society; no man is
safe if men have neither sobriety nor honesty, for the
innocent will be robbed by the thief, ravished by the
lewd, and murdered by the drunkard.
It might not be a needless digression if I should
examine here whether whoring and drunkenness be not
the two mother sins of the times, the spring and original
of all our fashionable vices. I distinguish this because
other sins, as murders, thefts, rapes, and the like, are
now come so much in vogue, we are content the laws
should be executed for them, but should think it very
hard a man should be hanged for whoring or trans-
ported for being drunk.
s*
I would not have any of our gentlemen think
that my laying the charge of our debauchery on
the examples of the gods, has taken off anything of
the blame from those who have industriously pro-
pagated the spreading evil among their tenants and
neighbours, by their own vicious example; and I
could turn the whole observation into a satire on the
manners of our gentlemen, and describe with what
easiness our magistrates let fall the reins of their
authority, and connive at the practice of all manner
of intemperance and excess among the people; with
what eagerness the poor countrymen are called in to
be made drunk upon every occasion; with what con-
tempt any person is looked upon either in town or
country, that either will not be drunk, or cannot bear
an excessive quantity of wine; how our common
mirth is filled with songs and poems, recommending
drunkenness and lewdness; and rampant vice rides
riot through the nation. But, as above, I avoid
satire; I shall endeavour to treat this foul subject in
as civil terms as the case will bear, and only examine
general conversation in particular heads, with some
vulgar errors of behaviour which are crept in, and
which seem authorised by custom.
III. Of Atheistical and Profane Discourse.
God Almighty Himself is the least beholding to this
age of any that ever was from the beginning of time;
for that being arrived to a degree of knowledge superior
to all that went before us, or at least fancying it to be
so, whereby the greater glory might accrue to Himself,
the Author of all wisdom, that every gift, the brightest
of all the heavenly blessings, is made use of to put the
greatest contempt upon His majesty that mankind is
capable of—to deny His essence; such an affront that the devils themselves never had the impudence to
suggest to the world till they found man arrived to a
degree of hardness fit for something never done before.
All the heathen nations in the world came short of
this; the most refined philosophers owned a first cause
of all things, and that something was superior, whose
influence governed, and whose being was sacred and to
be adored. The devil himself, who is allowed to be
full of enmity against the Supreme Being, has often
set up himself to be worshipped as a God, but never
prompted the most barbarous nations to deny the being
of a God; and 'tis thought that even the devil him-
self believed the notion was too absurd to be imposed
upon the world. But our age is even with him for
his folly, for since they cannot get him to join in the
denial of a God they will deny his devilship too, and
have neither one nor other.
'Tis worth observation, after the most convincing
arguments that nature and reason can produce for the
existence of a deity, what weak, foolish, ridiculous
shifts the most refined of our atheistical disputants fly
to in defence of their notion, with what senseless pains
they labour to reason themselves into an opinion
which their own constitution, nature, and way of
living give the lie to every moment; with how little
consistency they solve all the other phenomena of
nature and creation; that when in all other points
they are capable of arguing strenuously, and are not
to be satisfied but with strength of reason and sound
argument, here they admit sophisms, delusive supposi-
tions, and miserable shams and pretences to prevail
upon their own judgments. This is touched at in the
following lines upon the system of Prometheus, which
I could not omit upon this occasion, relating to the
heathens' ignorance in the great doctrine of first
causes:
The great Promethean artist, poets say,
First made the model of a man in clay,
Contrived the form of parts, and when he had done,
Stole vital heat from the prolific sun;
But not a poet tells us to this day
Who made Prometheus first, and who the clay,
Who gave the great prolific to the sun,
And where the first productive work begun.
Also Epicurus, his philosophy will satisfy some people,
who fancy the world was made by a strange fortuitous
conjunction of atoms, without any pre-existent influence,
or without any immediate power, which Mr. Creech
very well translates thus:
But some have dreamt of atoms strangely hurled
Into the decent order of the world,
And so by chance combined, from whence began
The earth, the heaven, the sea, and beast, and man.
To which I crave leave to subjoin one complement,
by way of confutation of this folly:
Forgetting first that something must bestow
Existence on those atoms that did so.
The arguments for the existence of a deity are so
many, so nicely handled, and so unanswerable, that 'tis
needless to attempt anything that way; no man in his
wits needs any further demonstration of it than what
he may find within himself, nor is it any part of the
work I am upon; I have only a few things to ask of our modern atheists.
1. Whether their more serious thoughts do not
reflect upon them in the very act, and give the lie
to their arguments. My Lord Rochester, who was
arrived to an extraordinary pitch in this infernal learn-
ing, acknowledged it on his deathbed; the sense nature
has upon her of the certainty of this great truth, will
give some convulsions at so horrid an act.
Nature pays homage with a trembling bow,
And conscious men but faintly disallow;
The secret trepidation racks the soul,
And while he says, no God, replies, "Thou fool."
2. I would ask the most confident atheist, what
assurance he has of the negative, and what a risk he
runs if he should be mistaken? This we are sure of,
if we want demonstration to prove the being of a God,
they are much more at a loss for a demonstration to
prove the negative. Now, no man can answer it to his
prudence, to take the risk they run, upon an uncertain
supposititious notion; for if there be such a thing as
a First Cause, which we call God, they have very little
reason to expect much from Him who have made it
their business to affront Him by denying His existence.
Nor have they acted in their denial like wise men, for
they have not used so much as the caution of good
manners; but as if they were as sure of His nonentity as
of the strongest demonstration, they have been witty
upon the thing, and made a jest of the supposition,
turned all matters of faith into ridicule, burlesqued upon
religion itself, and made ballads and songs on the Bible.
Thus Rochester has left us a long lewd song, beginning
thus:
Religion's a politic cheat,
Made up of many a fable;Ne'er trouble the wise or the great,
But only amuses the rabble.
Now, I am not in this discourse entering into any
of the arguments in these grand questions on one side
or other — that would be to make this work a collection
of polemics; nor am I casuist enough for such a work—
but I am observing or remarking upon the wickedness
of the treating these subjects with levity and ignorance
in the common road of conversation.
Methinks these gentlemen act with more courage
than discretion; for if it should happen at last that r
there should be a God, and that He has the power of
rewards and punishments in His hand, as He must have
or cease to be almighty, they are but in an ill case:
If it should so fall out, as who can tell,
But there may be a God, a heaven, a hell,
Mankind had best consider well for fear,
'Tshould be too late when their mistakes appear.
Nor do they, in my opinion, discover any great wit in
it; there is, if I might pass for a judge, something
flat, something that shocks the fancy, in all the satire
upon religion that ever I saw; as if the muse were not
so much an atheist as the poet, but baulks the hint, and
could not favour a blasphemous flight with so much
freedom and spirit that at other times it has shown;
which is a notice that there is a tacit sense of the Deity,
though they pretend to deny it, lodged in the under-
standing; that it is not stifled without some difficulty,
and struggles hard with the fancy, when the party strives
to be more than ordinarily insolent with his Maker.
In the next place, as 'tis one of the worst immoralities
of conversation when it is profane, so blasphemy is the
extreme of profaneness; you cannot come into company
with an atheist but you have it in his common discourse;
he is always putting some banter or foolish pun upon
religion, affronting the invisible Power, or ridiculing
his Maker; all his wit runs out into it, as all diseases
run into the plague in a time of infection, and you must
have patience to hear it or quarrel with him. Below these we have a sort of people who will
acknowledge a God, but he must be such a one as they
please to make him; a fine, well-bred, good-natured,
gentleman-like deity, that cannot have the heart to damn
any of his creatures to an eternal punishment, nor could
not be so weak as to let the Jews crucify his own son.
These men expose religion, and all the doctrines of
repentance, and faith in Christ, with all the means of i

a Christian salvation, as matter of banter and ridicule.
The Bible, they say, is a good history in most parts,
but the story of our Saviour they look upon as a mere
novel, and the miracles of the New Testament as a
legend of priestcraft.
Further, besides these, we have Arians and Socinians,
the disciples of an ancient heretic who went out of the
church always at the singing the Gloria Patri, that he
might be out of the noise, and would sit down at the
doxology of the prayers, to note his disowning the
godhead of Jesus Christ.
These are iniquities, as Job said, should be punished
by the judges (chap. xxii. ver. 20), and these are the
things which have given such a stroke to the ruin of
the nation's morals; for no method can be so direct to
prepare people for all sorts of wickedness as to persuade
them out of a belief of any Supreme Power to restrain
them. Make a man once cease to believe a God, and
he has nothing left to limit his appetite but mere
philosophy; if there is no supreme judicature, he must
be his own judge and his own law, and will be so;
the notion of hell, devil, and infernal spirits are empty
things, and have nothing of terror in them, if the belief
of a Power superior to them be obliterated.
But to bring this particular case nearer to the point of
conversation, the errors of which lie before me: though
we live in an age where these horrid degrees of impiety
are too much practised, yet we live in a place where
religion is professed, the name of God owned and
worshipped, religion and the doctrines of Christianity
established; and as it is so, it ought as much to be
preserved by the civil power from the horrid invasion of
atheists, deists, and heretics, as the public peace ought to
be defended against freebooters, thieves, and invaders.
Tis very improbable any reformation of manners
should be brought to pass, if the debauching the religious principles of the nation goes on with an un-
restrained liberty. How incongruous is it to the
decoration * of government, that a man shall be
punished for drunkenness and set in the stocks for
swearing, but shall have liberty to deny the God of
heaven and dispute against the very sum and substance
of the Christian doctrine, shall banter the Scripture
and make ballads of the Pentateuch, turn all the prin-
ciples of religion — the salvation of the soul, the death
of our Saviour, and the revelation of the Gospel — into
ridicule. And shall we pretend to reformation of
manners and suppressing immoralities, while such as
this is the general mixture of conversation? If a man
talk against the government, or speak scurrilously of the
king, he is had to the Old Bailey, and from thence to
the pillory or whipping-post, and it is fit it should be
so; but he may speak treason against the Majesty of
heaven, deny the godhead of His Redeemer, and make
a jest of the Holy Ghost — and thus affront the Power
we all adore — and yet pass with impunity. Perhaps
some in the company may have courage enough to
blame him, and vindicate their religion with a "Why
do you talk so?" but where is the man or the magistrate
that ever vindicated the honour of his Maker with a
resentment becoming the crime? If a man give the lie
to a gentleman in company he takes it as an affront, flies
into a passion, quarrels, fights, and perhaps murders
him; nay, some have done it for an absent friend
whom they have heard abused; but where is the
gentleman that ever thought himself so much concerned
in the quarrel of his Maker but that he could hear Him
affronted, His being denied, the lie given to His divine
authority, nay, to His divine being, andall His commands
ridiculed and exposed, without any motion of spirit to
punish the insolence of the party, and without drawing * Perhaps this is a misprint for "declaration."

his sword in the quarrel, or letting him know he does
not like it?
Methinks I need not make an apology for this, as
if I meant that quarrelling and fighting were a proper
practice in the case; the law does not admit it in any
case, nor is it reasonable it should; and God Almighty
is far from desiring us to run any risk in His service.
But I choose to bring the cases into a parallel, to signify
that I think it is a vulgar error in our behaviour not
to show our resentment when we hear the honour and
essence of God slighted and denied, His majesty abused,
and religion bantered and ridiculed in common dis-
courses. I think it would be very reasonable to tell a
gentleman he wants manners when he talks reproachfully
of his Maker, and to use him scurvily if he resented it.
It would very well become a man of quality to cane a
lewd fop, or kick him downstairs, when his insolence
took a loose at religion in his company, else men may
be bullied out of their Christianity and lampooned into
profaneness, for fear of being counted fools.
Besides, it is in this as in all other like cases; he
that will talk atheistically in my company, either believes
me to be an atheist like himself, or ventures to impose
upon me; and by imposing upon me, either accounts me
a fool that cannot tell when I am put upon, or a coward
that dare not resent it.
Upon which account, even in good manners, it ought
to be avoided; for it cannot be introduced into any part
of conversation where the company are not all alike,
without the greatest affront upon the rest that can be
offered them.
IV. Of Lewd and Immodest Discourse.
Talking bawdy, that sodomy of the tongue, has the
most of ill manners and the least of a gentleman in it of any part of common discourse. Sir George Mac-
kenzie has very handsomely exposed it in its proper
colours; but it may not be an intrenchment at all
upon his province to say something to it in these
observations.
This part is the peculiar practice of such persons as
are hardened to a degree beyond other men, proficients
in debauchery, whose lives are so continually devoted
to lewdness, that their mouths cannot contain it; who
can govern their tongues no better than their tails, and
are willing to be thought what really they are. In
these it is neither so strange nor so much a crime as in
others; these are persons not to be reclaimed. This
part of my observation is not designed for their use;
they are not to be talked out of their vice; they must
go on and run their length. Nothing but a gaol or an
hospital ever brings them to a reformation; they repent
sometimes in that emblem of hell, a fluxing house, and,
under the surgeon's hands, wish a little they had been
wiser; but they follow one sin with another, till their
carcass stinks as bad as their discourse, and the body
becomes too nasty for the soul to stay any longer in it.
From these no discourse is to be expected but what is
agreeable to the tenor of their lives; for then to talk
otherwise would be strained and eccentric, and become
them as little as it would be tedious to them; but for a
gentleman, a man of seeming modesty and a man of
behaviour, not arrived to that class in the devil's
school, for such a one to mix his discourse with lewd
and filthy expressions, has something in it of a figure
which intends more than is expressed.
Either we must believe such a one to be very lewd
in his practice, or else, that not being able yet to arrive
to such a degree of wickedness as he desires, he would
supply that defect with a cheat, and persuade you to
believe he is really worse than he is.
Which of these two characters I would choose to
wear I cannot tell, for he that desires to be worse than
he thinks he is, is certainly as bad as he desires to be;
and he that is so bad as to let fly the excrescences of
it at his mouth, is as wicked as the devil can in reason
desire of him.
But I descend from the wickedness to the indecency
of the matter; its being a sin against God is not so
much the present argument as its being unmannerly — a
sin against breeding and society, a breach of behaviour,
and a saucy, insolent affront to all the company.
I do not deny but that modesty, as it respects the
covering our bodies, was at first an effect of the fall of
our parents into crime, and is therefore said still to be
the consequences of criminal nature, and no virtue in
itself, because no part of the body had been unfit to be
exposed if vice had not made the distinction necessary.
But from this very argument lewd discourse appears
to be a sin against custom and decency; for why must
the tongue industriously expose things and actions at
which Nature blushes, and which custom, let the
original be what it will, has dedicated to privacy and
retirement? What if it be true that shame is the
consequence of sin, and that modesty is not an original
virtue; it cannot but be allowed that sin has thereby
brought us to a necessity of making modesty be a
virtue, and sin would have a double influence upon us
if, after it had made us ashamed, it should make us not
ashamed again.
'Tis, in my opinion, a mistake when we say sin was
the immediate cause of shame; 'twas sin indeed gave a
nudity to our natures and actions; the innocence, which
served as a glory and covering, being gone, then shame
came in as the effect of the conscious sinner; so the text
says, they knew that they were naked. Shame was the
effect of nakedness, as nakedness was the effect of sin.
From hence, then, I argue, and this is the reason of
my naming it, that to be ashamed of our nakedness is a
token of our wisdom and a monument of our just sense
of the first sin that made it so, and as much a duty
now as any other part of our repentance.
To give the tongue then a liberty in that which there
is so much reason to blush at, argues no sense of the
original degeneracy. Where is the man that partakes
not of Adam's fall, has no vicious contracted habit and
nature conveyed to him from his grand predecessor?
Let him come forth, let him go naked and live by
himself, and let his posterity partake of his innocence;
his tongue cannot offend, nothing can be indecent for
him to say, nothing uncomely for him to see. But if these gentlemen think it proper to cover their
nakedness with their clothes, methinks they should not
be always uncovering it again with their tongues; if
there are some needful things which Nature requires to
be done in secret, and which they by inclination choose
to act in private, what reason can they give for speak-
ing of them in public?
There is a strange incongruity in the behaviour of
these people, that they fill their mouths with the foul
repetition of actions and things which their own prac-
tising in private condemns them for, nay, which they
would be ashamed to do in public; such men ought to
act the common requirements of Nature in the most
publickest places of the streets, bring their wives or
whores to the exchange and to the market-places, and
lie with them in the street, or else hold their tongues,
and let their mouths have no more the stench of their
vices in public than their actions.
And why, of all the rest of the parts of life, must
the tongue take a peculiar licence to revel thus upon
Nature, as if she had a mind to reproach her with the
infirmities she labours under? The customs we are 
obliged to, though they are clogs upon Nature and a
badge of original defection, yet neither is there any-
thing so odious or so burdensome that these gentlemen
should triumph over the nurse that brought them up.
Take the lewdest and most vicious wretch that ever
gave his tongue a loose in this hateful practice, and turn
him about to his mother, you shall hardly prevail upon
him to talk his lewd language to her; there is some-
thing nauseous and surfeiting in that thought. This
talking bawdy is like a man going to debauch his own
mother; for it is raking into the arcana and exposing
the nakedness of Nature, the common mother of us all. If, as a famous man of wit pretended, lying with a
woman was the homeliest thing that man can do, 'tis
much more true that talking of it is the homeliest thing
that man can say.
Nor is there to me any jest in these things, any
appearance of mirth. There may be some pleasure in
wicked actions, as the world rates pleasure, but I must
profess 'tis dull, and for want of other more regular
tastes that there should be pleasure in the discourse.
'Tis a profaning of Nature, and bringing forth those
things she has hallowed to secrecy and retirement to
the scandalous indecency of public banter and jest.
But men, who have always something to say for
their folly, tell us 'tis custom only which has made
any of these things uncommon, and there's no sin in
speaking that which there was no sin in doing.
Let us grant them that custom only has done this;
but if custom has made these things uncommon, and
concealed, or, at least, banished them from the voice
of conversation, 'tis a sin then against custom to expose
them again. Lawful customs become allowed virtues,
and ought to be preserved. Custom is a good reason
in such concealments; if custom has locked them up,
let them remain so, at least, till you can give a better reason for calling them abroad again than custom has
given for restraining them. Custom has made these
things uncommon, because that sin which first made
Nature naked left her so captivated by some of her
parts more than others, that she could not but blush at
those where sin had taken up its peculiar residence.
Now, as I noted before, no man can with any tolerable
satisfaction expose the parts till he has first extracted
and separated the sin which, having possessed them,
covered them at first with shame. He that can do
this may go naked and talk anything.
And, for the same reason, no man can justify talking
lewdly but he that at the same time throws away his
clothes, for to cover himself with his hands and un-
cover himself with his tongue are contradictions in their
own nature, and one condemns the other. He that
scorns the decency of words should also scorn the de-
cency of clothes, let his body be as bald as his discourse,
and let him scorn the shame of one as well as the shame
of the other.
It is no sin, they say, to talk of what it is no sin to
do; and, I may add, it is no sin at all to show what
it is no sin to describe. Why is the eye to be less
offended than the ear, since both are but the common
organs of the understanding?
But the weather and inconveniences of the climate
are urged for clothing our bodies, and I urge decency
and good manners for the government of our tongues;
and let any one contend it with me that thinks he can
prove that the obligation of the first is greater than the
obligation of the last.
Much more might be said to this, but I make but
an essay, and am unwilling to run out into a long
discourse.
Of Talking Falsely.
By talking falsely, I do not design to enter upon a long
dissertation upon the sin of lying in general. I suppose
all men that read me will acknowledge lying to be one
of the most scandalous sins between man and man, a
crime of a deep dye, and of an extensive nature, leading
into innumerable sins, that is, as lying is practised to
deceive, to injure, betray, rob, destroy, and the like.
Lying in this sense, is the concealing of all other
crimes; it is the sheep's clothing hung upon the wolfs back, it is the Pharisee's prayer, the whore's blush, the
hypocrite's paint, the murderer's smile, the thiePs
cloak; 'tis Joab's embrace and Judas's kiss; in a
word, it is mankind's darling sin and the devil's dis-
tinguishing character.
But this is not the case I am upon, this is not the
talking falsely I am upon, but a strange liberty which
(particularly in conversation) people take to talk falsely,
without charging themselves with any offence in it either
against God or man. This is to be considered in two
or three parts, not but that it has many more.
1. The liberty of telling stories, a common vice in
discourse. The main end of this extraordinary part
of tittle-tattle is to divert the company and make them
laugh; but we ought to consider whether that very
empty satisfaction, either to ourselves or friends, is to
be purchased at so great an expense as that of conscience
and of a dishonour done to truth.
'Tis scarce fit to say how far some people go in
this folly, to call it no worse, even till sometimes they
bring the general credit of their conversation into
decay, and people that are used to them learn to lay
no stress upon anything they say.
For once, we will suppose a story to be in its
substance true, yet to what monstrous a bulk doth it r
III. G
grow by that frequent addition put to it in the relation,
till not only it comes to be improbable, but even im-
possible to be true; and the ignorant relater is so
tickled with having made a good story of it, whatever
it was when he found it, that he is blind to the absur-
dities and inconsistencies of fact in relation, and tells
it with a full face even to those that are able to con-
fute it by proving it to be impossible.
I once heard a man, who would have taken it very
ill to be thought a liar, tell a story, the facts of which
were impossible to be true, and yet assert it with so
much assurance, and declare so positively that he had
been an eye-witness of it himself, that there was
nothing to do but, in respect to the man, let him alone
and say nothing. A gentleman who sat by, and whose
good breeding restrained his passion, turned to him and
said, "Did you see this thing done, sir ?"—" Yes, I
did, sir," says the relater. —"Well, sir," replies the
gentleman, "since you affirm that you did see it, I am
bound in regard to you to believe it; but upon my
word, 'tis such a thing, that if I had seen it myself,
I would not have believed it." This broke the
silence, set all the company a-laughing, and exposed
the falsehood more than downright telling him it
was a lie, which might, besides, have made a broil
about it.
It is a strange thing that we cannot be content to tell
a story as it is, but we must take from it on one side
or add to it on another till the fact is lost among the
addenda, and till in time even the man himself, remem-
bering it only as he told it last, really forgets how it
was originally. This being so generally practised now,
nothing is more common than to have two men tell the
same story quite differing one from another, yet both of
them eye-witnesses to the fact related. These are that
sort of people who, having once told a story falsely, tell 
f people who, hav
it so often in the same or like manner, till they really
believe it to be true.
This supplying a story by invention is certainly a
most scandalous crime, and yet very little regarded in
that part. It is a sort of lying that makes a great hole
in the heart, at which by degrees a habit of lying enters
in. Such a man comes quickly up to a total disregard-
ing the truth of what he says, looking upon it as a trifle,
a thing of no import, whether any story he tells be true
or no, so it but commands the company, as they call it,
that is to say, procures a laugh or a kind of amazement,
things equally agreeable to these story-tellers, for the
business is to affect the company; either startle them with
something wonderful never heard of before, or made them laugh immoderately, as at something prodigiously
taking, witty, and diverting.
It is hard to place this practice in a station equal to
its folly; 'tis a meanness below the dignity of common-sense. They that lie to gain, to deceive, to delude, to
betray, as above, have some end in their wickedness;
and though they cannot give the design for an excuse
of their crime, yet it may be given as the reason and
foundation of it; but to lie for sport, for fun, as the boys
express it, is to play at shuttlecock with your soul, and
load your conscience for the mere sake of being a fool,
and the making a mere buffoonery of a story, the plea-
sure of what is below even madness itself.
And yet, how common is this folly? How is it the
character of some men's conversation that they are made
up of story! And how mean a figure is it they bear in
company! Such men always betray their emptiness by
this, and having only a certain number of tales in their
budget, like a pedlar with his pack, they can only at
every house show the same ware over again, tell the
same story over and over, till the jest is quite worn
out; and to convince us that much of it, if not all, is r
born of invention, they seldom tell it the same way
twice, but vary it even in the most material facts; so
that though it may be remembered that it was the same
story, it ought never to be remembered that it was told
by the same man.
With what temper should I speak of these people?
What words can express the meanness and baseness of
the mind that can do thus, that sin without design,
and not only have no end in the view, but even no
reflection in the act? The folly is grown up to a
habit, and they not only mean no ill, but indeed mean
nothing at all in it.
It is a strange length that some people run in this
madness of life; and it is so odd, so unaccountable,
that indeed 'tis difficult to describe the man, though
not difficult to describe the fact. What idea can be
formed in the mind of a man who does ill without
meaning ill; that wrongs himself, affronts truth, and
imposes upon his friends, and yet means no harm; or,
to use his own words, means nothing; that if he thinks
anything, it is to make the company pleasant? and
what is this but making the circle a stage, and himself
the Merry Andrew?
The best step such men can take is to lie on; and
this shows the singularity of the crime. It is a strange
expression, but I shall make it out. Their way is, I
say, to lie on, till their character is completely known,
and then they can lie no longer; for he whom nobody
believes can deceive nobody, and then the essence of
lying is removed; for the description of a lie is, that
it is spoken to deceive, or 'tis a design to deceive.
Now, he that nobody believes can never lie any more,
because nobody can be deceived by him. Such a man's
character is a bill upon his forehead, by which every-
body knows, "Here dwells a lying tongue." When
everybody knows what is to be had of him they know 
what to expect, and so nobody is deceived; if they
believe him afterwards 'tis their fault as much as his.
There are a great many sorts of those people who
make it their business to go about telling stories; it
would be endless to enumerate them. Some tell formal
stories forged in their own brain without any retrospect
either on persons or things, I mean, as to any particular
person or passage known or in being, and only with
the ordinary introduction of "There was a man," or
"There was a woman," and the like.
Others again, out of the same forge of invention,
hammer out the very person, man or woman, and begin,
"I knew the man," or, "I knew the woman," and
these ordinarily vouch their story with more assurance
than others, and vouch also that they knew the persons
who were concerned in it. The selling or writing a parable, or an illusive alle-
goric history, is quite a different case, and is always
distinguished from this other jesting with truth, that it
is designed and effectually turned for instructive and
upright ends, and has its moral justly applied. Such
are the historical parables in the Holy Scripture, such
"The Pilgrim's Progress," and such, in a word, the
adventures of your fugitive friend, "Robinson Crusoe."
Others make no scruple to relate real stories with
innumerable omissions and additions; I mean, stories
which have a real existence in fact, but which, by the
barbarous way of relating, become as romantic and
false as if they had no real original. These tales, like
the old "Galley of Venice," which had been so often
new vamped, doubled, and redoubled, that there was
not one piece of the first timber in her, have been told
wrong so often, and so many ways, till there would
not be one circumstance of the real story left in the
relating.
There are many more kinds of these, such, namely, as are personal and malicious, full of slander and abuse;
but these are not of the kinds I am speaking of; the
present business is among a kind of white devils, who
do no harm or injury to any but to themselves; they
are like the grasshopper, that spends his time to divert
the traveller, and does nothing but starve himself. The
conversation of these men is full of emptiness, their
words are levity itself, and, according to the text, they
not only tell untruths, but "the truth is not in them."
There is not a settled awe or reverence of truth upon
their minds; it is a thing of no value to them, it is not
regarded in their discourse, and they give themselves
a liberty to be perfectly unconcerned about the thing
they say, or the story they tell, whether it be true
or no.
This is a most abominable practice on another ac-
count, namely, that these men make a jest of their
crime. They are a sort of people that sin laughing,
that play upon their souls as a man plays upon a fiddle,
to make other people dance and wear itself out; they
may be said to make some sport indeed, but it is all at
themselves — they are the hearers' comedy and their
own tragedy, and, like a penitent jack-pudding, they
will at last say, "I have made others merry, but I
have been the fool."
I would be glad to shame men of common-sense out
of this horrid piece of buffoonery; and one thing I
would warn them of, namely, that their learning to lie
so currently in story will insensibly bring them to a
bold entrenching upon truth in the rest of their con-
versation. The Scripture command is, "Let every
man speak truth unto his neighbour." If we must tell
stories, tell them as stories, and nothing wilfully to
illustrate or set it forth in the relation. If you doubt
the truth of it say so, and then every one will be at
liberty to believe their share of it.

Besides, there is a spreading evil in telling a false
story as true, namely, that you put it into the mouths
of others, and it continues a brooding forgery to the
end of time. It is a chimney-corner romance, and has
in it this distinguishing article, that whereas parables
and the inventions of men, published historically, are
once for all related, and, the moral being drawn, the
history remains allusive only as it was intended (as in
several cases * may be instanced within our time f and
without), here the case alters; fraud goes unto the
world's end, for story never dies; every relater
vouches it for truth, though he knows nothing of the
matter.
These men know not what foundations they are
laying for handing on the sport of lying, for such they
make of it to posterity, not only leaving the example,
but dictating the very materials for the practice; like
family lies handed on from father to son, till what
begun in forgery ends in history, and we make our
lies be told for truth by all our children that come
after us.
If any man object here that the preceding volumes of
this work seem to be hereby condemned, and the history
which I have therein published of myself censured, I
demand in justice such objector stay his censure till he
sees the end of the scene, when all that mystery shall
discover itself, and I doubt not but the work shall
abundantly justify the design, and the design abun-
dantly justify the work.

An Essay on the Present State of Religion in the World.
IN that part of my work which may be called history,
I have frequently mentioned the unconquerable im-
pressions which dwelt upon my mind and filled up
all my desires, immovably pressing me to a wandering,
travelling life, and which pushed me continually on from
one adventure to another, as you have heard.
There is an inconsiderate temper which reigns in
our minds, that hurries us down the stream of our
affections by a kind of involuntary agency, and makes
us do a thousand things, in the doing of which we pro-
pose nothing to ourselves but an immediate subjection to
our will, that is to say, our passion, even without the
concurrence of our understandings, and of which we
can give very little account after 'tis done.
You may now suppose me to be arrived, after a long
course of infinite variety on the stage of the world, to
the scene of life we call old age, and that I am writing
these sheets in a season of my time when (if ever) a
man may be supposed capable of making just reflections
upon things past, a true judgment of things present, and
tolerable conclusions of things to come.
In the beginning of this life of composure (for now,
and not till now, I may say that I began to live, that
is to say, a sedate and composed life), I inquired of
myself very seriously one day what was the proper
business of old age. The answer was very natural, and
indeed returned quick upon me, namely, that two things
were my present work, as above:
i. Reflection upon things past. 2. Serious application to things future. Having resolved the business of life into these heads,
I began immediately with the first; and as sometimes 
I took my pen and ink to disburden my thoughts when
the subject crowded in fast upon me, so I have here
communicated some of my observations for the benefit
of those that come after me.
About the time that I was upon these inquiries, being
at a friend's house, and talking much of my long travels,
as you know travellers are apt to do, I observed an
ancient gentlewoman in the company listened with a
great deal of attention, and, as I thought, with some
pleasure, to what I was saying; and after I had done,
"Pray, sir," says she, turning her speech to me, "give
me leave to ask you a question or two." —" With all
my heart, madam," said I; so we began the following
short dialogue:—
Old Gent. Pray, sir, in all your travels, can you
tell what is the world a-doing? What have you
observed to be the principal business of mankind?
Rob. Cru. Truly, madam, 'tis very hard to answer
such a question, the people being so differently em-
ployed, some one way, and some another; and par-
ticularly according to the several parts of the world
through which our observations are to run, and accord-
ing to the differing manners, customs, and circumstances
of the people in every place.
Old. Gent. Alas! sir, that is no answer at all to me,
because I am not a judge of the differing customs and
manners of the people you speak of; but is there not
one common end and design in the nature of men,
which seems to run through all their actions, and to
be formed by Nature as the main end of life, and by
consequence is made the chief business of living?
Pray, how do they spend their time?
R. C. Nay; now, madam, you have added a
question to the rest of a different nature from what,
if I take you right, you meant at first. Old Gent. What question, sir?r
R. C. Why, how mankind spend their time; for I
cannot say that one-half of mankind spend their time
in what they themselves may acknowledge to be the
main end of life.
Old Gent. Pray, don't distinguish me out of my
question; we may talk of what is the true end of life,
as we understood it here in a Christian country, another
time; but take my question as I offer it, what is man-
kind generally a-doing as their main business?
R. C. Truly, the main business that mankind seems
to be doing is to eat and drink; that's their enjoyment,
and to get food to eat is their employment, including
a little their eating and devouring one another.
Old Gent. That's a description of them as brutes. R. C. It is so in the first part, namely, their living
to eat and drink; but in the last part they are worse
than the brutes; for the brutes destroy not their own
kind, but all prey upon a different species; and besides,
they prey upon one another for necessity, to satisfy
their hunger, and for food; but man for baser ends,
such as avarice, envy, revenge, and the like, devours
his own species, nay, his own flesh and blood, as my
Lord Rochester very well expresses it:
But judge yourself, I'll bring it to the test, Which is the basest creature, man or beast?Birds feed on birds, beasts on each other prey, But savage man alone does man betray. Pressed by necessity, they kill for food,
Man undoes man, to do himself no good.
With teeth and claws, by Nature armed they hunt,
Nature's allowance to suppy their want:
But man with smiles, embraces, friendship, praise,
Inhumanly his fellow's life betrays.
With voluntary pains works his distress,
Not for necessity, but wantonness.
Old Gent. All this I believe is true; but this does
not reach my question yet. There is certainly some-
thing among them which is esteemed as more particularly 
the end of life and of living than the rest; to which
they apply in common as the main business, and which
is always esteemed to be their wisdom to be employed
in. Is there not something that is apparently the great
business of living?
R. C. Why, really, madam, I think not. For ex-
ample: great part of the world, and a greater part by
far than we imagine, is resolved into the lowest de-
generacy of human nature, I mean, the savage life;
where the chief end of life seems to be merely to eat
and drink, that is to say, to get their food, just as the
brutal life is employed, and indeed with very little dif-
ference between them; for except only speech and
idolatry, I see nothing in the life of some whole nations
of people, and for ought I know, containing millions
of souls, in which the life of a lion or an elephant in the
deserts of Arabia is not equal.
Old Gent. I could mention many things, sir, in
which they might differ, but that is not the present
thing I inquire about; but, pray, sir, is not religion the
principal business of mankind in all the parts of the
world? for I think you granted it when you named
idolatry, which they, no doubt, call religion.
R. C. Really, madam, I cannot say it is; because,
what with ignorance on one hand, and hypocrisy on
the other, 'tis very hard to know where to find religion
in the world.
Old Gent. You avoid my question too laboriously,
sir; I have nothing to do either with the ignorance or
hypocrisy of the people; whether they are blindly de-
vout, or knavishly and designedly devout, is not the
case; but whether religion is not apparently the main
business of the world, the principal apparent end of life,
and the employment of mankind.
R. C. What do you call religion?
Old Gent. By religion, I mean the worshipping and paying homage to some supreme being; some God,
known or unknown is not to the case, so it be but to
something counted supreme.
R. C. It is true, madam, there are scarce any
nations in the world so stupid but they give testi-
mony to the being of a God, and have some notion of
a supreme power.
Old Gent. That I know also, but that is not the
main part of my question; but my opinion is, that
paying a Divine worship, acts of homage and adoration,
and particularly that of praying to the Supreme Being
which they acknowledge, is derived to mankind from
the light of Nature with the notion or belief itself.
R. C. I suppose, madam, you mean by the question
then, whether the notion or belief of a God in general,
and the sense of worship in particular, are not one and
the same natural principle.
Old Gent. I do so, if you and I do but agree about
what we call worship.
R. C. By worship, I understand adoration.
Old Gent. But there you and I differ again a little;
for by worship, I understand supplication.
R. C. Then you must take them both in together,
for some part of the Indian savages only adore.
Old Gent. I confess there is much adoration, where
there is little supplication. R. C. You distinguish too nicely, madam. Old Gent. No, no, I do not distinguish in what I
call worship; I allege that all the adoration of those
poor savages is mere supplication: you say they lift up
their hands to their idols, for fear they should hurt
them.
R. C. I do say so, and it is apparent.
Old Gent. Why, that is the same thing, for then
they lift up their hands to him, that is to say, pray to
him not to hurt them; for all the worship in the world, especially the outward performance, may be resolved
into supplication.
R. C. I agree with you in that, if you mean the
apparent endof worship.
Old Gent. Why, did not your man Friday and the
savage woman you tell us of, talk of their old idol they
called Benamuckee? And what did they do?
R. C. It is very true they did.
Old Gent. And did not Friday tell you they went up
to the hills, and said " O" to him? Pray, what was
the meaning of saying "O" to him, but "O do not
hurt us; for thou art omnipotent, and canst kill us: O
heal our distempers; for thou art infinite, and canst do
all things: O give us what we want, for thou art
bountiful: O spare us, for thou art merciful:" and so
of all the other conceptions of a God?
R. C. Well, madam, I grant all this; pray what
do you infer from it? What is the reason of your
question?
Old Gent. O sir, I have many inferences to draw
from it for my own observation; I do not set up to
instruct you.
I thought this serious old lady would have enter-
tained a farther discourse with me on so fruitful a sub-
ject, but she declined it, and left me to my own
meditation, which, indeed, she had raised up to an
unusual pitch; and the first thing that occurred to me,
was to put me upon inquiring after that nice thing I
ought to call religion in the world, seeing really I found
reason to think that there was much more devotion
than religion in the world; in a word, much more
adoration than supplication; and I doubt, as I come
nearer home, it will appear that there is much more
hypocrisy than sincerity — of which I may speak by
itself.
In my first inquiries, I looked back upon my own travels, and it afforded me but a melancholy reflection,
that in all the voyages and travels which I have em-
ployed two volumes in giving a relation of, I never set
my foot in a Christian country; no, not in circling
three parts of the globe; for excepting the Brazils,
where the Portuguese indeed profess the Roman Catholic
principles, which, however, in distinction from pagan-
ism, I will call the Christian religion — I say, except
the Brazils, where also I made little stay, I could not
be said to set foot in a Christian country, or a country
inhabited by Christians, from the bay of Larache, and
the port of Sallee, by the Strait's mouth, where I
escaped from slavery, through the Atlantic Ocean, the
coasts of Africa on one side, and of Caribbee, on the
American shore, on the other side; from thence to
Madagascar, Malabar, and the bay and city of Bengal,
the coast of Sumatra, Malacca, Siam, Cambodia,
Cochin China, the empire and coast of China, the de-
serts of Karakathie, the Mongol Tartars, the Siberian,
the Samoiede barbarians, and till I came within four or
five days of Archangel in the Black Russia.
It is, I say, a melancholy reflection to think how all
these parts of the world, and with infinite numbers of
millions of people, furnished with the powers of reason
and gifts of Nature, and many ways, if not every way,
as capable of the reception of sublime things as we are,
are yet abandoned to the grossest ignorance and de-
pravity; and that not in religion only, but even in all
the desirable parts of human knowledge, and especially
science and acquired knowledge.
What the Divine wisdom has determined concerning
the souls of so many millions, it is hard to conclude,
nor is it my present design to inquire; but this I may
be allowed here, as a remark: if they are received to
mercy in a future state, according to the opinion of
some, as having not sinned against saving light, then their ignorance and pagan darkness is not a curse, but
a felicity; and there are no unhappy people in the
world, but those lost among Christians, for their sins
against revealed light; nay, then being born in the
regions of Christian light, and under the revelation of
the Gospel doctrines, is not so much a mercy to be
acknowledged as some teach us, and it may in a negative
manner be true that the Christian religion is an efficient
in the condemnation of sinners, and loses more than it
saves, which is impious but to imagine. On the other
hand, if all those nations are included under the sentence
of eternal absence from God, which is hell in the
abstract, then what becomes of all the sceptical doc-
trines of its being inconsistent with the mercy and
goodness of an infinite and beneficent Being to condemn
so great a part of the world, for not believing in Him of
whom they never had any knowledge or instruction?
But I desire not to be the promoter of unanswerable
doubts in matters of religion; much less would I
promote cavils at the foundations of religion, either as
to its profession or practice, and therefore I only name
things. I return to my inquiry after religion as we
generally understand the word.
And in this I confine myself in my present inquiries
to the particular nations professing the Christian religion
only; and I shall take notice afterward what influence
the want of religion has upon the manners, the genius,
and the capacities of the people, as to all the improvable
parts of human knowledge.
The Moors of Barbary are Mahometans, and that
of the most unpolished and degenerate sort, especially
of that part of the world where they live; they are
cruel as beasts, vicious, insolent, and inhuman as de-
generated nature can make them: moral virtues have
so little recommended themselves to any among them,
that they are accounted no accomplishment, and are in r
no esteem; nor is a man at all respected for being
grave, sober, judicious, or wise, or for being just in his
dealings, or most easy in his conversation; but rapine
and injury is the custom of the place, and it is to
recommend a great man that he is rich, powerful in
slaves, merciless in his government of them, and im-
periously haughty in his whole household. Every man
is a king within himself, and regards neither justice or
mercy, humanity or civility, either to those above him
or those below him, but just as his arbitrary passions
guide him.
Religion here is confined to the biram and the
ramadan, the feast and the fast, to the mosque and the
bath; reading the Alcoran on one hand, and performing
the washings and purifications on the other, make up
their religious exercises; and for the rest, conversation
is eaten up with barbarisms and brutish customs; so
that there is neither society, humanity, confidence in
one another, or conversation with one another; but
men live like the wild beasts, for every man here really
would destroy and devour the other if he could.
This guided me to a just reflection, in honour of the
Christian religion, which I have often since made use
of, and which on this occasion I will make a digression
to, viz., that it is to be said for the reputation of the
Christian religion in general, and by which it is justly
distinguished from all other religions, that wherever
Christianity has been planted or professed nationally
in the world, even where it has not had a saving
influence, it has yet had a civilising influence. It
has operated upon the manners, the morals, the politics,
and even the tempers and dispositions of the people;
it has reduced them to the practice of virtue, and to
the true methods of living; has weaned them from the
barbarous customs they had been used to, infusing a
kind of humanity and softness of disposition into their very natures; civilising and softening them, teaching
them to love a regularity of life, and filling them with
principles of generous kindness and beneficence one to
another; in a word, it has taught them to live like men,
and act upon the foundations of clemency, humanity,
love, and good neighbourhood, suitable to the nature
and dignity of God's image, and to the rules of justice
and equity, which it instructs them in.
Nay, farther, I must observe also, that as the
Christian religion has worn out, or been removed from
any country, and they have returned to heathenism
and idolatry, so the barbarisms have returned, the
customs of the heathen nations have been again restored,
the very nature and temper of the people have been
again lost, all their generous principles have forsaken
them, the softness and goodness of their dispositions
have worn out, and they have returned to cruelty,
inhumanity, rapine, and blood.
It is true, and it may be named as an objection to
this remark of mine, that the Romans though heathens,
and the Grecians by the study of philosophy in par-
ticular persons, and by the excellency of their govern-
ment in their general or national capacity, were filled
with notions of virtue and honour, with most generous
and just principles, and acted with an heroic mind on
many occasions; practising the most sublime and ex-
alted height of virtue, such as sacrificing their lives for
their country with the utmost zeal; descending to
great examples of humanity and beneficence, scorning
to do base or vile actions, as unworthy the Roman
name, to save their lives; and a great many most
excellent examples of virtue and gallantry are found
in the histories of the Roman Empire.
This does not oppose, or rather indeed illustrates,
what I say; for with all the philosophy, all the
humanity and generosity they practised, they had yet III. H
their remains of barbarity, were cruel and unmerciful
in their natures, as appeared by the barbarity of their
customs, such as throwing malefactors to wild beasts,
the fightings of their gladiators, and the like; which
were not only appointed as punishments and severities
by the order of public justice, but to show it touched
the very article I am upon, it was the subject of their
sport and diversion, and these things were exhibited
as shows to entertain the ladies; the cutting in pieces
forty or fifty slaves, and the seeing twenty or thirty
miserable creatures thrown to the lions and tigers, was
no less pleasant to them than the going to see an opera,
a masquerade, or a puppet-show is to us; so that I think
the Romans were very far from a people civilised and
softened in their natures by the influences of religion.
And this is evident because that as the Christian reli-
gion came among them, all those cruel customs were
abhorred by them, the famous theatres and circles for
their public sports were overthrown, and the ruins of
them testify the justice of my observation at this very
day.
Nor will it be denied if I should carry this yet
farther, and observe, that even among Christians, those
who are reformed, and farther and farther Chris-
tianised, are still in proportion rendered more human,
more soft and tender; and we do find, without being
partial to ourselves, that even the Protestant countries
are much distinguished in the humanity and softness
of their tempers; the meek, merciful disposition ex-
tends more among Protestants than among the Papists,
as I could very particularly demonstrate from history
and experience.
But to return back to the Moors, where I left off;
they are an instance of that cruelty of disposition which
was anciently in their nature, and how in a country
abandoned of the true Christian religion, after it has been first planted and professed among them, the return
of heathenism or Mahometanism has brought back with
it all the barbarisms of a nation void of religion and good
nature.
I saw enough of these dreadful people to think them
at this time the worst of all the nations of the world;
a nation where no such thing as a generous spirit, or a
temper with any compassion mixed with it, is to be
found; among whom Nature appears stripped of all the
additional glories which it derives from religion, and
yet whereon a Christian flourishing church had stood
several hundred years.
From these I went among the negroes of Africa;
many of them I saw without any the least notion of a
Deity among them, much less any form of worship;
but I had not any occasion to converse with them on
shore, other than I have done since by accident, but
went away to the Brazils. Here I found the natives,
and that even before the Portuguese came among them,
and since also, had abundance of religion, such as it
was; but it was all so bloody, so cruel, consisting of
murders, human sacrifices, witchcrafts, sorceries, and
conjurings, that I could not so much as call them honest
pagans, as I do the negroes.
As for the cannibals, as I have observed in the dis-
course of them, on account of their landing on my
island, I can say but very little of them. As to their
eating human flesh, I take it to be a kind of martial
rage rather than a civil practice, for it is evident they
eat no human creatures but such as are taken prisoners
in their battles, and, as I have observed in giving the
account of those things, they do not esteem it murder,
no, nor so much as unlawful. I must confess, saving
its being a practice in itself unnatural, especially to us,
I say, saving that part, I see little difference between
that and our way, which in the war is frequent in heat of action, viz., refusing quarter; for as to the difference
between eating and killing those that offer to yield, it
matters not much. And this I observed at the same
time, that in their other conduct those savages were as
human, as mild, and gentle as most I have met with in
the world, and as easily civilised.
From these sorts of people I come to the Indians;
for as to the Madagascar men, I saw very little of them,
but that they were a kind of negroes, much like those
on the coast of Guinea, only a little more used and
accustomed to the Europeans by their often landing
among them.
The East Indians are generally pagans or Maho-
metans, and have such mixtures of savage customs with
them, that even Mahometanism is there in its corrup-
tion; neither have they there the upright just dealing,
in matters of right and wrong, which the Turks in
Europe have, with whom 'tis generally very safe trading,
but here they act all the parts of thieves and cheats,
watching to deceive you, and proud of being thought
able to do it.
The subjects of the Great Mogul have a seeming
polite government, and the inhabitants of Ceylon are
under very strict discipline, and yet what difficulty do
we find to trade with them? Nay, their very economy
renders them fraudulent, and in some places they cannot
turn their thoughts to being honest.
China is famous for wisdom, that is to say, that they,
having such a boundless conceit of their own wisdom,
we are obliged to allow them more than they have; the
truth is, they are justly said to be a wise nation among
the foolish ones, and may as justly be called a nation
of fools among the wise ones.
As to their religion, 'tis all summed up in Confu-
cius's maxims, whose theology I take to be a rhapsody
of moral conclusions; a foundation, or what we may 
call elements of polity, morality, and superstition,
huddled together in a rhapsody of words, without
consistency, and, indeed, with very little reasoning in
it; then 'tis really not so much as a refined paganism,
for there are, in my opinion, much more regular doings
among some of the Indians that are pagans, in America,
than there are in China; and if I may believe the
account given of the government of Montezuma in
Mexico, and of the Uncas of Cusco in Peru, their
worship and religion, such as it was, was carried on
with more regularity than these in China. As to the
human ingenuity, as they call it, of the Chinese, I shall
account for it by itself. The utmost discoveries of it
to me appeared in the mechanics, and even in them
infinitely short of what is found among the European
nations.
But let us take these people to pieces a little, and
examine into the great penetration they are so famed for.
First of all, their knowledge has not led them that
length in religious matters which the common notions
of philosophy would have done, and to which they did
lead the wise heathens of old among the Grecian and
Roman Empires, for they, having not the knowledge of
the true God, preserved, notwithstanding, the notion of
a God to be something immortal, omnipotent, sublime;
exalted above in place as well as authority, and there-
fore made heaven to be the seat of their gods, and the
images by which they represented their gods and god-
desses had always some perfections that were really to
be admired as the attendants of their gods, as Jupiter
was called the Thunderer for his power, father of gods
and men, for his seniority; Venus, adored for her
beauty; Mercury for swiftness; Apollo for wit, poetry,
music; Mars for terror and gallantry in arms, and the
like. But when we come to these polite nations of China, which yet we cry up for sense and greatness of genius, we see them grovelling in the very sink and filth
of idolatry; their idols are the most frightful monstrous
shapes, not the form of any real creature, much less the
images of virtue, of chastity, of literature, but horrid
shapes, of their priests' invention; neither hellish or
human monsters, composed of invented forms, with
neither face or figure, but with the utmost distortions,
formed neither to walk, stand, fly, or go, neither to
hear, see, or speak, but merely to instil horrible ideas of
something nauseous and abominable into the minds of
men that adored them.
If I may be allowed to give my notions of worship,
I mean as it relates to the objects of natural homage,
where the name and nature of God is not revealed, as
in the Christian religion, I must acknowledge the sun,
the moon, the stars, the elements, as in the pagan and
heathen nations of old; and above all these, the
representations of superior virtues and excellences
among men, such as valour, fortitude, chastity,
patience, beauty, strength, love, learning, wisdom,
and the like—the objects of worship in the Grecian
and Roman times — were far more eligible and more
rational objects of Divine rights than the idols of
China and Japan, where, with all the economy of
their State maxims and rules of civil government,
which we insist so much on as tests of their wisdom,
their great capacities and understandings, their worship
is the most brutish, and the objects of their worship
the coarsest, the most unmanly, inconsistent with
reason or the nature of religion, of any the world
can show; bowing down to a mere hobgoblin, and
doing their reverence not to the work of men's hands
only, but the ugliest, basest, frightfullest things that
man could make; images so far from being lovely and
amiable, as in the nature of worship is implied, that they
are the most detestable and nauseous, even to nature.
How is it possible these people can have any claim
to the character of wise, ingenious, polite, that could
suffer themselves to be overwhelmed in an idolatry
repugnant to common-sense, even to nature, and be
brought to choose to adore that which was in itself
the most odious and contemptible to nature; not
merely terrible, that so their worship might proceed
from fear, but a complication of nature's aversions?
I cannot omit, that being in one of their temples, or
rather in a kind of oratory or chapel, annexed to one
part of the great palace at Peking, there appeared a
mandarin with his attendants, or, as we may say, a
great lord and his retinue, prostrate before the image,
not of any one of God's creatures, but a creature of
mere human forming, such as neither was alive, nor
was like anything that had life, or had ever been seen
or heard of in the world.
The like image, or something worse, if I could give
it a true representation, may be found in a garden
chapel, if not defaced by wiser heads, of a great Tar-
tarian mandarin, at a small distance from Nanking, and
to which the poor abandoned creatures pay their most
blinded devotions.
It had a thing instead of a head, but no head; it
had a mouth distorted out of all manner of shape, and
not to be described for a mouth, being only an unshapen chasm, neither representing the mouth of a
man, beast, fowl, or fish; the thing was neither any
of the four, but an incongruous monster; it had feet,
hands, fingers, claws, legs, arms, wings, ears, horns,
everything mixed one among another, neither in the
shape or place that Nature appointed, but blended
together and fixed to a bulk, not a body, formed of
no just parts, but a shapeless trunk or log, whether of
wood or stone, I know not; a thing that might have
stood with any side forward, or any side backward, any end upward, or any end downward, that had as
much veneration due to it on one side as on the other
—a kind of celestial hedgehog, that was rolled up
within itself, and was everything every way; that to a
Christian could not have been worthy to have repre-
sented even the devil, and to men of common-sense
must have been their very soul's aversion. In a word,
if I have not represented their monstrous deities right,
let imagination supply anything that can make a mis-
shapen image horrid, frightful, and surprising; and
you may withjustice suppose those sagacious people
called the Chinese, whom, forsooth, we must admire—
I say, you may suppose them prostrate on the ground,
with all their pomp and pageantry, which is in itself
not a little, worshipping such a mangled, promiscuous-
gendered creature.
Shall we call these a wise nation who represent God
in such hideous, monstrous figures as these, and can
prostrate themselves to things ten thousand times more
disfigured than the devil? Had these images been
contrived in the Romans' time, and been set up for
the god of ugliness, as they had their god of beauty,
they might, indeed, have been thought exquisite, but
the Romans would have spurned such an image out of
their temples.
Nothing can render a nation so completely foolish
and simple as such an extravagance in matters of re-
ligious worship; for if gross ignorance in the notion
of a God, which is so extremely natural, will not demon-
strate a nation unpolished, foolish, and weak, even next
to idiotism, I know nothing that will.
But let me trace this wise nation that we talk so
much of, and who not only think themselves wise, but
have drawn us in to pay a kind of homage to their
low-prized wit.
Government and the mechanic arts are the two 
main things in which our people in England, who have
admired them so much, pretend they excel. As to
their government, which consists in an absolute tyranny,
which, by the way, is the easiest way of ruling in the
world where the people are disposed to obey as blindly
as the mandarin commands or governs imperiously,
what policy is required in governing a people of whom
it is said, that if you command them to hang them-
selves, they will only cry a little, and then submit
immediately? Their maxims of government may do
well enough among themselves, but with us they would
be all confusion. In their country it is not so, only
because whatever the mandarin says is a law, and God
Himself has no power or interest among them to con-
tradict it, unless He pleases to execute it brevi manu
from heaven.
Most of their laws consist in immediate judgment,
swift executions, just retaliations, and fair protection
from injuries. Their punishments are cruel and ex-
orbitant, such as cutting the hands and the feet off for
theft, at the same time releasing murders and other
flagrant crimes.
Their mandarins are their judges in very many cases,
like our justices of the peace; but then they judge
by customs, oral tradition, or immediate opinion, and
execute the sentence immediately,without room or
time to reflect upon the justice of it, or to consider
of mitigations, as in all Christian countries is practised,
and as the sense of human frailty would direct.
But let me come to their mechanics, in which their
ingenuity is so much cried up. I affirm there is little
or nothing sufficient to build the mighty opinion we
have of them upon, but what is founded upon the com-
parisons which we make between them and other pagan
nations, or proceeds from the wonder which we make
that they should have any knowledge of mechanic arts, r
/
because we find the remote inhabitants of Africa and
America so grossly ignorant and so entirely destitute in
such things; whereas we do not consider that the Chinese
inhabit the continent of Asia, and though they are
separated by deserts and wildernesses, yet they are a
continuous continent of land with the parts of the
world once inhabited by the politer Medes, Persians,
and Grecians; that the first ideas of mechanic arts
were probably received by them from the Persians,
Assyrians, and the banished transplanted Israelites,
who are said to be carried into the regions of Parthia
and the borders of Karakathie, from whence they are
also said to have communicated arts, and especially
handicraft, in which the Israelites excelled, to the
inhabitants of all those countries, and, consequently,
in time to those beyond them.
But let them be received from whom they will, and
how long ago soever, let us but compare the improve-
ment they have made with what others have made;
and, except in things peculiar to themselves, by their
climate, we shall find the utmost of their ingenuity
amounts but to a very trifle, and that they are outdone
even in the best of their works by our ordinary artists,
whose imitations exceed their originals beyond all com-
parison.
For example, they have gunpowder and guns,
whether they have learned to make them by direc-
tion of Europeans, which is most likely, or that they
found it out by mere strength of invention, as some
would advance, though without certainty, in their
favour — be it which it will, as I say, it matters not
much, their powder is of no strength for the needful
operations of sieges, mines, batteries, no, nor for shoot-
ing of birds, as ours is, without great quantities put
together; their guns are rather an ostentation than for
execution, clumsy, heavy, and ill-made; neither have 
they arrived to any tolerable degree of knowledge in
the art of gunnery or engineering. They have no bombs,
carcasses, hand-grenades; their artificial fireworks are
in no degree comparable or to be named with ours;
nor have they arrived to anything in the military skill
—in marshalling armies, handling arms, discipline, and
the exercise in the field — as the Europeans have; all
which is depending on the improvement of firearms,
&c., in which, if they have had the use of gunpowder
so many ages as some dream, they must be unaccount-
able blockheads that they have made no farther improve-
ment; and if it is but lately, they are yet apparently
dull enough in the managing of it, at least compared
to what ought to be expected of an ingenious people,
such as our people cry them up to be.
I might go from this to their navigation, in which
it is true they outdo most of their neighbours; but
what is all their skill in sailing compared to ours?
Whither do they go? and how manage the little and
foolish barks and junks they have? What would they
do with them to traverse the great Indian, American,
or Atlantic oceans? What ships, what sailors, what
poor, awkward, and ignorant doings are there among
them at sea! And when our people hire any of them,
as sometimes they are obliged to do, how do our sailors
kick them about, as a parcel of clumsy, ignorant, un-
handy fellows!
Then for building of ships, what are they? and
what are they able to do towards the glorious art of
building a large man-of-war? It is out of doubt with
me, that all the people of China could not build such
a ship as the "Royal Sovereign" in a hundred years;
no, not though she was there for them to look at and
take pattern by.
I might go on to abundance more things, such as
painting, making glasses, making clocks and watches, making bone-lace, frame-work knitting; all of which,
except the two first, they know little or nothing; and
of the two first nothing compared to what is done in
Europe.
The height of their ingenuity, and for which we
admire them with more colour of cause than in other
things, is their porcelain or earthenware work, which,
in a word, is more due to the excellent composition
of the earth they make them of, and which is their
peculiar, than to the workmanship; in which, if we
had the same clay, we should soon outdo them as much
as we do in other things. The next art is their manu-
facturing in fine silks, cotton, herba, gold, and silver,
in which they have nothing but what is in common
with our ordinary poor weavers.
The next mechanic art is their lacquering, which is
just, as in their China ware, a peculiar to their country,
in the materials, not at all in the workmanship; and as
for the cabinet-work of it they are manifestly outdone
by us; and abundance is every year sent thither framed
and made in England, and only lacquered in China, to
be returned to us. I might run the like parallel through most of the
things these people excel in, which would all appear to
be so deficient as would render all their famed wisdom
and capacity most scandalously imperfect. But I am
not so much upon their cunning in arts as upon their
absurdity and ridiculous folly in religious matters, and
in which I think the rudest barbarians outdo them.
From this wise nation we have a vast extent of
ground, near two thousand miles in breadth, partly
under the Chinese government, partly under the Mus-
covite, but inhabited by Tartars of Mongol Tartary,
Karakathie, Siberian, and Samoiedes pagans, whose
idols are almost as hideous as the Chinese's, and whose
religion is all Nature — and not only so, but Nature under 
the greatest degeneracy, and next to brutal. Father le
Comte gives us the pictures of some of their house idols,
and an account of their worship; and this lasts, as I have
observed, to within a few days of Archangel. So that,
in a word, from the mouth of the Straits, that is to say,
from Sallee over to Caribbee, from thence round Africa
by the Cape of Good Hope, across the vast Indian
Ocean, and upon all the coast of it, about by Malacca
and Sumatra, through the straits of Singapore and the
coast of Siam northwards to China, and through China
by land over the deserts of the Grand Tartary to the
river Dwina, being a circuit three times the diameter
of the earth, and every jot as far as the whole circum-
ference, the name of God is not heard of, except
among a few of the Indians that are Mahometans;
the Word of God is not known, or the Son of God
spoken of.
Having some warmth in my search after religion,
occasioned by this reflection, and so little of it appear-
ing in all the parts which I had travelled, I resolved
to travel over the rest of the world in books, for my
wandering days are pretty well over; I say, I resolved
to travel the rest in books; and sure, said I, there
must appear abundance of serious religion in the rest
of the world, or else I know nothing at all of where I
shall find it.
But I find by my reading, just as I did in travelling,
that all the customs of nations, as to religion, were
much alike; that, one with another, they are more
devout in their worship of something, whatever it be,
than inquisitive after what it is they worship; and
most of the altars of worship in the world might to
this day be inscribed to the unknown God.
This may seem a strange thing; but that wonder
may cease when further inquiry is made into the par-
ticular objects of worship which the several nations of the world bow down to, some of which are so horrid,
so absurd, as one would think human nature could not
sink so low as to do her homage in so irrational a
manner.
And here, being to speak of religion as idolatrous,
it occurs to me that it seemed strange that, except in
Persia and some part of Tartary, I found none of the
people look up for their gods, but down; by which it
came into my mind that, even in idolatry itself, the
world was something degenerated, and their reason was
more hoodwinked than their ancestors'.
By looking up and looking down, I mean, they do
not, as the Romans, look up among the stars for their
idols, place their gods in the skies, and worship, as we
might say, like men, but look down among the brutes,
form idols to themselves out of the beasts, and figure
things like monsters, to adore them for their ugliness
and horrible deformity.
Of the two, the former, in my opinion, was much
the more rational idolatry, as particularly the Persians
worshipping the sun; and when I had a particular ac-
count of that of Bengal, it presently occurred to my
thoughts that there was something awful, something
glorious and godlike in the sun, that, in the ignorance
of the true God, might rationally bespeak the homage
of the creatures; and to whom it seemed reasonable,
where reason was its own judge only, without the helps
of Revelation, to pay an adoration as the parent of
light, and the giver of life to all the vegetative world,
and as in a visible manner enlivening and influencing
the rational and sensitive life, and which might, for
aught they knew, at first create, as it did since so
plainly affect, all things round us.
This thought gave birth to the following excursion,
with which I shall close this observation:
Hail 1 glorious lamp, the parent of the day,
Whose beams not only heat and life convey;
But may that heat and life, for aught we know,
On many, many distant worlds bestow.
Immense, amazing globe of heavenly fire. To whom all flames ascend, in whom all lights expire,
Rolling in flames, emits eternal ray,
Yet self-sufficient suffers no decay.
Thy central vigour never, never dies,
But life the motion, motion life supplies,
When lesser bodies rob us of thy beams,
And intercept thy flowing, heavenly streams;
Fools by mistake eclipse thee from their sight, When 'tis the eyes eclipsed, and not thy light.
Thy absence constitutes effectual night
When rolling earth deprives us of thy light;
And planets all opaque and beggarly,
Borrow thy beams, and strive to shine like thee;
In their mock, lifeless light we starve and freeze,
And wait the warmth of thy returning rays.
Thy distance leaves us all recline and sad,
And hoary winter governs in thy stead:
Swift thy returning vigour, warm and mild,
Salutes the earth, and gets the world with child.
Great soul of nature, from whose vital spring
Due heat and life diffused through everything:
Govern'st the moon and stars by different ray, \
She queen of night, thee monarch of the day, The moon, and stars, and earth, and plants obey. When darker nations see thee placed on high,
And feel thy warmth their genial heat supply;How imperceptible thy influence
Slides through their veins, and touches every sense;By glimmering nature led, they bow their knee,
Mistake their God, and sacrifice to thee,
Mourn thy declining steps, and hate the night,
But when in hope of thy approaching light,
Bless thy return, which brings the cheerful day,
And to thy wond'rous light false adorations pay.
Nor can we blame the justice of the thought,
In minds by erring reason only taught.
Nature, it seems, instructs a deity,
And reason says there's none so bright as thee.
Nor is thy influence so much a jest,
There's something shocks our nature in the rest:To make a God, and then the tool adore,
And bow to that that worshipped us before.
The nonsense takes off all the reverence,
That can't be worshipping that is not sense.
'
But when the spring of Nature shows its face, The glory of its rays, the swiftness of its race, Stupendous height and majesty divine, And with what awful splendour it can shine, Who that no other news from heaven could hear, }
Would think but this was God, would think and fear, J.
No other idol ever came so near. J
Certain it is that the Persians, who thus paid their
adoration to the sun, were at that time some of the
wisest people in the world. Some tell us that the
great image that Nebuchadnezzar set up for all his
people to worship, was represented holding the sun in
his right hand; and that it was to the representation
of the sun that he commanded all nations and kindreds
to bow and to worship. If so, then the Assyrians
were worshippers also of the sun as well as the Per-
sians, which is not at all improbable. We read also in
the Scripture of those nations who worshipped all the
host of heaven, a thing much more rational, and nearer
of kin to worshipping the great God of heaven than
worshipping the whole host of the earth, and worship-
ping the most abject and loathsome creatures, or but
even the representations of those creatures, which was
still worse than the other.
But what are all the absurdities of heathenism, which
at last are resolved into the degeneracy of mankind, and
their being fallen from the knowledge of the true God,
which was once, as we have reason to believe, diffused
to all mankind? I say, what are these? And how
much ground for just reflection do they afford us,
compared to the gross things in practice which we find
every day among those nations who profess to have had
the clear light of Gospel revelation?
How many self-contradicting principles do they
hold? How contrary to their profession do they act?
How does one side burn for what another side abhors?
And how do Christians, taking that venerable name for a general appellation, doom one another to the devil for
a few disagreeing clauses of the same religion, while all
profess to worship the same Deity, and to expect the
same salvation?
With what preposterous enthusiasms do some mingle
their knowledge, and with as gross absurdities others
their devotion? How blindly superstitious; how
furious and raging in their zeal? How cruel, inexor-
able, and even inhuman and barbarous to one another,
when they differ? as if religion divested us of humanity,
and that in our worshipping a God of mercy, and in
whose compassions alone it is that we have room to
hope, we should, to please and serve Him, banish
humanity from our nature, and show no compassion
to those that fall into our hands.
In my travelling through Portugal, it was my lot to
come to Lisbon while they held there one of their courts
of justice called Auto-de-fe, that is to say, a court of
justice of the Inquisition. It is a subject which has
been handled by many writers, and indeed exposed by
some of the best Catholics; and my present business is
not to write a history, or engage in a dispute, but to
relate a passage.
They carried in procession all their criminals to the
great church, where eight of them appeared first,
dressed up in gowns and caps of canvas, upon which
were painted all that man could devise of hell's torments,
devils broiling and roasting human bodies, and a
thousand such frightful things, with flames and devils
besides in every part of the dress.
Those I found were eight poor creatures condemned
to be burnt, and for they scarce knew what, but for
crimes against the Catholic faith, and against the blessed
Virgin, and they were burnt. One of them, it was
said, rejoiced that he was to be burnt, and being asked
why, answered that he had much rather die than be III. 1
carried back to the prison of the Inquisition, where
their cruelties were worse than death. Of those eight,
as I was told, some were Jews, whose greatest crime,
as many there did not scruple to say, was that they
were very rich; and some Christians were in the
number at the same time, whose greatest misery was
that they were very poor.
It was a sight that almost gave me a shock in my
notion of Christianity itself, till I began to recollect
that it might be possible that Inquisitors were scarce
Christians, and that I knew many Catholic countries
do not suffer this abominable judicature to be erected
among them.
I have seen much, and read more, of the unhappy
conduct, in matters of religion, among the other nations
of the world professing the Christian religion; and
upon my word I find some practices infinitely scandal-
ous, some which are the common received customs of
Christians, which would be the abhorrence of heathens;
and it requires a strong attachment to the foundation,
which is indeed the principal part in religion, to guard
our minds against being offended even at the Christian
religion itself, but I got over that part afterward.
Let it not offend the ears of any true lover of the
Christian religion that I observe some of the follies of
the professors of the Christian religion, assuring you
'tis far from being my design to bring the least scandal
upon the profession itself.
And here, therefore, let me give the words of a
judicious person who travelled from Turkey through
Italy. His words are these :—
"When I was in Italy I ranged over great part of
the patrimony of St. Peter, where one would think,
indeed, the face of religion would be plainest to be
seen, and without any disguise; but, in short, I found
there the face of religion, and no more.
"At Rome there was all the pomp and glory of
religious habits: the Pope and the cardinals walked
with a religious gravity, but lived in a religious luxury,
kept up the pomp of religion and the dignity of religious
titles; but, like our Lord's observation on the Pharisees,
I found within they were all ravening wolves.
"The religious justice they do there is particularly
remarkable, and very much recommends them. The
Church protects murderers and assassins, and then
delivers the civil magistrates over to Satan for doing
justice. They interdict whole kingdoms, and shut up
the churches for want of paying a few ecclesiastic dues,
and so put a stop to religion for want of their money.
I found the courtesans were the most constant creatures
at the church, and the most certain place for an assigna-
tion with another man's wife was at prayers.
"The Court of Inquisition burnt two men for
speaking dishonourably of the blessed Virgin, and the
missionaries in China tolerated the worshipping the
devil by their new convert. A Jew was likewise
burnt for denying Christ, while the Jesuits joined the
paganism of the heathen with the high mass, and sung
anthems to the immortal idols of Tonquin.
"When I saw this I resolved to inquire no more
after religion in Italy, till by accident meeting with a
quietist, he gave me to understand that all religion was
internal, that the duties of Christianity were summed up
in reflection and ejaculation. He inveighed bitterly
against the game of religion which he said was playing
over the world by the clergy; and said Italy was a
theatre, where religion was the grand opera, and the
Popish clergy were the stage players. I liked him in
many of his notions about other people's religion; but
when I came to talk with him a little closely about his
own, it was so wrapped up in his internals, concealed in
the cavities and dark parts of the soul, viz., meditation without worship, doctrine without practice, reflection
without reformation, and zeal without knowledge, that
I could come to no certainty with him but in this, that
religion in Italy was really invisible."
This was very agreeable to my notions of Italian
religion, and to what I had met with from other people
that had travelled the country, but one observation of
blindness and superstition I must give within my own
knowledge, and nearer home. When passing through
Flanders I found the people in a certain city there in
a very great commotion. The case was this. A
certain scelerate (so they call an abandoned wretch
given up to all wickedness) had broken into a chapel
in the city, and had stolen the pix or casket wherein
the sacred host was deposited; which host, after rightly
consecrated, they believe to be the real body of our
blessed Saviour, being transubstantiated, as they call it,
from the substance of bread.
The fact being discovered, the city, as I said above,
was all up in a tumult; the gates were shut up, nobody
suffered to go out, every house was searched, and the
utmost diligence used; and at length, as it was next to
impossibility he should escape, he was discovered.
His execution was not long deferred. But first he
was examined, and I think by torture, what he had
done with the sacred thing which was in the pix,
which he had stolen? And at length he confessed
that he had thrown it into a house of office, and was
carried with a guard to show them the place.
As it was impossible to find a little piece of a wafer
in such a place, though no pains were spared in a most
filthy manner to search for it; but, as I say, it could
not be found; immediately the place was judged con-
secrated ipso facto, turned into an oratory, and the
devout people flocked to it to expiate, by their prayers,
the dishonour done to the Lord God by throwing His precious body into so vile a place. It was determined
by the wiser part that the body would not fall down
into the place, but be snatched up by its inherent
power, or by the holy angels, and not be suffered to
touch the excrements in that place. However, the
people continued their devotions for some time just in
the place where it was, and afterwards a large chapel
was built upon it, where the same prayers are con-
tinued, as I suppose, to this day.
I had a particular occasion to come at a very ac-
curate account of Poland by a Polish gentleman, in
whose company I travelled, and from whom I learned
all that was worth inquiring of about religious affairs in
Prussia on one side and Muscovy on the other.
As for Poland, he told me they were all confusion
both in Church and in State; that notwithstanding their
wars they were persecutors of the worst kind, that they
let the Jews live among them undisturbed to such a
degree, that in the country about Lemburg and Kiow
there were reckoned above 30,000 Jews; that these
had not toleration only but many privileges granted
them, though they denied Christ to be the Messiah,
or that the Messiah was come in the flesh, and blas-
phemed His name upon frequent occasions; and at
the same time they persecuted the Protestants, and
destroyed their churches, wherever they had power to
do it.
On the other hand, when I came to inquire of those
Protestants, and what kind of people they were who
suffered so severely for their religion, I found they were
generally a sort of Protestants called Socinians, and that
Lelius Socinus had spread his errors so universally over
this country that our Lord Jesus Christ was reduced
here to little more than a good man sent from heaven
to instruct the world, and far from capable of effecting
by the influence of His Spirit and grace the glorious work of redeeming the world. As for the divinity of
the Holy Ghost, they have no trouble about it.
Having given this account of knowledge and piety
in the countries inhabited by Christians of the Roman
Church, it seems natural to say something of the Greek
Church.
There are in the Czar of Muscovy's dominions abun-
dance of wooden churches, and had not the country
been as full of wooden priests something might have
been said for the religion of the Muscovites, for the
people are wonderfully devout there; which would
have been very well, if it had not been attended with
the profoundest ignorance that was ever heard of in
any country where the name of Christian was so much
as talked of. But when I came to inquire about their worship,
I found our Lord Jesus Christ made so much a
meaner figure among them than St. Nicholas that I
concluded religion was swallowed up of superstition,
and so indeed I found it was upon all occasions: as to
the conduct of the people in religious matters, their
ignorance is so established upon obstinacy, which is
the Muscovite's national sin, that it would be really to
no purpose to look any longer for a reformation among
them.
In short, no man will, I believe, say of me that I
do the Muscovites any wrong when I say they are the
most ignorant and most obstinate people in the Christian
world, when I tell the following story of them.
It was after the battle at Narva, where the late King
of Sweden, Charles XII., defeated their great army,
and after the victory extended his troops pretty far into
their country, and perhaps plundered them a little as
he advanced; when the Muscovites, we may be sure,
being in the utmost distress and confusion, fell to their
prayers. We read of nothing they had to say to God Almighty in that case; but to their patron saint they
addressed this extraordinary prayer:
"O thou, our perpetual comforter in all our adver-
sities! thou infinitely powerful St. Nicholas, by what
sin, and how have we highly offended thee in our
sacrifices, genuflections, reverences, and actions of
thanksgiving, that thou hast thus forsaken us? We
had therefore sought to appease thee entirely, and we
had implored thy presence and thy succour against the
terrible, insolent, dreadful, enraged, and undaunted
enemies and destroyers; when, like lions, bears, and
other savage beasts that have lost their young ones, they
attacked us after an insolent and terrible manner; and
terrified and wounded, took and killed us by thousands,
us who are thy people. Now, as it is impossible that
this should happen without witchcraft and enchantment,
seeing the great care that we had taken to fortify our-
selves, after an impregnable manner, for the defence and
security of thy name, we beseech thee, O St. Nicholas,
to be our champion, and the bearer of our standard, to
be with us both in peace and in war, and in our neces-
sities, and at the time of our death, to protect us against
this horrible and tyrannical crew of sorcerers, and to
drive them far enough off from our frontiers, with the
recompense which they may deserve."
It may be hoped I may give a better account of
religion among the Protestants than I have among the
Roman and Grecian Churches; and I will, if in justice
it is possible.
The next to the nations I have been mentioning, I
mean in geographical order, are those reformed Christians
called Lutherans; to say no worse of them, the face
of religion indeed is altered much between these and
the latter. But I scarce know what name to give it,
at least as far as I have inquired into it, or what it is
like. -^
It was Popery and no Popery; there was the consub.
but not the transub. The service differed indeed from
the mass, but the deficiency seemed to be made up very
much with the trumpets, kettle-drums, fiddles, haut-
boys, &c., and all the merry part of the Popish de-
votion; upon which it occurred to me presently, that if
there was no danger of Popery among the Lutherans,
there was danger of superstition; and as for the pious
part, I saw very little of it in either of them.
By religion, therefore, the reader is desired to under-
stand here not the principles upon which the several
nations denominate themselves, so much as the manner
in which they discover themselves to be sincere in the
profession which they make. I had no inclination
here to enter into the inquiry after the creeds which
every nation professed to believe, but the manner in
which they practised that religion which they really
professed; for what is religion to me without practice?
And although it may be true that there can be no true
religion where it is not professed upon right principles;
yet, that which I observe here, and which to me is the
greatest grievance among Christians, is the want of a
religious practice even where there are right principles
at bottom, and where there is a profession of the
orthodox faith.
In brief, I am not hunting after the profession of
religion, but the practice. The first I find almost in
every nation—nulla gens tarn barbara; but the last I am
like to travel through the histories of all Christendom
with my search, and perhaps may hardly be able, when
I have done, to tell you where it is.
All the satire of this inquiry will look this way; for
where God has not given a people the blessing of a true
knowledge of Himself, it would call for our pity, not
reproach. It would be a very dull satire indeed that a
man should be witty upon the negroes in Africa for not 
knowing Christ, and not understanding the doctrine of
a Saviour; but if turning to our modern Christians of
Barbadoes and Jamaica for not teaching them, not in-
structing them, and for refusing to baptize them, there
the satire would be pointed and seasonable, as we shall
hear farther by-and-by.
But to return to the Lutherans, for there I am sup-
posed to be at this time, I mean, among the courts and
cities of Brandenburg, Saxony, &c.,— I had oppor-
tunity here to view a court affecting gallantry, magni-
ficence, and gay things, to such a height, and with
such a passion, to exceed the whole world in that empty
part of human felicity called show, that I thought
it was impossible to pursue it with such an impetuous
torrent of the affections without sacrificing all things
to it which wise men esteem more valuable.
Nor was my notion wrong; for the first thing I
found sacrificed, as I say, to this voluptuous humour
was the liberties of the people, who being by constitution
or custom rather under absolute government, and at the
arbitrary will of the prince, are sure to pay, not all they
can spare, but even all they have, to gratify the un-
bounded appetite of a court given up to pleasure and
exorbitance.
By all I have read of the manner of living there,
both court and people, the latter are entirely given up
to the former, not by necessity only, but by the consent
of custom and the general way of management through
the whole country; nay, this is carried to such a height
that, as I have been told, the king's coffers are the
general cesspool of the nations, whither all the money
of the kingdoms flows, and only disperses again as that
gives it out — whether by running over or running out
at its proper vent, I do not inquire; so that as all the
blood in the human body circulates in twenty-four hours
through the ventricles of the heart, so all the money in the kingdom is said to pass once a year through the
king's treasury.
How far poverty and misery may prompt piety and
devotion among the poor inhabitants, I cannot say; but
if luxury and gallantry, together with tyranny and
oppression to support it, can subsist with true religion
in the great men, then, for aught I know, the courts of
Prussia and Dresden may be the best qualified in the
world to produce this thing called religion, which, I
have hitherto seen, is hard to be found.
It is true, that the magnificence of the wisest king in
the world in Jerusalem was esteemed the felicity of his
people; but it seems to be expressed very elegantly, not
as a testimony of his glory only, but of the flourishing
condition of his people at the same time, under the
prosperous circumstances which his reign brought them
to, viz., that he made gold to be for plenty like the
stones in the streets, amply expressing the flourishing
condition of his people under him.
I have likewise read, indeed, and heard much of the
same kind of the King of Prussia, and that even from
his own subjects, who were always full of the generous
and truly royal qualities of that prince; he was the first
king of the country, which before was a dukedom or
electorate only. The sum of their discourse is, that
his majesty was so true a father of his country and of
his people, that his whole care was the flourishing of
their trade, establishing their manufactures, increasing
their numbers, planting foreigners—French, Swiss, and
other nations — among them to instruct and encourage
them; and being no way accessory to any of their
oppressions, but relieving and redressing all their griev-
ances as often and as soon as they came to his know-
ledge; and, indeed, I could not but entertain a great
regard to the character of so just and good a prince.
But all I could infer from that was, that a government 
may be tyrannical, and yet the king not be a tyrant;
but the grievances to the people are oftentimes much
the same. And every administration, where the con-
stitution is thus stated, as it seems to be in most, if not
all of the northern courts, Protestant as well as others,
seems inconsistent with the true ends of government;
the thing we call government was certainly established
for the prosperity of the people; whereas, on the con-
trary, in all those German courts, where I have made
my observations, the magnificence of the court and the
prosperity of the people stand like the two poles; what
excess of light you see at one is exactly balanced by
so much darkness at the other.
And where, pray, is the religion of all this? that a
whole nation of people should appear miserable that
their governors may appear gay; the people starve, that
the prince may be fed; or rather, the people be lean,
that their sovereign may be fat; the subjects sigh, that
he may laugh; be empty, that he may be full; and all
this for mere luxury, not for the needful defence of the
government — resisting enemies, preserving the public
peace, and the like, but for mere extravagance, luxury,
and magnificence, as in Prussia; or for ambition, and
pushing at crowns, and the lust of domination, as in
Saxony.
But to come back to the religious transactions of
these countries: how are the ecclesiastics, jealous of
their hierarchy, afraid to reform farther lest, as they
gave a mortal stab to the perquisites and vails of God
Almighty's service in the Romish Church, modern re-
formation might give the like to them i For this reason
they set a pale about their Church, and there, as well as
in other places, they cry to their neighbours, "Stand
off, I am holier than thou;" and with what persecution
and invasion — persecuting for religion, and invading the
principles of one another. If there was any peace '
'
among them, it was that only which passes all under-
standing. It presently occurred to me, what charity
can here be where there is no peace? and what religion
where there is no charity? And I began to fear I
should find little of what I looked for in those odd
climates.
I had travelled personally through the heart of
France, where I had occasion to look round me often
enough in my route from the foot of the Pyrenean
mountains to Toulouse, from thence to Paris and
Calais. Here I found the people so merry and yet
so miserable, that I knew not where to make any judg-
ment. The poverty of the poor was so great that it
seemed to leave them no room to sigh for anything but
their burdens, or to pray for anything but bread. But
the temper of the people was so volatile, that I thought
they went always dancing to church and came singing
out of it.
I found a world of teachers here, but nobody
taught. The streets were everywhere full of priests,
and the churches full of women; but as for religion,
I found most of the clergy were so far from having
much of it, that few of them knew what it was.
Never surely was a nation so full of truly blind
guides; for nothing can be more grossly ignorant of
religion than many of their clergy are, nothing more
void of morals than many of those to whom other
people go to confess their sins.
I made some inquiry about religion; and among
the rest I happened to fall in company with a good
honest Huguenot incognito; and he told me very
honestly that the state of religion in France stood
thus: First, that for some years ago it was put to
the test by the king, and that was when the edicts
came out to banish and ruin the Huguenots; "At
which time," said he, "we thought there had been a great deal of religion in it; but really, when it came
to the push," said he, "it was hard to tell where we
should find it. The persecution, as it was thought
at first, would be ingrateful to the more religious
Roman Catholics, and that some would be found too
good to do the drudgery of the devil. But we were
mistaken; the best fell in with persecution when it was
done by other hands and not their own, and those
that would not do it acknowledged they rejoiced that
it was done; which showed," said he, "that the
Catholics either had no principle, or acted against
principle, which is much as one. And as for us
Huguenots," says he, "we have shown that we have
no religion lost among us; for, first, some run away
for their religion and yet left it behind them, and we
that stayed behind did it at the price of our principles.
For now," says he, "we are mere hypocrites, neither
Papists nor Huguenots, for we go to mass with Pro-
testant hearts; and while we call ourselves Protestants,
we bow in the house of Rimmon." —" Where, then,"
said I, "is the religion once boasted of here to be
found?" —"Indeed," said he, "it is hard to tell you,
and except a little that is in the galleys, I can give you
no good account of it." This, indeed, was confining
the remains of a flourishing church to about 350 con-
fessors, who really suffered martyrdom for it — for it
was no less. So I minuted down French religion
tugging at the oar, and would have come away.
But it came into my thought to ask him what he
meant by telling me that those who run away for their
religion out of France left most of it behind them?
He answered, I should judge of it better if I observed
them when I came into my own country; where, if
I found they lived better than other people, or showed
anything of religion suitable to a people that suffered
persecution for their profession, I should send word of it; for he had heard quite otherwise of them, which
was the reason why he and thousands of others did
not follow them.
It happened, while I was warm in my inquiries thus
after religion, a proclamation came out in London for
appointing a general thanksgiving for a great victory
obtained by the English forces and their confederates
over the French at [Ramillies]. I care not to put
names to the particular times of things.
I started at the noise when they cried it in the
streets. Ah! said I, then I have found it at last;
and I rejoiced, in particular, that having looked so
much abroad for religion I should find it out at home.
Then I began to call myself a thousand fools, that I
had not saved myself all this labour and looked at
home first; though, by-the-bye, I had done no more in
this than other travellers often or indeed generally do,
viz., go abroad to see the world and search into the
curiosities of foreign countries, and know nothing of
their own.
But to return to my observations. I was resolved
to see the ceremonies of this pious piece of work; and
as the preparations for it were prodigiously great, I
inquired how it would be; but nobody could re-
member that the like had ever been in their time before.
Every one said it would be very fine, that the queen
would be there herself, and all the nobility; and that
the like had never been seen since Queen Elizabeth's
time.
This pleased me exceedingly; and I began to form
ideas in my mind of what had been in former times
among religious nations; I could find nothing of what I
was made to expect, unless it was Solomon's dedication
of the temple, or Josiah's great feast of the reformation;
and I expected God would have a most royal tribute of
praise.

But it shocked me a little that the people said there
had never been such a thanksgiving since Queen Eliza-
beth's time. What, thought I, can be the reason of
that? and musing a little, O! says I to myself, now I
have found it; I suppose nobody gives God thanks in
our country but queens. But this looked a little harsh,
and I rummaged our histories a little for my farther
satisfaction, but could make nothing of it. At last,
talking of it to a good old cavalier, that had been a
soldier for King Charles, "Oh," says he, "I can
tell you the reason of it; they have never given
thanks," says he, "because they have had nothing to
give thanks for. Pray," says he, "when have they
had any victories in England since Queen Elizabeth's
time, except two or three in Ireland in King William's
time? and then they were so busy, had so many losses
with them abroad, that they were ashamed to give
thanks for them."
This I found had too much truth in it, however
bitter the jest of it; but still heightened my expecta-
tion, and made me look for some strange seriousness
and religious thankfulness in the appearance that was
to be on the occasion in hand; and accordingly I
secured myself a place, both without and within the
church, where I might be a witness to every part of
the devotion and joy of the people.
But my expectations were wound up to a yet greater
pitch when I saw the infinite crowds of people throng
with so much zeal, as I, like a charitable coxcomb,
thought it to be, to the place of the worship of God; and
when I considered that it was to give God thanks for
a great victory, I could think of nothing else than the
joy of the Israelites, when they landed on the banks of
the sea and saw Pharaoh's army, horses, and chariots,
swallowed up; and I doubted not I should hear some-
thing like the song of Moses and the children of Israel on the occasion, and should hear it sung with the same
elevation of soul.
But when I came to the point, the first thing I
observed was that nine parts of ten of all the company
came there only to see the queen and the show, and
the other tenth part, I think, might be said to make
the show.
When the queen came to the rails, and descended
from her coach, the people, instead of crying out
"Hosannah, blessed be the queen that cometh in the
name of the Lord," I say, the people cried "Murder"
and "Help, for God's sake," treading upon one another,
and stifling one another at such a rate, that in the rear
of the two lines or crowds of people through which the
queen passed it looked something like a battle where
the wounded were retired to die and to get surgeons
to come to them; for there lay heaps of women and
children dragged from among the feet of the crowd,
and gasping for breath. I went among some of them,
and asked them what made them go into such a crowd?
and their answer was all the same, "O sir, I had a
mind to see the queen, as the rest did."
Well, I had my answer here indeed; for in short,
the whole business of the thanksgiving without doors
was to see the queen, that was plain; so I went away
to my stand, which, for no less than three guineas, I
had secured in the church.
When I came there it was my fate to be placed be-
tween the seats where the men of God performed the
service of His praise, and sung out the anthems and the
Te Deum, which celebrated the religious triumph of
the day.
As to the men themselves, I liked their office, their
vestments, and their appearance; all looked awful and
grave enough, suitable in some respects to the solemnity
of a religious triumph; and I expected they would be as solemn in their performances as the Levites that blew
the trumpets at Solomon's feast, when all the people
shouted and praised God.
But I observed these grave people, in the intervals
of their worshipping God, when it was not their turn
to sing, or read, or pray, bestowed some of the rest of
their time in taking snuff, adjusting their perukes, looking
about at the fair ladies, whispering, and that not very
softly neither, to one another, about this fine lady, that
pretty woman, this fine duchess, and that great fortune,
and not without some indecencies, as well of words as
of gestures. Well, says I, you are none of the people
I look for; where are they that give God thanks?
Immediately the organ struck up for the Te Deum, up
starts all my gentlemen, as if inspired from above, and
from their talking together, not over-modestly, fall to
praising God with the utmost precipitation, singing
the heavenly anthems with all the grace and music
imaginable.
In the middle of all this music and these exalted
things, when I thought my soul elevated with Divine
melody, and began to be reconciled to all the rest, I
saw a little rustling motion among the people, as if they
had been disturbed or frighted. Some said it thundered,
some said the church shook; the true business was, the
Te Deum within was answered without by the thunder
of a hundred pieces of cannon and the noise of drums,
with the huzzas and shouts of great crowds of people in
the streets. This I did not understand, so it did neither
disturb nor concern me; I found indeed no great
harmony in it; it bore no consort in the music, at least
as I understood it; but it was over pretty soon, and so
we went on.
When the anthem was sung, and the other services
succeeded them, I, that had been a little disturbed
with the lucid intervals of the choristers and the III. K
gentlemen that sat crowded in with them, turned my
eyes to other places, in hopes I should find some
saints among the crowd, whose souls were taken up
with the exalted raptures of the day.
But, alas! it was all one, the ladies were busy
singling out the men and the men the ladies. The
star and garter of a fine young nobleman — beautiful
in person, rich in habit, and sparkling in jewels, his
blue ribbon intimating his character — drew the eyes
of so many women off their prayer-books, that I think
his grace ought to have been spoken to by the vergers
to have withdrawn out of the church, that he might
not injure the service, and rob God Almighty of the
homage of the day.
As for the queen, her majesty was the star of the
day, and infinitely more eyes were directed to her than
were lifted up to heaven, though the last was the
business of the whole procession.
Well, said I, this is mighty fine, that's true; but
where's the religion of all this? Heavens bless me,
said I, out of this crowd, and I'll never mock God
any more here when the queen comes again. Cannot
these people go and see the queen where the queen is
to be seen, but must they come hither to profane the
church with her, and make the queen an idol? And
in a great passion I was, both at the people and at the
manner of the day, as you may easily see by what
follows.
N.B.—I had made some other satirical reflections
upon the conduct of the day; but as it looks too near
home, I am not willing that poor Robinson Crusoe
should disoblige anybody.
I confess, the close of the day was still more extra-
vagant; for there the thanksgiving was adjourned
from the church to the tavern, and to the street; and 
instead of the decency of a religious triumph, there was
indeed a triumph of religious indecency; and the
anthems, Te Deum, and thanksgiving of the day ended
in the drunkenness, the bonfires, and the squibs and
crackers of the street.
How far religion is concerned in all this, or whether
God Almighty will accept of these noisy doings for
thanksgivings, that I have nothing to do with; let
those people consider of it that are concerned in it.
Of Differences in Religion.
'Tis known alone to the Divine Wisdom why He
has been pleased to suffer any part of religion, and the
adoration paid to His majesty, the supplications made
to Him, and the homage which His creatures owe to
His glorious being, to be so doubtfully directed, or so
differently understood by His creatures, as that there
should be any mistakes or disagreements about them.
How comes it to pass, that the paying a reverence
to the name and being of God should not be as in-
capable of being disputed in the manner of it as in the
thing itself? That all the rules of worshipping, believ-
ing in, and serving the great God of heaven and earth,
should be capable of being understood any more than
one way? And that the infallible Spirit of God, who
is our guide to heaven, should leave any one of its
dictates in a state of being misunderstood?
Why have not the rules of religion, as well those of
doctrine as of life, been laid down in terms so plain,
and so impossible to be mistaken, that all men in the
world, in every age, should have the same notions of
them, and understand them, in every tittle of them,
exactly alike? Then as heaven is but one blessed
great port, at which all hope to arrive, there would
have been but one road to travel the journey in; all men would have gone the same way, steered the same
course; and brethren would no more have fallen out by
the way.
God alone, for wise and righteous reasons, because
He can do nothing but what is wise and righteous, has
otherwise ordered it, and that is all we can say of it;
as to the reason and justice of it, that is a thing of
which, like as of the times and of the seasons, we may
say, knoweth no man.
In the state of uncertainty we are now in, so it is;
two men, believing in the same God, holding the same
faith, the same Saviour, the same doctrine, and aiming
at the same heaven, yet cannot agree to go to that
heaven, or worship that God, or believe in that
Saviour, the same way, or after the same manner;
nay, they cannot know, or conceive of God, or of
heaven, or of the Redeemer, or indeed of any one
principle of the Christian religion, in the same manner,
or form the same ideas of those things in their minds.
It is true, the different capacities and faculties of
men are in part a reason for this, by which it is
occasioned, that scarce two men together have the
same notions and apprehensions even of one and the
same thing, because their understandings are led by
different guides, and they see by different lights.
But this is not all; they are not alike honest to the
light they have. Three men read the same doctrinal
article, say it be of the Trinity, or of any other, and
they all examine the foundation of it in the Scripture; one
thinks verily he has found out the mystery effectually,
goes on with his inquiries, and brings every Scripture
and every passage to correspond exactly with his first
notion, and thus he confirms himself immovably in his
opinion; and it is so clear to him, that he can not
only never be argued out of it, but can entertain no
good opinion of any man that conceives of it in any 
other way, but takes him for an enemy to the orthodox
doctrine, and that he merits to be expelled out of
Christ's Church, denied the Christian communion, and,
in short, treats him with no respect, no, nor thinks of
him with charity.
Another comes to the same Scripture, and in quest
of the same doctrine, and he reads over the same texts,
and receives notions from them directly opposite to
the other, or, at least, very remote from them; he
follows in his search through all the corroborating texts
and is confirmed in his first opinion from them all; he
grows as immovable in his received construction of
the Scripture as the other, and all is so clear to him,
that he not only can never be argued out of his opinion,
but can entertain no good opinion of any man that
conceives of it any other way, but takes him for an
enemy to the orthodox doctrine.
The third man, he reads over all the same texts
of Scripture, but doing it with an indifferency as to the
substance, and whether he receives right information
or no, truly he comes away with a calmness of mind as
to the substance; and as he went with no great concern
about being certain, so he comes back as uncertain as
he went. These three men are enough to fill the whole world
full of disputes about religion. The first two meet,
and being equally positive of their being infallibly
guided, equally warm in defending their opinions, and
equally tenacious of them, and above all, equally void
of charity to the other, truly they fall out, part, condemn,
censure, revile, and as opportunity and power offers,
at last persecute one another, and all one another's
adherents. The third, half informed, indifferent man, he comes
in between these two, laughs at them both, says they
are a parcel of furious Christians, that the thing is not absolutely necessary to be known, that it is no article
of faith, so as that without deciding it a man cannot be
saved; says they are a parcel of fools to fall out thus
about what they cannot be certain of, and which they
may go to heaven though they should not understand
it till they come there; and thus the world comes to
be divided. Could they differ with humility, they would differ
with charity, but it is not to be in religion, whatever
it may be in civil or politic affairs; for there is a
thing called zeal, which men call a grace in religion,
and esteem a duty, and this makes men fall out
in religious matters with a more fatal warmth and
more animosity than in other cases, according to
Hudibras—
Zeal makes men fight, like mad or drunk,
For Dame Religion as for punk.
Nor is this the fate only of the Christian religion,
though 'tis more so there than in any other, but 'tis
the same in other cases, as between the Persians
and the Turks about the successors of their prophet
Mahomet. It was so of old between the heathen and
the Jews; and the Assyrian monarch prepared a fiery
furnace for those that would not fall down and worship
the great image that he had set up.
In the primitive times of God's Church, the heathen
did the like by the Christians, and Christianas ad hones
was the common cry; but when the Church came to
its halcyon days, Constantine the Great gave peace to
the Christians, and it was but a little while that they
enjoyed that peace before they fell out by the way.
The Arian heresies rose up, and differing opinions rent
the State into factions, the Church into schisms, and
in the space of two reigns the Arians persecuted the
orthodox, and the orthodox the Arians, almost with the same fury as the heathen had persecuted them both
with before.
From thence to our time persecution has been the
practice even of all parties, as they have been clothed
with power, and as their differences have moved them;
for example, in all the Christian countries, there is a
mortal feud between Popish and the Protestant; and
though,indeed, the former have carried their zeal farthest,
yet the latter have not been able to say they have not
persecuted in their turn, though not with fire and faggot.
What wars and bloodshed molested Europe on the
account of religion in Germany! Especially till the
general pacification of those troubles at the treaty of
Westphalia, when the Protestants, having had the
apparent advantage of the war, obtained the everlasting
settlement of their religion as well as liberties through
the whole empire.
Since those times, what persecution, in the same
country, between the Lutheran and Calvinist churches,
and how little charity is among them, insomuch that
the Lutherans to this day will not allow the Reformed
Evangelic churches, so the Calvinists are called, liberty
to assemble for worship within the gates of their cities,
or give them Christian burial.
I avoid looking too near home, or searching in
Scotland and England, among the unhappy divisions of
Episcopal and Presbyterian, Church of England and
Dissenter, and this I do because it is at home; but it
is too evident that all these come either from men's
being negligent of right informations, or too tenacious
when they have it; for it is evident, if all men would
be honest to the light they have, and favourable to
their neighbours, we might hope that, how many several
ways soever we chose to walk towards heaven, we should
all meet there at last. I look upon all the seeds of religious dissension as '
r
tares sowed by the devil among the wheat; and it
may be observed, that though, as I have already said,
the Assyrians persecuted the Jews, and the Romans
the Christians, yet where the devil is immediately and
personally worshipped, there we meet with little or no
persecution; for Satan, having a kind of peaceable
dominion there, offers them no disturbance; he desires
no innovation for ever; he finds the sweetness of it,
and lets it all alone.
But if once they talk of other gods before him, he
is far less easy; there he is continually sowing strife
and hatching divisions among them, for, like all other
monarchs, the devil loves to reign alone.
It would be too long a task here to reckon up the
several sorts of differences in religion even among us
in England, where, if two happen to differ, presently,
like St. Paul to St. Peter, they withstand one another to
the face; that is to say, carry on the dispute to the
utmost extremity.
But there is another question before me, and that is
not only why there are such differences on the point
of religion, and why are religious differences hotter
and more irreconcilable than other breaches, but why
are there more differences of this kind among us than
among any other nation in the world?
Certainly this pushing on our religious broils to the
extremity is the peculiar of this country of England,
and is not the same thing in other places; and the
variety is such here, that 'tis said there are more
several communions or communities of religious kinds
in England than in all the other Protestant countries
in the world.
The best and most charitable answer that I can
think of to give for this is to compliment ourselves,
and say, 'tis because we are the most religious nation
in the world; that is to say, that we in general set more seriously to work to inquire into the substance
and nature of religion; to examine principles, and
weigh the reasons of things, than other people, being
more concerned for and anxious about the affairs of
God, of heaven, and our souls; that thinking, as we
ought to do, that religion is of the utmost concern
to us, and that it is of the last moment to us to be
certain about it and well-grounded in the points before
us, particularly whether we are rightly informed or
not. This anxious concern makes us jealous of every
opinion and tenacious of our own, breaks much in
upon the custom of submitting our judgments to the
clergy, as is the case in countries where people are
more indifferent in their search after these things,
and more unconcerned in the certainty or uncertainty
of them.
I must acknowledge that I think the true and the
only just reason that can be given for this matter, is
not that we are more furious than other people, more
censorious and rash in our judgment, that we have less
charity, or less patience, in debating religious points
than other people; but the truth is, that we have less
indifference about them, and cannot sit down contented
with a slight and overly inquiry, or a cursory or school
answer to the doubts in question; but we make it a
thing of absolute necessity to be fully informed of, and
therefore, are earnest in the inquiry, and knowing the
Scripture to be the great rule of faith, the standard for
life and doctrine, we fly thither and search for our-
selves, not having Popery enough to expect an infallible
judge, not indifference enough to acquiesce in the judg-
ment of the clergy, and perhaps a little too tenacious of
our own interpretation even in things we are uninstructed about.
This, indeed, I take to be the true reason why
religious disputes increase so much here, and why there are such separations and schisms among us, more than
there are in any other nation in the world.
I know much of it is laid to the door of the con-
fusions they were all in here during the bloody intestine
wars in the years 1640 to 1656, and the liberty given
to all opinions to set up themselves at that time; but
I waive that as a question that tends to more division.
I believe the reason I have given for it stands as well
grounded, and as likely to be approved, as any I can
give, or as any that has been given in this case.
There is another difficult question which still remains
before us, and that is, what remedy can we apply to
this malady? And first, I must answer negatively, not to
have us be less religious, that we might differ less about
it, but to have us exercise more charity in our disputes,
that we might differ more like men of temper, and more
like Christians than we do. This is striking at the
root of religious differences; for if they were carried
on mildly, with a peaceable spirit, willing to be in-
formed, a disposition to love as brethren, though in
everything not like-minded — our variety of opinions
would not then have the name of differences, we should
not separate in communion and in charity, though we
did not agree in everything we were to believe or not
to believe about religion.
It is hard that we should say these differences are the
consequences of a nation having more religion than their
neighbours, since we have still this one part too little;
and as I suppose us to have more religion, I must be
obliged to grant we have not enough more; for if, as
we have just so much more religion as is sufficient to
make us quarrelsome in religious disputes, we had yet
as much more as were sufficient to make us peaceable
again after it, then we should be religious to purpose.
So that, in a word, our being so religious as above
is only an unhappy middle composition between the inquiring and fully-informed Christian on one hand, and
the careless, indifferent, unconcerned temper that takes
up with anything on the other hand. And this I take
to be a just though short account of our differences in
England about religion.
It might be a very useful question to start here,
namely, where will all our unhappy differences end?
I, that am not willing to give the worst-natured
answer, where the best and kindest will hold water, am
for the present disposed to answer in general, rather
than descend to particulars, viz., in heaven. There
all our unkind, unchristian, unneighbourly, unbrotherly
differences will end. We shall freely shake hands
there with many a pardoned sinner that here we bid
stand off; embrace many a publican that here we think
it a dishonour to converse with; see many a heart that
we have broken here, with censures, reproachings, and
revilings, made whole again by the balm of the same
Redeemer's blood.
There we shall see that there have been other flocks
than those of our fold, other paths to heaven than those
we shut men out from; that those we have excom-
municated have been taken into that superior com-
munion; and those we have placed at our left hand
have been there summoned to the right hand; all sepa-
rations will be there taken away, and the mind of every
Christian be entirely reconciled to one another; no
divisions, no differences, no charging sincere minds
with hypocrisy, or embracing painted hypocrites for
saints; everything to be seen and to be known as it
really is, and by a clear light; none will desire to
deceive, none be subject to be deceived.
There we shall look upon all we have done and
said in prejudice of the character of our brethren with
a just change, and sufficiently repair to one another all
the injurious things we have said, or indeed but thought;
of one another, by rejoicing in the common felicity and
praising the Sovereign Glory that had received those
we had foolishly rejected, and let those into the same
heaven whom we had, in the abundance of our pride
and the penury of our charity, shut out.
How many actions of men which we, seeing only
their outside, have now censured, shall we find there by
that penetration that cannot err, be accepted for their
inside sincerity? How many an opinion that we con-
demn here shall we see then to be orthodox? In a
word, how many contradicting notions and principles
which we thought inconsistent with true religion shall
we find then to be reconcilable to themselves, to one
another, and to the fountain of truth?
All the difficulties in our conceptions of things invi-
sible will then be explained; all the doctrines of the
immutability of the Divine counsels will then be recon-
cilable to the changeable events of things, and to the
varieties often happening in the world. The unchangeableness of the Eternal decrees will then appear; and
yet the efficacy of praying to God to do this, or not do
that, to pardon, forgive, spare, and forbear, which we
now say is inconsistent with those unchangeable decrees,
shall be reconcilable to that unchangeableness in a
manner to us now inconceivable.
And this is the foundation of what I now advance,
viz., that in heaven all our differences in religion will
be reconciled, and will be at an end. If any man ask
me whether they cannot be ended before, I answer, if
we were all thoroughly convinced that they would be
reconciled then, we should certainly put an end to them
before; but it is impossible to be done. Men's con-
victions of the greatest and most certain truths are not
equal to one another, or equal to the weight and significancy of those truths; and therefore such a general effect
of this affair cannot be expected on this side of time.

There is one very great reconciler of religious differ-
ences in this world, which has sometimes been made
use of by Providence to heal the breaches in Christian
charity among religious people, and it is, generally
speaking, very effectual; but it is a bitter draught, a
potion that goes down with great reluctance, and that
is persecution. This generally reconciles the differ-
ences of Christians about the lesser matters in re-
ligion. The primitive churches, while under the
Roman persecutions, had a much greater harmony
among themselves, and very few schisms and divisions
broke out among them. When they did differ in any
particular points, they wrote healing epistles to one
another, contended with modesty and with charity, and
referred willingly their notions to be decided by one
another. They did not separate communion, and ex-
communicate whole churches and nations, for a dispute
about the celebration of Easter, or unchurch one
another for the question of receiving and rebaptizing
of penitents, as was afterwards the case. The furnace
of affliction burnt up all that dross, the fury of their
persecutors kept their minds humble, their zeal for re-
ligion hot, and their affection for and charity to one
another increased as their liberty and their number were
lessened.
Thus Bishop Ridley and Bishop Hooper, the first a
rigid Church of England bishop, the other almost a
Presbyterian, or at least a Calvinist, like Peter and
Paul, differed hotly, and withstood one another to the
face in the very beginning of the Reformation; but
when they came to burn for their religion, fire and
faggot showed them the reconcilableness of all their
disputes, convinced them that it was possible for both
to hold fast the truth in sincerity and yet entertain
differing notions of the rites and outsides of the Divine
economy, and at the stake they ended all their dis-
putes, wrote healing letters to one another, and became
fellow-martyrs and confessors for that very profes-
sion which was so intermixed with censure and dislike
before.
And let all that think of this remedy remember that
whenever these quarrelsome Christians come, by perse-
cution or any other incident, to be thus reconciled in
their charity, they find always a great deal to ask
pardon of one another for with respect to what is past;
all their violence, heat of zeal, and much more heat of
passion, all their breach of charity, their reproaches and
censures and hard words, which have passed between
them, will only then serve to bring them together with
more affection, and to embrace more warmly; for,
depend upon it, all the differences in religion among
good men (for I do not mean essential, doctrinal, and
fundamental differences), serve only to make them all
ashamed of themselves at last.
Of the wonderful Excellency of Negative Religion and
Negative Virtue.
Negative virtue sets out like the Pharisee with "God,
I thank thee;" it is a piece of religious pageantry, a
jointed baby dressed up gay, but, stripped of its gewgaws,
it appears a naked lump, fit only to please children and
deceive fools. 'Tis the hope of the hypocrite, it is
a cheat upon the neighbourhood, a dress for without
doors, for 'tis of no use within; 'tis a mask put on for
a character, and as generally it is used to cheat others,
'tis so ignorantly embraced that we cheat even our-
selves with it.
In a word, negative virtue is positive vice, at least
when it is made use of in any of the two last cases;namely, either as a mask to deceive others, or as a mist
to deceive ourselves. If a man were to look back upon it to see in what part he could take up his nest, or lay
a foundation of hope for the satisfaction of his mind as
to future things, he would find it the most uncomfort-
able condition to go out of the world with that any
man in the world can think.
The reason is plain; compare it with the publican,
whom such a man despises. "Here is my landlord a
drunkard, one of my tenants is a thief, such a poor
man is a swearer, such a rich man a blasphemer, such
a tradesman is a cheat, such a justice of the peace is
an atheist, such a rakish fellow is turned highwayman,
such a beau is debauched; but I — I that am clothed in
negatives, and walk in the light of my own vanity — I
live a sober, regular, retired life, I am an honest man;
I defraud nobody; no man ever heard me swear, or an
ill word come out of my mouth; I never talk irreli-
giously or profanely, and I am never missed out of my
seat at church. God, I thank thee! I am not de-
bauched, I am no highwayman, no murderer," &c.
Now, what is the difference of all these? I must con-
fess, speaking of all these together, and of what is usually
the end of them, I think a man had better be any of
them, nay, almost all of them together, than the man
himself, and my reason is in a few words as follows.
All these know themselves to be wicked persons;
conscience, though for a time oppressed and kept under,
yet upon all occasions tells them plainly what their con-
dition is, and oftentimes they repent. 'Tis true, some-
times they do not; God is pleased sometimes to treat
them in the vindictive attribute, and they are cut off in
their crimes, insensible and stupid, without a space or a
heart to repent; and therefore let none take hope in
their profligate living from what I am going to say.
Again, others, though they do repent, and God is
pleased to give them the grace to return to Him as
penitents, come to it very late, and sometimes under a severe hand, as perhaps on a deathbed, or under some
disaster, and oftentimes at the gallows.
But still, I say, those men, though they sin, they do
it as a crime, and when they come to be told of it often
they are brought to repent. But the negative Chris-
tian I speak of is so full of himself, so persuaded that
he is good enough, and religious enough already, that
he has no thoughts of anything unless it be to pull off
his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank Him
that he has no need of Him. This is the opiate that
doses his soul even to the last gasp; and it is ten thou-
sand to one but the lethargic dream shoots him through
the gulf at once, and he never opens his eyes till he
arrives in that light where all things are naked and
open; where he sees too late that he has been a cheat
to himself, and has been hurried by his own pride in a
cloud of negatives into a state of positive destruction
without remedy.
I am reading no particular man's fate; God forbid!
I restrain it to no circumstances, I point out no per-
sons; it is too solemn a thing to make it a satire; 'tis
the state, not the man, I speak of. Let the guilty apply
it to themselves, and the proud good man humble him-
self and avoid it.
I have observed that many fall into this case by the
excessive vanity of being thought well of by their
neighbours, obtaining a character, &c. It is a delusion
very fatal to many; a good name is indeed a precious
ointment, and in some cases is better than life. But
with your pardon, Mr. Negative, it must be a good
name for good deeds, or otherwise a good name upon a
bad life is a painted whore, that has a gay countenance
upon a rotten, diseased, corrupted carcass.
Much to be preferred is the general slander of a
prejudiced age and a state of universal calumny, where
the mind is free from the guilt they charge. Such a man, though the world spits upon and despises him,
looks in with comfort, and looks up with hope.
-Hie murus aeneus esto,
Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa. —Horace.
General contempt, universal reproach, is a life that
requires a world of courage and steadiness of mind to
support; but be this my portion in this world, with a
heart that does not reproach me with the guilt, much
rather than to be a man of negatives only, and who all
the world caresses with their good wishes and good
opinion, but is himself empty of real virtue, a hypocrite
at bottom, a cheat, and under the delusion of it; whose
portion is with hypocrites, and who can neither look in,
or look up, with pleasure, but must look without him-
self, for all that can be called good, either by others or
by himself.
As at the great and last day the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed, so I am persuaded the opinion we
have of one another here, will be one of the things which
will be there, and perhaps not till then fully rectified;
and we shall be there thoroughly enlightened, we shall
find room to see that we have been much mistaken in
our notions of virtue and vice, religion and irreligion,
in the characters of our neighbours. And I am per-
suaded we shall see many of our acquaintances placed
at the right hand of a righteous Judge, whose characters
we have oppressed with slanders, and who we have
censoriously placed at His left hand here; and many a
painted hypocrite, who has insulted his neighbour with,
"Stand off, I am holier than thou," or whom he has
turned from with disdain, and with a "This publican!"
placed at the left hand, who we made no doubt we
should have seen at the right hand in triumph.
This is a support to the mind of a good man, even
when his enemies, as David says, "gnash upon him III. L
with their teeth, and have him in derision," that is to
say, when he is run down by universal clamour, and
damned by the tongues of men, even for this world and
another.
Happy the man, who with exalted soul,
Knows how to rate the great, the prosp'rous fool,
Who can the insults of the street contemn,
And values not the rage or tongues of men.
He, like the sun, exists on his own flame,
And, when he dies, is to himself a fame.
But take this with you as you go, that as negative
praise will build no man comfort, so negative virtue
will not support the mind under universal contempt.
Scandal is much worse than slander; for the first is
founded upon real guilt, the other attacks innocence.
Nothing is a scandal, but what is true; nothing is a
slander, but what is false.
He that fortifies himself against reproach, must do
it with a certain reserve of real and solid virtue and
piety; it must be uprightness and integrity that must
preserve him; nothing but a fund of what is good can
support the mind under the reproach of being all that
is bad; I do not mean neither that the man must be
perfect, have no follies or failings, have made no ex-
cursions, have nothing to be laid to the charge of his
character; for where then shall the man be found I
am speaking of? And I may be said to be describing
the black swan, a person that is not, and never was to
be found; but the right way of judging men, and the
way which alone can be just, is to judge of them by
their general conduct; and so a man may in his own
mind justly denominate himself: as every good action
does not denominate me to be a good man, so neither
does every failing, every folly, no, nor every scanda-
lous action, denominate me a hypocrite, or a wicked
man; otherwise some of the most eminent saints in 
Scripture, and of every age since the Scripture was
written, are gone to the devil; and 'twill be hard to
say there was ever a good man in the world.
But I return to my subject, the negative good man;
and let me examine him a little in his just character,
in his conduct, public and private. He is no drun-
kard, but is intoxicated with the pride of his own
worth; he is a good neighbour, a common arbitrator
and peacemaker in other families, but a cursed tyrant
in his own; he appears in a public place of worship
for a show, but never enters into his closet and shuts
the door about him, to pray to Him that sees in secret;
he is covered with the vainglorious and ostentatious
part of charity, but does all his alms before men, to be
seen of them; he is mighty eager in the duties of the
second table, but regardless of the first; appearingly
religious to be seen and taken notice of by men; but
between God and his own soul no intercourse, no com-
munication. What is this man? and what comfort is
there of the life he lives? He knows little, or perhaps
nothing, of faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified
life; in a word, he is a man perfect in the circum-
stances of religion, and perfectly a stranger to the
essential part of religion.
Take this man's conversation apart, enter into the
private and retired part of it, what notions has he of
misspent hours, and of the natural reflux of all our
minutes, on to the great centre and gulf of life, eter-
nity? Does he know how to put a right value upon
time? Does he esteem it the life-blood of his soul,
as it really is, and act in all the moments of it, as one
that must account for them? Alas! this is of no
weight with such a man; he is too full of himself to
enter into any notions about an account, either for mis-
spent time, or anything else misdone; but persuading
himself that he never did anything amiss, entertains no r
notion of judgment to come, eternity, or anything
in it.
What room has a man to expiate, in his thoughts
upon so immense and inconceivable a subject as that of
eternal duration, whose thoughts are all taken up, and
swelled top-full with his own extraordinary self? It
would be impossible for any man in the world to enter-
tain one proud thought of himself, if he had but one
right idea of a future state. Could such a man think
that anything in him, or anything he could do, could
purchase for him a felicity that was to last to eternity?
What! that a man should be capable in one moment
(for life is not that in length compared to eternity) to
do anything for which he should deserve to be made
happy to eternity?
If, then, you can form no equality between what he
can do and what he shall receive, less can it be founded
upon his negative virtue, or what he has forborne to do;
and if neither his negative nor his positive piety can be
equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is
to last for, what then is become of the Pharisee? he
must think no more of himself, for all his boasts;
neither of his negatives nor his positives, but of a rich
unbounded grace, that rewards according to itself, not
according to what we can do; and that to be judged
at the last day according to our works, if literally
understood, would be to be undone; but we are to
be judged by the sincerity of our repentance, to be
rewarded according to the infinite grace of God, and
purchase of Christ, with a state of blessedness to an
endless eternity.
Indeed this eternity is not a meditation suitable to
the man I am talking of; 'tis a sublime thought, which
his bloated imagination has never descended to or
engaged in; and when it comes he is like to have as
little comfort of it as he has had thought about it.

This thought of eternity raises new ideas in my mind,
and I cannot go forward without a digression upon so
important a subject; if the reader approves the thought,
he will not quarrel about its being a digression.
ETERNITY
Hail! mighty circle, unconceived abyss.
Centre of worlds to come, and grave of this;
Great gulf of Nature, in whose mighty womb,
Lies all that thing called Past, that nothing called To come.
Ever and never, both begun in thee,
The weak description of eternity,
Mere sounds which only can thy being confess;
For how should finite words thee infinite express?
Thou art duration's modern name,
To be, or to have been, in thee are all the same.
Thy circle holds the pre-existent state
Of all that's early, or that shall be late.
Thou know'st no past or future; all in thee,
Make up one point, Eternity:
And, if things mortal measure things sublime,
Are all one great ubiquity of time.
To end, begin, be born, and die,
The accidents of time and life,
Are nonsense in thy speech, Eternity
Swallows them all, in thee they end their strife.
In thee the ends of Nature form one line,
And generation with corruption join.
Ages of life describe thy state in vain,
Even death itself, in thee, lives o'er again.
Thy radiant, bright, unfaded face,
Shines over universal space.
All limits from thy vast extent must flee,
Old everlasting's but a point to thee,
Ten everlastings make not one Eternity.
To thee things past exist as things that are;
And things to come, as if they were;
Thou wast the first great when, while there was yet no where.
Even time itself's a little ball of space,
Borrowing a flame from thy illustrious face,
Which, wheeling round, in its own circle burns,
Rolls out from thy first spring, and into thee returns.
r
What we have been, and what we are,
The present and the time that's past, We can resolve to nothing here,
But what we are to be in thee at last.
Deeds soon shall die, however nobly done,
And thoughts of men, like as themselves decay;
But time when to eternity roll'd on,
Shall never, never, never waste away.
Years, ages, months, weeks, days, and hours
Wear out, and words to number them shall fail,
One endless all the wild account devours,
And thy vast unit casts up all the tale.
Numbers as far as numbers run
Are all in thy account but one,
Or rather are thy reck'ning just begun.
Thou art the life of immortality,
When time itself drowns and expires in thee.
All the great actions of aspiring men,
By which they build that trifling thing called fame,
In thy embrace lose all their where and when, Reserving not so much as a mere empty name.
How vain are sorrows of a human state,
Why mourn th' afflicted at their fate?
One point, one moment's longer far
Than all their days of sorrow shall appear,
When wrapt in wonders we shall see,
And measure their extent by thee.
In vain are glorious monuments of fame,
Which fools erect t'immortalise a name,
Not half a moment when compared with thee,
Lives all their fancied immortality.
Start back, my soul! and with some horror view,
If with these eyes thou can'st look through,
Inquire what gives the pain of loss a sting,
Even hell itself's a hell, in no one other thing. Then with a brightness on thy face,
An emanation from that glorious place,
A joy which no dark cloud can overcast,
And which Eternity itself cannot outlast,
Reflect, my soul I Duration dwells on high,
And heaven itselfs made heaven, by blest Eternity.

But to the purpose in hand, for I have not done with
this man of negatives yet. And now let us bring him
more nearly and seriously to a converse with the in-
visible world. He looks into it with horror and dread-
ful apprehensions, as Felix, when St. Paul reasoned of
temperance, righteousness, and of judgment to come.
Felix was a moral heathen, that is to say, a man of
negatives, like him I am speaking of. What was then
the case? He trembled. Pray, what is it reasonable
to think Felix trembled at? If I may give my opinion,
who am but a very mean expositor of texts, it was this
or something like it. Felix was a philosopher as well as a man of power;
and by his wisdom, as also by his reverence of the
gods, which at that time was the sum of religion,
had been a man of morals, a man that had practised
temperance and righteousness, as the life which was
unquestionably to be rewarded by the powers above
with an Elysian felicity, that is to say, according to
the Roman maxim, that the gods were the rewarders
of virtue.
But when the blessed Apostle came to reason with
Felix how unlikely it was that these negatives should
purchase our happiness hereafter, he showed him that
the gods could not be in debt to us for the practice
of virtue, which was indeed no more than living most
suitable to our reason; that a life of virtue and temper-
ance was its own reward, by giving a healthy body, a
clear head, a composed life, &c., fitting the man for
all other worldly enjoyments adequate to his reason and
his present felicity as a man. But eternal happiness
must come from another spring, namely, from the
infinite, unbounded grace of a provoked God, who
having erected a righteous tribunal, where every heart
should be searched, and where every tongue would
confess itself guilty, and stand self-condemned. Jesus 
Christ, whom Paul preached, would separate such as
by faith and repentance He had brought home and
united to Himself by the grace of adoption, and on
the foot of His having laid down His life a ransom for
them, had appointed them to salvation.
When poor negative Felix heard of this, and that
all his philosophy, his temperance, and righteousness,
if it had been ten thousand times as great, would weigh
nothing and plead nothing for him at that judicature,
and that he began to see the justice and reason of this,
for Paul reasoned him into it; I say, when he saw
this, he trembled indeed, as well he might, and as all
negative people will.
What a strange idea must that Pharisee have of God,
who went up with the publican to the temple to pray.
'Tis observable he went with a good stock of assurance
in his face that could come to the altar as he did, not
to offer any sacrifice; we do not find he carried any
offering, or bespoke the priest to make any atonement;
he wanted no priests to make any confession to. Good
man, as he thought he was, he had no sins to confess;
he rather came up to the altar to even accounts with
heaven, and like the other man in the Gospel, tell God
that he had fulfilled the whole law, and had done
all those things that were commanded, even from his
youth; so, as before, he only pulled off his hat to his
God, and let Him know that there was nothing between
them at present, and away he goes about his business.
But the poor wretch whom he despised, and whom
he had left behind him, for he durst come no further,
acted quite another part. He had at first, indeed, in
sense of his duty, resolved to go up to the temple;
but when he saw the splendour and majesty of God
represented by the glory of that elevated building, I say,
when he saw that, though a great way off, and then
looked into his own heart, all his negative confidences failing him, and a sense of miserable circumstances
coming upon him, he stops short, and with a blow of
reflection, and perfectly unmixed with any of the
Pharisee's pride, he looks down in humility, but lifts up
his heart in a penitential faith, with a "Lord, be merci-
ful to me a sinner."
Here was faith, repentance, duty, and confession, all
conjoined in one act, and the man's work was done
at once, he went away justified. When the negative
Pharisee went home, the self-same vain wretch that he
came out, with "God, I thank thee," in his mouth,
and a mass of pride in his heart, that nothing could
convince.
In what glorious colours do the Scriptures upon all
occasions represent those two hand-in-hand graces,
faith and repentance! There is not one mention of
faith in the whole Scripture but what is recommending
some way or other to our admiration and to our prac-
tice; 'tis the foundation and the top-stone of all religion,
the right hand to lead and the left hand to support, in
the whole journey of a Christian, even through this
world and into the next. In a word, 'tis the sum and
substance of the Gospel foundation.
Religion seems to have been founded upon three
establishments in the world, in all which the terms of
life are laid down at the end of our acceptance of it.
The first establishment was with Adam in Paradise;
the terms of which were, "Forbear and live." The second establishment was with the children of
Israel, in the giving of the Law; the terms of which
were, "Do and live."
The third establishment is that of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ; the terms of which are, "Believe and
live."
So that, in a word, faith is the substance and
fulfilling of Gospel religion, the plan of righteousness,
and the great efficient of eternal life. Let me break
out here upon this glorious subject, and pardon the
excursion, I entreat you.
FAITH
Hail! mystic, realising vision, hail!
Heaven's duplicate, eternity's entail;
God's representative to hand us on,
And for us claim a station near His throne.
Not the eternal battlements of brass,
Gates, a whole hell of devils could never pass;
Not angels, not the bright seraphic train,
Which drove out Adam from the sacred plain;
Not all the flaming swords Heaven ever drew,
Shall shut thee out, or intercept thy view.
Boldly thou scal'st the adamantine wall,
Where heaps of fainting suppliants fall,
Where doubt has thousands and ten thousands slain,
And hypocrites knock hard in vain.
Soaring above the dark abyss of fear,
Quite out of sight, behind thou leav'st despair,
Who fainting, and unable to keep pace,
Gives up the prize, gives out the race,
Faints by the way, and fainting cries,
I can't, and so for fear of dying, dies.
While thou, on air of hope, fanning thy wings, With gentle gales of joy, from whence assurance springs,
Mount'st on, and passing all th' aethereal bounds.
Thy head with beatific rapture crowns.
Great pilot of the soul, who goes before
The dangers of the dreadful voyage t' explore,
Enters the very place, and when 'tis there,
Sends back expresses to support us here,
Negotiates peace, gains the great pledge of love,
And gets it ratified above.
With awful confidence at Heaven's high throne,
It rather humbly claims than merely prays.
Pleads, promises, and calls them all its own,
And trusts to have, even then, when Heaven denies.
ay, )
a,' },
>bey.)
On earth what wonders has it wrought!Rather what wonders has it not?It has parted rivers, dried up seas. Made hills of those, and walls of these,
And if to this great mountain it should say,
"Move off, O hill, and roll to yonder sea,"
The sea and mountain, too, must both obey.
If towards heaven it looks, 'tis ne'er in vain,
From thence 't has brought down fire, 't has brought down
rain,
And thither it ascends in flame again.
Its influence is so vigorous and intense,
It pierces all the negatives of sense.
Things quite invisible to sight it sees,
Things difficult performs with ease:
Things imperceptible to us it knows,
Things utterly impossible it does:
Things unintelligible it understands,
Things high (superior to itself) commands,
Things in themselves unnatural reconciles,
Weakness to strength, and to its sorrows smiles,
Hopes against hope, and in despair's resigned,
And spite of storms without, it calms the mind.
Say, unborn lamp, what feeds thy flame,
In all varieties the same?What wonder-working hand thy power supplies?
Nature and reason's just surprise.
Nature and reason join thee hand in hand, And to thy just dominion stoop the mind:But neither can thy workings understand, And in thy swifter pace thou leav'st them both behind.
'Twas from thy motion fortified by thee,
Peter asked leave to walk upon the sea,
When his great Lord said, "Come," and Faith said, "Go,"
What heart could fear? What coward tongue say, no?Boldly he stept upon the flowing wave, And might have marched through fire or through the grave, >
While He stood by who had the power to save. j
But soon as Peter lost his hold of thee,
He sunk like lead into the sea.
All thy magnetic power disperst and gone,
The heavenly charm was broke, and Peter quite undone;
And had not help been just at hand,
Peter had gone the nearest way to land.
Made up of wonders, and on wonders fixed,
Of contradicting qualities thou'rt mixed.
Small as a grain, yet as a mountain great,
A child in growth, yet as a giant strong;
A beggar, yet above a king in state:
Of birth but short, yet in duration long.
How shall we reconcile thee to our sense?
Here thou would'st pass for mere impertinence.
Thy teasing nature would thy end defeat,
So humble, and yet so importunate.
See the great test of faith, the greatest sure,
That Heaven e'er put a mortal to endure.
She cried, she begged, nay, she believed and prayed,
Yet long neglected, and as long denied;
At last, as if commanded to despair,
She's almost told it was not in His power,
That she was out of His commission placed,
Shut out by Heaven, by race accurst.
Woman 1 I am not sent to thee!
Woman! thou hast no share in Me!
Was ever creature born, but this, could hear
Such words proclaimed from Heaven and not despair?
But still she prays, adheres, petitions, cries,
And on the Hand that thrusts her back relies:
Till moved, as 'twere, with her impertinence,
He calls her dog, and challenges her sense,
To tell her whether such as she are fed. With food appropriate, or the household bread.
But all was one; her faith so often tried,
Too strong to fail, too firm to be denied:
She follows still, allows her outcast state,
The more thrust off, the more importunate:
Every repulse she meets, revives her prayer.
And she builds hope because she's bid despair;
He call her dog, she calls herself so too,
But pleads as such the fragments that are due.
The case so doubtful, the repulse so long,
Her sex so weak, and yet her faith so strong. Heaven yields! The victory of faith's obtained,
And all she asked, and all she sought for, gained.
Mysterious flame! tell us from whence
Thou draw'st that cleaving confidence,
That strange, that irresistible desire. That with such magic force sets all the soul on fire;By which thou can'st to Heaven itself apply,
In terms which Heaven itself cannot deny.
A power so great, an influence so sure,
Not Heaven itself the wrestlings can endure.
See how the struggling angel yields the day,
When Jacob's faith bids Jacob pray.
Let me alone, the heavenly vision cries.
No, no, says conquering faith, never without my prize.
Heaven yields 1 Victonous faith prevailed.
And all the blessings asked for he entailed.
Blest humble confidence, that finds the way
To know we shall be heard before we pray;
Heav'n's high insurance-office, where we give
The premium faith, and then the grant receive.
Stupendous gift I from what strange spring below,
Can such a supernatural product flow?
From Heaven, and Heaven alone it must derive;
For Heaven alone can keep its flame alive.
No spring below can send out such a stream,
No fire below emit so bright a flame,
Of nature and original divine,
It does all other gifts of Heaven outshine.
Thou art the touchstone of all other grace, No counterfeits can keep thy pace.
The weighty standard of our best desires,
The true sublime, which every breast inspires,
By thee we rise to such a height of flame,
As neither thought can reach nor language name,
Such as St Paul himself could hardly know, Whether he really was alive or no:
When clothed in raptures lifted up by thee,
He saw by faith, what none without it see.
Just Heaven, that in thy violence delights, And easily distinguishes thy flights
From the thin outside warmth of hypocrites,
Approves, accepts, rewards, and feeds thy flame,
And gives this glorious witness to thy fame,
That all our gifts are hallowed by thy name.
By thee our souls on wings of joy ascend, Climb the third heaven, an entrance there demand, As sure those gates to thee shall open wide, As without thee we're sure to be denied. No bars, no bolts, no flaming swords appear, To shock thy confidence, or move thy fear.
/
To thee the patent passage always free,
Peter himself received the keys from thee;
Or, which we may conceive with much more ease,
Thou art thyself the gate, thyself the keys.
Thine was the fiery chariot, thine the steeds,
That fetched Elijah from old Jordan's plains;
Such a long journey such a voiture needs,
And thou the steady coachman held the reins.
Thine was the wondrous mantle he threw down,
By which successive miracles were wrought;
For 'twas the prophet's faith, and not his gown,
Elisha so importunately sought.
Bright pole-star of the soul, for ever fixed,
The mind's sure guide, when anxious and perplexed;
When wandering in the abyss of thoughts and cares,
Where no way out and no way in appears;
When doubt and horror, the extremes of fear,
Surround the soul, and prompt her to despair.
Thou shin'st aloft, open'st a gleam of light,
And show'st all heaven to our sight;
Thou gild'st the soul with sudden smiles, and joy,
And peace, that hell itself can ne'er destroy.
If all this be to be said, and all indeed but a poetical
trifle upon this exalted subject, what is become of our
negative Christian in all this? There is not a word of
negative religion in all the description of faith, any more
than there is of faith in all our negative religion.
Now let us follow this poor negative wretch to his
deathbed; and there having very little other notion of
religion — for 'tis the fate of those that trust to their
negatives to have little else in their thoughts — if a good
man come to talk with him, if he talks out of that way
he puts him all into confusion; for if he cannot swim
upon the bladders of his negatives he drowns imme-
diately, or he buoys himself up above your reproofs, and
goes on as before. He is a little like the Polish
Captain Uratz, who was executed for the murder of Mr. Thynne, who, when they talked to him of repentance
and of Jesus Christ, said he was of such and such a family, and he hoped God would have some respect to
,,him as a gentleman.
But what must a poor minister do who, being filled
with better principles, prays for this vainglorious man?
Must he say, "Lord, accept this good man, for he has
been no drunkard, no swearer, no debauched person;
he has been a just, a charitable man, has done a great
deal of good among his neighbours, and never wilfully
wronged any man; he has not been so wicked as it is
the custom of the times to be, nor has he shown bad
examples to others; Lord, be merciful to this excellent
good man"?
No, no, the poor sincere minister knows better
things; and if he prays with him, he turns him quite
inside out, represents him as a poor mistaken creature,
who now sees that he is nothing, and has nothing in
himself, but casts himself entirely, as a miserable lost
sinner, into the arms of a most merciful Saviour, praying
to be accepted on the merits of Jesus Christ, and no
other; so that there is all his negative bottom unravelled
at once; and if this is not his case it must be worse.
Chapter to.
Of Listening to the Voice of Providence.
, A A 7E are naturally backward to inform ourselves
of our duty to our Maker and to ourselves;
it is a study we engage in with great reluc-
tance, and it is but too agreeable to us, when we meet
with any difficulty which we think gives us a just occa-
sion to throw off any farther inquiries of that kind.
Hence I observe the wisest of men often run into
mistakes about the things which, speaking of religion,
we call duty, taking up slight notions of them, and believing they understand enough of them, by which
they rob themselves of the advantages as well as com-
fort of a farther search; or, on the other hand,
taking up with the general knowledge of religious
principles, and the common duties of a Christian life,
are satisfied with knowing what they say is sufficient
to carry them to heaven, without inquiring into those
things which are helpful and assistant to make that
strait path easy and pleasant to themselves, and to
make them useful to others by the way.
Solomon was quite of another opinion, when he
bid us cry after knowledge, and lift up our voice for
understanding — dig for her as for silver, and search
for her as for hid treasure. It is certain here that he
meant religious knowledge, and it is explained in the
very next words, with an encouraging promise to those
that shall enter upon the search, viz., Then shalt
thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the
knowledge of God.
I am of opinion that it is our unquestioned duty to
inquire after everything in our journey to the eternal
habitation which God has permitted us to know, and
thus to raise difficulties in the way of our just search
into Divine discoveries, is to act like Solomon's
sluggard, who saith, "There is a lion without, I shall
be slain in the streets" (Prov. xxii. 13). That is,
he sits down in his ignorance, repulsed with imaginary
difficulties, without making one step in the search after
the knowledge which he ought to dig for as for hid
treasure.
Let us, then, be encouraged to our duty; let us
boldly inquire after everything that God has permitted
us to know. I grant that secret things belong to
God, and I shall labour to keep my due distance;
but I firmly believe that there are no secret things
belonging to God, and which as such we are for-
kofiiNsoN crusoe. 177
bidden to inquire into, but what also are so preserved
in secrecy that by all our inquiries we cannot arrive
at the knowledge of them; and it is a most merciful,
as well as wise dispensation, that we are only forbid
inquiring after those things which we cannot know,
and that all those things are effectually locked up from
our knowledge which we are forbidden to inquire into.
The case is better with us than it was with Adam.
We have not the tree of knowledge first planted in our
view, as it were tempting us with its beauty, and
within our reach, and then a prohibition upon pain
of death; but blessed be God, we may eat of all the
trees in the garden, and all those of which we are not
allowed to take are placed both out of our sight and
out of our reach.
I am making way here to one of the trees of sacred
knowledge, which, though it may grow in the thickest
of the wood, and be surrounded with some briars and
thorns, so as to place it a little out of sight, yet I hope
to prove that it is our duty to taste of it, and that the
way to come at it is both practicable and plain.
But to waive the allegory, as I am entering into the
nicest search of Divine things that perhaps the whole
scheme of religion directs us to, it is absolutely neces-
sary at our entrance, if possible, to remove every
difficulty, explain every principle, and lay down every
foundation so undeniably clear, that nothing may appear
dark or mysterious in our first conceptions of things—
no stumbling-block lie at the threshold, and the humble
reader may meet with no repulse from his own apprehen-
sions of not understanding what he is going to read.
Listening to the voice of Providence is my subject;
I am willing to suppose, in the first place, that I am
writing to those who acknowledge the two grand
principles upon which all religion depends. 1. That
there is a God, a first great moving cause of all things, III. M
an eternal Power, prior, and consequently superior, to
all power and being. 2. That this eternal Power,
which I call God, is the Creator and Governor of all
things, viz., of heaven and earth.
To avoid needless distinctions concerning which of
the persons in the Godhead are exercised in the creating
power, and which in the governing power, I offer that
glorious text, Psalm xxxiii. 6, as a repulse to all such
cavilling inquiries, where the whole Trinity is plainly
entitled to the whole creating work:—" By the Word
(God the Son) of the Lord (God the Father) were
the heavens made, and all the host of them by the
breath (God the Holy Ghost) of His mouth."
Having thus presupposed the belief of the being and
the creating work of God, and declared that I am
writing to such only who are ready to own they be-
lieve that God is, and that He created the heaven and
the earth, the sea and all that in them is, I think I
need not make any preamble to introduce the following
propositions, viz.:
1. That this eternal God guides by His providence
the whole world, which He has created by His power.
2. That this Providence manifests a particular care
over and concern in the governing and directing man,
the best and last created creature on earth.
Natural religion proves the first, revealed religion
proves the last of these beyond contradiction. Natural
religion intimates the necessity of a Providence guid-
ing and governing the world, from the consequence
of the wisdom, justice, prescience, and goodness of
the Creator.
It would be absurd to conceive of God exerting
infinite power to create a world, and not concerning
His wisdom, which is His providence, in guiding the
operations of Nature, so as to preserve the order of
His creation, and the obedience and subordination of consequences and causes throughout the course of that
nature, which is in part the inferior life of that
creation.
Revealed religion has given such a light into the
care and concern of this Providence, in an especial
manner, in and over that part of the creation called
man, that we must likewise deny principles if we enter
into disputes about it.
For him the peace of the creation is preserved, the
climates made habitable, the creatures subjected and
made nourishing, all vegetative life made medicinal;
so that indeed the whole creation seems to be entailed
upon him as an inheritance, and given to him for a
possession, subjected to his authority, and governed by
him as viceroy to the King of all the earth; the
management of it is given to him as tenant to the great
Proprietor, who is Lord of the manor, or Landlord of
the soil. And it cannot be conceived, without great
inconsistency of thought, that this world is left entirely
to man's conduct, without the supervising influence and
the secret direction of the Creator.
This I call Providence, to which I give the whole
power of guiding and directing of the creation, and
managing of it, by man who is His deputy or substitute,
and even the guiding, influencing, and overruling man
himself also.
Let critical annotators enter into specific distinctions
of Providence, and its way of acting, as they please,
and as the formalities of the schoolmen direct; the
short description I shall give of it is this, that it is
that operation of the power, wisdom, justice, and
goodness of God by which He influences, governs, and
directs not only the means, but the events, of all things
which concern us in this world.
I say it is that operation, let them call it what they
will, which acts thus; I am no way concerned to show how it acts, or why it acts thus and thus in particular;
we are to reverence its sovereignty, as it is the finger
of God Himself, who is the Sovereign Director; and
we are to observe its motions, obey its dictates, and
listen to its voice, as it is, and because it is, particularly
employed for our advantage.
It would be a very proper and useful observation
here, and might take up much of this work, to illus-
trate the goodness of Providence, in that it is, as I say,
particularly employed for the advantage of mankind.
But as this is not the main design, and will come in
naturally in every part of the work I am upon, I refer
it to the common inferences, which are to be drawn
from the particulars, as I go on. It is, indeed, the most rational foundation of the
whole design before me; it is therefore that we should
listen to the voice of Providence, because it is princi-
pally determined, and determines all other things, for
our advantage.
But I return to the main subject — the voice of Pro-
vidence, the language or the meaning of Providence.
Nothing is more frequent than for us to mistake
Providence, even in its most visible appearances; how
easy, then, must it be to let its silent actings, which
perhaps are the most pungent and significant, pass our
observation.
I am aware of the error many fall into, who, deter-
mining the universal currency of events to Providence,
and that not the minutest thing occurs in the course of
life but by the particular destination of Heaven, by con-
sequence entitle Providence to the efficiency of their
own follies; as if a person presuming to smoke his
pipe in a magazine of gunpowder should reproach
Providence with blowing up the castle, for which
indeed he ought to be hanged; or a man leaving his
house or shop open in the night, should charge Provi-

dence with appointing him to be robbed, and the like.
Nay, to carry it farther, every murderer or thief may
allege Providence, that determines and directs every-
thing, directed him to such wickedness; whereas
Providence itself, notwithstanding the crimes of men,
is actively concerned in no evil.
But I pass all these things; the subject I am
treating upon is of another nature. The design here
is to instruct us in some particular things relating to
Providence and its government of men in the world,
which it will be worth our while to observe, without
inquiring how far it does or does not act in other
methods.
There is, it is true, a difficulty to shake off all the
wry steps which people take to amuse themselves
about Providence, and for this reason I take so much
pains at first to avoid them. Many men entitle Provi-
dence to things which it is not concerned about,
speaking abstractedly; but, which is a much worse
error, many also take no notice of those things which
Providence particularly, and even in a very remarkable
manner, distinguishes itself by its concern in.
If Providence guides the world, and directs the
issues and events of things; if it commands causes and
forms the connection of circumstances in the world,
as no man that owns the principles mentioned above
will deny; and, above all, if the general scope of
Providence, and of the government of the world by
its influence, be for our advantage, then it follows,
necessarily, that it is our business and our interest to
listen to its voice.
By listening to the voice of Providence, I mean to
study its meaning in every circumstance of life, in
every event; to learn to understand the end and de-
sign of Providence in everything that happens, what is
the design of Providence in it respecting ourselves, and '
what our duty to do upon the particular occasion that
offers. If a man were in danger of drowning in a
shipwrecked vessel, and Providence presented a boat
coming towards him, he would scarce want to be told
that it was his business to make signals of distress, that
the people in the said boat might not pass by ignorant
of his condition, and give him no assistance; if he did,
and omitted it, he would have little cause to concern
Providence in his ruin.
There is certainly a rebellion against Providence,
which Heaven itself will not always concern itself to
overrule; and he that throws himself into a river to
drown himself, he that hangs himself up to a beam, he
that shoots himself into the head with a pistol, shall die
in spite of all the notions of decree, destiny, fate, or
whatever we weakly call Providence; in such cases,
Providence will not always concern itself to prevent
it; and yet it is no impeachment of the sovereignty
of Heaven in directing, decreeing, and governing all
events in the world. Providence decrees that events shall attend upon
causes in a direct chain, and by an evident necessity,
and has doubtless left many powers of good and evil
seemingly to ourselves, and, as it were, in our hands,
as the natural product of such causes and consequences,
which we are not to limit and cannot expressly deter-
mine about, but which we are accountable for the good
or evil application of; otherwise we were in vain ex-
horted and commanded to do any good thing, or to avoid
any wicked one. Rewards and punishments would be
incongruous with sovereign justice, and promises and
threatenings be perfectly unmeaning, useless things—mankind being no free agent to himself, or intrusted
with the necessary powers which those promises and
threatenings imply. But all these things are out of my present inquiry. I am for freely and entirely submitting all events to
Providence; but not to be supinely and unconcernedly
passive, as if there was nothing warning, instructing, or
directing in the premonitions of God's providence, and
which He expected we should take notice of, and take
warning by. The "prudent man foreseeth the evil, and
hideth himself." How does he foresee it, since it is not
in man to direct himself? There are intimations given
us, by which a prudent man may sometimes foresee
evil and hide himself; and I must take these all out
of the devil's hands if possible, and place Providence
at the head of the invisible world, as well as at the
helm of this world; and though I abhor superstitious
and sceptical notions of the world of spirits, of which
I purpose to speak hereafter, either in this work or in
some other by itself—I say, though I am not at all a
sceptic, yet I cannot doubt but that the invisible hand
of Providence, which guides and governs this world,
does with a secret power likewise influence the world,
and may, and I believe does, direct from thence silent
messengers on many occasions — whether sleeping or
waking, whether directly or indirectly, whether by
hints, impulses, allegories, mysteries, or otherwise, we
know not; and does think fit to give us such alarms,
such previous and particular knowledge of things that,
if listened to, might many ways be useful to the prudent
man to foresee the evil, and hide himself.
The only objection, and which I can see no method
to give a reason for and no answer to, is, why, if it be
the work of Providence, those things should be so im-
perfect, so broken, so irregular, that men may either
never be able to pass any right judgment of them, as is
sometimes the case, or make a perfect judgment of them,
which is often the case, and so the end of the intima-
tion be entirely defeated, without any fault, neglect, or
omission of the man.

This we can no more account for than we can for
the handwriting upon the wall at the great feast of
Belshazzar, viz., why it was written in a character
which none could understand; and which, if the pro-
phet had not been found, had perhaps never been known,
or at least not till the king's fate, which was even then
irretrievable, had been over.
This, indeed, we cannot account for, and can only
say it is our duty to study these things, to listen to the
voice of them and obey their secret dictates, as far as
reason directs, without an over-superstitious regard to
them any more than a total neglect, leaving the reason
of Providence's acting thus to be better understood
hereafter. But to describe a little what I mean by listening to
the voice of Providence: it is the reverse of the supine
stupid man, whose character I shall come to by-and-by.
The man I would recommend lives, first, in a general
belief that Providence has the supreme direction of all
his affairs, even of his in particular, as well as those of
the world; that 'tis his mercy that it is so, that 'tis
the effect of an infinitely wise and gracious disposition
from above that he subsists; and that it is not below
the dignity any more than 'tis remote from the power
of an infinite, wise, and good Being to take cognisance
of the least thing concerning him.
This, in the consequence, obliges him to all I say;
for to him who firmly believes that Providence stoops
to concern itself for him, and to order the least article
of his affairs, it necessarily follows that he should con-
cern himself in everything that Providence does which
comes within his reach, that he may know whether he
be interested in it or not.
If he neglects this, he neglects himself—he abandons
all concern about himself; since he does not know but
that the very next particular act of Providence, which comes within his reach to distinguish, may be interested
in him and he in it.
It is not for me to dictate here to any man what
particular things relating to him Providence is concerned
in, or what not, or how far any incident of life is or is
not the particular act and deed of the government of
Providence. But as it is the received opinion of every
good man that nothing befalls us without the active or
passive concern of Providence in it, so it is impossible
this good man can be unconcerned in whatever that
Providence determines concerning him.
If it be true, as our Saviour Himself says, that not
a hair falls from our heads without the will of our
heavenly Father, then not a hair ought to fall from
our heads without our having our eyes up to our
heavenly Father in it.
I take the text in its due latitude, namely, that not
the minutest incident of life befalls us without the active
will of our Father directing it, or the passive will of
our Father suffering it; so I take the deduction from
it in the same latitude, that nothing, of how mean a
nature soever, can befall us, but what we ought to have
our eyes up to our heavenly Father in it, be resigned to
Him in the event, and subjected to Him in the means;
and he that neglects this lives in contempt of Providence,
and that in the most provoking manner possible.
I am not answerable for any extremes these things
may lead weak people into; I know some are apt to
entitle the hand of God to the common and most
ridiculous trifles in Nature; as a religious creature I
knew, seeing a bottle of beer being over ripe burst out,
the cork fly up against the ceiling, and the froth follow
it like an engine, cried out, " O! the wonders of omni-
potent Power!" But I am representing how a Christian
with an awful regard to the government of Providence
in the world, and particularly in all his own affairs, subjects his mind to a constant obedience to the
dictates of that Providence, gives an humble preference
to it in all his conclusions, waits the issues of it with a
cheerful resignation, and, in a word, listens carefully to
the voice of Providence, that he may be always obedient
to the heavenly vision.
Whether this Divine emanation has any concern in
the notices, omens, dreams, voices, hints, forebodings,
impulses, &c., which seem to be a kind of communica-
tion with the invisible world, and a converse between
the spirits embodied and those unembodied, and how
far, without prejudice to the honour and our reverence
of Providence, and without danger of scepticism and a
kind of radicated infidelity, those things may be regarded,
is a nice and difficult thing to resolve, and I shall treat
of it by itself.
It has been the opinion of good men of all ages that
such things are not to be totally disregarded; to say
how far they are to be depended upon, I am not to take
upon me.1 How far they may or may not be con-
cerned in the influence of Providence, I also dare not
say. But as the verity of astronomy is evidenced by the
calculation of eclipses, so the certainty of this communi-
cation of spirits is established by the concurrence of
events with the notices they sometimes give; and if it
be true, as I must believe, that the divine Providence
takes cognisance of all things belonging to us, I dare not
exclude it from having some concern, how much I do
not say, in these things also. But of this in its place.
Whenever Providence discovers anything of this
arcanum I desire to listen to the voice of it, and this is
one of the things I recommend to others. Indeed, I
would be very cautious how I listen to any other voices
from that country than such as I am sure are conveyed
* I have here transposed some words which seem to have got
out of their proper place.

to me from Heaven for my better understanding the
whole mystery.
If, then, we are to listen to the voice of Nature, and
to the voices of creatures, viz., to the voice of the
invisible agents of the world of spirits, as above, much
more are we to listen to the voice of God.
I have already hinted that He that made the world
we are sure guides it, and His providence is equally
wonderful as His power. But nothing in the whole
course of His providence is more worthy our regard,
especially as it concerns us His creatures, than the silent
voice, if it may be allowed me to call it so, of His
managing events and causes. He that listens to the
Providence of God listens to the voice of God, as
He is seen in the wonders of His government, and as He
is seen in the wonders of His omnipotence.
If, then, the events of things are His, as well as
the causes, it is certainly well worth our notice, when
the sympathy or relation between events of things and
their causes most eminently appears; and how can any
man who has the least inclination to observe what is
remarkable in the world, shut his eyes to the visible
discovery which there is in the events of Providence of
a supreme Hand guiding them? For example, when
visible punishments follow visible crimes, who can
refrain confessing the apparent direction of supreme
justice? When concurrence of circumstances directs
to the cause, men that take no notice of such remarkable
pointings of Providence openly contemn Heaven, and
frequently stand in the light of their own advantages.
The concurrence of events is a light to their causes,
and the methods of Heaven, in some things, are a happy
guide to us to make a judgment in others; he that is
deaf to these things shuts his ears to instruction, and,
like Solomon's fool, hates knowledge.
The dispositions of Heaven to approve or condemn '
our actions are, many of them, discovered by obser-
vation; and it is easy to know when that hand of
Providence opens the door for, or shuts it against, our
measures, if we will bring causes together, and com-
pare former things with present, making our judgment
by the ordinary rules of Heaven's dealing with men.
How, and from what hand, come the frequent in-
stances of severe judgment following rash and hellish
imprecations, when men call for God's judgment, and
Providence, or justice rather, obeys the summons, and
comes at their call? A man calls God to witness to
an untruth, and wishes himself struck dumb, blind, or
dead, if it is not true, and is struck dumb, blind, or
dead. Is not this a voice? does not Heaven, with the
stroke, cry, Castigo te — be it to thee as thou hast said?
He must be deaf who cannot hear it, and worse than
deaf that does not heed it; such executions from
Heaven are in terrorem, as offenders among men are
punished as well for example to others as to prevent
their doing the like again.
Innumerable ways the merciful disposition of Provi-
dence takes to discover to us what He expects we should
do in difficult cases; and doubtless, then, it expects at the
same time we should take notice of those directions.
We are short-sighted creatures at best, and can see
but a little way before us — I mean, as to the events of
things. We ought, therefore, to make use of all the
lights and helps we can get; these, if nicely regarded,
would be some of the most considerable to guide us in
many difficult cases.
Would we carefully listen to the concurrence of Pro-
vidence in the several parts of our lives, we should stand
less in need of the more dangerous helps of visions,
dreams, and voices from less certain intelligences.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being to go a
journey into the north, was twice taken very ill the day he had appointed to begin his journey, and so was
obliged to put off going. This he took for a direction
from Heaven that he should not go at all; and in very
few days after his wife was taken sick and died, which
made it absolutely necessary for him to be at home to look
after his affairs; and had he gone away before, must
certainly have been obliged to come back again.
The Romans had certainly the foundation of this
principle in their prudent observations of days and cir-
cumstances of days, nor is Scripture itself void of the
like, but rather points out to the observation, particu-
larly that of the children of Israel, who, after 430
years were expired from their coming into Egypt,
"Even in the self-same day departed they thence"
(Exod. xii. 41, 42). This is the day, that remarkable
day; several other Scriptures mention periodical times,
dies infaustus — the prudent shall keep silence in that
time, for it is an evil time. We find Providence stoops to restrain not the actions
of men only, but even its own actions to days and
times; doubtless for our observation, and in some
things for our instruction. I do not so much refer to
the revolutions of things and families on particular days,
which are therefore by some people called lucky and
unlucky days, as I do to the observing how Providence
causes the revolutions of days to form a concurrence
between the actions of men, which it does not approve,
or does approve, and the reward of these actions in this
world, by which men may, if they think fit to dis-
tinguish and observe right upon them, see the crime
or merit of those actions in the Divine resentment,
may read the sin in the punishment, and may learn
conviction from the revolution of circumstances in the
appointment of Heaven.
I have seen several collections of such things made
by private hands, some relating to family circumstances, 
some to public; also, in the unnatural wars in England,
between the King and the Parliament, I have heard
many such things have been observed. For example,
the same day of the year and month that Sir John
Hotham kept out Hull against King Charles the First,
and refused him entrance, was the same Sir John
Hotham put to death by the very Parliament that
he did that exploit for; that King Charles himself
was sentenced to die by the High Court of Justice,
as it was then called, the same day of the month that
he signed the warrant for the execution of the Earl of
Strafford, which, as it was then said by some of his
friends, was cutting off his own right hand. The
same day that King James the Second came to the
crown, against the design of the Bill of Exclusion,
the same day he was voted abdicated by Parliament,
and the throne filled by the Prince of Orange and
his princess.
These, or such as these, seem to be a kind of silent
sentence of Providence upon such actions, animadverting
upon them in a judicial manner, and intimating plainly,
that the animadversion had a retrospect to what was
passed, and those that listen to the voice of Providence
in such things should at least lay them up in their
hearts.
Eminent deliverances in sudden dangers are of the
most significant kind of providences, and which, accord-
ingly, have a loud voice in them, calling upon us to be
thankful to that blessed Hand that has been pleased to
spare and protect us. The voice of such signal deliver-
ances is frequently a just call upon us to repentance,
and looks directly that way; often 'tis a caution
against falling into the like dangers we were exposed
to, from which nothing but so much goodness could
deliver us again. In how many occasions of life, if
God's providence had no greater share in our safety than our own prudence, should we plunge and pre-
cipitate ourselves into all manner of misery and distress?
And how often, for want of listening to those pro-
vidences, do we miscarry?
Innumerable instances present themselves to us every
day, in which the providence of God speaks to us in
things relating to ourselves; in deliverances to excite
our thankfulness; in views of danger to awaken our
caution, and to make us walk wisely and circum-
spectly in every step we take; those that are awake
to these things, and have their ears open to the voice
of them, many times reap the benefit of their instruction
by being protected, while those who neglect them are
of the number of the simple, who pass on and are
punished.
To be utterly careless of ourselves in such cases,
and talk of trusting Providence, is a lethargy of the
worst nature; for as we are to trust Providence with
our estates, but to use, at the same time, all diligence
in our callings, so we are to trust Providence with our
safety, but with our eyes open to all its necessary
cautions, warnings, and instructions, many of which
Providence is pleased to give us in the course of life
for the direction of our conduct, and which we should
ill place to the account of Providence without acknow-
ledging that they ought to be regarded, and a due rever-
ence paid to them upon all occasions.
I take a general neglect of these things to be a kind
of practical atheism, or at least a living in a kind of
contempt of Heaven, regardless of all that share which
His invisible hand has in the things that befall us.
Such a man receives good at the hand of his Maker,
but unconcerned at the very nature or original of it,
looks not at all to the Benefactor; again, he receives
evil, but has no sense of it, as a judicial dispensing of
punishment from Heaven; but, insensible of one or other, he is neither thankful for one, nor humble under the
other, but stupid in both, as if he was out of God's care,
and God Himself out of his thoughts; this is just the
reverse of the temper I am recommending, and let the
picture recommend itself to any according to its merits. When Prince Vandemont commanded the confede-
rate army in Flanders, the same campaign that King
William was besieging Namur, some troops were
ordered to march into the flat country towards Nieuport, in order to make a diversion, and draw down the
Count de Montal, who commanded a flying body about
Menin, and to keep him from joining the Duke de
Villeroy, who commanded the main body of the French
army.
The soldiers were ordered, upon pain of death, not
to stir from their camp, or to plunder any of the
country people; the reason was evident, because pro-
visions being somewhat scarce, if the boors were not
protected they would have fled from their houses, and
the army would have been put to great straits, being
just entered into the enemy's country.
It happened that five English soldiers, straggling
beyond their bounds, were fallen upon, near a farm-
house, by some of the country people (for indeed the
boors were oftentimes too unmerciful to the soldiers),
as if they had plundered them, when, indeed, they had
not; the soldiers defended themselves, got the better,
and killed two of the boors, and being, as they thought,
justly provoked by being first attacked, they broke into
the house, and then used them roughly enough indeed.
They found in the house a great quantity of apples;
the people being fled had left them in possession, and
they made no haste to go away, but fell to work with
the apples, and heating the oven put a great quantity of
apples into the oven to roast. In the meantime the
boors, who knew their number to be but five, and had 381'
ed")
« v. I "fel r
i E-
got more help on their side, came down upon them
again, attacked the house, forced their way in, mastered
the Englishmen, killed two, and took a third and bar-
barously put him into the oven, which he had heated,
where he was smothered to death; it seems it was not
hot enough to burn him.
The other two escaped, but in coming back to the
camp they were immediately apprehended by the pro-
vosts, and brought to a court-martial, where they were
sentenced, not for plundering, for that did not appear,
but for being out of the bounds appointed by the general
order, as above.
When the sentence came to be executed, the general
was prevailed upon to spare one of them, and to order
them to cast lots for their lives. This, as it is known,
is usually done by throwing dice upon a drum-head,
and he that throws highest or lowest, as is appointed
before, is to die; at this time he that threw lowest was
to live.
When the fellows were brought out to throw, the
first threw two sixes, and fell immediately to wringing
his hands, crying he was a dead man, but was as much
surprised with joy when his comrade throwing, there
came up two sixes also.
The officer appointed to see the execution was a
little doubtful what to do, but his orders being positive,
he commanded them to throw again; they did so, and
each of them threw two fives; the soldiers that stood
round shouted, and said neither of them was to die.
The officer, being a sober thinking man, said it was
strange, and looked like something from heaven, and he
would not proceed without acquainting the council of
war, which was then sitting; they considered a while,
and at last ordered them to take other dice and to
throw again, which was done, and both the soldiers
threw two fours.
III. N
The officer goes back to the council of war, who
were surprised very much, and looking on it as the voice
of Heaven, respited the execution till the general was
acquainted with it.
The general sends for the men, and examines them
strictly, who telling him the whole story, he pardoned
them, with this expression to those about him: "I
love," says he, "in such extraordinary cases to listen
to the voice of Providence."
While we are in this uninformed state, where we
know so little of the invisible world, it would be greatly
our advantage if we knew rightly, and without the
bondage of enthusiasm and superstition, how to make
use of the hints given us from above for our direction
in matters of the greatest importance.
It has pleased God very much to straighten the
special and particular directions which He gives to men
immediately from Himself; but I dare not say they are
quite ceased. We read of many examples in Scripture,
how God spake to men by voice immediately from
heaven, by appearance of angels, or by dreams and
visions of the night, and by all these, not in public and
more extraordinary cases only, but in private, personal,
and family concerns.
Thus God is said to have appeared to Abraham, to
Lot, and to Jacob; angels also have appeared in many
other cases, and to many several persons, as to Manoah
and his wife, to Zachariah, to the Virgin Mary, and
to the Apostles; others have been warned in a dream,
as King Abimelech, the false prophet Balaam, Pontius
Pilate's wife, Herod, Joseph, the Apostles also, and
many others.
We cannot say but these and all the miraculous
voices, the prophetic messages prefaced boldly by the
ancients with "thus saith the Lord," are ceased, and
as we have a more sure word of prophecy handed to us by the mission of Gospel ministers, to which the
Scripture says, " We do well that we take heed;" and
to whom our blessed Lord has said, "Lo, I am with
you to the end of the world;" I say, as we have this
Gospel backed with the Spirit and presence of God, we
are no losers if we observe the rule laid down, viz.,
that we be obedient to the heavenly vision, for such it
is, as well as that of the Apostle Peter's dream of the
sheet let down from heaven.
I mention this to pay a due reverence to the suffi-
ciency of Gospel revelation, and to the guiding of the
Spirit of God, who in spiritual things is given to lead
us into all truth; nor would I have anything which I
am going to say tend to lessen these great efficients
of our eternal salvation.
But I am chiefly upon our conduct in the inferior
life, as I may call it; and in this, I think, the voice
of God, even His immediate voice from heaven, is not
entirely ceased from us, though it may have changed
the mediums of communication.
I have heard the divines tell us by way of distinction,
that there is a voice of God in His word, and a voice
of God in His work; the latter I take to be a subject
very awful and very instructing.
This voice of God in His works, is either heard
in His works which are already wrought, such as of
creation, which fill us with wonder and astonishment,
admiration and adoration; "When I view the heavens,
the work of Thy hands, the moon and the stars which
Thou hast made, then I say, what is man?" &c. Or
(2.) His works of government and providence, in which
the infinite variety affords a pleasing and instructing
contemplation; and it is without question our wisdom
and advantage to study and know them, and to listen
to the voice of God in them; for this listening to the
voice of Providence is a thing so hard to direct, and so little understood, that I find the very thought of it
is treated with contempt, even by many pious and good
people, as leading to superstition, to enthusiasm, and
vain fancies tainted with melancholy, and amusing the
mind with the vapours of the head.
It is true, an ill use may be made of these things,
and to tie people too strictly down to a rule, where
their own observation is to be the judge, endangers
the running into many foolish extremes, entitling a
distempered brain too much to the exposition of
the sublimest things, and tacking the awful name of
Providence to every fancy of their own.
From hence, I think, too much proceeds the extra-
ordinary (note, I say extraordinary) homage paid to
omens, flying of birds, voices, noises, predictions, and a
thousand foolish things, in which I shall endeavour to
state the case fairly between the devil and mankind;
but at present I need say no more here, than that they
have nothing to do with the subject I am now upon, or
the subject I am upon with them.
But as my design is serious, and I hope pious, I
shall keep strictly to the exposition I give of my own
meaning, and meddle with no other.
By the voice of Providence, therefore, I shall
confine myself to the particular circumstances, incident,
and accident, which every man's life is full of, and
which are, in a more extraordinary manner, said to be
peculiar to himself or to his family.
By listening to them, I mean, making such due
application of them to his own circumstances as becomes
a Christian, for caution in his conduct, and all manner
of instruction, receiving all the hints as from Heaven,
returning all the praise to, making all the improvement
for, and reverencing the sovereignty of his Maker in
everything, not disputing or reproaching the justice of
Providence; and, which is the main thing I aim at, taking such notice of the several providences that
happen in the course of our lives, as by one circumstance
to learn how to behave in another.
For example, supposing from my own story, when a
young fellow broke from his friends, trampled upon all
the wise advices and most affectionate persuasions of
his father, and even the tears and entreaties of a tender
mother, and would go away to sea, but is checked in
his first excursions by being shipwrecked, and in the
utmost distress saved by the assistance of another ship's
boat, seeing the ship he was in soon after sink to the
bottom ;—ought not such a young man to have listened
to the voice of this providence, and have taken it for a
summons to him, that when he was on shore he should
stay on shore, and go back to the arms of his friends,
hearken to their counsel, and not precipitate himself
into farther mischiefs? what happiness might such a
prudent step have procured, what miseries and mischiefs
would it have prevented in the rest of his unfortunate
life!
An acquaintance of mine, who had several such cir-
cumstances befall him, as those which I am inclined to
call warnings, but entirely neglected them, and laughed
at those that did otherwise, suffered deeply for his
disregard of omens. He took lodgings in a village near
the city of London, and in a house where either he
sought bad company, or, at best, could meet with little
that was good. Providence, that seemed to animadvert
upon his conduct, so ordered it that something or
other mischievous always happened to him there, or
as he went thither; several times he was robbed on the
highway going thither, once or twice taken very ill, at
other times his affairs in the world went ill, while he
diverted himself there. Several of his friends cautioned
him of it, and told him he ought to consider that some
superior Hand seemed to hint to him that he should come there no more; he slighted the hint, or at least
neglected it after some time, and went to the same
place again, but was so terrified with a most dreadful
tempest of thunder and lightning, which fell as it were
more particularly upon that part of the country than upon
others, that he took it as a warning from Heaven, and
resolved not to go there again, and some time after a fire
destroyed that house, very few escaping that were in it.
It would be an ill account we should give of the
government of divine Providence in the world, if we
should argue that its events are so unavoidable, and
every circumstance so determined, that nothing can be
altered, and that therefore these warnings of Provi-
dence are inconsistent with the nature of it. This,
besides that I think it would take from the sovereignty
of Providence, and deny even God Himself the privi-
lege of being a free agent, it would also so contradict
the experience of every man living, in the varieties of
his respective life, that he should be unable to give
any account for what end many things which Provi-
dence directs in the world are directed, and why so
many things happen which do happen. Why are evils
attending us so evidently foretold, that by those foretellings they are avoided, if it was not determined before
they should be avoided and should not befall us?
People that tie up all to events and causes, strip the
providence of God which guides the world of all its
superintendency, and leave it no room to act as a wise
disposer of things.
It seems to me that the immutable wisdom and power
of the Creator, and the notion of it in the minds of
men, is as dutifully preserved, and is as legible to our
understanding, though there be a hand left at liberty
to direct the course of natural causes and events. 'Tis
sufficient to the honour of an immutable Deity, that,
for the common incidents of life, they be left to the 
disposition of a daily agitator, namely, divine Provi-
dence, to order and direct them, as it shall see good,
within the natural limits of cause and consequence.
This seems to me a much more rational system
than that of tying up the hands of the Supreme Power
to a road of things, so that none can be acted or per-
mitted but such as was so appointed before to be acted
and permitted.
But what if, after all, we were to sit down and
acknowledge that the immutability of God's being and
the unchangeableness of His actings are not easy to be
comprehended by us, or that we may say we are not
able to reconcile them with the infinite variation of His
Providence, which in all its actings seems to us to be
at full liberty to determine anew and give events a turn
this way or that way, as its sovereignty and wisdom
shall direct; does it follow that these things are not
reconcilable because we cannot reconcile them? Why
should we not as well say nothing of God is to be
understood, because we cannot understand it? or that
nothing in Nature is intelligible but what we can under-
stand?
Who can understand the reason, and much less the
manner, of the needle tending to the pole by being
touched with the loadstone, and by what operation the
magnetic virtue is conveyed with a touch? Why that
virtue is not communicable to other metals — such as
gold, silver, or copper — but to iron only? What
sympathetic influence is there between the stone and
the star, or the pole? Why tending to that point in
the whole arch and not to any other? And why face
about to the south pole as soon as it has passed the
equinox? Yet we see all these things in their opera-
tions and events; we know they must be reconcilable
in nature, though we cannot reconcile them; and in-
telligible in nature, though we cannot understand them. Sure it is as highly reasonable then for us to believe
that the various actings of Providence, which to us
appear changeable — one decree, as it were, reversing
another, and one action superseding another — may be
as reconcilable to the immutability of God and to
the unchangeableness of His purposes, though we
cannot understand how it is brought to pass, as it is
to believe that there is a reason to be given for the
agreement and sympathetic correspondence between the
magnet and the pole, though at present the manner of
it is not discovered and cannot be understood.
If, then, the hand of divine Providence has a
spontaneous power of acting, and directed by its own
sovereignty proceeds by such methods as it thinks fit,
and as we see daily in the course of human things,
our business is to converse with the acting part of
Providence, with which we more immediately have
to do, and not confound our judgment with things
which we cannot fully comprehend, such as the why,
to what end, and the how, in what manner it acts so
and so.
As we are then conversant with the immediate
actions of divine Providence, it is our business to
study it as much as may be in that part of its act-
ings wherein it is to be known; and this includes
the silent actings of Providence, as well as those
which are more loud, and which, being declared,
speak in public.
There are several silent steps which Providence
takes in the world which summon our attention; and
he that will not listen to them shall deprive himself
of much of the caution and counsel, as well as com-
fort, which he might otherwise have in his passage
through this life; particularly by thus listening to the
voice, as I call it, of Providence, we have the comfort
of seeing that really an invisible and powerful Hand is 
employed in, and concerned for, our preservation and
prosperity in the world. And who can look upon the
manifest deliverances which he meets with in the in-
finite variety of life, without being convinced that they
are wrought for him without his own assistance by
the wise and merciful dispositions of an invisible and
friendly Power?
The bringing good events to pass by the most
threatening causes, as it testifies a Power that has the
government of causes and effects in its hand, so it
gives a very convincing evidence of that Power being
on good terms with us; as on the contrary, when the
like Providence declares against us, we ought to make
a suitable use of it another way, that is to say, take the
just alarm, and apply to the necessary duties of humilia-
tion and repentance.
These things may be jested with by the men of
fashion, but I am supposing myself talking to men that
have a sense of a future state, and of the economy of
an invisible world upon them, and neither to atheists,
sceptics, or persons indifferent, who are, indeed, near
of kin to them both.
As there are just reflections to be made upon the
various conduct of Providence in the several passages
of man's life, so there are infinite circumstances in
which we may furnish ourselves with directions in the
course of life, and in the most sudden incidents, as well
to obtain good as avoid evil.
Much of the honour due to the goodness of Provi-
dence is unjustly taken away from it by men that give
themselves a loose in a general neglect of these things;
but that which is still more absurd to me is, that some
men are [so] obstinately resolved against paying the
homage of their deliverances to their Maker, or paying
the reverence due to His terrors in anything that befalls
them ill, where it ought to be paid, that they will give f
all that honour to another. If it was well, they tell you
they know not how, but so it happened, or it was so by
good chance, and the like. This is a sort of language I
cannot understand; it seems to be a felonious thought
in its very design, robbing Heaven of the honour due to
it, and listing ourselves in the regiment of the ungrateful.
But this is not all, for one crime leads on to another;
if this part is felony or robbery, the next is treason, for
resolving first to deny the homage of good or evil events
to God, from whose hands they come, they go on and
pay it to the devil, the enemy of His praise, and rival of
His power.
Two of these wretches travelled a little journey with
me some years ago, and in their return, some time after
I was gone from them, they met with a very different
adventure, and telling me the story, they expressed
themselves thus: They were riding from Huntingdon
towards London, and in some lanes betwixt Hunting-
don and Caxton, one happened, by a slip of his horse's
foot, which lamed him a little, to stay about half a mile
behind the other, was set upon by some highwaymen,
who robbed him, and abused him very much; the
other went on to Caxton, not taking care of his com-
panion, thinking he had stayed on some particular
occasion, and escaped the thieves, they making off
across the country towards Cambridge.
"Well," says I to the first, "how came you to
escape ?"—" I don't know, not I," says he; "I
happened not to look behind me when his horse
stumbled, and I went forward, and by good luck,"
adds he again, "I heard nothing of the matter." Here
was, "it happened," and "by good luck," but not the
least sense of the government of Providence in this
affair, or its disposition for his good, but an empty idol
of air, or rather an imaginary, nonsensical nothing, an
image more inconsistent than those I mentioned among 
I
the Chinese; not a monster, indeed, of a frightful shape
and ugly figure, loathsome and frightful, but a mere
phantasm, an idea, a nonentity — a name without being, a
miscalled, unborn, nothing, hap, luck, chance; that is
to say, a name put upon the medium, which they set up
in their imagination for want of a will to acknowledge
their Maker, and recognise the goodness which had
particularly preserved him. This was the most ungrate-
ful piece of folly, or, to speak more properly, the
maddest and most foolish piece of ingratitude, that ever
I met with.
Well, if this was foolish and preposterous, the other
was as wicked and detestable; for when the first had
told his tale I turned to the other, and asked him
what was the matter. "Why, how came this to
pass?" said I; "why has this disaster fallen all
upon you? How was it ?" —" Nay," says he, " I do
not know; I was a little behind, and my horse
chanced to slip and lame himself, and he went for-
ward and left me; and as the devil would have it,
these fellows came across the country and chopped
upon me," &c.
Here was first chance, the same mock goddess as
before, lamed his horse, and next, the devil ordered
the highwaymen to chop upon him that moment.
Now, though it may be true that the highwaymen
were, even by their employment, doing the devil's
office of going to and fro, seeking whom they may
plunder, yet 'twas a higher Hand than Satan's that
delivered this poor blind fellow into their power. We have a plain guide for this in Scripture lan-
guage, in the law of manslaughter, or death, as we call
it foolishly enough, by misadventure; it is in Exod.
xxi. 13, in the case of casual killing a man; it is
expressed thus: "If a man lie not in wait, but God
deliver him into his hand." This was not to be accounted murder, but the slayer was to fly to the city
of refuge.
Here it is evident that God takes all these mis-
adventures into His own hand; and a man killed by
accident is a man whom God has delivered up, for what
end in His providence is known only to Himself, to be
killed in that manner, perhaps vindictively, perhaps not.
With what face can any man say, this was as the
devil would have it, or as bad luck would have it, or
it happened, or chanced, or fell out? all which are
our simple and empty ways of talking of things that
are ordered by the immediate hand or direction of
God's providence.
The words last quoted from the Scripture, of God's
delivering a man into another man's hand to be killed
unwillingly, are fully explained in another place, Deut.
xix. 5. "As when a man goeth into the wood with
his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a
stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head
slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neigh-
bour, that he die, he shall flee unto one of these cities
and live."
The wicked thoughtless creature I have just men-
tioned, whose horse fell lame, and stopped his travelling
till he might come just in the way of those thieves,
who, it seems, were crossing the country, perhaps
upon some other exploit, ought to have reflected that
Providence, to chastise him, and bring him to a sense
of his dependence upon and being subjected to His
power, had directed him to be separated from his
companion, that he might fall into the hands that
robbed and abused him; and the other had no less
obligation to give thanks for his deliverance; but how
contrary they acted in both cases you have heard.
We have had abundance of collections, in my re-
membrance, of remarkable providences, as they are *
called, and many people are forward to call them so,
but this does not come up to the case in hand.
Though contemning Providence, and giving the
homage due to it, as above, to the devil, or to chance,
fate, and I know not what embryos of the fancy, are
impious; yet every one that avoids this evil does not
come up to the particular point I am speaking of, for
there is a manifest difference between acknowledging
the being and operations of Providence and listening to
its voice, as many people acknowledge a God that
obey none of His commands, and concern themselves
in nothing of their duty to Him.
To listen to the voice of Providence, is to take strict
notice of all the remarkable steps of Providence which
relate to us in particular, to observe if there is nothing
in them instructing to our conduct, no warning to us
for avoiding some danger, no direction for the taking
some particular steps for our safety or advantage, no
hint to remind us of such and such things omitted, no
conviction of something committed, no vindictive step,
by way of retaliation, marking out the crime in the
punishment. You may easily observe the differences
between the directions and warnings of Providence,
when duly listened to, and the notices of spirits from
an invisible world, viz., that these are darkhints of evil,
with very little direction to avoid it; but those notices,
which are to be taken from the proceedings of Provi-
dence, though the voice be a kind of silent or soft
whisper, yet 'tis generally attended with an offer of the
means for escaping the evil, nay, very often leads by
the hand to the very proper steps to be taken, and even
obliges us, by a strong conviction of the reason of it, to
take those steps.
It is in vain for me to run into a collection of stories;
for example, where the variety is infinite, and things
vary as every particular man's circumstances vary; but as every event in the world is managed by the superintendency of Providence, so every providence has in it
something instructing, something that calls upon us to
look up, or look out, or look in.
Every one of those heads is big with particular
explanations, but my business is not preaching, I am
making observations and reflections, let those make en-
largements who read it; in a word, there is scarce any
particular providence attends our lives, but we shall find,
if we give due weight to it, that it calls upon us, either—
1. To look up, and acknowledge the goodness of
God in sparing us, the bounty of God in providing for
us, the power of God in delivering and protecting us;
not forgetting to look up, and acknowledge, and be
humble under the justice of God in being angry with
and afflicting us.
2. Or to look out, and take the needful caution and
warning given of evil approaching, and prepare either
to meet or avoid it.
3. Or to look in, and reflect upon what we find
Heaven animadverting upon, and afflicting us for taking
notice of the summons to repent and reform.
And this is, in a word, what I mean by listening to
the voice of Providence.
Chapter ni.
Of the Proportion ietiveen the Christian and Pagan
World.
1HAVE said something of this already in my inquiry
after the state of religion in the world, but upon
some reflections which fell in my way since, I
think it may offer further thoughts, very improving, as
well as diverting. When we view the world geographically, take the
plane of the globe, and measure it by line, and cut it
out into latitude and longitude, degrees, leagues, and
miles, we may see, indeed, that a pretty large spot of
the whole is at present under the government of Chris-
tian powers and princes, or under the influence of their
power and commerce, by arms, navies, colonies, and
plantations, or their factories, missionaries, residences, &c.
But I am loath to say we should take this for a
fulfilling the promise made to the Messiah, that His
kingdom should be exalted above all nations, and the
Gospel be heard to the end of the earth; I was going
to say, and yet without any profaneness, that we hope
God will not put us off so. I must acknowledge I
expect, in the fulfilling of these promises, that the time
will come when the knowledge of God shall cover the
earth as the waters cover the sea, that the Church
of God shall be set open to the four winds, that the
mountain of the Lord's house shall be exalted above
the tops of the mountains, and all the nations shall flow
into it (Isaiah ii. 2); that is to say, that the Christian
religion, or the profession of the doctrine of the Messiah,
shall be made national over the whole globe, according
to those words (Matt.xxiv. 14; Markxiii. 13; Luke
xxiv. 17). But this may be a little too apocalyptical
or visionary for the times; and it is no business of
mine to enter upon the interpretation of Scripture
difficulties, whatever I may understand or believe my-
self about them, but rather to make my observations,
as I have begun, upon things which now are, and
which we have seen and know; let what is to come
be as He pleases who has ordered things past, and
knows what is to follow.
The present case is to speak of the mathematical
proportion that there is now to be observed upon the
plane of the globe, and observe how small a part of the world it is where the Christian religion has really
prevailed and is nationally professed — I speak of the
Christian religion where it is, as I call it, national, that
is, in its utmost latitude; and I do so that I may give
the utmost advantage, even against myself, in what I
am going to say; and therefore, when I come to make
deductions for the mixtures of barbarous nations, I shall
do it fairly also.
I have nothing to do with the distinctions of Chris-
tians: I hope none will object against calling the
Roman Church a Christian Church in this respect, and
the professors of the Popish Church Christians; neither
do I scruple to call the Greek Church Christian,
though in some places so blended with superstition and
barbarous customs, as in Georgia, Armenia, and the
borders of Persia and Tartary, likewise in many parts
of the Czar of Muscovy's dominions, that, as before,
the name of Christ is little more than just spoken of,
and literally known, without any material knowledge of
His person, nature, and dignity, or of the homage due
to Him as the Redeemer of the world.
The nations of the world, then, where Christ is
acknowledged, and the Christian religion is professed
nationally, be it Romish Church or Greek Church, or
even the Protestant Church, including all the several
subdivisions and denominations of Protestants, take them
all as Christians, I say, these nations are as follow:—
1. In Europe: Germany, France, Spain, Italy,
Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Muscovy,
Poland, Hungary, Transylvania, Moldavia, and
Wallachia.
2. In Asia: Georgia and Armenia.
3. In Africa: no place at all, the few factories of
European merchants only excepted.
4. In America: The colonies of Europeans only, as follow:—
i. The Spaniards in Mexico and Peru, the coasts
of Chili, Carthagena, and St. Martha, and a
small colony at Buenos Ayres on the Rio de
la Plata.
2. The Portuguese in the Brazils.
3. The British on the coast of America, from the
Gulf of Florida to Cape Breton, on the mouth
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or the great river
of Canada, also a little in Newfoundland and
Hudson's Bay.
4. The French in the river of Canada and the great
river of Mississippi.
5. The English, French, and Dutch on the islands
called the Caribbees, &c.
The chief seat of the Christian religion is at present
in Europe. But if we measure the quarter of the
world we call Europe upon the plan of the globe, and
cast up the northern, frozen, and indeed uninhabitable
part of it, such as Laponia, Petzora, Candora, Obdora,
and the Samoiedes, with part of Siberia, they are all
pagans, with the eastern unpeopled deserts bordering
on Asia, on the way to China, and the vast extent of
land on that side, which, though nominally under the
dominion of Muscovy, is yet all pagan, even nationally
so — under no real government, but of their own pagan
customs.
If we go from thence to the south, and take out of
it the European Tartars, viz., of Circassia, the Crimea,
and Budziack — if you go on, and draw a line from the
Crim Tartary to the Danube, and from thence to the
Adriatic Gulf, and cut off all the Grand Seignior's
European dominions — I say, take this extent of land
out of Europe, and the remainder does not measure
full two-thirds of land in Europe under the Christian
government, much of which is also desert and un-
inhabited, or at least by such as cannot be called
in. o
Christians and do not concern themselves about it,
as, particularly, the Swedish and Norwegian Lapland,
the more eastern and southern Muscovy, beyond the
Volga, even to Karakathie, and to the borders of
Asia, on the side of India — I say, taking in this part,
not above one-half of Europe is really inhabited by
Christians.
The Czar of Muscovy, of the religion of whose
subjects I have said enough, is lord of a vast extended
country; and those who have measured it critically
say his dominions are larger than all the rest of
Europe, that is to say, that he possesses a full half as
much as Europe; and in those dominions he is master
of abundance of nations that are pagan or Mahomedan,
as, in particular, Circassia, being conquered by him,
the Circassian Tartars, who are all Mahomedans, or
the most of them, are his subjects.
However, since a Christian monarch governs them,
we must, upon the plan I laid down, call this a Chris-
tian country; and that alone obliges me to give two-thirds of Europe to the Christians. But this will bring another account upon my hands
to balance it, viz., that excepting this two-thirds, there
will not come one Christian to be accounted for in any
of the other three parts of the world, except Georgia
and Armenia. As for Africa, there is nothing to be
mentioned on that side, all the Christians that are
on the continent of Africa consisting only of a few
merchants residing at the coast towns in the Mediter-
ranean, as at Alexandria, Grand Cairo, Tunis, Tripoli,
Algiers, &c.; the factories of the English and Dutch
on the coast of Guinea, the Gold Coast, the coast of
Angola, and at the Cape of Good Hope; all which put
together, as I have calculated them, and as they are
calculated by a better judgment than mine, will not
amount to 5000 people, excepting Christian slaves in Sallee, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, &c., which are not so
many more.
America is thronged with Christians, God wot,
such as they are; for I must confess the European
inhabitants of some of the colonies there, as well
French and English as Spanish and Dutch, very ill
merit that name.
Some part of America is entirely under the dominion and government of the European nations; and having indeed destroyed the natives, and made desolate the country, they may be said to be Christian countries in
. the sense as above.
But what numbers do these amount to compared to
the inhabitants of so great a part of the world as that of
America, which at least is three times as big as Europe,
and in which are still vast extended countries, infinite
numbers of people, of nations unknown and even un-
heard of, which neither the English, French, Spanish, or
Portuguese have ever seen? Witness the populous cities
and innumerable nations which Sir Walter Raleigh met
with in his voyage up the great river Oronooque, in
one of which they talk of two millions of people;
witness the nations, infinitely populous, spread on
both sides the river Amazon, and all the country be-
tween these two prodigious rivers, being a country
above 400 miles in breadth and 1600 miles in length,
besides its extent south, even to the Rio Paraguay, and
S.E. to the Brazils, a rich, fruitful, and populous
country; and in which, by the accounts given, there
must be more people inhabiting at this time than in all
the Christian part of Europe put together, being the
chief if not the only part of America into which the
Spaniards never came, and whither the frighted people
fled from them, being so fortified with rivers and im-
passable bays and rapid currents, and so inaccessible by
the number of inhabitants, the heat of the climate, and the mountains, waterfalls, and such other obstructions,
that the Spaniards durst never attempt to penetrate the
way.
What are the numbers of Christians in America,
put them all together, to the inhabitants of these parts
of America, besides the northern parts of America, not
inquired into?
But we are not calculating of people yet, but the
extent of land that the Christians possess; the British
colonies in the north are by far the most populous,
even more than the Spaniards themselves, though the
latter extend themselves over more land.
The British colonies in the north of America are
supposed to contain three hundred thousand souls, in-
cluding Nova Scotia, New England, New York, New
Jersey, East and West Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
and Carolina; and these lie extended upon the coast
from the latitude of 32 degrees to 47, or thereabouts,
being about 750 miles in length; but then much of
this is very thinly peopled, and the breadth they lie
west into the country is little or nothing, 50 or 60
miles is in many places the most. And except some
plantations in Virginia, in Rappahanock, and James River
in Virginia, occasioned by the great inlet of the bay
there, and of the rivers that fall into it, we can see
nothing a hundred miles within that land but waste and
woods, whose inhabitants seem to be fled farther up
into the country, from the face of their enemies the
Christians.
So that all this planting, though considerable, amounts
to no more, compared to the country itself, than a long
narrow slip of land upon the sea-coast, there being very
few English inhabitants planted anywhere above twenty
miles from the sea, or from some navigable river, and
even that sea-coast itself very thinly inhabited, and
particularly from New England to New York, from 
New England north to Annapolis, from Virginia to
Carolina; so that all this great colony or collection
of colonies — nay, though we include the French at
Canada — are but a point, a handful, compared to the
vast extent of land lying west and north-west from
them, even to the South Sea, an extent of continent
full of innumerable nations of people unknown, un-
discovered, never searched into, or indeed heard of
but from one another, much greater in its extent than
all Europe.
If we take the north part of America, exclusive
of all the country which the Spaniards possess, and
which they call the empire of Mexico, and exclusive
too of what the English and French possess on the
coast and in the two rivers of Canada and Mississippi
as above, which indeed are but trifles, the rest of that
country, which, as far as it has been travelled into, is
found exceeding populous, is a great deal larger than
all Europe, though we have not reckoned the most
northern, frozen, and almost uninhabitable part of it,
where no end can be found, and where it is there can
be no doubt but there is a contiguous continent with
the northern part of Asia, or so near joining it as to be
only parted by a narrow gulf or strait of sea, easily
passed over both by man and beast, or else it would be
hard to give an account how man or beast came into
that part of the world — I say this vast continent, full
of people, and no doubt inhabited by many millions of
souls, is all wrapt up in idolatry and paganism, given up
to ignorance and blindness, worshipping the sun, the
moon, the fire, the hills their fathers, and, in a word,
the devil.
As to the thing we call religion, or the knowledge
of the true God, much less the doctrine of the Messiah
and the name of Christ, they not only have not, but
never had the least intimation of it on earth, or revelation of it from heaven, till the Spaniards came among them;
nay, and now Christians are come among them, it is
hard to say whether the paganism is much abated except
by the infinite ravages the Spaniards made where they
came, who rooted out idolatry by destroying the idol-
aters, not by converting them; having cruelly cut off,
as their own writers affirm, above seventy millions of
people, and left the country naked of its inhabitants for
many hundred miles together.
But what need we come to calculations for the
present time with respect to America? Let us but be
at the trouble to look back a little more than a hundred
years, which is as nothing at all in the argument; how
had the whole continent of America, extended almost
from pole to pole, with all the islands round it, and
peopled with such innumerable multitudes of people,
been as it were entirely abandoned to the devil's
government, even from the beginning of time, or at
least from the second peopling the world by Noah
to the sixteenth century, when Ferdinando Cortez,
general for the famous Charles the Fifth, first landed
in the Gulf of Mexico.
We have heard much of the cruelty of the Spaniards
in destroying such multitudes of the inhabitants there,
and of cutting off whole nations by fire and sword; but
as I am for giving up all the actions of men to the
government of Providence, it seems to me that Heaven
had determined such an act of vengeance should be
executed, and of which the Spaniards were instruments,
to destroy those people, who were come up (by the
influence of the devil, no doubt) to such a dreadful
height, in that abhorred custom of human sacrifices,
that the innocent blood cried for it, and it seemed
to be time to put a stop to that crime, lest the very
race of people should at last be extinct by their own
butcheries.

The magnitude of this may be guessed at by the
temple consecrated to the great idol of Vistlipustli, in
the city of Mexico, where, at the command of Monte-
zuma, the pagan monarch, twenty thousand men were
sacrificed in a year, and the wall hung a foot thick with
clotted blood, dashed in ceremony against the side of
that place on those occasions.
This abomination God in His providence put an end
to by destroying those nations from the face of the
earth, bringing a race of bearded strangers upon them,
cutting in pieces man, woman, and child, destroying
their idols, and even the idolatry itself by the Spaniards,
who, however wicked in themselves, yet were in this
to be esteemed instruments in the hand of Heaven to
execute the Divine justice on nations whose crimes
were come up to a full height, and that called for
vengeance.
I make no doubt (to carry on this digression a little
farther) that when God cast out the heathen, so the
Scripture calls it, from before the Israelites, and the
iniquity of the people of the land was full, Joshua,
Moses, and the Israelites were taxed with as much
cruelty and inhumanity in destroying the cities, killing
man, woman, and child, nay, even destroying the
very cattle, and trees, and fruits of the earth, as
ever the Spaniards were charged with in the conquest
of Mexico.
This is apparent by the terror that was spread upon
the minds of the people round about them, whereof
thousands fled to other parts of the world. History
tells us that the first builders of the city of Carthage,
long before the Roman times, or before the fable of
Queen Dido, were some Phoenicians, that is to say,
Canaanites, who, flying for their lives, got ships and
went away to sea, planting themselves on the coast of
Africa as the first place of safety they arrived at; and to prove this a pillar of stone was found not far from
Tripoli, on which was cut, in Phoenician characters,
these words: "We are of those who fled from the face
of Joshua the robber."
The cruelties of the Israelites, in destroying the
nations of the land of Canaan, was commanded from
heaven, and therein Joshua was justified in what was
done. The cruelties of the Spaniards, however ab-
horred by us, was doubtless an appointment of God
for the destruction of the most wicked and abominable
people upon earth.
But this is all a digression; I come to my calculation.
It is true that the Spaniards, whom I allow to be
Christians, have possessed the empires of Mexico and
Peru; but after all the havoc they made, and the mil-
lions of souls they dismissed out of life there, yet the
natives are infinitely the majority of the inhabitants;
and though many of them are Christianised, they are
little more than subjected; and take all the Spaniards,
Christians, and all the Portuguese in the Brazils, all
the English and French in the north, and, in a word,
all the Christians in America, and put them together,
they will not balance one part of the pagans or Maho-
metans in Europe; for example, take the Crim Tartars
of Europe, who inhabit the banks of the Euxine
Sea, they are more in number than all the Christians in
America; so that setting one nation against the other,
and you may reckon that there is not one Christian, or
as if there were not one Christian, in those three parts
of the world, Asia, Africa, and America, except the
Greeks of Asia.
This is a just but a very sad account of the small
extent of Christian knowledge in the world; and were
it considered as it ought, would put the most powerful
princes of Europe upon thinking of some methods, at
least, to open a way for the spreading Christian know-

ledge. I am not much of the opinion, indeed, that
religion should be planted by the sword; but as the
Christian princes of Europe, however few in number,
are yet so superior to all the rest of the world in martial
experience and the art of war, nothing is more certain
than that, if they could unite their interest, they are
able to beat paganism out of the world. Nothing is
more certain than this, that would the Christian princes
unite their powers and act in concert, they might de-
stroy the Turkish Empire and the Persian kingdom, and
beat the very name of Mahomet out of the world.
It is no boast to say that, were there no intestine
broils among us, the Christian soldiery is so evidently
superior to the Turkish at this time, that had they all
joined after the late battle at Belgrade to have sent
80,000 veteran soldiers to have joined Prince Eugene,
and supplied him with money and provisions by the ports
of the Adriatic Gulf and the Archipelago, that prince
would in two or three campaigns have driven the
Mahomedans out of Europe, taken Constantinople, and
have overturned the Turkish Empire.
After such a conquest, whither might not the Christian
religion have spread? The King of Spain with the
same ease would reduce the Moors of Barbary, and
dispossess those sons of hell, the Algerines, Tripolines,
Tunizens, and all the Mahomedan pirates of that coast,
and plant again the ancient churches of Africa, the
sees of Tertullian, St Cyprian, &c.
Nay, even the Czar of Muscovy, an enterprising
and glorious prince, well assisted and supported by
his neighbours, the northern powers, who together are
masters of the best soldiery in the world, would not find
it impossible to march an army of 36,000 foot and
16,000 horse, in spite of waste and inhospitable deserts,
even to attack the Chinese Empire, who, notwithstand-
ing their infinite numbers, pretended policy, and great i
skill in war, would sink in the operation; and such an
army of disciplined European soldiers would beat all
the forces of that vast empire with the same or greater
ease as Alexander with 30,000 Macedonians destroyed
the army of Darius, which consisted of 680,000 men.
And let no man ridicule this project on account of
the march, which I know they will call 3000 miles,
and more. While there is no obstruction but the
length of the way, it is not so difficult as some may
imagine; 'tis far from impossible to furnish sufficient
provisions for the march, which is indeed the only
difficulty that carries any terror in it.
Such a prince as the Czar of Muscovy cannot want
the assistance of innumerable hands for the amassing,
or carriage for conveying, to proper magazines sufficient
stores of provisions for the maintaining a select chosen
body of men to march over the deserts, for in the
grand march no useless mouths should be found to
feed.
Why, then, should not the Christian princes think it
a deed of compassion to the souls of men, as well as
an humble agency to the work of Providence, and to
the fulfilling the promises of their Saviour, by a moderate
and, as far as in them lies, a bloodless conquest, to
reduce the whole world to the government of Christian
power, and so plant the name and knowledge of Christ
Jesus among the heathens and Mahomedans? I am
not supposing that they can plant real religion in this
manner; the business of power is to open the way to
the gospel of peace; the servants of the king of the
earth are to fight, that the servants of the King of
Heaven may preach.
Let but an open door be made for the preaching
of the word of God, and the ministers of Christ be
admitted, if they do not spread Christian knowledge
over the face of the earth the fault will be theirs. Let but the military power reduce the pagan world, and
banish the devil and Mahomet from the face of the
earth, the knowledge of God be diligently spread, the
word of God duly preached, and the people meekly
and faithfully instructed in the Christian religion, the
world would soon receive the truth, and the knowledge
of Divine things would be the study and delight of
mankind.
I know some nice and difficult people would object
here, How are the present body of Christians, as you
call them, qualified to convert the pagan and
Mahomedan world, when they are not able to settle
the main point, viz., What the Christian religion is,
or what they would convert them to? That Chris-
tianity is subdivided into so many parts and particular
principles, the people so divided in their opinion; and,
that which is still worse, there is so little charity
among the several sorts, that some of them would
sooner side with Mahomet against their neighbours
than assist to propagate that particular doctrine in
religion which they condemn. Thus the members
of the Protestant faith would make it a point of
principle not to support or propagate the interest of
Popery in such a conquest as this; and again, the
Catholics would as much make it a duty on them to
root out heresy — so they call the Protestant doctrine—
as they would to root out paganism and the worship
of devils.
I would not answer for some Protestants that they
would not be of the same mind, as to particular
divisions among Protestants. The difference among
some opinions is such, and their want of charity one
to another sets them at such variance, that if they
do not censure one another for devil-worshippers, yet
we know they frequently call some of the opposite
principles doctrines of devils, and persecute one another with as much fury as ever the heathen persecuted the
primitive churches.
Witness the violences which have reigned between
the Episcopal and Presbyterian parties in the north
of Ireland and in Scotland, which has so often broken
out into a flame of war, and that flame been always
quenched with blood.
Witness the frequent persecutions, wars, massacres,
and other cruel and unnatural doings, which have been
in these parts of the world among Christians the effect
of a mistaken zeal for the Christian religion; which,
as it was not planted by blood and violence, so much
less can Christians justify the endeavours to erect this
or that opinion in it by the ruin and blood of their
brethren.
But this is far from being a reason why we should
not think it our duty to subdue the barbarous and
idolatrous nations of the world in order to suppress
the worshipping the devil, who is the enemy not only
of God and of all true religion in the world, but who
is the great destroyer and enemy of mankind, and of
his future or present felicity; and whose business is
always, to the utmost of his power, to involve or retain
them either in ignorance or in error.
I distinguish between forcing religion upon people,
or forcing them to entertain this or that opinion of
religion — I say, I distinguish between that and opening
the door for religion to come among them. The
former is a violence, indeed, inconsistent with the
nature of religion itself, whose energy prevails and
forces its way into the minds of men by another sort
of power; whereas the latter is removing a force
unjustly put already upon the minds of men, by the
artifice of the devil, to keep the Christian religion out
of the world; so that, indeed, I propose a war not
with men, but with the devil — a war to depose Satan's infernal tyranny in the world and set open the doors
to religion, that it may enter if men will receive it;
if they will not receive it, be that to themselves.
In a word, to unchain the wills of men, set their
inclinations free, that their reason may be at liberty
to influence their understandings, and that they may
have the faith of Christ preached to them, whether
they will hear or forbear, I say, as above, is no part
of the question; let the Christian doctrine and its
spiritual enemies alone to struggle about that. I am
for dealing with the temporalities of the devil, and
deposing that human power which is armed in the
behalf of obstinate ignorance, and resolute to keep out
the light of religion from the mind.
I think this is a lawful and just war, and, in the
end, kind both to them and their posterity: let me
bring the case home to ourselves.
Suppose neither Julius Caesar or any of the Roman
generals or emperors had cast their eyes towards Britain
for some ages, or till the Christian religion had spread
over the whole Roman Empire: 'tis true the Britons
might at last have received the Christian faith in
common with the rest of the northern world, but
they had yet lain above three hundred years longer
in ignorance and paganism than they did; and some
hundred thousands of people who proved zealous
Christians, nay, even martyrs for the Christian doc-
trine, would have died in the professed paganism of
the Britons.
Now 'tis evident the invasion of the Romans was an
unjust, bloody, tyrannical assault upon the poor Britons,
against all right and property, against justice and neigh-
bourhood, and merely carried on for conquest and
dominion. Nor, indeed, had the Romans any just
pretence of war; yet God was pleased to make this
violence be the kindest thing that could have befallen the British nation, since it brought in the knowledge of
God among the Britons, and was a means of reducing
a heathen and barbarous nation to the faith of Christ,
and to embrace the Messias.
Thus Heaven serves itself of men's worst designs,
and the avarice, ambition, and rage of men have been
made use of to bring to pass the glorious ends of
Providence, without the least knowledge or design
of the actors. Why, then, may not the great under-
takings of the princes of Europe, if they could be
brought to act in concert, with a good design to bring
all the world to open their doors to the Christian
religion, and by consequence their ears—I say, why
may not such an attempt be blessed from heaven with
so much success, at least as to make way for bringing
in nominal Christianity among the nations? For as
to obliging the people to be of this or that opinion
afterward, that is another case. There is a great pother made in the world among
the several denominations of Christians about coercion,
erecting a church, and compelling men to come in;
that is to say, one sort of Christians persecuting another
sort of Christians to make them worship Christ their
way, as if Christ had no sheep but one fold.
I distinguish much between using force to reduce
heathens and savages to Christianity, and using force to
reduce those that are already Christians to be of this
or that opinion; I will not say but a war might be
very just, and the cause be righteous, to reduce the
worshippers of the pagodas of India to the knowledge
and obedience of Christianity, when it would be a
horrible injustice to commence a like war to reduce
even a Popish nation to be Protestant.
But my proposed war does not reach so far as that
neither; for though I would have a nation of pagans
conquered that their idols and temples might be destroyed, and their idol worship be abolished, yet I
would be very far from punishing and persecuting the
people for not believing in Christ; for if we believe that
faith, as the Scripture says, is the gift of God, how can
we, upon any Christian foundation, punish or persecute
the man for not exercising that which God had not
given him? Hence, compelling men to conform to this
or that particular profession of the Christian religion, is
to me impious and unchristian.
And shall I speak a word here of the unhappy
custom among Christians of reviling one another with
words on account of differing opinions in religion? It
was a part of apocryphal scripture, taken from one of
the traditional sayings of the Rabbis, "Thou shalt not
mock at the gods of the heathens;" but ribaldry, satire,
and sarcasms are the usage we give one another every
day on the subject of religion, as if slander and the
severities of the tongue were not the worst kind of
violence in matters of the Christian religion.
In a word, I must acknowledge, if I am to speak of
reproach in general, I know no worse persecution than
that of the tongue. Solomon says, "There are that
speak like the piercing of a sword;" and King David
was so sensible of the bitterness of the tongue, that he
is full of exclamations upon the subject; among the
rest, he says of his enemies, "They have compassed me
about with words of hatred. ... He clothed himself with
cursing like as with his garment" (Psalm cix. 3,18).
It is indeed remote from the subject I am upon to
talk of this kind of uncharitable dealing, but as just
observations are never out of season, it may have its
uses; let no man slight the hint, though it were meant
for religion only, for that, indeed, is my present subject:
there is doubtless as severe a persecution by the tongue
as that of fire and faggot, and some think 'tis as hard
to be borne.
I have never met with so much of this anywhere in
all my travels as in England, where the mouths of the
several sects and opinions are so effectually open against
one another, that, albeit common charity commands us
to talk the best of particular persons in their failings and
infirmities, yet here, censuring, condemning, and re-
proaching one another on account of opinions is carried
on with such a gust, that lets every one see nothing but
death and destruction can follow, and no reconciliation
can be expected.
I have lived to see men of the best light be mistaken,
as well in party as in principles, as well in politics as in
religion, and find not only occasion, but even a necessity,
to change hands or sides in both; I have seen them
sometimes run into contrary extremes, beyond their
first intention, and even without design; nay, in those
unhappy changes I have seen them driven into lengths
they never designed, by the fiery resentment of those
whom they seemed to have left, and whom they
differed from. I have lived to see those men acknow-
ledge, even publicly and openly, they were wrong and
mistaken, and express their regret for being misled very
sincerely; but I cannot say I have lived to see the
people they have desired to return to forgive or receive
them. Perhaps the age I have lived in has not been a
proper season for charity; I hope futurity will be fur-
nished with better Christians; or perhaps 'tis appointed
so to illustrate the Divine mercy, and let mankind see
that they are the only creatures that never forgive. I
have seen a man in the case I speak of, offer the most
sincere acknowledgments of his having been mis-
taken, and this not in matters essential either to the
person's morals or Christianity, but only in matters
of party, and with the most moving expressions desire
his old friends to forgive what has been passed, and
have seen their return be mocking him with what they y
called a baseness of spirit, and a mean submission; I
have seen him expostulate with them, why they should
not act upon the same terms with a penitent, as God
Himself not only prescribed, but yields to; and have
seen them in return tell him God might forgive him
if He pleased, but they would never, and then ex-
pose all those offers to the first comer in banter and
ridicule: but take me right too, I have seen at the
same time, that to wiser men it has been always
thought to be an exposing themselves, and an honour
to the person.
I speak this too feelingly, and therefore say no more;
there is a way by patience, to conquer even the universal
contempt of mankind; and though two drams of that
drug be a vomit for a dog, it is, in my experience,
the only method; there is a secret peace in it, and
in time the rage of men will abate. A constant steady
adhering to virtue and honesty, and showing the world
that whatever mistakes he might be led into, supposing
them to be mistakes, that yet the main intention and
design of his life was sincere and upright: He that
governs the actions of men by an unbiassed hand, will
never suffer such a man to sink under the weight
of universal prejudice and clamour.
I, Robinson Crusoe, grown old in affliction, borne
down by calumny and reproach, but supported from
within, boldly prescribe this remedy against universal
clamours and contempt of mankind: patience, a steady
life of virtue and sobriety, and a comforting dependence
on the justice of Providence, will first or last restore
the patient to the opinion of his friends, and
justify him in the face of his enemies; and in the
meantime will support him comfortably in despising
those who want manners and charity, and leave them
to be cursed from Heaven with their own passions
and rage.
ill. P
r
This very thought made me long ago claim a kind
of property in some good old lines of the famous
George Withers, Esq., made in prison in the Tower.
He was a poetical gentleman who had, in the time of
the civil wars in England, been unhappy in changing
sides too often, and had been put into the Tower by
every side in their turn; once by the King, once by
the Parliament, once by the Army, then by the Rump,
and at last again, I think, by General Monk; in a
word, whatever side got up, he had the disaster to be
down. The lines are thus:
The world and I may well agree,
As most that are offended;
For I slight her, and she slights me,
And there's our quarrel ended. For service done and love expressed, Though very few regard it,
My country owes me bread at least;But if I am debarred it,
Good conscience is a daily feast, And sorrow never marred it.
But this article of verbal persecution has hurried me
from my subject, which I must return to.
I have spoken of a project for the Czar of Muscovy,
worthy of a monarch who is lord of so vast an extent
of country as the Russian Empire reaches to, which is
in effect, as I have said, much more than half Europe,
and consequently an eighth part of the world. I have
given my thoughts how a war to open a door for the
Christian religion may be justifiable, and that it has not
the least tincture of persecution in it. If the Christian
princes of the world, who now spend their force so
much to an ill purpose in real persecution, would join
in an universal war against paganism and devil-worship,
the savage part of mankind would, in one age, be
brought to bow their knees to the God of Truth, and 
would bless the enterprise itself in the end of it, as the
best thing that ever befell them; nor could such an
attempt fail of success, unless Heaven in justice had
determined to shut up the world longer in darkness,
and the cup of their abominations was not yet full.
But I may venture to say there would be much more
ground for such Christian princes to hope and expect
the concurrence of Heaven in such an undertaking, than
in sheathing their swords in the bowels of their brethren,
and making an effusion of Christian blood upon every
slight pretence, as we see has been the case in Europe
for above thirty years past.
I had intended to remark here that, as the country
possessed by Christians is but a spot of the globe com-
pared to the heathen, pagan, and Mahometan world,
so the number of real Christians among the nations
professing the Christian name is yet a more disproportioned part, a mere trifle, and hardly to be compared
with the infinite numbers of those who, though they
call themselves Christians, yet know as little of God
and religion as can be imagined to be known where the
word Christian is spoken of, and neither seek or desire
to know more; in a word, who know but little of
God or Jesus Christ, heaven or hell, and regard none
of them.
This is a large field, and being thoroughly searched
into, would, I doubt not, reduce the real faithful sub-
jects of the kingdom of Jesus Christ to a much fewer
number than those of Mahomet; nay, than those of
the monarch of Germany, and make our Lord appear
a weaker prince, speaking in the sense of kingdoms,
than many of the kings of the earth. And if it be
true that the old king of France should say, that he
had more loyal subjects than King Jesus, I do not
know but, in the sense his most Christian majesty
meant it, the thing might be very true.
But this observation is something out of my present
road, and merits to be spoken of by itself.
The number of true Christians will never be known
on this side the great bar, where they shall be critically
separated. No political arithmetic can make a calcula-
tion of the number of true Christians while they live
blended with the false ones, since it is not only hard,
but impossible, to know them one from another in this
world.
We shall perhaps be surprised at the last day to
see some people at the right hand of the righteous
Judge whom we have condemned with the utmost
zeal in our opinions, while we were contemporary
with them in life; for charity, as it is generally
practised in this world, and mixed with our human
infirmities, such as pride, self-opinion, and personal
prejudice, is strangely misguided, and makes us
entertain notions of things and people quite different
from what they really deserve; and there is hardly
any rule to prescribe ourselves, except it be of the
text—"In meekness, every one esteeming others
better than themselves," which, by the way, is diffi-
cult to do.
But though we shall thus see at the great audit a
transposition of persons from the station they held in
our charity, we shall only thereby see that our judgment
was wrong; that God judgeth not as man judgeth, and
that we too rashly condemn whom He has thought fit
to justify and accept.
Let, then, the number of Christians be more or less,
as He that makes them Christians determines, this is
not for us to enter into; and this brings me back to
what I said before, that though we cannot make
Christians, we both can and may, and indeed ought,
to open the door to Christianity, that the preaching of
God's word, which is the ordinary means of bringing 
mankind to the knowledge of religion, may be spread
over the whole world.
With what vigour do we consult, and how do the
labouring heads of the world club together, to form pro-
jects, and to raise subscriptions to extend the general
commerce of nations into every corner of the world!
But 'twould pass for a bubble of all bubbles, and a
whimsey that none would engage in, if ten millions
should be asked to be subscribed for sending a strong
fleet and army to conquer heathenism and idolatry,
and protect a mission of Christians, to be employed in
preaching the Gospel to the poor heathens, say it were
on the coast of Coromandel, the island of Ceylon,
and country of Malabar, or any of the dominions of
the Great Mogul; and yet such an attempt would
not only be just, but infinitely advantageous to the
people who should undertake it, and to the people
of the country on whom the operation should be
wrought.
In the occasional discourses I had on this subject, in
conversation with men of good judgment and principles,
I have been often asked in what manner I would
propose to carry on such a conquest as I speak of, and
how it should answer the end; and that I may not be
supposed to suggest a thing impracticable in itself, or
for which no rational scheme might be proposed, I
shall make a brief essay, at the manner, in which
the conquest I speak of should be, or ought to be,
carried on; and if it be considered seriously, the
difficulties and perhaps all the reasonable objections
might vanish in an instant. I will therefore, first, for
the purpose only, suppose that an attempt was made
by a Christian nation to conquer and subdue some
heathen or Mahometan people at a distance from them,
place the conquest where and among whom we will;
for example, suppose it was the great island of Mada-
gascar, or that of Ceylon, Borneo in the Indies, or
those of Japan, or any other where you please.
I would first suppose the place to be infinitely popu-
lous, as any of those countries, though they are islands,
are said to be; and because the Japanese are said to be
a most sensible, sagacious people, under excellent forms
of government, and capable more than ordinarily of
receiving impressions, supported by the argument and
example of a virtuous and religious conqueror.
For this purpose you must grant me, that the island
or islands of Japan were in a situation proper for the
undertaking, and that a powerful European army, being
landed upon them, had in a great battle, or in divers
battles, overthrown all their military force, and had
entirely reduced the whole nation to their power; as,
to go back to examples, the Venetians had done by the
Turks in the Morea in a former war, or as the Turks
did in the isles in Candia, Cyprus, and the like. The
short scheme for establishing the government in those
countries should be this :—
First, as the war is pointed chiefly against the king-
dom of the devil in behalf of the Christian worship, so
no quarter should be given to Satan's administration;
and as nothing else should willingly be treated with
violence, so, indeed, no part of the devil's economy
should have any favour, but all the idols should be im-
mediately destroyed and publicly burnt, all the pagodas
and temples burnt, and the very face and form of
paganism, and the worship attending it, be utterly
defaced and destroyed.
Secondly, the priests and dedicated persons of every
kind, by whatsoever names or titles known or distin-
guished, should be at least removed, if not destroyed.
Thirdly, all the exercise of profane and idolatrous
rites, ceremonies, worship, festivals, and customs should
be abolished entirely, so as by time to be forgotten, and 
clean wiped out of the minds as well as out of the
practice of the people.
This is all the coercion I propose, and less than this
cannot be proposed; because, though we may not by
arms and force compel men to be religious — because if
we do we cannot make them sincere, and so by per-
secution we only create hypocrites — yet I insist that
we may by force, and that with the greatest justice
possible, suppress paganism, and the worship of God's
enemy the devil, and banish it out of the world; nay,
that we ought to do it to the utmost of our power.
But I return to the conquest. The country being thus entirely reduced under
Christian government, the inhabitants, if they submit
quietly, ought to be used with humanity and justice,
no cruelty, no rigour. They should suffer no oppression,
injury, or injustice, that they may not receive evil
impressions of the people that are come among them;
lest, entertaining an abhorrence of Christians from their
evil conduct, cruelty, and injustice, they should enter-
tain an abhorrence of the Christian religion for their
sakes; as the poor wretches the Indians in America,
who, when they were talked to of the future state, the
resurrection of the dead, eternal felicity in heaven,
and the like, inquired where the Spaniards went after
death, and if any of them went to heaven; and being
answered in the affirmative, shook their heads, and
desired they might go to hell then, for that they were
afraid to think of being in heaven if the Spaniards were
there.
A just and generous behaviour to the natives, or at
least to such of them as should show themselves willing
to submit, would certainly engage them in their interest,
and accordingly would in a little while bring them to
embrace that truth which dictated such just principles
to those who espoused it.
Thus prejudices being removed, the way to instruc-
tion would be made the more plain, and then would be
the time for Gospel labourers to enter upon the harvest;
ministers should be instructed to teach them our lan-
guage, to exhort them to seek the blessings of religion
and of the true God, and so gradually to introduce right
principles among them at their own request.
From hence they should proceed to teach all the
young children the language spoken by them, who
would then be their benefactors rather than conquerors;
and a few years wearing the old generation out, the
posterity of them and of their conquerors would be all
one nation.
In case any rejected the instruction of religious men
and adhered obstinately to his idolatry, and would not
be reclaimed by gentle and Christian usage, suitable
methods are to be taken with such, that they might not
make a religious faction in the country and gain others to
side with them in order to recover their liberty, as they
might call it, to serve their own gods, that is to say,
idols; for it must be for ever as just not to permit them
to go back to idolatry by force as it was to pull them
from it by force.
By this kind of conquest the Christian religion would
be most effectually propagated among innumerable
nations of savages and idolaters, and as many people be
brought to worship the true God as may be said to do
it at this time in the whole Christian world.
This is my crusado; and it would be a war as justi-
fiable on many accounts as any that was ever undertaken
in the world, a war that would bring eternal honour to
the conquerors and an eternal blessing to the people
conquered.
It were easy now to cut out enterprises of this nature
for other of the princes of the world than the Czar of
Muscovy; and I could lay very rational schemes for such undertakings, and the schemes that could, if
thoroughly pursued, never fail of success. For ex-
ample, an expedition against the Moors of Africa by
the French, Spanish, and Italian princes, who daily
suffer so much by them, and the last of whom are at
perpetual war with them; how easy would it be to
those powers to join in a Christian confederacy to plant
the Christian religion again in the Numidian and Mauritanian kingdoms — where was once the famous church
of Carthage, and from whence thousands of Christians
have gone to heaven — the harvest of the primitive
labours of St. Cyprian, Tertullian, and many more,
whose posterity now bow their knees to that latest and
worst of all impostors, Mahomet.
But unchristian strife was always a bar against the
propagation of the Christian religion, and unnatural
wars, carried on among the nations I speak of, are
made so much the business of the Christian world, that
I do not expect in our time to see the advantages taken
hold of that the nature of the thing offers. But I am
persuaded, and leave it upon record as my settled
opinion, that one time or other the Christian powers
of Europe shall be inspired from Heaven for such a
work, and then the easiness of subduing the king-
dom of Africa to the Christian power shall shame the
generations past, who had the opportunity so often in
their hands, but made no use of it.
Note. — In this part of the subject I am upon, I must
acknowledge there is a double argument for a war:
(1.) In point of the interfering interests, Europe ought
to take possession of those shores, without which it is
manifest her commerce is not secured; and indeed,
while that part of Africa bordering on the sea is in the
hands of robbers, pirates cannot be secured. Now, this
is a point of undisputed right, for a war-trade claims
the protection of the powers to whom it belongs, and we make no scruple to make war upon one another for
the protection of our trade, and it is allowed to be a
good reason why we should do so. Why, then, is it
not a good reason to make war upon thieves and rob-
bers? If one nation take the ships belonging to an-
other, we immediately reclaim the prize from the
captors, and require of the prince that justice be done
against the aggressor, who is a breaker of the peace;
and if this is refused we make war.
But shall we do thus to Christians, and scruple to
make an universal war for the rooting out a race of
pirates and rovers, who live by rapine, and are continu-
ally employed, like the lions and tigers of their own
Lybia, in devouring their neighbours? This, I say,
makes such a war not only just on a religious account,
but both just and necessary upon a civil account.
The war, then, being thus proved to be just on
other accounts, why should not (2.) the extirpation
of idolatry, paganism, and devil-worship be the con-
sequence of the victory? If God be allowed to be
the giver of victory, how can it be answered to Him
that the victory should not be made use of for the
interest and glory of the God of war, from whom it
proceeds? But these things are not to be offered to
the world till higher principles work in the minds of
men in their making war and peace than yet seems to
take up their minds.
I was tempted upon this occasion to make an excur-
sion here upon the subject of the very light occasions
princes and powers, states and statesmen, make use of for
the engaging in war and blood one against another; one
for being ill satisfied with the other, and another for
preserving the balance of power; this for nothing at all,
and that for something next to nothing; and how little
concern the blood that is necessarily spilt in these wars
produces among them. But this is not a case that will so well bear to be entered upon in a public manner at
this time. All I can add is, I doubt no such zeal for the Chris-
tian religion will be found in our days, or perhaps in any
age of the world, till Heaven beats the drums itself, and
the glorious legions from above come down on purpose
to propagate the work, and to reduce the whole world
to the obedience of King Jesus — a time which some
tell us is not far off, but of which I heard nothing in all
my travels and illuminations, no, not one word.

A VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD
THEY must be much taken up with the satisfaction
of what they are already, that never spare their
thoughts upon the subject of what they shall be. The place, the company, the employment which we
expect to know so much of hereafter, must certainly be
well worth our while to inquire after here.
I believe the main interruptions which have been
given to these inquiries, and perhaps the reason why
those that have entered into them have given them up,
and those who have not entered into them have satis-
fied themselves in the utter neglect, have been the wild
chimeric notions, enthusiastic dreams, and unsatisfying
ideas, which most of the conceptions of men have led
them into about these things.
As I endeavour to conceive justly of these things, I
shall likewise endeavour to reason upon them clearly,
and, if possible, convey some such ideas of the invisible
world to the thoughts of men as may not be confused
and indigested, and so leave them darker than I find
them.
The locality of heaven or hell is no part of my •37

search; there is doubtless a place reserved for the re-
ception of our souls after death; as there is a state of
being for material substances, so there must be a place;
if we are to be, we must have a where; the Scripture
supports reason in it — Judas is gone to his place;
Dives in hell lifted up his eyes, and saw Lazarus in
Abraham's bosom: the locality of bliss and misery
seems to be positively asserted in both cases.
But there is not so clear a view of the company as
of the place; it is not so easy to inquire into the world
of spirits, as it is evident that there are such spirits and
such a world. We find the locality of it is natural, but
who the inhabitants are is a search of still a sublimer
nature, liable to more exception, encumbered with more
difficulties, and exposed to much more uncertainty.
I shall endeavour to clear up as much of it as I can,
and intimate most willingly how much I rejoice in the
expectation that some other inquirers may go farther,
till at last all that Providence has thought fit to discover
of that part may be perfectly known.
The discoveries in the Scripture which lead to this
are innumerable, but the positive declaration of it seems
to be declined. When our Saviour walking on the
sea frighted His disciples, and they cried out, what do
we find terrified them? Truly they thought they had
seen a spirit. One would have thought such men as
they, who had the vision of God manifest in the flesh,
should not have been so much surprised if they had
seen a spirit, that is to say, seen an apparition, for to
see a spirit seems to be an allusion, not an expression to
be used literally, a spirit being not visible by the organ
of human sight.
But what if it had been a spirit i If it had been a
good spirit, what had they to fear? And if a bad spirit,
what would crying out have assisted them? When
people cry out in such cases, it is either for help, and then they cry to others; or for mercy, and then they
cry to the subject of their terror to spare them. Either
way it was either the foolishest or the wickedest thing
that ever was done by such grave men as the apostles;
for if it was a good spirit as before, they had no need
to cry out; and if it was a bad one, who did they cry
to? for 'tis evident they did not pray to God, or cross
and bless themselves, as was afterwards the fashion; but
they cried out, that is to say, they either cried out for
help, which was great nonsense to call to man for help
against the devil; or they cried to the spirit they saw,
that it might not hurt them, which was, in short, neither
less nor more than praying to the devil.
This put me in mind of the poor savages in many of
the countries of America and Africa, who, really in-
structed by their fear, that is to say, by mere nature,
worship the devil that he may not hurt them.
Here I must digress a little, and make a transition
from the story of the spirit to the strange absurdities of
men's notions at that time, and particularly of those upon
whom the first impressions of Christ's preachings were
wrought; and if it be looked narrowly into, one cannot
but wonder what strange ignorant people even the
disciples themselves were at first; and indeed their
ignorance continued a great while, even to after the
death of Christ Himself—witness the foolish talk of
the two disciples going to Emmaus. It is true they were
wiser afterwards when they were better taught; but
the Scripture is full of the discoveries of their igno-
rance, as in the notions of sitting at His right hand
and His left in His kingdom, asked for by Zebedee's
children; no doubt but the good woman their mother
thought one of her sons should be lord treasurer
there, and the other lord chancellor, and she could
not but think those places their due when she saw
them in such favour with Him here. Just so in their notion of seeing a spirit here, which put them
into such a fright, and indeed they might be said,
according to our dull way of thinking, to be frighted
out of their wits; for had their senses been in exer-
cise, they would either have rejoiced in the appearance
of a good angel, and stood still to hear his message as
from Heaven, or prayed to God to deliver them out
of the hands of the devil on their supposing it, as
above, to be a vision from hell.
But I come to the subject. It is evident that the
notion of spirits, and their intermeddling with the affairs
of men, and even of their appearing to men, prevailed
so universally in those ages of the world, that even God's
own people, who were instructed from Himself, believed
it, nor is there anything in all the New Testament in-
stitution to contradict it, though many things to confirm
it; such particularly as the law against what is called a
familiar spirit, which was esteemed no better or worse
than a conversing with the devil, that is to say, with
some of the evil spirits of the world I speak of.
The witch of Endor, and the story of an apparition
of an old man personating Samuel, which is so plainly
asserted in Scripture, and which the learned opposers of
these notions have spent so much weak pains to disturb
our imaginations about, yet assure us that such appari-
tions are not inconsistent with Nature or with religion;
nay, the Scripture allows this woman to patu <watu, as
the Indians in America call it, and conjure for the
raising this spectre, and when it is come, allows it to
speak a great prophetic truth, foretelling the king, in
all its terrible particulars, what was to happen to him,
and what did befall him the very next day.
Either this appearance must be a good spirit or a
bad; if it was a good spirit it was an angel, as it is ex-
pressed in another place of the Apostle Peter, when he
knocked at the good people's door in Jerusalem (Acts xii. 15); and then it supports my opinion of the spirits
unembodied conversing with and taking care of the
spirits embodied; if it was an evil spirit, then they must
grant God to be making a prophet of the devil, and
making him personate Samuel to foretell things to come;
permitting Satan to speak in the first person of God's
own prophet, and indeed to preach the justice of God's
dealing with Saul for rejecting His prophet Samuel;
which, in short, is not a little odd, putting the spirit of
God into the mouth of the devil, and making Satan a
preacher of righteousness.
When I was in my retirement I had abundance of
strange notions of my seeing apparitions there, and
especially when I happened to be abroad by moonshine,
when every bush looked like a man, and every tree like
a man on horseback; and I so prepossessed myself
with it that I scarce durst look behind me for a good
while, and after that durst not go abroad at all at night;
nay, it grew upon me to such a degree at last, that I as
firmly believed I saw several times real shapes and
appearances, as I do now really believe and am assured
that it was all hypochondriac delusion.
But, however, that the reader may see how far the
power of imagination may go, and judge for me
whether I showed any more folly and simplicity than
other men might do, I'll repeat some little passages,
which for a while gave me very great disturbances,
and every one shall judge for me whether they might
not have been deluded in the like circumstances as
well as I.
The first case was, when I crept into the dark cave
in the valley, where the old goat lay just expiring,
which, wherever it happened, is a true history, I assure
you.
When first I was stopped by the noise of this poor
dying creature, you are to observe that the voice was III. Q
not only like the voice of a man, but even articulate,
only that I could not form any words from it; and
what did that amount to more or less than this, namely,
that it spoke, but only it was in a language that I did
not understand. If it was possible to describe the
surprise of my spirits on that occasion, I would do it
here, how all my blood run, or rather stood still,
chilled in my veins, how a cold dew of sweat sat on
my forehead, how my joints, like Belshazzar's knees,
shook one against another, and how, as I said, my hair
would have lifted off my hat if I had had one on my
head.
But this is not all. After the first noise of the
creature, which was a faint, dying kind of imperfect
bleating, not unusual, as I found afterward; I say,
after this he fetched two or three deep sighs, as lively,
and as like human, as it is possible to imagine, as I
have also said.
These were so many confirmations of my surprise,
besides the sight of his two glaring eyes, and carried it
up to the extreme of fright and amazement; how I
afterwards conquered this childish beginning, and mus-
tered up courage enough to go into the place with a
firebrand for light, and how I was presently satisfied
with seeing the creature whose condition made all the
little accidental noises appear rational, I have already
said.
But I must acknowledge that this real surprise left
some relics or remains behind it that did not wear
quite off a great while, though I struggled hard with
them; the vapours that were raised at first were never
so laid but that on every trifling occasion they re-
turned; and I saw, nay, I felt apparitions as plainly
and distinctly as ever I felt or saw any real substance
in my life.
The like was the case with me before that, when I first found the print of a man's foot upon the sand, by
the seaside, on the north part of the island.
And these, I say, having left my fancy a little
peevish and wayward, I had frequently some returns of
these vapours, on differing occasions, and sometimes
even without occasion; nothing but mere hypochon-
driac whimsies, fluttering of the blood, and rising of
vapours, which nobody could give any account of but
myself.
For example, it was one night, after my having
seen some odd appearances in the air, of no great sig-
nificance, that coming home, and being in bed, but not
asleep, I felt a pain in one of my feet, after which it
came to a kind of numbness in my foot, which a little
surprised me, and after that a kind of tingling in my
blood, as if it had been some distemper running up
my leg. On a sudden I felt, as it were, something alive lie
upon me, as if it had been a dog lying upon my bed,
from my knee downwards, about half way up my leg,
and immediately afterwards I felt it heavier, and felt it
as plainly roll itself upon me upwards upon my thigh,
for I lay on one side, I say, as if it had been a
creature lying upon me with all his weight, and turn-
ing his body upon me.
It was so lively and sensible to me, and I remember
it so perfectly well, though it is now many years ago,
that my blood chills and flutters about my heart at the
very writing it. I immediately flung myself out of my
bed and flew to my musket, which stood always ready
at my hand, and naked as I was, laid about me upon
the bed in the dark, and everywhere else that I could
think of where anybody might stand or lie, but could
find nothing. "Lord deliver me from an evil spirit,"
said I, " what can this be?" And being tired with
groping about, and having broke two or three of my earthen pots with making blows here and there to no
purpose, I went to light my candle, for my lamp which
I used to burn in the night either had not been lighted,
or was gone out.
When I lighted a candle, I could easily see there
was no living creature in the place with me but the
poor parrot, who was waked and frighted, and cried
out, "Hold your tongue," and "What's the matter
with you?" Which words he learned of me, from
my frequent saying so to him, when he used to make
his ordinary wild noise and screaming that I did not
like.
The more I was satisfied that there was nothing in
the room, at least to be seen, the more another concern
came upon me. "Lord!" says I aloud, "this is the
devil!" "Hold your tongue," says Poll. I was so
mad at the bird, though the creature knew nothing of
the matter, that if he had hung near me, I believe I
should have killed him. I put my clothes on, and sat
me down, for I could not find in my heart to go to
bed again, and as I sat down, " I am terribly frighted,"
said I. "What's the matter with you i" says Poll.
"You toad," said I, "I'd knock your brains out if
you were here." "Hold your tongue," says he again,
and then fell to chattering "Robin Crusoe," and "Poor
Robin Crusoe," as he used to do.
Had I been in any reach of a good temper, it had
been enough to have composed me, but I was quite
gone; I was fully possessed with a belief that it was
the devil, and I prayed most heartily to God to be
delivered from the power of the evil spirit.
After some time I composed myself a little, and
went to bed again, and lying just in the posture as I
was in before, I felt a little of the tingling in my
blood which I felt before, and I resolved to lie still,
let it be what it would; it came up as high as my 
knee, as before, but no higher; and now I began to
see plainly that it was all a distemper, that it was
something paralytic, and that affected the nerves; but
I had not either experience of such a thing, or know-
ledge of diseases enough to be fully satisfied of the
nature of them, and whether anything natural, any
numbness or dead palsy affecting one part of the thigh,
could feel as that did, till some months after that I
felt something of the very same again at my first lying
down in my bed for three or four nights together,
which at first gave me a little concern as a distemper,
but at last gave me such satisfaction, that the first was
nothing but the same thing in a higher degree; that
the pleasure of knowing it was only a disease was far
beyond the concern at the danger of it, though a dead
palsy to one in my condition might reasonably have
been one of the most frightful things in Nature, since,
having nobody to help me, I must have inevitably
perished for mere want of food, not being able to go
from place to place to fetch it.
But to go back to the case in hand, and to the
apprehension I had been in all the several months
that passed between the first of this and the last, I
went about with a melancholy, heavy heart, fully
satisfied that the devil had been in my room, and lay
upon my bed.
Sometimes I would try to argue myself a little out
of it, asking myself whether it was reasonable to
imagine the devil had nothing else to do than to come
thither, and only lie down upon me, and go away about
his business, and say not one word to me; what end
it could answer; and whether I thought the devil was
really busied about such trifles; or whether he had
not employment enough of a higher nature, so that
such a thing as that could be worth his while.
But still, then, I was answered with my own thoughts returning thus—What could it be? Or, if
it was not a devil, what was it? This I could not
answer by any means at all; and so I still sunk under
the belief that it was the devil, and nothing but the
devil.
You may be sure, while I had this fancy in my
head, I was of course overrun with the vapours, and
had all the hypochondriac fancies that ever any melan-
choly head could entertain; and what with ruminating
on the print of a foot upon the sand, and the weight of
the devil upon me in my bed, I made no difficulty to
conclude that the old gentleman really visited the
place; and, in a word, it had been easy to have
possessed me, if I had continued so much longer, that
it was an enchanted island, that there were a million
of evil spirits in it, and that the devil was lord of the
manor.
I scarce heard the least noise, near or far off, but I
started, and expected to see a devil; every distant
bush upon a hill, if I did not particularly remember it
before, was a man, and every stump an apparition;
and I scarce went twenty yards together, by night or
by day, without looking behind me.
Sometimes, indeed, I took a little heart, and would
say, "Well, let it be the devil if it will! God is
master of the devil, and he can do me no hurt unless
he is permitted; he can be nowhere but He that made
him is there too;" and, as I said afterwards, when I
was frighted with the old goat in a cave, "He is not
fit to live all alone in such an island for twenty years
that would be afraid to see the devil."
But all these things lasted but a short while, and the
vapours that were raised at first were not to be so
easily laid; for, in a word, it was not mere imagination,
but it was the imagination raised up to disease; nor
did it ever quite wear off till I got my man Friday with me, of whom I have said so much; and then,
having company to talk to, the hypo wore off, and I
did not see any more devils after that.
Before I leave this part, I cannot but give a caution
to all vapourish, melancholy people, whose imaginations
run this way; I mean about seeing the devil, appari-
tions, and the like; namely, that they should never
look behind them, and over their shoulders, as they go
upstairs, or look into the corners and holes of rooms
with a candle in their hands, or turn about to see who
may be behind them in any walks or dark fields, lanes,
or the like; for let such know, they will see the devil
whether he be there or no; nay, they will be so
persuaded that they do see him, that their very imagina-
tion will be a devil to them wherever they go.
But after all this is said, let nobody suggest that
because the brain-sick fancy, the vapourish hypochon-
driac imagination represents spectres and spirits to us,
and makes apparitions for us, that therefore there are
no such things as spirits, both good and evil, any more
than we should conceive that there is no devil, because
we do not see him.
The devil has witnesses of his being and nature, just
as God Himself has of His; they are not indeed so
visible or so numerous, but we are all able to bring
evidence of the existence of the devil from our own
frailties, as we are to bring evidence of the existence
of God from the faculties of our souls, and from the
contexture of our bodies.
As our propensity to evil rather than good is a
testimony of the original depravity of human nature, so
the harmony between the inclination and the occasion
is a testimony which leaves the presence of the evil
spirit with us out of question.
Not that the devil is always the agent in our tempta-
tions, for though the devil is a very diligent fellow, and L-
always appears ready to fall in with the allurement,
yet the Scripture clears him, and we must do so too,
of being the main tempter; 'tis our own corrupt,
debauched inclination, which is the first moving agent;
and therefore the Scripture says, "A man is tempted
when he is drawn away of his own lusts, and enticed."
The devil, who, as I said, is a very diligent fellow in
the infernal work, and is always ready to forward the
mischief, is also a very cunning fellow, and knows how
most dexterously to suit alluring objects to the allurable
dispositions; to procure ensnaring things, and lay them
in the way of the man whom he finds so easily to be
ensnared; and he never fails to prompt all the mischief
he can, full of stratagem and art, to ensnare us by the
help of our corrupt affections, and these are called
"Satan's devices."
But having charged Satan home in that part, I must
do the devil that justice as to own that he is the most
slandered, most abused creature alive; thousands of
crimes we lay to his charge that he is not guilty of;
thousands of our own infirmities we load him with
which he has no hand in; and thousands of our sins,
which, as bad as he is, he knows nothing of 5 calling
him our tempter, and pretending we did so and so as
the devil would have it, when on the contrary the
devil had no share in it, and we were only led away
of our own lusts, and enticed.
But now, having made this digression in the devil's
defence, I return to the main question, that of the
being of the devil, and of evil spirits; this I believe,
there is no room to doubt of; but this, as I have observed,
is not the thing; these are not the spirits I am speak-
ing of, but I shall come directly to what I mean, and
speak plain without any possibility of being misunder-
stood.
I make no question but that there is not only a world of spirits, but that there is a certain knowledge
of it, though to us impossible as to the manner of it;
there is a certain converse between the world of spirits,
and the spirits in this world; that is to say, between
spirits uncased or unembodied and souls of men em-
bodied or cased up in flesh and blood, as we all are
on this side death.
It is true that we cannot describe this converse
of spirits, as to the way of it, the manner of the
communication, or how things are mutually conveyed
from one to another. How intelligences are given
or received, we know not; we know but little of their
being conveyed this way from the spirits unembodied
to ours that are in life; and of their being conveyed
that way, namely, from us to them—of that we know
nothing. The latter certainly is done without the
help of the organ, the former is conveyed by the
understanding, and the retired faculties of the soul, of
which we can give very little account.
"For spirits, without the help of voice, converse."
Let me, however, give, as reasons for my opinion,
some account of the consequences of this converse of
spirits; I mean, such as are quite remote from what
we call apparition or appearance of spirits; and I omit
these, because I know they are objected much against,
and they bear much scandal from the frequent imposi-
tions of our fancies and imaginations upon our judg-
ments and understandings, as above.
But the more particular discoveries of this converse
of spirits, and which to me are undeniable, are such
as follows, namely,—
Dreams Impulses Involuntary sad- Voices Hints ness, &c.
Noises Apprehensions Dreams are dangerous things to talk of; and we
have such dreaming about them, that indeed the least
encouragement to lay any weight upon them is presently
carried away by a sort of people that dream waking,
and that run into such wild extremes about them, that
indeed we ought to be very cautious what we say of
them.
It is certain dreams of old were the ways by which
God Himself was pleased to warn men, as well what
to do, as what not to do; what services to perform,
what evils to shun. Joseph, the husband of the blessed
Virgin Mary, was appeared to in both these (Matt. ii.
13, 19). He was directed of God, in a dream, to go
into Egypt; and he was bid return out of Egypt in a
dream; and in the same chapter, the wise men of the
East were warned of God in a dream to depart into
their own country another way to avoid the fury of
Herod.
Now as this, and innumerable instances through the
whole Scripture, confirm that God did once make use
of this manner to convey knowledge and instruction to
men, I wish I could have this question well answered,
viz., Why are we now to direct people to take no notice
of their dreams?
But farther; it appears that this was not only the
method God Himself took by His immediate power,
but it is evident He made use of it by the ministry
of spirits; the Scripture says in both the cases of
Joseph above named, that the "angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a dream." Now every unem-
bodied spirit is an angel of the Lord in some sense;
and as angels and spirits may be the same thing in
respect of this influence upon us in dreams, so it is
still; and when any notice for good, or warning against
evil, is given us in a dream, I think 'tis no arrogance
at all for us to say the angel of the Lord appeared to us in a dream; or to say some good spirit gave me
warning of this in a dream ;— take this which way you
will.
That I may support this with such undeniable argu-
ments, drawn from examples of the fact, as no man
will, or reasonably can oppose, I first appeal to the
experience of observing people; I mean, such people
as observe these things without a superstitious depen-
dence upon the signification of them, that look upon
dreams but with such a moderate regard to them as
may direct to a right use of them. The question I
would ask of such is, whether they have never found
any remarkable event of their lives so evidently fore-
told them by a dream, as that it must of necessity be
true that some invisible being foresaw the event, and
gave them notice of it? And that, had that notice
been listened to, and the natural prudence used which
would have been used if it had been certainly dis-
covered, that evil event might have been prevented?
I would ask others whether they have not, by
dreams, been so warned of evil really approaching, as
that, taking the hint, and making use of the caution
given in those dreams, the evil has been avoided? If
I may speak my own experience, I must take leave to
say, that I never had any capital mischief befall me in
my life but I have had notice of it by a dream; and
if I had not been that thoughtless, unbelieving creature,
which I now would caution other people against, I
might have taken many a warning, and avoided many
of the evils that I afterwards fell into merely by a total
obstinate neglect of those dreams.
In like manner I have in some of the greatest
distresses of my life been encouraged to believe firmly
and fully that I should one time or other be delivered;
and I must acknowledge, that in my greatest and most
hopeless banishment I had such frequent dreams of my deliverance, that I always entertained a firm and satis-
fying belief that my last days would be better than my
first; all which has effectually come to pass.
From which I cannot determine, as I know some
do, that all dreams are mere dozings of a delirious
head, delusions of a waking devil, and relics of the
day's thoughts and perplexities, or pleasures. Nor do
I see any period of time fixed between the two op-
posite circumstances — namely, when dreams were to
be esteemed the voice of God and when the delusion
of the devil.
I know some have struggled hard to fix that par-
ticular article, and to settle it as a thing going hand
in hand with the Jewish institutions; as if the oracle
ceasing in the temple with the consummation of the
typical law, all the methods which Heaven was pleased
to take in the former times for revealing His will to
men were to cease also at the same time, and the
Gospel revelation being fully and effectually supplied
by the mission of the Holy Spirit, dreams and all the
uses and significations of dreams were at an end, and
the esteem and regard to the warnings and instructions
of dreams was to expire also.
But the Scripture is point-blank against this in the
history of fact relating to Ananias and the conversion
of St Paul, and in the story of St. Peter and Cornelius,
the devout centurion at Antioch; both of them emi-
nent instances of God's giving notice of His pleasure
to men by the interposition or medium of a dream.
The first of these is in Acts ix. 10: "There was a
certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. To
him said the Lord in a vision," &c.; the words
spoken in this vision to Ananias, directing to go to
seek out one Saul of Tarsus, go on thus (ver. 12),
"and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias
coming in."

The other passage is of St. Peter and Cornelius the
centurion (Acts x. vers. 3, 10, 11). In the third verse
it is said, Cornelius, fasting and praying, saw a vision,
which afterwards, in the 22nd verse, is called an holy
angel warning him; in the 30th verse it is said, "a
man stood before me in bright clothing;" at the same
time (ver. 10) it is said, St. Peter was praying and fell
into a trance — this we all agreed to be a possession of
sleep, or a deep sleep — and in this trance it is said he
saw heaven opened; that is to say, he dreamed that
he saw heaven opened; it could be nothing else, for
no interpreters will offer to insist that heaven was
really opened; also, the hearing a voice (vers. 13, 15)
must be in a dream. Thus 'tis apparent the will of
God concerning what we are to do or not to do, what
is or is not to befall us, is and has been thus conveyed
by vision or dream since the expiration of the Levitical
dispensation, and since the mission of the Holy Ghost.
When, then, did it cease 1 And if we do not know
when it ceased, how then are we sure it is at all ceased,
and what authority have we now to reject all dreams
or visions of the night, as they are called, more than
formerly?
I will not say but there may be more nocturnal
delusions now in the world than there were in those
times; and perhaps the devil may have gained more
upon mankind in these days than he had then, though
we are not let into those things enough to know
whether it is so or not; nor do we know that there
were not as many unsignifying dreams in those days
as now, and perhaps as much to be said against
depending upon them 5 though I think there is not
one word in Scripture said to take off the regard men
might give to dreams, or to lessen the weight which
they might lay on them.
The only text that I think looks like it is the flout Joseph's brethren put upon him, or threw out at him,
when they were speaking of him with contempt (Gen.
xxxvii. 19), "Behold, this dreamer cometh; and
again (ver. 20), "Let us slay him and cast him into
some pit, and we shall see what will become of his
dreams."
This, indeed, looks a little like the present language
against dreams; but even this is sufficiently rebuked
in the consequences, for those dreams of Joseph did
come all to pass, and proving the superior influence
such things have upon the affairs of men, in spite of all
the contempt they can cast upon them.
The maxim I have laid down to myself for my
conduct in this affair is, in few words, that we should
not lay too great stress upon dreams, and yet not
wholly neglect them.
I remember I was once present where a long dis-
pute was warmly carried on between two persons of
my acquaintance upon this very subject, the one a
layman, the other a clergyman, but both very pious
and religious persons. The first thought there was
no heed at all to be given to dreams, that they could
have no justifiable original, that they were delusions
and no more, that it was atheistical to lay any stress
upon them, and that he could give such objections
against them as that no man of good principles could
avoid being convinced by; that as to their being a
communication from the invisible to the visible world
'twas a chimera, and that he saw no foundation for
believing any reality in such a thing, unless I would
set up for a Popish limbus, or purgatory, which had no
foundation in the Scripture.
(1.) He said, if dreams were from the agency of any
prescient being, the notices would be more direct and
the discoveries clear — not by allegories and emblematic
fancies, expressing things imperfect and dark. For to 
what purpose should spirits unembodied sport with
mankind, warning him of approaching mischiefs by
the most ridiculous enigmas, figures, &c., leaving the
wretch to guess what awaited him, though of the
utmost consequence, and to perish if he mistook the
meaning of it; and leaving him sometimes perfectly
at a loss to know whether he was right or wrong, and
without any rule or guide to walk by in the most diffi-
cult cases?
(2.) He objected, that with the notice of evil, sup-
pose it to be rightly understood, there was not given a
power to avoid it, and therefore it could not be alleged
that the notice was any way kind, and that it was not
likely to proceed from a beneficent spirit, but merely
fortuitous, and of no significancy.
(3.) He objected, that if such notices as those were
of such weight, why were they not constant, but that
sometimes they were given and sometimes omitted,
though cases were equally important? and that, there-
fore, they did not seem to proceed from any agent
whose actions were to be fairly accounted for.
(4.) He said, that oftentimes we had very distinct
and formal dreams, without any signification at all, that
we could neither know anything probable or anything
rational of them; and that it would be profane to
suggest that to come from heaven which was too
apparently foolish and inconsistent.
(5.) As men were not always thus warned, or sup-
plied with notices of good or evil, so all men were
not alike supplied with them; and what reason could
we give why one man or one woman should not have
the same hints as another?
The clergyman gave distinct answers to all these
objections, and to me, I confess, very satisfactory;
whether they may be so to those that read them, is no
concern of mine; let every one judge for himself.
(1.) He said, that as to the signification of dreams,
and the objections against them, because dark and
doubtful, that they are expressed generally by hiero-
glyphical representations, similes, allusions, and figurative
emblematic ways of expressing things, was true, and
that by this means, for want of interpretation, the thing
was not understood, and consequently the evil not
shunned. This, he said, was the only difficulty that
remained to him in the case, but that he could see
nothing in it against the signification of them, because
thus it was before, for dreams were often allegoric and
allusive when they were evidently from God, and what
the end and design of Providence in that was, we
could not pretend to inquire.
(2.) To the second he said, we charged God fool-
ishly, to say He had given the notice of evil without
the power to avoid it, which he denied, and affirmed
that, if any one had not power to avoid the evil, it was
no notice to him that it was want of giving due heed
to that notice, not for want of the notice being suffi-
cient that any evil followed, and that men first neglected
themselves, and then charged the Judge of all the
earth with not doing right.
(3.) Likewise he said, the complaint that these notices
were not constant, was unjust, for he doubted not but
they were so, but our discerning was crazed and
clouded by our negligence in not taking due notice
of it; that we hookwinked our understanding by pre-
tending dreams were not to be regarded; and the
voice really spoke, but we refused to hear, being
negligent of our own good.
(4.) In the same sense he answered the fourth, and
it was a mistake to say that sometimes dreams had
no import at all; he said it was only to be said, none
that we could perceive the reason of, which was owing
to our blindness and supine negligence, to be secure at one time, and our heads too much alarmed at another,
so that the spirit which we might be said to be con-
versing with in a dream was constantly and equally
kind and careful; but our powers not always in the
same state of action, nor equally attentive to or reten-
tive of the hints that were given, or things might be
rendered more or less intelligible to us, as the powers
of our soul were more or less dozed or somniated with
the oppression of vapours from the body, which occa-
sions sleep; for though the soul cannot be said to sleep
itself, yet how far its operations may be limited, and
the understanding prescribed by the sleepiness of the
body, says he, I will not undertake; let the anatomist
judge of it who can account for the contexture of
the parts, and for their operations, which I cannot
answer to.
(5.) As to the last question, why people are not
equally supplied with such warnings, he said, this
seemed to be no question at all in the case, for Provi-
dence itself might have some share in the direction of
it, and then that Providence might perhaps be limited
by some superior direction, the same that guides all the
solemn dispositions of Nature, and was a wind blowing
where it listeth; that as to the converse of spirits,
though he allowed the thing itself, yet he did not tie it
up to a stated course of conversing, that it should be
the same always, and to all people, and on all occa-
sions, but that it seemed to be spontaneous, and conse-
quently arbitrary, as if the spirits unembodied had it
left to them to converse as they thought fit, how,
where, and with whom they would; that all he an-
swered for in that discourse was for the thing itself,
that such a thing there was, but why there was so
much of it, or why no more, was none of his business,
and he believed a discovery was not yet made to man-
kind of that part. III. R
I thought it would be much to the purpose to remark
this opinion of another man, because it corresponded
so exactly with my own; but I have not done with my
friend, for he led me into another inquiry, which, in-
deed, I had not taken so much notice of before, and
this was introduced by the following question:—
"You seem," says he, "to be very inquisitive about
dreams, and to doubt — though I think you have no
reason for it — of the reality of the world of spirits,
which dreams are such an evidence of. Pray," says
he, "what think you of waking dreams, trances, visions,
noises, voices, hints, impulses, and all these waking
testimonies of an invisible world, and of the communi-
cation that there is between us and them, which are
generally entertained with our eyes open?"
This led me into many reflections upon past things,
which I had been witness to as well in myself as in
other people, and particularly in my former solitudes,
when I had many occasions to mark such things as
these, and I could not but entertain a free conversa-
tion with my friend upon this subject as often as I had
opportunity, of which I must give some account.
I had one day been conversing so long with him
upon the common received notions of the planets being
habitable, and of a diversity of worlds, that I think
verily I was for some days like a man transported into
these regions myself. Whether my imagination is more
addicted to realising the things I talk of, as if they
were in view, I know not, or whether by the power of
the converse of spirits I speak of I was at that ti.ne enabled to entertain clearer ideas of the invisible world,
I really cannot tell, but I certainly made a journey to
all those supposed habitable bodies in my imagination,
and I know not but it may be very useful to tell you
what I met with in my way, and what the wiser I
am for the discovery; whether you will be the wiser 
for the relation at second hand, I cannot answer for
that.
I could make a long discourse here of the power of
imagination, and how bright the ideas of distant things
may be found in the mind when the soul is more than
ordinarily agitated. It is certain the extraordinary
intelligence conveyed in this manner is not always re-
gular; sometimes it is exceeding confused, and the
brain being not able to digest it, turns round too fast;
this tends to lunacy and distraction, and the swiftness
of the motion these ideas come in with occasions a
commotion in Nature; the understanding is mobbed
with them, disturbed, runs from one thing to another,
and digests nothing; this is well expressed in our
common way of talking of a madman, namely, that his
head is turned. Indeed, I can liken it to nothing so
well as to the wheels of a windmill, which, if the sails
or wings are set, and the wind blow a storm, run round
so fast, that they will set all on fire if a skilful hand
be not ready to direct and manage it.
But not to enter upon this whimsical description of
lunacy, which, perhaps, may be nobody's opinion but
my own, I proceed thus, that when the head is strong,
and capable of the impressions, when the understanding
is empowered to digest the infinite variety of ideas
which present to it from the extended fancy, then, I
say, the soul of man is capable to act strangely upon
the invisibles in Nature, and upon futurity, realising
everything to itself in such a lively manner, that what
it thus thinks of it really sees, speaks to, hears, con-
verses with, &c., as lively as if the substance was really
before his face; and this is what I mean by those that
dream waking, by visions, trances, or what you please
to call them, for it is not necessary to this part that the
man should be asleep.
I return to my share of these things. It was after
ray conversing with my learned friend about the heavenly
bodies, the motion, the distances, and the bulk of the
planets, their situation, and the orbits they move in;
the share of light, heat, and moisture which they
enjoy; their respect to the sun; their influences upon
us; and, at last, the possibility of their being habitable,
with all the arcana of the skies; it was on this occasion,
I say, that my imagination, always given to wander,
took a flight of its own, and as I have told you that
I had an invincible inclination to travel, so I think I
travelled as sensibly, to my understanding, over all the
mazes and wastes of infinite space, in quest of those
things, as ever I did over the deserts of Karakathie,
and the uninhabited wastes of Tartary, and perhaps
may give as useful an account of my journey.
When first my fancy raised me up in the confines of
this vast abyss, and having now travelled through the
misty regions of the atmosphere could look down as
I mounted, and see the world below me, it is scarcely
possible to imagine how little, how mean, how despic-
able everything looked. Let any man but try this
experiment of himself, and he shall certainly find the
same thing; let him but fix his thoughts so intensely
upon what is and must necessarily be seen in a stage or
two higher than where we now live, removed from the
particular converse with the world, as to realise to his
imagination what he can suppose to be there, he shall
find all that is below him, as distant objects always do,
lessen in his mind as they do in his sight.
Could a man subsist without a supply of food, and
live but one mile in perpendicular height from the
surface, he would despise life and the world at such a
rate that he would hardly come down to have it be all
his own; the soul of man is capable of being continually
elevated above the very thoughts of human things — is
capable of travelling up to the highest and most distant regions of light, but when it does, as it rises above
the earthly globe, so the things of this globe sink to
him.
When I was at first lifted up in my imaginary travels,
this was the first thing of moment I remarked, namely,
how little the world and everything about it seemed to
me. I am not given to preach, or drawing long
corollaries, as the learned call them, but I recommend
it to my friends to observe that, could we always look
upon the things of life with the same eyes as we shall
do when we come to the edge of time, when one eye
can as it were look back on the world, and the other
look forward into eternity, we should save ourselves
the trouble of much repentance, and should scorn to
touch many of those things in which we now fancy
our chief felicity is laid up; believe me, we shall see
more with half an eye then, and judge better at first
glance, than we can now, with all our pretended wisdom
and penetration. In a word, all the passions and
affections suffer a general change upon such a view,
and what we desire before, we contemn them with
abhorrence.
Having begun to soar, the world was soon out of
sight, unless that as I rose higher, and could look at
her in a due position as to the sun, I could see her
turned into a moon, and shine by reflection. "Ay,
shine on," said I, "with thy borrowed rays, for thou
hast but very few of thy own."
When my fancy had mounted me thus beyond the
vestiges of the earth, and leaving the atmosphere behind
me, I had set my firm foot upon the verge of infinite,
when I drew no breath, but subsisted upon pure ether,
it is not possible to express fully the vision of the
place. First, you are to conceive of sight as unconfined,
and you see here at least the whole solar system at
one view. Nor is your sight bounded by the narrow '
circumference of one sun and its attendants of planets,
whose orbits are appropriated to its proper system, but
above and beyond, and on every side, you see innumer-
able suns, and, attending on them, planets, satellites,
and inferior lights, proper to their respective systems,
and all these moving in their subordinate circumstances,
without the least confusion, with glorious light and
splendour inconceivable.
In this first discovery 'tis most natural to observe
how plainly it is to be seen that the reason of the
creation of such immense bodies as the sun, stars,
planets, and moons, in the great circle of the lower
heaven, is far from being to be found in the study of
Nature on the surface of our earth, but he that will see
thoroughly why God has formed the heavens, the
work of His hands, and the moon and the stars which
He has made, must soar up higher, and then, as he will
see with other eyes than he did before, so he will see
the God of Nature has formed an infinite variety which
we know nothing of, and that all the creatures are a
reason to one another for their creation.
I could not forget myself, however, when I was got
up thus high; I say, I could not but look back upon
the state of man in this life, how confined from these
discoveries, how vilely employed in biting and devour-
ing, envying and maligning one another, and all for the
vilest trifles that can be conceived.
But I was above it all here, and all those things
which appeared so afflicting before gave me not the
least concern now; for the soul being gone of this
errand had quite different notices of the whole state of
life, and was neither influenced by passions or affections,
as it was before.
Here I saw into many things by the help of a sedate
inquiry, that we can entertain little or no notion of in a
state of common superficial life, and I desire to leave a few remarks of this imaginary journey, as I did of my
ordinary travels.
When I came, I say, to look into the solar system
as I have hinted, I saw perfectly the emptiness of our
modern notions that the planets were habitable worlds,
and shall give a brief description of the case, that others
may see it too, without the necessity of taking so long
a journey.
And first for the word habitable: I understand the
meaning of it to be, that the place it is spoken of is
qualified for the subsistence and existence of man and
beast, and to preserve the vegetative and sensitive life,
and you may depend upon it that none of the planets,
except the moon, are in this sense habitable; and the
moon, a poor, little, watery, damp thing, not above as
big as Yorkshire, neither worth being called a world,
nor capable of rendering life comfortable to mankind,
if indeed supportable; and if you will believe one's
mind capable of seeing at so great a distance, I assure
you I did not see man, woman, or child there in all my
contemplative voyage to it: my meaning is, I did not
see the least reason to believe there was or could be any
there. As to the rest of the planets, I will take them
in their order. Saturn (the remotest from the sun,
which is in the centre of the system) is a vast extended
globe, of a substance cold and moist; its greatest degree
of light is never so much as our greatest darkness may
be said to be in clear weather, and its cold insufferable;
and if it were a body composed of the same elements
as our earth, its sea would be all brass, and its earth all
iron; that is to say, both would be continually frozen,
as the north pole in the winter solstice. What man
or men, and of what nature, could inhabit this frigid
planet, unless the Creator must be supposed to have
created animal creatures for the climate, not the climate
for the creatures? All the notions of Saturn's being a r
habitable world are contrary to nature, and incongruous
with sense; for Saturn is at so infinite a distance from
the sun, that it has not above one-ninetieth part of the
light and heat that we enjoy on our earth; so that the
light there may be said to be much less than our star-
light, and the cold ninety times greater than the coldest
day in our winter.
Jupiter is in the same predicament; his constitution,
however, in its degree much milder than Saturn, yet
certainly is not qualified for human bodies to subsist,
having only one twenty-seventh part of the light and
heat that we enjoy here; consequently its light is at
best as dim as our twilight, and its heat so little in the
summer of its situation as to be as far from comfortable
as it is in its winter situation insupportable.
Mars, if you will believe our ancient philosophers, is
a fiery planet in the very disposition of its influence, as
well as by the course of its motion; and yet even here
the light is not above one-half, and its heat one-third
of ours. And on the other hand, as Saturn is cold
and moist, so this planet is hot and dry, and would
admit no habitation of man, through the manifest in-
temperance of the air, as well as want of light to make
it comfortable, and moisture to make it fruitful; for by
the nature of the planet, as well as by clear-sighted
observation, there is never any rain, vapour, fog, or
dew in that planet.
Venus and Mercury are in the extreme the other
way, and would destroy nature by their heat and dazzling
light, as the other would by their darkness and cold;
so that you may depend upon it I could see very
clearly that all these bodies were neither inhabited
or habitable; and the earth only, as we call it, being
seated between these intemperances, appeared habitable,
surrounded with an atmosphere to defend it from the
invasion of the inconsistent ether, in which perspiration 
could not be performed by the lungs, and by which the
needful vapour it sends forth is preserved from dissipat-
ing into the waste and abyss, and is condensed, and
timely returns in showers of rain to moisten, cool, and
nourish the exhausted earth.
It is true the way I went was no common road, yet
I found abundance of passengers going to and fro here,
and particularly innumerable armies of good and evil
spirits, who all seemed busily employed, and continu-
ally upon the wing, as if some expresses passed between
the earth, which in this part of my travels I place
below me, and some country infinitely beyond all that
I could reach the sight of; for, by the way, though
I take upon me in this sublime journey to see a great
deal of the invisible world, yet I was not arrived to
a length to see into any part of the world of light
beyond it all. That vision is beyond all, and I pretend
to say nothing of it here, except this only, that a
clear view of this part with optics unclouded is a
great step to prepare the mind for a look into the
other.
But to return to my station in the highest created
world; flatter not yourselves that those regions are
uninhabited because the planets appear to be so. No,
no; I assure you this is that world of spirits, or at
least is a world of spirits.
Here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being
the prince of the power of the air; 'tis in this bound-
less waste he is confined, whether it be his busy rest-
less inclination has posted him here, that he may
affront God in His government of the world, and do
injury to mankind in mere envy to his happiness, as
the famed Mr. Milton says it, or whether it is that
by the eternal decree of Providence he is appointed
to be man's continual disturber for Divine ends, to us
unknown; this I had not wandered far enough to be informed of, those secrets being lodged much higher
than imagination itself ever travelled. But here, I say, I found Satan keeping his court, or
camp we may call it, which we please. The innumer-
able legions that attended his immediate service were
such that it is not at all to be wondered that he
supplied every angle of this world, and had his work
going forward, not in every country only, but even in
every individual inhabitant of it, with all the dexterity
and application imaginable.
This sight gave me a just idea of the devil as a
tempter, but really let me into a secret which I did not
so well know before, or at least did not consider,
namely, that the devil is not capable of doing half the
mischief in the world that we lay to his charge. That
he works by engines and agents, stratagems and art, is
true, and a great deal is owing to his vigilance and
application, for he is a very diligent fellow in his calling.
But 'tis plain his power is not so great as we imagine;
he can only prompt to the crime — he cannot force us to
commit it; so that if we sin it is all our own, the
devil has only to be charged with the art of insinuation.
Just as he began with Eve, he goes on with us; in
short, he reasons us out of our resolutions to do well,
and wheedles us to an agreement to do ill, working us
up to an opinion, that what evil we are about to do is
no sin, or not so great a sin as we feared, and so draws
us by art into the crime we had resolved against. This,
indeed, the Scripture intimates when it speaks of Satan's
devices, the subtlety of the wicked one, his lying in
wait, &c. But to charge the devil with forcing us to
offend, is doing the devil a great deal of wrong; our
doing evil is from the native propensity of our wills:
humanum est peccare. I will not enter here into the
dispute about original corruption in nature, which I know
many good and learned men dispute; but that there is a secret aptness to offend, and a secret backwardness
to what is good, which, if it is not born with us, we
can give no account how we came by, this I think
every man will grant; and that this is the devil that
tempts us the Scripture plainly tells us, when it says,
"Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his
own lust and enticed."
There is a secret love of folly and vanity in the
mind, and mankind are hurried down the stream of
their own affections into crime; 'tis agreeable to them
to do this, and 'tis a force upon nature not to do it.
Vice is down hill, and when we do offend,
'Tis nature all, we act as we intend.
Virtue's up hill, and all against the grain,
Resolved reluctant, and pursued with pain.
But to return to the devil: his power not extending
to creation, and being not able to force the world into
an open rebellion against Heaven, as doubtless he would
do if he could, he is left to the exercise of his skill;
and, in a word, we may say of him, that he lives by his
wits, that is to say, maintains his kingdom by subtlety
and most exquisite cunning; and if my vision of his
politics is not a new discovery, I am very much
mistaken.
His innumerable legions, as I hinted above, like
aides-de-camp to a general, are continually employed to
carry his orders and execute his commissions in all
parts of the world, and in every individual to oppose
the authority of God and the felicity of man to the
utmost of his power.
The first and greatest part of his government is over
those savage nations where he has obtained to set him-
self up as God, and to be worshipped instead of God;
and I observed that though, having full possession of
these people, even by whole nations at a time, that is
the easiest part of his government; yet he is far from neglecting his interest there, but is exceeding vigilant to
keep up his authority among those people. This he
does by sending messengers into those parts to answer
the pawawings or conjurings even of the most ignorant
old wizard, raising storms and making noises, and
shrieks in the air, flashes of infernal fire, and anything
but to fright the people, that they may not forget him,
and that they may have no other gods but him.
He has his peculiar agents for this work, which he
makes detachments of, as his occasions require, some
to one part of the world, some to another, as to the
North America, even as far as to the frozen provinces
of Greenland; to the north of Europe, to the Lap-
landers, Samoiedes, and Mongol Tartars; also to the
Gog and Magog of Asia, and to the devil-makers of
China and Japan; again to the southern parts of Asia,
to the isles of the Indian and South Seas, and to the
south part of America and Africa.
Through all these parts he has an uncontrolled power,
and is either worshipped in person or by his representa-
tives, the idols and monsters which the poor people bow
down to, and Satan has very little trouble with them.
He employs, indeed, some millions of his missionaries
into those countries, who labour ad propagand. Jid., and
fail not to return and bring him an account of their
success, and I doubt not but some of them were at my
hand in my island when the savages appeared there;
for if the devil had not been in them, they would hardly
have come straggling over the sea so far to devour one
another.
In all these countries the brutality, the cruelty, and
ravenous bloody dispositions of the people, is to me a
certain testimony that the devil has full possession of
them.
But to return to my observations in the exalted state
of my fancy; I must tell you that though the devil carried on his schemes of government in those blinded
parts of the world with great ease and all things went to
his mind, I found he had more difficulty in the north-
ern parts of the temperate zone; I mean, our climate
and the rest of Christendom, and consequently he did
not act here by whole squadrons and by generals, but
was obliged to carry on his business among us by
particular solicitations, to act by particular agents upon
particular persons, attacking the personal conduct of
men in a manner peculiar to himself. But so far was
this difficulty from being any advantage to the world,
or disadvantage to the devil, that it only obliged him to
make use of the more engines; and as he had no want
of numbers, I observed that his whole clan seemed busy
on this side, the number of which consists of innumer-
able millions; so that, in short, there was not a devil
wanting, no, not to manage every individual man,
woman, and child in the world.
How, and in what manner, evil angels attend us,
what their business, how far their power extends, and
how far it is restrained, and by whom, were all made
plain to me at one view in this state of eclaircissement
that I stood in now, and I will describe it if I can in
a few heads of fact; you may enlarge upon them as
experience guides.
And first, the limitations of the devil's power are
necessary to be understood, and how directed. For
example, you must know, that though the numbers
of these evil spirits, which are thus diligently employed
in mischief, are so infinitely great, yet the numbers of
good angels or good spirits which are employed by a
superior authority, and from a place infinitely distant
and high above the devil's bounds, is not only equal,
I say equal at least, in number, but infinitely superior
in power, and it is this particular which makes it plain
that all the devil does, or that his agents can do, is by continual subtlety, extreme vigilance and application,
under infinite checks, rebukes, and callings off by the
attendant spirits, who have power to correct and re-
strain him upon all occasions, just as a man does a dog
or a thief when he is discovered.
On this account it is first plain, I say, that the devil
can do nothing by force; he cannot kill, maim, hurt,
or destroy; if he could, mankind would have but a
very precarious state of life in the world; nay the
devil cannot blast the fruits of the earth, cause dearth,
droughts, famine, or scarcity; neither can he spread
noxious fumes in the air to infect the world; if any
of those things were in his power, he would soon
unpeople God's creation, and put his Maker to the
necessity of a new fiat, or of having no more human
creatures to worship and honour Him.
You will ask me how I came to know all this? I
say, ask me no questions till the elevation of your fancy
carries you up to the outer edge of the atmosphere, as
I tell you mine did. There you will see the prince of
the air in his full state, managing his universal empire
with the most exquisite art; but if ever you can come
to a clear view of his person, do but look narrowly,
and you will see a great clog at his foot, in token of
his limited power; and though he himself is immense
in bulk, and moves like a fiery meteor in the air, yet
you always see a hand with a thunderbolt impending
just over his head; the arm coming out of a fiery
cloud, which is a token of the sentence he is under,
that at the end of his appointed time that cloud shall
break, and that hand strike him with the thunder
represented, down, down, for ever, into a place pre-
pared for him.
But all this does not hinder him, who is prompted
by infernal rage against the kingdom of God and the
welfare of man, from pushing mankind, as above, upon all the methods of their own ruin and destruction, by
alluring baits, cunning artifice, night whispers, infusing
wicked desires, and fanning the flames of men's lusts,
pride, avarice, ambition, revenge, and all the wicked
excursions of corrupt nature.
It would take up a long tract by itself to form a
system of the devil's politics, and to lay down a body
of his philosophy. I observed, however, that some of
his general rules are such as these:—
(1.) To infuse notions of liberty into the minds of
men; that it is hard they should be born into the
world with inclinations, and then be forbidden to
gratify them; that such and such pleasure should
be prepared in the nature of things, made suitable
and proper to the senses and faculties, which on the
other hand are prepared in mere constitution, and
placed in his soul, and that then he should be for-
bidden, under the penalty of a curse, to taste them;
that to place an appetite in the man, and a strong
powerful gust to these delights, and then declare them
fatal to him, would be laying a snare to mankind in
his very constitution, and making his brightest faculties
be the betrayers of his soul to misery, which would not
consist with justice, much less with the goodness of a
creator. (2.) To persuade from hence, that the notions of
future punishments are fables and amusements, that it
is not rational to think a just God would prepare in-
finite and eternal punishments for finite and trivial
offences; that God does not take notice of the minute
acts of life, and lay every slip to our charge, but that
the merciful dispositions of God, who so bountifully
directs the whole world to be assistant to the profit and
delight of mankind, has certainly given him leave to
enjoy it at will, and take the comfort of it without fear.
(3.) Of late, indeed, the devil has learned—for devils may improve as well as men in the arts of doing
ill — at last, I say, he has learned to infuse a wild
notion into the heads of some people, who are first
fitted for it by having reasoned themselves in favor of
their loose desires up to a pitch, that there is no such
thing as a God or a future state at all.
Now, as at first the devil was not fool enough to
attempt to put this jest upon man, his own antiquity
and eternity being a contradiction to it; so I found
among my new discoveries that the devil took this
absurdity from man himself, and that it went among
Satan's people for a new invention. I found also
that there was a black party employed upon this new
subtlety; these were a sort of devils, for Satan never
wants instruments, who were called insinuators, and
who were formerly employed to prompt men to crimes
by dreams; and here I shall observe, that I learned a
way how to make any man dream of what I please.
For example: suppose one to be sound asleep, or, as
we say, in a deep sleep or dead sleep, let another lay
his mouth close to his ear and whisper anything to
him so softly as not to awaken him, the sleeping man
shall certainly dream of what was so whispered to him.
Let no man despise this hint: nothing is more sure
than that many of our dreams are the whispers of the
devil, who, by his insinuators, whispers into our heads
what wicked things he would have our thoughts enter-
tain and work upon; and take this with you as you
go, those insinuating devils can do this as well when
we are awake as when we are asleep. And this will
bring me to what I call impulses upon the mind, which
are certainly whispers in the ear and no other, and
come either from good angels attending us, or from
the devil's insinuators, which are always at hand, and
may be judged of according as the subject our thoughts
are prompted to work upon is good or evil.
From whence but from these insinuators come our
causeless passions, our involuntary wickedness, sinning
in desire as effectually as by actual committing the
crime we desire to commit?
Whence comes imagination to work upon wicked
and vicious objects when the person is fast asleep, and
when he had not been under the preparation of wicked
discourse or wicked thoughts previous to those imagina-
tions? Who forms ideas in the mind of man? who
presents beautiful or terrible figures to his fancy, when
his eyes are closed with sleep? who but these insinuat-
ing devils, who invisibly approach the man, sleeping
or waking, and whisper all manner of lewd, abominable
things into his mind.
Mr. Milton, whose imagination was carried up to
a greater height than I am now, went farther into
the abyss of Satan's empire a great way, especially
when he formed Satan's palace of pandemonium; I
say, he was exactly of this opinion when he re-
presented the devil tempting our mother Eve in the
shape of a toad lying just at her ear, when she lay
fast asleep in her bower, where he whispered to her
ear all the wicked things which she entertained notions
of by night, and which prompted her the next day
to break the great command, which was the rule of
her life; and, accordingly, he brings in Eve, telling
Adam what an uneasy night's rest she had, and re-
lating her dream to him.
This thought, however laid down in a kind of jest,
is very seriously intended, and would, if well digested,
direct us very clearly in our judgment of dreams, viz.,
not to suggest them to be always things of mere chance;
but that sometimes they are to be heeded as useful
warnings of evil or good by the agency of good spirits,
as at other times they are the artful insinuations of the
devil to inject wicked thoughts and abhorred abominable III S
ideas into the mind; which we ought not only as much
as possible to guard against, but even to repent of so
far as the mind may have entertained and acted upon
them.
From this general vision of the devil's management
of his affairs, which I must own I have had with my
eyes wide open, I find a great many useful observations
to be made; and first, it can be no longer strange that,
while the commerce of evil spirits is so free and the
intercourse between this world and that is thus open,
I say, it can be no longer strange that there are so many
silent ways of spirits conversing; I mean, spirits of all
kinds.
For, as I have observed already, there is a residence
of good spirits, but they are placed infinitely higher,
out of the reach and out of the sight of this lower
orbit of Satan's kingdom; as those pass and repass
invisible, I confess I have yet had no ideas of them
but those which I have received from my first view of
the infernal region. If I should have any superior
elevations, and should be able to see the economy of
Heaven in His disposition of things on earth, I shall
be as careful to convey them to posterity as they
come in.
However, the transactions of good spirits with man
are certainly the same; for as God has, for a protec-
tion and safeguard to mankind, limited the devil from
affrighting him by visible appearances in his native and
hellish deformity, and the horrid shape he would neces-
sarily bear; so, for man's felicity, even the glorious
angels of heaven are very seldom allowed, at least not
lately, to appear in the glorious forms they formerly
took, or, indeed, in any form, or with a voice; the
restraint of our souls in the case of flesh and blood we
now wear not admitting it, and not being able to fami-
liarise those things to us; man being by no means, in his incorporated state, qualified for an open and easy
conversation with unembodied spirit.
Moreover, this would be breaking into the limits
which the wisdom and goodness of God has put to
our present state, I mean as to futurity, our ignorance
in which is the greatest felicity of human life; and
without which necessary blindness man could not sup-
port life, for nature is no way able to support a view
into futurity; I mean, not into that part of futurity
which concerns us in our state of life in this world.
I have often been myself among the number of those
fools that would be their own fortune-tellers; but when
I look thus beyond the atmosphere, and see a little
speculatively into invisibles, I could easily perceive that
it is our happiness that we are shortsighted creatures,
and can see but a very little before us. For example,
were we to have the eyes of our souls opened through
the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very imme-
diate region of air which we breathe in thronged with
spirits, to us, blessed be God, now invisible, and which
would otherwise be most frightful; we should see into
the secret transactions of those messengers who are
employed when the passing soul takes its leave of the
reluctant body, and perhaps see things nature would
shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze-
ment. In a word, the curtain of Providence for the
disposition of things here, and the curtain of judgment
for the determination of the state of souls hereafter,
would be alike drawn back; and what heart could
support here its future state in life, much less that of
its future state after life, even good or bad?
It is, then, our felicity that the converse of spirits
and the visions of futurity are silent, emblematic, and
done by hints, dreams, and impulses, and not by clear
vision and open discovery. They that desire a fuller
and plainer sight of these things ask they know not 
what; and it was a good answer of a gipsy, when a
lady of my acquaintance asked her to tell her fortune,
"Do not ask me, lady," said the gipsy, "to tell you
what you dare not hear." The woman was a little
honester than her profession intimated, and freely con-
fessed it was all a cheat, and that they knew nothing
of fortunes, but had a course or round of doubtful ex-
pressions, to amuse ignorant people and get a little
money.
Even the devil's oracles—for such, no doubt, they
were at Delphos and at other places, though the devil
seemed at that time to have some liberties granted him
which it is evident have since been denied him — were
allowed to be given only in doubtful expressions, double
entendres, echoes of words, and such like. For ex-
ample: a man going to sea, and inquiring of the oracle
thus—
"Have I just cause the seas and storms to fear?"
Echo —" Fear."
Another.
"Shall we the Parthian boatmen fight, or fly?"
Echo—"Fly."
Such dark replies, and other words doubtful and
enigmatic, were frequently given and taken for answers,
by which the deluded world were kept in doubt of
that futurity they hunted after. But Satan, even then,
was not permitted to speak plain, or mankind to see
what awaited them behind the dark veil of futurity;
nor was it proper, on any account whatsoever, that it
should be otherwise.
But before I come to this let me put some limits to
the elevations and visions I have mentioned before; for
as I am far from enthusiastic in my notions of things,
so I would not lead any one to fancy themselves farther enlightened than is meet, or to see things invisible, as
St. Paul heard things unutterable.
And, therefore, let me add here, that the highest
raptures, trances, and elevations of the soul are bounded
by the eternal decree of Heaven, and let men pretend
to what visions they please, it is all romance; all
beyond what I have talked of above is fabulous and
absurd, and it will for ever be true, as the Scripture
says, not only those things are hid from the eye, but
even from the conception.
Upon this occasion, I must own that I think it is
criminal to attempt to form ideas either of hell or of
heaven in the mind, other than as the Scripture has
described them, by the state rather than the place.
We are told, in plain words, it hath not entered into
the heart of man to conceive either of what is prepared
for the future state of the happy or miserable; 'tis
enough for us to entertain the general notion — the
favour of God is heaven, and the loss of it the most
dreadful of all, hell.
A heaven of joy must in His presence dwell,
And in His absence every place is hell.
My meaning is this; all visions, or propounded
visions, either of heaven or hell, are mere delusions
of the mind, and generally are fictions of a waking
bewildered head; and you may see the folly of them
in the meanest of the descriptions, which generally end
in showing some glorious place, fine walks, noble
illustrious palaces, gardens of gold, and people of
shining forms and the like. Alas! these are all so
short that they are unworthy the thoughts of a mind
elevated two degrees above darkness and dirt. All
these things amount to no more than Mahomet's
Alcoran and the glorious state of things represented by
him to his believers. In short, all this makes only a r
heaven of sense, but comes so infinitely short of what
alone must or can be a heaven to an exalted glorified
spirit, that I as much want words to express how
contemptible the best of these descriptions are as to a
true description of heaven as I do to express a true idea
or description of heaven myself.
And how should this be done? We can form no
idea of anything that we know not and have not seen
but in the form of something that we have seen. How,
then, can we form an idea of God or heaven in any
form but of something which we have seen or known?
By what image in the mind can we judge of spirits?
By what idea conceive of eternal glory? Let us cease
to imagine concerning it; 'tis impossible to attain, it is
criminal to attempt it.
Let me, therefore, hint here, that supposing myself,
as before, in the orbit of the sun, take it in its immense
distance as our astronomers conceive of it, or on the
edge only of the atmosphere with a clear view of the
whole solar system, the region of Satan's empire all in
view, and the world of spirits laid open to me:
Yet let me give you this for a check to your imagina-
tion, that even here the space between finite and infinite
is as impenetrable as on earth, and will for ever be so
till our spirits, being uncased, shall take their flight to
the centre of glory, where everything shall be seen as it
is; and therefore you must not be surprised if I am
come down again from the verge of the world of spirits
the same short-sighted wretch as to futurity and things
belonging to heaven and hell as I went up; for eleva-
tions of this kind are meant only to give us a clearer
view of what we are, not of what we shall be, and 'tis
an advantage worth travelling for too. All this I
thought necessary to prevent the whimsical building of
erroneous structures on my foundation, and fancying
themselves carried farther than they are able to go.

I come, therefore, back to talk of things familiar,
and particularly to mention in the next place some of
those other ways by which we have notice given of this
converse of spirits which I have been speaking of; for the
whispers and insinuators I have mentioned go sometimes
farther than ordinary.
One of those other methods is, when, by strong
impulses of the mind, as we call them, we are directed
to do or not to do this or that particular thing that we
have before us to do, or are under a consultation about.
I am a witness to many of these things, as well in my
own life as in my observation of others.
I know a man, who being at some distance from
London, not above six or seven miles, a friend that
came to visit and dine with him urged him to go to
London. "What for?" says his friend; "is there
any business wants me?"—"Nay, nothing," says the
other,"but for your company; I do not know of any-
thing wants you;" and so gave over importuning him.
But as his friend had given it over a strong impulse of
mind seized him and followed him, like a voice, with
this—Go to London, go to London. He put it by
several times, but it went on still — Go to London, go
to London, and nothing else could come upon his
thoughts but Go to London. He came back to his
friend, "Hark ye," says he, "tell me sincerely, is all
well at London? Am I wanted there? Did you
ask me to go to London with you on any particular
account ?" —" Not I," says his friend, "in the least;
I saw all your family, and all is very well there; nor
did they say they had any particular occasion for you to
return; I only ask it, as I told you, for the sake of
your company." So he put off going again, but could
have no quiet, for it still followed him, and no doubt a
good spirit communicated it — Go to London; and at
length he resolved he would go, and did so; and when he came there he found a letter, and messengers had
been at his house to seek him and to tell him of a parti-
cular business, which was, first and last, worth above a
thousand pounds to him, and which, if he had not been
found that very night, would have been in danger of
being lost.
I seriously advise all sober-thinking persons not to
disregard those powerful impulses of the mind in things
otherwise indifferent or doubtful, but believe them to be
whispers from some kind spirit, which sees something
that we cannot see, and knows something that we can-
not know.
Besides, unless infinite Power should take off the
silence that is imposed upon the inhabitants of the
invisible world, and allow them to speak audibly,
nothing can be a plainer voice; they are words spoken
to the mind, though not to the ear, and they are a cer-
tain intelligence of things unseen, because they are given
by persons unseen, and the event confirms it beyond all
dispute.
I know a man who made it his rule always to obey
these silent hints, and he has often declared to me that
when he obeyed them he never miscarried; and if he
neglected them, or went on contrary to them, he never
succeeded; and gave me a particular case of his own,
among a great many others, wherein he was thus
directed. He had a particular case befallen him,
wherein he was under the displeasure of the Govern-
ment, and was prosecuted for a misdemeanour, and
brought to a trial in the King's Bench Court, where a
verdict was brought against him, and he was cast; and
times running very hard at that time against the party
he was of, he was afraid to stand the hazard of a
sentence, and absconded, taking care to make due
provision for his bail, and to pay them whatever they
might suffer. In this circumstance he was in very great distress, and no way presented unto him but to
fly out of the kingdom, which, being to leave his family,
children, and employment, was very bitter to him, and
he knew not what to do; all his friends advising him
not to put himself into the hands of the law, which,
though the offence was not capital, yet, in his circum-
stances, seemed to threaten his utter ruin. In this
extremity he felt one morning—just as he awaked, and
the thoughts of his misfortune began to return upon
him — I say, he felt a strong impulse darting into his
mind thus, Write a letter to them. It spoke so dis-
tinctly to him, and as it were forcibly, that, as he has
often said since, he can scarce persuade himself not to
believe but that he heard it; but he grants that he really
did not hear it too.
However, it repeated the words daily and hourly to
him, till at length, walking about in his chamber, where
he was hidden, very pensive and sad, it jogged him
again, and he answered aloud to it, as if it had been a
voice, Who shall I write to? It returned immediately,
Write to the judge. This pursued him again for
several days, till at length he took his pen, ink, and
paper, and sat down to write, but knew not one word
of what he should say; but, dabitur in hoc hora, he
wanted not words. It was immediately impressed on his
mind, and the words flowed upon his pen in a manner
that even charmed himself, and filled him with expecta-
tions of success.
The letter was so strenuous in argument, so pathetic
in its eloquence, and so moving and persuasive, that as
soon as the judge read it he sent him word he should
be easy, for he would endeavour to make that matter
light to him; and, in a word, never left till he obtained
to stop prosecution, and restore him to his liberty and
to his family.
These hints, I say, are of a nature too significant to be neglected; whence they come is the next inquiry.
I answer, they are the whispers of some subsisting spirit
communicated to the soul without the help of the organ,
without the assistance of a particular sound, and without
any other communication; but, take it as you go, not
without the merciful disposition of that Power that
governs that world, as well as this that we are sensible
of. How near those spirits are to us, who thus foresee
what concerns us, and how they convey these hints into
our minds as well waking as sleeping, or how they are
directed, that I could not discover, nor can yet resolve,
no, not in the highest of my imaginary elevation, any
more than in what manner they are limited and re-
strained.
I have been asked by some, to whom I have talked
freely of my frequent applications to these things, if I
knew anything by those observations of the manner
of the disposition of the human soul after its departure
out of the body, I mean, as to its middle state, and
whether, as some, it has a wandering existence in the
upper part of the waste or abyss near to, but not in, a
present state of felicity? Whether it is still confined
within the atmosphere of the earth, according to others,
as in a limbus, or purgatory; or in the circle of the sun,
as others say? Whether I knew or perceived anything
of our Saviour's being ascended into the body of the
sun only, and not into the highest heaven, receiving His
redeemed souls to Himself, and into an incorporation
with His glory there, till the restitution of all things?
Whether I perceived anything of Satan being pos-
sessed of the reprobate souls as they departed; and
of his substitutes, as executioners, being empowered and
employed to torment them according to the received
notions of the wise contemplators of such things?
I answered, as I do now, that not only nothing
of all this appears, but, on the contrary, such serious contemplations as mine give a great and abundant reason to
be satisfied that there is nothing in it all but mere dream
and enthusiastic conjecture. I own that the agents I men-
tioned make use of all those things to terrify and affright
poor ignorant people out of their senses, and to drive
them often into desperation, and after to restore them
by a cure that is worse than the distemper, namely, by
a hardness and coldness of temper, rejecting entirely all
the notions of eternity and futurity, and so fitting them
to go out of the world as they lived in it, viz., without
troubling themselves with what is to come after it.
But I return to the article of impulses of the mind,
for I lay a greater weight upon these than upon any of
the other discoveries of the invisible world, because
they have something in them relating to what we are
about, something directing, something to guide us in
avoiding the evils that attend us, and to accepting, or
rather embracing, opportunities of doing ourselves good
when they present, which many times, for want of the
knowledge of our way, we irrecoverably let slip. Voices, apparitions, noises, and all the other affright-
ing things which unavoidably follow the neighbourhood
of spirits in the air we breathe in, seem to have much
less signification, as to us, than these seasonable kind
whispers to our souls, which, it is plain, are directed for
the advantage of life.
It seems hard that mankind should be so open to the
secret insinuators, the whispering devils I have been
speaking of, who are night and day, sleeping and
waking, working upon his senses by the arts and
subtleties of hell, to fill his imagination with a thousand
devilish contrivances to gratify his vanity and lust; and
that our thoughts should be always ready to receive the
impressions they make, pressed to follow the infernal
counsel, be awake to listen to all his directions, but
should be deaf to the instructions of any kind spirits that would influence us for our advantage, and insensible to
those impressions which are made upon us for our
immediate good by an agent good in itself, and acting
from a principle, whatever it be, of good to us.
We have a foolish saying, though taken from some-
thing that is more significant than we imagine, when
any danger has surprised us — Well, my mind misgave
me when I was going about it; well, I knew some
mischief would come of it. Did you so? And why
then did you do it? Why did you go on? Why,
when your mind misgave you, did you not obey the
friendly caution? Whence do you think your mind
received the speaking, though silent impression? Why
did you not listen to it as to a voice? For such a one
it was, no doubt; and let all those unthinking people
who go on in anything they are upon, contrary to those
secret, silent impressions upon their minds, I say, let
them know and observe it, they will very seldom fail of
meeting some mischief in the way. They will very
seldom fail of miscarrying in the way. I say very
seldom, because I would not take upon me to prescribe
things positively, which the reader will take me up
short in, and say, how do I know it? But I will take
the liberty to say, I durst be positive in it, relating to
myself, and I durst be positive from the nature and
reason of the thing.
As to my own experience, I waive saying much of
it, but that in general I never slighted these impulses
but to my great misfortune; I never listened to and
obeyed them, but to my great advantage; but I choose
to argue from the reason of them, rather than from my
own experience.
As they are evident warnings of what is to come,
and are testified daily and hourly by the things coming
to pass afterwards, so they are undeniable testimonies
that they proceed from some being, intelligent of those things that are at hand, while they are yet to come. If,
then, I am satisfied that it is a notice given from a
something, be it what it will, which is fully informed
of what is attending me, though concealed from me,
why should I slight the hint given me from anything
that knows what I know not, and especially, for example,
for avoiding evils to come?
I know a person, who had so strong an impression
upon her mind that the house she was in would be
burnt that very night, that she could not go to sleep;
the impulse she had upon her mind pressed her not to
go to bed, which, however, she resisted and went to
bed, but was so terrified with the thought, which, as
she called it, run in her mind, that the house would be
burnt, that she could not go to sleep.
She had made so much discovery of her apprehen-
sions in the family, that they were all in a fright, and
applied themselves to search from the top of the house
to the bottom, and to see every fire and every candle
safe out, so that, as they all said, it was impossible
anything could happen in the house, and they sent to
the neighbours on both sides to do the like. Thus far
they did well, but had she obeyed the hint, which
pressed upon her strangely not to go to bed, she had
done much better, for the fire was actually kindled at
that very time, though not broken out.
In about an hour after the whole family was in bed,
the house just over the way, directly opposite, was all
in a flame, and the wind, which was very high, blowing
the flame upon the house this gentlewoman lived in, so
filled it with smoke and fire in a few moments, the
street being narrow, that they had not air to breathe,
or time to do anything but jump out of their beds and
save their lives. Had she obeyed the hint given, and
not gone to bed, she might have saved several things of
value which she lost; but as she neglected that, and r
would go to bed, the moments she had spared to her
were but just sufficient to get out of bed, get some
clothes on, and get downstairs, for the house was on
fire in half a quarter of an hour.
It might be asked here, why could not the same kind
spirit have intimated by the same whispers where the
danger lay, and from what quarter it was to be ex-
pected; in what manner the fire would attack them,
and that it would come from the other side of the
street, the wind blowing it directly upon them?
To this I answer, that it is our business the more
vigilantly to observe and listen to the hints which are
given, seeing the intimations are not so particular as we
might wish, without inquiring into the reasons why
they are given no plainer. We have a great deal of
reason to believe the kind spirit that gives these in-
timations and whispers thus to us, gives us all the light
it is permitted to give, and whispers as much, either as
it knows, or as it is allowed to communicate; other-
wise, why does it give any intimations at all? But, on
the other hand, it may be alleged that enough is in-
timated to suffice for our safety, if we will obey the
intimation; and it would be a much more reasonable
question to ask why we slight and disobey the impression
that we acknowledge to have received, rather than why
the intimation was no plainer.
A person of my acquaintance being to go to New
England by sea, two ships presented, and the masters
earnestly solicited to take him as a passenger; he
asked my advice, professing that as well the ships as
the captains were perfectly indifferent to him, both the
men being equally agreeable to him, and the vessels
equally good. I had my eye upon this notion of
impulses, and pressed upon him to observe strictly if he
had not some secret motion of his mind to one ship
rather than another, and he said he had not.
After some time he accidentally met one of the
captains, and falling into terms with him, agreed for
his passage, and accordingly prepared to go on board;
but from the very time that he made the agreement,
nay, even while he was making the bargain, he had a
strong impression on his mind that he should not go in
that ship.
It was some days after this that he told me of
these impressions, which increased on him every day;
upon which I pressed him earnestly not to go, but to
take passage with the other. After he had resolved
upon this, he came to me, and told me, that he had
with some difficulty and some loss put off the first
ship, but now he had the same, or rather stronger
aversion to going in the second ship, and had a strong
impression on his mind that if he went in the second
ship he should be drowned. I bid him consider it a
little, and tell me if he had any further intimations of
it; and he continued to tell me that he had no rest
about his going in either of those ships, and yet his
affairs lay so that he was under a necessity of going,
and there was no other ship put up upon the Exchange
for going.
I pressed him, however, not to venture by any means;
I convinced him that those impulses of his mind were
the whispers of some kind spirit, that saw things farther
than he could, and were certainly given him as cautions
to save him from some mischief which he might not
foresee; that it could be no evil spirit, because the
keeping him back could be no injury to him of such a
nature as would gratify the devil in any part of his usual
desires; it must therefore be something for his good,
and he ought to be very cautious how he slighted the
silent admonition. In a word, I prepossessed him so
much in aid of the secret impulses of his own mind,
that he resolved not to go that year, and he saw clearly f
afterwards that the secret intimation was from a good
hand, for both the ships miscarried; the first being
taken by the Turks, and the latter cast away and all
the men lost, the ship foundering at sea, as was sup-
posed, for she was never heard of.
I could fill this tract with accounts of this nature, but
the reason of the case is stronger than the example; for
as it is an intimation of something future, and that is to
come to pass, it is certain there is a state in which what
is future and must come to pass is known, and why
should we not believe the news, if it comes from the
place where the certainty of it is known?
Some give all this to a prescience peculiar to the soul
itself, and of kin to that we call the second sight; but
I see no ground for this but mere presumption. Others
call it an afflatus, which they think is a distemper of
the brain. Others call it a sympathetic power in the
soul, foreboding its own disasters. But all this is short
of the thing, for here is not a foreboding only, which
indeed is often felt, but is expressed another way; but
here is a direct intelligence, a plain intimation of the
evil, and warning to avoid it: this must be more than
an afflatus, more than a sympathy; this must be from a
certain knowledge of a thing that exists not, by a some-
thing that does exist; and must be communicated by a
converse of spirits unembodied, with the spirit embodied,
for its good; unless you will call it Divine revelation,
which I see no ground for.
All these reasonings make it abundantly our concern
to regard these things, as what we are greatly concerned
in; however, that is not the chief use I make of them
here, but (1.) they abundantly explain the nature of the
world of spirits, and the certainty of an existence after
death; (2.) they confirm that the disposition of Provi-
dence concerning man, and the event of things, are not
so much hidden from the inhabitants of that world as 
they are from us; as also (3.) that spirits unembodied
see with a sight differing from us, and are capable of
knowing what attends us, when we know nothing of it
ourselves.
This offered many useful reflections to my mind,
which, however, 'tis impossible for me to communicate
with the same vivacity, or to express with the same life,
that the impression they make on my own thoughts
came with.
The knowledge of there being a world of spirits,
may be many ways useful to us, and especially that of
their seeing into futurity, so as to be able to communi-
cate to us, by what means soever they do it, what we
shall or shall not do, or what shall or shall not befall
us; to communicate dangers before us so as they may
be avoided, and mischiefs awaiting us, so as they may
be prevented, and even death itself, so as we may pre-
pare for it; for we may certainly, if we would attend
to these things, increase our acquaintance with them,
and that very much to our advantage.
I would be far from prompting the crazy imagina-
tions of hypochondriac distempered heads, which run
men out to so many extravagancies, and which, in fixing
their thoughts upon the real world of spirits, make this
an imaginary world of spirits to them; who think they
are talked to from the invisible world by the howling of
every dog, or the screeching of every owl. I believe
it was much of this vapourish dreaming fancy by which
the augurs of the Romans determined events from the
flying of birds, and the entrails of beasts. It will be hard for me to be prevailed on to suppose
that even those intelligent spirits which I speak of, who
are able by such easy ways, as the impulses of our minds,
dreams, and the like, to convey the knowledge of things
to us, can be put to the necessity, or find reason to make
use of the agency of dogs and birds, to convey their f
III. T
notices by; this would be to suppose them to be much
more confined in their converse with us, than we
evidently find they are; and, on the other hand, would
suppose the inanimate world to have more knowledge
of the invisible than we have, whereas, on the other
hand, we know they have nothing at all to do with it. There is only this to be said for it, namely, that those
inanimate creatures do it involuntarily, and, as it were,
under the power of a possession.
I will not affirm but that the invisible inhabitants I
have been speaking of may have power to act upon the
brute creatures, so as to employ them, or make use of
their agency, in the warnings and notices which they
give to us of things to come; but that the brutes have
otherwise any farther sight of things than we have, I
can see nothing at all of that. It is true Balaam's ass
saw the angel with the flaming sword standing in the
road when the prophet did not, but the reason is plainly
expressed; the angel was really there, and actually pre-
senting terror to them with a flaming sword in his hand,
only the prophet's eyes were miraculously withheld that
he could not see him.
I shall unriddle this mystery of the agency of beasts
and birds as far as reason dictates; and it seems to be
easy upon the scheme of the nearness of the spirits I
am speaking of to us, and their concern to convey
intelligence to us. They may, I say, have power to
terrify the brutes by horrible apparitions to them, so as
to force those howlings and screechings we have been
told of, and to do this in such places, and at such
times, as shall suit with the circumstances of the family
or person concerned, and so far their said extraordinary
howlings and screechings may be significant; but that
the brutes can either, by sense or by extraordinary
sight, have any foreknowledge of things in futurity
relating to us, or to themselves, this has no foundation in reason or philosophy, any more than it has in religion.
Matter may act upon material objects, and so the
understanding or sense of a brute may act upon visible
objects, but matter cannot act upon immaterial things,
and so the eye of a beast cannot see a spirit, or the
mind of a brute act upon futurity, eternity, and the
sublime things of a state to come.
What use, then, the spirits we speak of, inhabiting
the invisible world, can make of the inanimate world to
direct them, as missionaries to us, I do not see, neither
did I in all my altitudes perceive they employed any
such agents.
It is from the misunderstanding of these things that
we place abundance of incidents, merely fortuitous,
to the devil's account, which he knows nothing of.
Many a storm blows that is none of his raising; many
a midnight noise happens that is none of his making.
If Satan or his instruments had one tenth part of the
power, either of the air, or in the air, or over the
elements, that we give them in our imaginations, we
should have our houses burnt every night, hurricanes
raised in the air, floods made in the country, and, in a
word, the world would not be habitable; but you re-
member I told you, as powerful as he is, he is chained,
he has a great clog at his foot, and he can do nothing
by violence, or without permission.
I might hint here at abundance of idle, ridiculous
devils, that we are daily told of, that come and only
make game among us, put out our candles, throw chairs
and stools about the house, break glasses, make a
smoke, a stink of brimstone, &c., whereas, after all, the
devil has no more sulphur about him than other folks,
and I can answer for it that Satan is not disposed for
mirth; all the frolics and gambols we ascribe to him, I
dare say, are antics of our own brain. I heard of a
house in Essex which they told me was haunted, and r
that every night the devil or a spirit, call it which you
will, came into such a room, and made a most terrible
knocking, as if it had a hammer or a mallet, and this
for two or three hours together. At length, upon
looking about in an empty closet in that room, there
was found an old mallet, and this was presently con-
cluded to be the mallet which the devil made such a
noise with, so it was taken away; but the next night
they said the devil made such a racket for want of the
mallet, that they were much more disturbed than
before, so they were obliged to leave the mallet there
again, and every night the devil would come and knock
in the window, for two or three hours together, with
that mallet. I have seen the room and the mallet, in
neither of which was anything extraordinary, but never
heard the noise, though I sat up to wait for it, nor after
causing the mallet to be taken away was there any
noise; belike the mannerly spirit would not disturb
us who were strangers.
This passed for a most eminent piece of walking or
haunting, and all the difficulty was to inquire to what
purpose all this disturbance was made, seeing there was
no end answered in it, and I always thought the devil
was too full of business to spend his time to no manner
of purpose.
At last all the cheat was discovered, viz., that a
monkey, kept in a house three or four houses from it,
had found the way into that room, and came every
night almost about midnight, and diverted himself with
the frolic, and then went home again.
If these things were not frequently detected, it would
be a great scandal upon the devil that he had nothing
to employ himself in more significant than rapping all
night with a hammer to fright and disturb the neigh-
bours, making noises, putting out candles, and the like.
When we come into the invisible state, of which we now know so little, we shall be easily convinced that
the devil is otherwise employed, and has business of
much more importance upon his hands.
It would be very insignificant to have us so fre-
quently warned against Satan's devices, to have us be
cautioned to be sober and vigilant, knowing that our
adversary, the devil, goes about like a roaring lion,
seeking, &c. All these things import that he is dili-
gent in attacking us, watching all advantages, hunting
us down, circumventing, waiting, and constantly plying
us with snares that he may trepan and devour us. This
admits not any of those simple, ludicrous, and sense-
less digressions which we set him to work upon in
our imaginations.
Perhaps it may be expected I should enter here
upon the subject of apparitions, and discourse with
equal certainty of that undecided question concerning
the reality of apparitions, and whether departed souls
can revisit the place of their former existence, take up
shapes, bodies, and visible and apparent beings, assume
voices, and concern themselves with the affairs of life,
of families, persons, and even of estates, and the like,
as many have affirmed they have been witnesses to.
I must be allowed to leave this where I find it.
There are some difficulties which I am not yet got
over in it, nor have I been elevated high enough to
determine that point, and shall not venture to decide it
without more certainty than I am yet arrived to.
I would warn all people not to suffer their imagina-
tion to form shapes and appearances where there are
none; and I may take upon me to say that the devil
himself does not appear half so often as some people
think they see him: fancy governs many people, and a
sick brain forms strange things to itself; but it does
not follow from thence that nothing can appear because
nothing does at that time.
f
However, as my design is to instruct, not amuse, so,
I say, I forbear to enter upon a subject which I must
leave as doubtful as I find it, and consequently talk of
to no purpose.
I have heard of a man that would allow the reality
of apparitions, but would have it be nothing but the
devil; that the souls of men departed or good spirits
never appeared. It happened that to this very man
something appeared, as he said, and insisted upon it to
the last. He said he saw the shape of an ancient man
pass by him in the dusk of the evening, who, holding
up his hand as it were in a threatening posture, said
aloud, "O wicked creature! repent, repent." He
was exceedingly terrified, and consulted several people
about it, who all advised him seriously to take the
advice, for his life made it well known, it seems, that
he stood in need of it; but being seriously debating
about it, one of his friends asked what he thought of
the apparition, and whether it was any of the devil's
business to bid him repent. This puzzled his thoughts,
and, in a word, he grew a very sober man; but, after
all, it was a real man, and no apparition, that spoke to
him, though his frighted fancy made him affirm that
he vanished out of his sight, which he did not; and
the person who did it, being a grave and pious gentleman, met him by mere accident, without any design,
and spoke as he did, from the knowledge he had of
his being indeed a most wretched wicked fellow. By
the way, the gentleman had the opportunity to hear the
use that was made of it, and to hear himself mistaken
for an apparition of the devil, but he was so prudent
as not to discover it to the man, lest the reformation,
which was the consequence of the fright, should wear
off, when he should know that there was nothing in the
thing but what was common.
If we would always make the like good use of Satan's real appearances, I do not know but it would go a
great way to banish him from the visible world; for I
am well assured he would very seldom visit us, if he
thought his coming would do us any good; at least, he
would never come but when he was sent, he would
never come willingly; for he is so absolutely at the
Divine disposal, that if Heaven commands he must go,
though it were to do the good he abhors. Not that I
believe Heaven ever thinks fit to employ him in doing
good; if ever he is let loose, 'tis to act in judgment as
an instrument of vengeance, and some are of opinion he
is often employed as a destroying angel, though I do
not grant that; I can hardly think the justice of God
would gratify Satan's gust of doing evil so far as to
suffer him to be even so much as an executioner; but
that is by the way.
I have another turn to give this part of my observa-
tions, which though, perhaps, some may not think so
much to the purpose as entering into a critical inquiry
after the devil's particular mission in these cases, yet I
think otherwise.
I have observed that some desperate people make a
very ill use of the general notion, that there are no
apparitions, nor spirits at all; and really, the use they
make of it is worse than the extreme of those who, as
I said, make visions and devils of everything they see
or hear. For these men persuade themselves there are
no spirits at all, either in the visible or invisible world,
and, carrying it on farther, they next annihilate the
devil, and believe nothing about him, either of one kind
or another.
This would not be of so much bad consequence if it
was not always followed by a worse, namely, that
when they have prevailed with themselves to believe
there is no devil, the next thing is, and they soon
come to it, that there is no God, and so atheism
takes its rise in the same sink, with a carelessness about
futurity.
I have no mind to enter upon an argument to prove
the being of our Maker, and to illustrate His power by
words, who has so many undeniable testimonies in the
breasts of every rational being to prove His existence.
But I have a mind to conclude this work with a short
history of some atheists, which I met with many years
ago, and whether the facts are testified or not, may be
equally useful in the application, if you do not think
them a little too religious for you.
Some years ago there was a young gentleman, a
scholar at the university, eminent for learning and virtue,
of prompt parts and great proficiency, insomuch that he
was taken great notice of by the masters and fellows,
and every one promised fair in their thoughts for him,
that he would be a great man. It happened, whether
from his earnest desire of more knowledge, or the
opinion of his own great capacity, I know not which,
that this gentleman, falling upon the study of divinity,
grew so opinionative, so very positive and dogmatic in
his notions in religious things, that by degrees it came
to this height, that his tutor saw plainly that he had
little more than notions in all his religious pretences to
knowledge, and concluded he would either grow en-
thusiastic or obstinately profane and atheistic.
He had three chums, or companions, in his studies,
and they all fell into the same error, as well by the
consequence of a great deal of wit and little grace, as
by the example and leading of this other young gentle-
man, who was, indeed, their oracle almost in every-
thing.
As his tutor, who was a very good man, feared for
him, so it came to pass with him and all the rest; for
they ran up their superficial notions in divinity to such
a height that, instead of reasoning themselves into good principles of religion, they really reasoned themselves
out of all religion whatsoever, running on to expunge
every right idea from their minds; pretending those
things really were not, of which they could not define
both how and what they were, they proceeded to deny
the existence of their Maker, the certainty of a future
state, a resurrection, a judgment, a heaven, or a hell.
They were not contented to satisfy themselves with
these impious foundations, but they set up to dispute in
private societies against all revealed religion, thereby
bringing on themselves the curse denounced in Scripture
against those that do evil and teach men so to do; in a
little time they grew so public that more company came
in, and, which was worse, many joined with them in
principle, or, as I should rather have said, in casting
off all principles, and they began to be famous in the
place, though to the offence of all good men, and were
called "The Atheistical Club."
They soon began to see sober, religious people shun
them, and in some time, upon information given, they
were obliged, by authority, to separate for fear of
punishment, so that they could not hold their public
disputations as they began to do, yet they abated
nothing of their wicked custom; and this dreadful
creature, who set up at the head of the rest, began to
be so open in his blasphemies that he was at length
obliged to fly from the university.
However, he went a great while before it came to
that; and though he had been often admonished, yet,
instead of reclaiming, he grew the more impious, making
the most sacred things his jest and the subject of his
ridicule. He gave out that he could frame a new
gospel, and a much better system of religion than that
which they called Christian; and that if he would
trouble himself to go about it, he would not fail to
draw in as great a part of the world to run after him as r
had been after any other. I care not to repeat any of
his blasphemous words; it is not to be supposed there
can be any blasphemous abominable thing that this set
of wicked wretched young men did not run into,
neither any wickedness of that kind within their reach
which they did not commit.
It would be too long to enter into the particular
history of these men, and how it pleased God to
dispose of them; they might be in number, before they
separated, about twenty-two in all; I shall tell you
of some of them, however, who did not run such
lengths as the rest. There was a young man who
frequented their society, though, as he afterwards said,
he was rather persuaded to be among them than to
be one of them; he had, however, too much yielded
to their delusions; and though they made him very
much their jest, because they found he still retained
some little sense of a God and of a future state in his
mind, yet he had yielded dreadfully to them, and
began to do so more and more every day.
It happened one day this young man was going to
their hellish society, and not minding the weather, the
clouds gathered over his head, and he was stopped by
a sudden shower of rain in the street. It rained so
very hard that it obliged him to stand up in the gate-
way of an inn for some time; while he was standing
here a great flash of lightning more than ordinarily
surprised him; it seems the fire came so directly in his
face that he felt the very warmth of it, and was ex-
ceedingly startled; in the same moment almost, as is
natural in the case, followed such a clap of thunder
that perfectly astonished him. The rain continuing
kept him in the gateway, as I said, for a good while, till
he had time for such reflections as these: "Where am
I going? What am I going about? Who is it has
stopped me thus? Why are these thunders, these rains, and this lightning thus terrible? and whence are
they?" And with the rest came in this thought, warm
and swift as the lightning which had terrified him
before, "What if there should be a God! what will
become of me then?" Terrified with these things he
starts out of the gateway into the street, notwithstand-
ing the wet, and runs back through the rain, saying to
himself as he went," I will go among them no more!"
When he came home to his chambers he fell into
dreadful agonies of mind,and at length broke out thus:
"What have I been doing! have I been denying the
Power that made me? despising that God whose fire
flashed just now in my face; and which, had not that
mercy I have abused interposed, might have burnt me
to death? What kind of creature am I?" While
he was thus giving vent to his reflections a near relation
of his — a pious, good man, who had often used to
speak very plainly to him of the horrid sin he was
guilty of—happened to come to visit him.
The young man had thrown himself upon his bed,
and had, with the deepest sense of his madness and
most serious reproaches of himself for his horrid life,
been expressing himself to his friend, and he had been
comforting him in the best manner he could, when,
after a while, he desired his friend to retire that he
might be a little alone and might give vent to his
thoughts with the more freedom; and his friend taking
a book in his hand stayed in the outer room.
In this interval came another scholar to the door,
who was one of the wicked company I mentioned just
now. He came not to visit this first gentleman, but to
call him to go with him to the usual meeting of their
dreadful society; and knocking at his chamber door,
this gentleman who was left in the chamber stepped
to the door, and, looking through a little grate, not
only knew the person, but knew him to be one of the wicked company I have been speaking of. Now, as
he was very loath his friend should have such an inter-
ruption to the good disposition he was then in, so,
above all, he was loath he should be persuaded to go
any more among that miserable gang; wherefore he
opened the door a little way, so as he was not very
distinctly seen, and spoke aloud in the person of his
friend thus: "O sir, beseech them all to repent;
for, depend upon it, there is a God; tell them I say
so;" and with that he shut the door upon him
violently, giving him no time to reply, and, going back
into his friend's room, took no notice of anybody
having been at the door at all.
The person who knocked at the door you may
suppose was one of the leaders of the company, a
young scholar of good parts and sense, but debauched
by that horrid crew, and one that had made himself
eminent for his declared opposition to all the common
notions of religion; a complete atheist, and publicly so,
without God or the desire of God in the world.
However, as he afterwards confessed, the repulse he
met with at the door, and which he thought came
from his friend, gave him a strange shock at first and
filled him with horror. He went down the college
stairs in the greatest confusion imaginable, and went
musing along a good way, not knowing where he was
or whither he went, and in that embarrassment of
thought went a whole street out of the way. The
words had made an unusual impression upon his mind,
but he had his other surprises too; for he thought his
friend, for he believed firmly that it was he that had
spoken to him, had treated him very rudely.
Sometimes he resented it, and reflected upon it as
an affront, and once or twice was upon the point of
going back again to him to know the reason of his
using him so, and to demand satisfaction; but still the words, "There is a God," dwelt upon his mind.
"And what if it should be so?" says he, "what
then?" Upon this question to himself, the answer
immediately occurred to his mind. "What then?
Why, then, I am undone! For, have not I declared
war against the very notion, defied all the pretenders
to it as mere enthusiasts and men of whimsey?"
However, after these thoughts his mind cooled a
little again, and it offered to him, no doubt injected by
an evil spirit, that he should not trouble himself with
inquiring into it one way or another, but be easy.
This pacified him for a little while, and he shook
off the surprise he was in; the hardened temper seemed
to return, and he kept on his way towards the hellish
society that he was going to before. But still the words
returned upon him, "There is a God," and began to
bring some terror with it upon his mind; and the last
words of his friend came into his mind often, "tell
them I say so." This filled him with a curiosity
which he could not withstand, viz., of going back to
his friend and inquiring of him what discoveries he
had made of this kind? How he came to have changed
his mind so suddenly? And, especially, how he was
arrived to a certainty of the thing?
I told you that there had been a great shower of
rain, which had stopped the first young gentleman in
his way out; it seems the day was still showery, and
a little rain happening to fall again as this gentleman
went by a bookseller's shop, he stops at the door to
stand up a little out of the wet.
There happened to be sitting in the shop reading a
book a gentleman of his acquaintance, though far differing
from him in his principles, being a very sober, studious,
religious young man, a student in divinity of the same
college, who, looking up, called him in, and after a few
common salutes he whispers in his ear.
Student. I was looking in an old book here just
now, and began the following short dialogue; and I
found four lines written on the back of the title-page
which put me in mind of you.
Atheist. Me! why did they put you in mind of me?
Stud. I'll tell you presently; come hither. [He
retires into a back room, and calls the other after him.]
Ath. Well, now tell me.
Stud. Because I think they are very fit for such an
atheistical wretch as you to read. Ath. You are very civil. Stud. You know you deserve it. Ath. Come, let me see them, however.
Stud. Let me look in your face all the while, then. Ath. No, you shan't.
Stud. Then you shan't see them. Ath. Well, let it alone, then.
Stud. Come, give me your hand; you shall see
them if you will promise to read them over three times.
Ath. There's my hand, I'll read them out to you.
Stud. I'll hold your hand all the while, because I'll
be sure of your performance.
Ath. I'D warrant you I'll read them. [He reads.]
"But if it should fall out, as who can tell,
That there may be a God, a heaven, and hell,*
Had I not best consider well, for fear
'T should be too late when my mistakes appear?"
[*He held him by the hand till that word, and then
let it go, pressing gently one of his fingers.~\
Stud. Well, what do you say to them?
Ath. I'll tell you my thoughts farther by-and-by,
but first tell me, what did you press my hand for when
you let it go?
Stud. Did you feel no motion within you when you
read those words, " there may be a God "?
Ath. What motion? What do you talk of?

Stud. Come, do not deny it, for I am a witness
against you.
Ath. Witness, for what? I have killed nobody, I
have robbed nobody; if you would turn informer, I
value not your evidence.
Stud. No, no, I shall not turn informer of that kind,
but I am a witness in your Maker's behalf.
Ath. What can you witness?
Stud. I'll tell you what I can witness; I can testify
that your own conscience is against you in your impious
denying the existence of that God that gave you life;
you could not conceal it; I tell you I felt it.
Ath. How do you pretend to know what my con-
science dictates to me, or what the result of secret
reflections may be in the mind? You may be mistaken;
have a care, you know you are not to bear false
witness.
Stud. 'Tis in vain to struggle with it —'tis not to be
concealed; you betrayed yourself, I tell you.
Ath. How betrayed myself? you are mighty dark in
your expressions.
Stud. Did I not tell you I would look in your face
all the while you read? Did I not see into the dis-
traction of your soul? Did you not turn pale at the
very words, when your tongue said, "there may be a
God"? Was there not a visible horror in your counte-
nance when you read the word heaven? a horror which
signified a sense of your having no share in it, or hope
about it? And did I not feel a trembling in your
very joints, as I held you by the hand, when you read
the word hell?
Ath. And was that it you held me by the hand for?
Stud. Indeed it was; I was persuaded I should find
it, for I could never believe that an atheist had always
a hell within him, even while he braved it out against a
hell without him.
304 a vision or the angelic world.
Ath. You speak enough to fright one; how can you
say so positively a thing which you cannot be sure of?
Stud. Never add sin to sin; 'tis in vain to deny it.
Ath. Well, well, it's none of your business; who
made you my father confessor \ \He is a little angry.~]
Stud. Nay, do not be angry with your friend; and
though you are, do but take the hint, and be as angry
as you will.
Ath. What hint? What is it you aim at? Your
hints are all so general, I can make nothing of them.
Stud. I aim at nothing but your eternal felicity; I
thought those lines very apposite to your case, and
was wishing you had them before I happened to see
you. I thought that such a reflection in the case of
atheism, so natural, so plain, especially blessed from
Him whose secret voice can effectually reach the
mind, might be some means to open your eyes.
Ath. Open my eyes !—to what?
Stud. To something that I am persuaded you see
already in part, though I find you struggle hard against
your own convictions.
Ath. What is this something you speak of?
Stud. I mean in a few words what the lines you
have read mean, viz., that perhaps there may be a
God, a heaven, and hell.
Ath. I don't know but there may. \_He observes
tears stand in his eyes.~\
Stud. Well, I see it begins to touch you; if you
are uncertain, that is a step to conviction; and the
rest of the words you have read are a most natural
inference in your case.
"You'd best consider well, for fear
T should be too late when your mistakes appear.
Ath. What would you have me consider?
Stud. I am not able to enter into that part now; the first thing is to persuade you to look in; listen to
the voice of conscience; I am satisfied you stand con-
victed at that bar; you cannot plead not guilty there. Ath. Convicted of what?
Stud. Of having acted contrary to the light of
nature, of reason, and indeed of common-sense; most
impiously denied the God whose air you breathe in,
whose earth you tread on, whose food you eat, whose
clothes you wear, who is your life, and will be your
Judge.
Ath. I do not absolutely deny; I tell you I don't
know but there may be a God.
Stud. Don't you know but there may! O sir, I
beseech you, repent; for certainly there is a God,
depend upon it; I say so.
Ath. You fright me. [He starts and looks sur-
prised.]
Stud. Indeed I think it may well fright you.
Ath. But you fright me upon a quite different
account from what you imagine; I am indeed very
much surprised, and so would you too, if you knew
the circumstance.
Stud. What circumstance?
Ath. Pray did you hear those words spoken any-
where to-day before you spoke them?Stud. No, not I.
Ath. Was you at Mr. 's chamber about half-an-hour ago?
Stud. I have not been there this month past; I
have given over visiting him, and all such as he is,
long ago.
Ath. Have you seen him to-day, or when did you
last see him ?— did he speak those words to you, or
you to him?
Stud. I have not seen him since I saw him with
you about fourteen days ago, when your discourse r
III. u
(even both of you) was so blasphemous and so
atheistical as made my very heart tremble, and I re-
solved never to come into company with either of you
again, and it was that very discourse that made me
think of you when I found those lines in this book.
I should think it an evident discovery of God, and
what I might hope should best forward your con-
viction, if His providence should have sent you to this
door at that minute to receive the hint on this occasion.
Ath. There is something more than common in
everything that has happened to me to-day.
Stud. If you would explain yourself a little I might
say more; but you know very well I cannot make the
least guess at what you mean.
Ath. Ask me no more questions; there must be
a God or a devil in being. [He looks wildly and
amazed.]
Stud. Dear friend, there are both, depend upon it;
but I beseech you, compose your mind, and do not
receive the conviction with horror, but with comfort
and hope.
Ath. One or other of them has been concerned in
what has happened to me to-day; it has been a strange
day with me.
Stud. If it relates only to these things, perhaps it
may be of use to you to communicate the particulars,
at least it may give some vent to the oppression of
thought which you seem to be under; you cannot
open your mind to one that has more earnest desires
to do you good, though perhaps not sufficiently fur-
nished to advise you.
Ath. I must tell it or burst. [Here he gave him
the whole story of his going to his friend's chamber in
order to take him with him to the wicked club they had
kept, and how he had met him at the door, and said the
same words to him that the Student had repeated, and
tuhen he had done, says he to his friend^— And who
now do you think must dictate the same words to
him, and afterwards to you, to say to me on the same
occasion?
Stud. Who do I think? Nay, who do you think?Ath. Who? the devil, if there is a devil.
Stud. Why, do you think the devil preaches repent-
ance? [He stands stock still, and says not a ivord,
ivhich the other perceiving, goes on J— Pray think seri-
ously, for I see it does a little touch your reason. Is
it likely the devil should bid either of us, or both of
us, entreat you to repent? Is it the devil, think you,
that would pronounce the certainty of the great truth
I speak of? Is it his business to convince you that
there is a God?
Ath. That's very true.
Stud. One thing, however, I'll say in Satan's be-
half, and that is, that he never came up to your height
of sinning. The devil has frequently set up himself,
and persuaded poor deluded people to worship him
as a God; but, to do him justice, he never had the
impudence to deny the being of a God; that's a sin
purely human, and even among men very modern too,
the invention of witty men, as they call themselves—
a way they have lately found out to cherish superlative
wickedness, and flatter themselves that they shall have
no audit of their accounts in a future state; of whom it
may indeed be said in that particular, they have outsinned the devil.
Ath. Indeed I think we have.
Stud. I wish you would consider a little farther
of it.
Ath. What can men consider that have gone that
length I
Stud. Yes, yes; remember what St. Peter said to
Simon the sorcerer. Ath. What was that?
Stud. Read Acts viii. 22; "Repent, therefore, of
this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the
thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."
Ath. No, no; the last of your verses is against me
there most directly.
"It's all TOO late, now my mistakes appear."
Stud. No, no; remember what you said, that it
must be a God or a devil.
Ath. What is that to the purpose?
Stud. Why, you seemed satisfied that it could not
be from the devil.
Ath. But what the better am I for that, if the other
is my enemy?
Stud. Much the better if it was from God, if the
words you heard were from God, and that two un-
concerned persons so eminently concurred in speaking
to you; you cannot believe God would bid you repent
if it was too late, or if He were your irreconcilable
enemy; on the contrary, if you believe it to be the
voice of His providence, you ought to listen to and
obey it.
Ath. You have a strange power of persuasion, there is
no resisting your argument.
Stud. It is not in me to persuade, but Heaven may
make use of me to convince.
Ath. To convince is to persuade; I am convinced
that I have been a dreadful wretch.
Stud. I am persuaded you were convinced of that
before.
Ath. I cannot deny but my heart always struck me
—a kind of chill horror ran through my veins, when I
have uttered the blasphemous opinions that I have been
drawn into; my very blood stagnated at the thought of
it, and I look back on it with astonishment.
Stud. I tell you, I felt a tremor even in your flesh
when you read the words, a God, a heaven, a hell.
Ath. I confess to you my very heart sunk within
me at the words who can tell; my soul answered that I
could tell myself that it both is and must be so.
Stud. Conscience is a faithful and never-failing evi-
dence in his Maker's behalf.
Ath. It is a very terrible evidence against me, and
where will it end?
Stud. I hope it will end where it began, I mean in a
heavenly call to you to repentance.
Ath. That is not always the consequence of con-
viction.
Stud. You must therefore distinguish again of what
proceeds from heaven, what from hell, the voice of
God, and the voice of the devil; the first calls upon
you to repent, the last prompts you to despair.
Ath. Despair seems to be the natural consequence
of denying God, for it shuts out the power that can
alone restore the mind.
Stud. The greater is that love which refuses to be
shut out, that sends such a heavenly summons to you
to repent, and in so eminent a manner; it is not your
having been an enemy, a blasphemer, a denier of God;
Peter denied Christ three times, nay, the third time
he even abjured Him, and yet, mark the words — the
Lord looked on him, and immediately he repented.
Ath. My case is worse than Peter's.
Stud. And yet you see you are called on to repent.
Ath. I think you are called to make me repent;
there's no answering you.
Stud. Amen; may I have the blessing of being an
instrument to so good a work; there seems to be
something extraordinary in it all.
Ath. It's all a surprise to me how came I hither.
Stud. Nay, how came I hither ?— How came this book here ?—Who writ the lines in the frontispiece?
—How came I to read them i—'Tis all a dream to
me!
Ath. How came you to think of me upon the read-
ing them? And how came I here just at the moment,
and out of my way too?
\He lifts up his hands and cries out, "There is a
God, certainly there is; I am convinced of it; it must
be jo."]
Stud. Nothing more certain; nor is there any doubt
but all these things are of Him.
Ath. But there are yet greater things behind; I wish you would go with me to my friend Mr 's chamber;I am persuaded something yet more extraordinary must
have befallen him.
Stud. With all my heart.
[They both go to the first gentleman's chamber, and
find him at home, very much out of order, but willing
enough to discourse ivith them.\
Ath. Well, friend of mine, I hope you are better
disposed to your friends than when I saw you last. Gent. Truly, when I saw you last, I was disposed
of by the devil, and so, I doubt, were you; I hope I
shall never come into that horrid place again.
Ath. What horrid place?
Gent. You know where I mean; I tremble at the
very thoughts of the place, and much more of the
company; I wish I could prevail upon you to come
no more among them too; I assure you, if I know
myself, and if God would assist me to do it, I would
much rather go to a stake to be burnt.
Stud. I rejoice in such an alteration, sir, upon you,
and I hope our friend here is of the same mind; long
may it continue in you both.
Ath. Well, pray tell us something of the occasion of
this happy alteration, for it will seem still more strange how you came to be instrumental to my change, if I
know nothing of the means that brought about your own.
Gent. Mine! I assure you it was all from heaven;
not the light that shone about St. Paul was more
immediately from heaven than the stroke that touched
my soul; it is true I had no voice without, but a
voice has spoken (I hope) effectually to my under-
standing; I had voice enough to tell me how I was
in the hands of that Power, that Majesty, that God,
whom I had wickedly, and with a hardness not to be
expressed, disowned and denied.
Stud. Pray, sir, if you care to have it known, give
us some account of the particulars of this wonderful
thing.
Gent. Sir, I shall do it freely; I think I ought not
to conceal it.
[Here he gives an account of the surprise he was in
by the lightning, how he was stopped in his way to his
wicked company, and went back to his chamber.']
Ath. Well, now I will no more wonder at the
salutation you gave me when I came to call you, but
thank you for it.
Gent. What salutation?
Ath. Why, when I was at your chamber about two
hours ago.
Gent. You at my chamber!
Ath. Nay, you need not conceal it, for I have told
our friend here all the story.
Gent. I know nothing of what you talk of, much
less what you mean.
Ath. Nay, what need you go about to conceal it?
I tell you I do not take it ill; I hope I may have
reason to be thankful for what you said to me, and
look upon it as spoken from Heaven; for I assure you,
it has been an introduction to that light in my thoughts
which I hope shall never be extinguished.
Gent. Dear friend, as I believe you are serious, so
I hope you believe I am so; I profess I know nothing
of all you talk about.
Ath. Why, was I not at your door this afternoon a
little after the great shower of rain?
Gent. Not that I know of.
Ath. Why, did not I knock at your chamber-door,
and you come to the door yourself and speak to me?
Gent. Not to-day, I am very sure of it.
Ath. Am I awake i Are you Mr ?am I
sure we are all alive, and know what we are saying,
and to whom?
Gent. I beseech you unriddle yourself, for I am
surprised.
Ath. Why, about three o'clock this afternoon I
came to this chamber-door; I knocked; you came
and opened the door; I began to speak, you inter-
rupted me, and
[Here he repeats the passage at large, and his own thoughts and resentment, as before.]
Gent. Depend upon it, 'twas some voice from
heaven, it was nothing of mine; I have not been at
the door since two of the clock, when I came first in,
but have been on the bed, or in my study ever since,
wholly taken up with my own thoughts, and very much
indisposed.
[The young man turns pale, and falls into a s<woon.~\
There was a great deal more belonging to this story,
but it is too long for the present purpose; I have
related this part on several accounts, and it hits the
purpose I am upon many ways.
(i.) Here is a visible evidence of God, and of His
being and nature, fixed so in the mind, that not the
most hardened atheist can deny it; nature recoils at
every endeavour to suppress it, and the very pulsation
of his blood shall discover and acknowledge it.
(2.) Yet even in this we see how the power of
imagination may be worked up by the secret agency
of an unknown hand, how many things concurred to
make this man believe he had seen an apparition, and
heard a voice; and yet there was nothing in it but the
voice of a man unseen and mistaken. The young man
was so surprised at his friend's declaring that he knew
nothing of his coming there, that he concluded it had
been all a vision or apparition that opened the door,
and that it was a voice that had spoken to him, of
what kind he knew not; and the reflection upon this
surprised him so much as threw him into a swoon, and
yet here was neither vision or voice, but that of an
ordinary person, and one who meant well and said
well.
It is not to be doubted but that many an apparition
related with a great deal of certainty in the world, and
of which good ends have followed, has been no more
than such a serious mistake as this.
But before I leave it, let me observe that this should
not at all hinder us from making a very good use of
such things; for many a voice may be directed from
heaven that is not immediately spoken from thence; as
when the children cried Hosannah to our Saviour, they
fulfilled the Scripture, which said, "Out of the mouths
of babes and sucklings Thou hast ordained praise;" so
doubtless He that made all things and created all things,
may appoint instruction to be given by fortuitous
accidents, and may direct concurring circumstances to
touch and affect the mind as much and as effectually
as if they had been immediate and miraculous.
Thus was the two persons happening to say the
same words to the atheist, the strange reading of those
lines when the person came into the bookseller's shop,
the incident of his running into the shop for shelter,
and many the like things of the same nature, and ordered 3'4

in the same manner as the cock crowing when Peter
denied Christ, which, though wonderfully concurrent
with what his blessed Master had foretold, yet was
no extraordinary thing in a cock, who naturally crows
at such a time of the morning.
In a word, all these things serve to convince us of
a great superintendency of divine Providence in the
minutest affairs of this world, of a manifest existence of
the invisible world, of the reality of spirits, and of the
intelligence between us and them. I hope I have
said nothing of it to misguide anybody, or to assist
them to delude themselves, having spoken of it with
the utmost seriousness in my design, and with a sincere
desire for a general good.

Captain Woodes Rogers's Account of the Rescue of
Alexander Selkirk.
["A Cruising Voyage round the World," second edition (1718),
pp. 123-130.]
AT seven this morning [Jan. 31, 1709] we made
f^ the island of Juan Fernandez. ... In the
afternoon we hoisted our pinnace out; Captain
Dover, with the boat's crew, went in her to go ashore,
though we could not be less than four leagues off.
As soon as the pinnace was gone, I went on board the
"Duchess," who admired our boat attempting going
ashore at that distance from land. 'Twas against my
inclination, but to oblige Captain Dover I consented
to let her go. As soon as it was dark we saw a light
ashore. Our boat was then about a league from the
island, and bore away for the ships as soon as she saw
the lights. We put our lights abroad for the boat,
though some were of opinion the lights we saw were
our boat's lights; but as night came on, it appeared
too large for that. We fired our quarterdeck gun
and several muskets, showing lights in our mizen and
fore shrouds, that our boat might find us whilst we plied
in the lee of the island. About two in the morning
our boat came on board, having been two hours on
317
board the "Duchess," that took them up astern of us;
we were glad they got well off, because it began to
blow. We are all convinced the light is on the shore,
and design to make our ships ready to engage, believing
them to be French ships at anchor, and we must either
fight them or want water. We stood on the back
side along the south end of the island, in order to lay
in with the first southerly wind, which Captain Dampier
told us generally blows there all day long. In the
morning, being past the island, we tacked to lay it in
close aboard the land, and about ten o'clock opened
the south end of the island, and ran close aboard the
land that begins to make the north-east side.
The flaws came heavy off the shore, and we were
forced to reef our topsails when we opened the middle
bay, where we expected to find our enemy, but saw
all clear, and no ships in that nor the other bay next
the north-west end. These two bays are all that ships
ride in which recruit on this island; but the middle
bay is by much the best. We guessed there had been
ships there, but that they were gone on sight of us.
We sent our yawl ashore about noon, with Captain
Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men, all armed. Meanwhile
we and the "Duchess" kept turning to get in, and
such heavy flaws came off the land, that we were
forced to let go our topsail sheet, keeping all hands to
stand by our sails, for fear of the wind's carrying them
away; but when the flaws were gone we had little
or no wind. These flaws proceeded from the land,
which is very high in the middle of the island. Our
boat did not return; so we sent our pinnace, with the
men armed, to see what was the occasion of the yawl's
stay, for we were afraid that the Spaniards had a
garrison there, and might have seized them. We put
out a signal for our boat, and the "Duchess" showed
a French ensign. Immediately our pinnace returned from the shore, and brought abundance of cray-fish,
with a man clothed in goat's skins, who looked wilder
than the first owners of them. He had been on the
island four years and four months, being left there by
Captain Stradling in the " Cinque Ports ;" his name
was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who had been
master of the "Cinque Ports," a ship that came here
last with Captain Dampier, who told me that this was
the best man in her; so I immediately agreed with him
to be a mate on board our ship. 'Twas he that made
the fire last night when he saw our ships, which hejudged to be English. During his stay here he saw
several ships pass by, but only two came to anchor.
As he went to view them, he found them to be
Spaniards, and retired from them, upon which they
shot at him. Had they been French, he would have
submitted, but chose to risk his dying alone on the
island rather than fall into the hands of the Spaniards
in these parts; because he apprehended they would
murder him, or make a slave of him in the mines, for
he feared they would spare no stranger that might be
capable of discovering the South Seas.
The Spaniards had landed before he knew what
they were, and they came so near him that he had
much ado to escape; for they not only shot at him,
but pursued him to the woods, where he climbed to the
top of a tree, at the foot of which they made water,
and killed several goats just by, but went off without
discovering him. He told us that he was born at
Largo, in the county of Fife, in Scotland, and was bred
a sailor from his youth. The reason of his being left
here was a difference betwixt him and his captain;
which, together with the ship's being leaky, made him
willing rather to stay here than go along with him at
first; and when he was at last willing, the captain
would not receive him. He had been in the island -
before to wood and water, when two of the ship's
company were left upon it for six months till the ship
returned, being chased thence by two French South
Sea ships.
He had with him his clothes and bedding, with
a firelock, some powder, bullets, and tobacco, a hat-
chet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, some practical pieces,
and his mathematical instruments and books. He
diverted and provided for himself as well as he could,
but for the first eight months had much ado to bear up
against melancholy, and the terror of being left alone in
such a desolate place. He built two huts with pimento
trees, covered them with long grass, and lined them with
the skins of goats, which he killed with his gun as he
wanted, so long as his powder lasted, which was but a
pound; and that being almost spent, he got fire by
rubbing two sticks of pimento wood together upon his
knee. In the lesser hut, at some distance from the
other, he dressed his victuals; and in the larger he
slept and employed himself in reading, singing psalms,
and praying; so that he said he was a better Christian
while in this solitude than ever he was before, or than,
he was afraid, he should ever be again.
At first he never ate anything till hunger con-
strained him, partly for grief, and partly for want of
bread and salt. Nor did he go to bed till he could
watch no longer; the pimento wood, which burnt very
clear, served him both for firing and candle, and re-
freshed him with its fragrant smell. He might have
had fish enough, but could not eat them for want of
salt, because they occasioned a looseness; except cray-
fish, which are there as large as lobsters, and very good.
These he sometimes boiled, and at other times broiled,
as he did his goats' flesh, of which he made very good
broth, for they are not so rank as ours. He kept an
account of 500 that he killed while there, and caught 
as many more, which he marked on the ear, and let go.
When his powder failed, he took them by speed of
feet; for his way of living and continual exercise of
walking and running cleared him of all gross humours;
so that he ran with wonderful swiftness through the
woods, and up the rocks and hills, as we perceived
when we employed him to catch goats for us. We
had a bull-dog, which we sent, with several of our
nimblest runners, to help him in catching goats; but he
distanced and tired both the dog and the men, catched
the goats, and brought them to us on his back.
He told us that his agility in pursuing a goat had
once like to have cost him his life: he pursued it with
so much eagerness that he catched hold of it on the
brink of a precipice, of which he was not aware, the
bushes hiding it from him; so that he fell with the
goat down the said precipice, a great height, and was
so stunned and bruised with the fall that he narrowly
escaped with his life; and when he came to his senses,
found the goat dead under him. He lay there about
twenty-four hours, and was scarce able to crawl to his
hut, which was about a mile distant, or to stir abroad
again for ten days.
He came at last to relish his meat well enough
without salt or bread; and in the season had plenty of
good turnips, which had been sowed there by Captain
Dampier's men, and have now overspread some acres
of ground. He had enough of good cabbage from the
cabbage trees, and seasoned his meat with the fruit of
the pimento trees, which is the same as Jamaica pepper,
and smells deliciously. He found also a black pepper
called malageta, which was very good to expel wind,
and against griping in the guts.
He soon wore out all his shoes and clothes by
running through the woods; and at last, being forced
to shift without them, his feet became so hard that he '
III. X
ran everywhere without difficulty, and it was some
time before he could wear shoes after we found him;
for, not being used to any so long, his feet swelled when
he came first to wear them again.
After he had conquered his melancholy, he di-
verted himself sometimes by cutting his name on the
trees, and the time of his being left, and continuance
there. He was at first much pestered with cats and
rats, that bred in great numbers from some of each
species which had got ashore from ships that put in
there to wood and water. The rats gnawed his feet
and clothes whilst asleep, which obliged him to cherish
the cats with his goats' flesh, by which many of them
became so tame, that they would lie about him in
hundreds, and soon delivered him from the rats. He
likewise tamed some kids, and to divert himself
would, now and then, sing and dance with them and
his cats; so that, by the care of Providence, and
vigour of his youth, being now about thirty years old,
he came at last to conquer all the inconveniences of his
solitude, and to be very easy.
When his clothes wore out, he made himself a
coat and a cap of goat's skins, which he stitched
together with little thongs of the same, that he cut
with his knife. He had no other needle but a nail;
and when his knife was wore to the back, he made
others, as well as he could, of some iron hoops that
were left ashore, which he beat thin and ground upon
stones. Having some linen cloth by him, he sewed
himself shirts with a nail, and stitched them with the
worsted of his old stockings, which he pulled out on
purpose. He had his last shirt on when we found
him on the island.
At his first coming on board us, he had so much
forgot his language, for want of use, that we could scarce
understand him, for he seemed to speak his words by halves. We offered him a dram, but he would not
touch it, having drank nothing but water since his
being there; and 'twas some time before he could
relish our victuals.
He could give us an account of no other product
of the island than what we have mentioned, except
small black plums, which are very good, but hard
to come at, the trees which bear them growing on
high mountains and rocks. Pimento trees are plenty
here, and we saw some of sixty feet high, and about
two yards thick, and cotton trees higher, and more
than four fathom round in the stock.
The climate is so good that the trees and grass
are verdant all the year. The winter lasts no longer
than June and July, and is not then severe, there being
only a small frost and a little hail, but sometimes great
rains. The heat of the summer is equally moderate,
and there's not much thunder or tempestuous weather
of any sort. We saw no venomous or savage creature
on the island, nor any other sort of beast, but goats, &c.,
as above mentioned, the first of which had been put
ashore here on purpose for a breed by Juan Fernandez,
a Spaniard, who settled there with some families for a
time, till the continent of Chili began to submit to the
Spaniards; which, being more profitable, tempted them
to quit this island, which is capable of maintaining a
good number of people, and of being made so strong
that they could not be easily dislodged.
Rengrose, in his account of Captain Sharpe's voyage,
and other buccaneers, mentions one who had escaped
ashore here, out of a ship which was cast away with
all the rest of the company, and says he lived five years
alone, before he had the opportunity of another ship to
carry him off. Captain Dampier talks of a Mosquito
Indian that belonged to Captain Watlin, who, being
a-hunting in the woods when the captain left the r
island, lived there three years alone, and shifted much
in the same manner as Mr. Selkirk did, till Captain
Dampier came hither in 1684 and carried him off.
The first that went ashore was one of his countrymen,
and they saluted one another, first, by prostrating them-
selves by turns on the ground, and then embracing.
But whatever there is in these stories, this of Mr. Selkirk I know to be true; and his behaviour after-
wards gives me reason to believe the account he gave
me how he spent his time, and bore up under such an
affliction, in which nothing but the Divine Providence
could have supported any man.
II.
Steele's Account of Selkirk.
\Tht Englishman, December 1-3, 1713.]
Under the title of this paper, I do not think it
foreign to my design to speak of a man born in
her Majesty's dominions, and relate an adventure
in his life so uncommon, that it is doubtful whether
the like has happened to any other of the human
race. The person I speak of is Alexander Selkirk,
whose name is familiar to men of curiosity, from the
fame of his having lived four years and four months
alone in the island of Juan Fernandez. I had the
pleasure, frequently, to converse with the man soon
after his arrival in England in the year 1711. It was
matter of great curiosity to hear him, as he is a man of
good sense, give an account of the different revolutions
in his own mind in that long solitude. When we con-
sider how painful absence from company, for the space
of but one evening, is to the generality of mankind, we
may have a sense how painful this necessary and con-

stant solitude was to a man bred a sailor, and ever
accustomed to enjoy and suffer, eat, drink, and sleep,
and perform all offices of life, in fellowship and com-
pany. He was put ashore from a leaky vessel, with
the captain of which he had had an irreconcilable dif-
ference; and he chose rather to take his fate in this
place than in a crazy vessel, under a disagreeable com-
mander. His portion was a sea-chest, his wearing
clothes and bedding, a firelock, a pound of gunpowder,
a large quantity of bullets, a flint and steel, a few pounds
of tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, and
other books of devotion; together with pieces that con-
cerned navigation, and his mathematical instruments.
Resentment against his officer, who had ill-used him,
made him look forward on this change of life as the
more eligible one, till the instant in which he saw the
vessel put off; at which moment his heart yearned
within him, and melted at the parting with his com-
rades and all human society at once. He had in pro-
visions for the sustenance of life but the quantity of
two meals, the island abounding only with wild goats,
cats, and rats. He judged it most probable that he
should find more immediate and easy relief by finding
shell-fish on the shore than seeking game with his gun.
He accordingly found great quantities of turtles, whose
flesh is extremely delicious, and of which he frequently
ate very plentifully on his first arrival, till it grew dis-
agreeable to his stomach, except in jellies. The neces-
sities of hunger and thirst were his greatest diversion
from the reflections on his lonely condition. When
those appetites were satisfied, the desire of society was
as strong a call upon him, and he appeared to himself
least necessitous when he wanted everything; for the
supports of his body were easily attained, but the eager
longings for seeing again the face of man, during the
interval of craving bodily appetites, were hardly sup-
portable. He grew dejected, languid, and melancholy,
scarce able to refrain from doing himself violence, till by degrees, by the force of reason and frequent reading
the Scriptures, and turning his thoughts upon the study
of navigation, after the space of eighteen months he
grew thoroughly reconciled to his condition. When
he had made this conquest, the vigour of his health,
disengagement from the world, a constant cheerful,
serene sky and a temperate air, made his life one con-
tinual feast, and his being much more joyful than it had
before been irksome. He now, taking delight in every-
thing, made the hut in which he lay, by ornaments
which he cut down from a spacious wood on the side
of which it was situated, the most delicious bower,
fanned with continual breezes and gentle aspirations of
wind, that made his repose after the chase equal to the
most sensual pleasures.
I forgot to observe, that during the time of his dis-
satisfaction monsters of the deep, which frequently lay
on the shore, added to the terrors of his solitude; the
dreadful howlings and voices seemed too terrible to
be made for human ears; but upon the recovery of his
temper he could with pleasure not only hear their voices,
but approach the monsters themselves with great intre-
pidity. He speaks of sea-lions, whose jaws and tails
were capable of seizing or breaking the limbs of a man
if he approached them. But at that time his spirits and
life were so high, that he could act so regularly and
unconcerned, that merely from being unruffled in him-
self he killed them with the greatest ease imaginable;
for observing that though their jaws and tails were so
terrible, yet the animals being mighty slow in working
themselves round, he had nothing to do but place him-
self exactly opposite to their middle, and as close to
them as possible, and he despatched them with his
hatchet at will.

THE END.

The precautions which he took against want, in
case of sickness, was to lame kids when very young,
so as that they might recover their health, but never be
capable of speed. These he had in great numbers
about his hut; and as he was himself in full vigour, he
could take at full speed the swiftest goat running on a
promontory, and never failed of catching them, but on
a descent.
His habitation was extremely pestered with rats,
which gnawed his clothes and feet when sleeping. To
defend himself against them he fed and tamed numbers
of young kitlings, who lay about his bed and preserved
him from the enemy. When his clothes were quite
worn out he dried and tacked together the skins of
goats, with which he clothed himself, and was inured
to pass through woods, bushes, and brambles with as
much carelessness and precipitance as any other animal.
It happened once to him that running on the summit of
a hill he made a stretch to seize a goat, with which
under him he fell down a precipice and lay senseless for
the space of three days, the length of which he measured
by the moon's growth since his last observation. This
manner of life grew so exquisitely pleasant, that he never
had a moment heavy upon his hands; his nights were
untroubled and his days joyous, from the practice of
temperance and exercise. It was his manner to use
stated hours and places for exercises of devotion, which
he performed aloud, in order to keep up the faculties of
speech, and to utter himself with greater energy.
When I first saw him I thought if I had not been
let into his character and story I could have discerned
that he had been much separated from company from
his aspect and gesture; there was a strong but cheerful
seriousness in his look, and a certain disregard to the
ordinary things about him, as if he had been sunk in
thought. When the ship which brought him off the

ROBINSON CRUSOE'S PREFACE.
AS the design of everything is said to be first in the
intention, and last in the execution, so I come
now to acknowledge to my reader that the pre-
sent work is not merely the product of the two first
volumes, but the two first volumes may rather be called
the product of this. The fable is always made for the
moral, not the moral for the fable.
I have heard that the envious and ill-disposed part of
the world have raised some objections against the two
first volumes, on pretence, for want of a better reason,
that (as they say) the story is feigned, that the names
are borrowed, and that it is all a romance; that there
never were any such man or place, or circumstances in
any man's life; that it is all formed and embellished by
invention to impose upon the world. I, Robinson Crusoe, being at this time in perfect
and sound mind and memory, thanks be to God there-
for, do hereby declare their objection is an invention
scandalous in design, and false in fact; and do affirm
that the story, though allegorical, is also historical; and
that it is the beautiful representation of a life of un-
exampled misfortunes, and of a variety not to be met
with in the world, sincerely adapted to and intended for
the common good of mankind, and designed at first, as it
is now farther applied, to the most serious uses possible.
L
Farther, that there is a man alive, and well known
too, the actions of whose life are the just subject of
these volumes, and to whom all or most part of the
story most directly alludes; this may be depended
upon for truth, and to this I set my name. The famous "History of Don Quixote," a work
which thousands read with pleasure, to one that knows
the meaning of it, was an emblematic history of, and a
just satire upon, the Duke de Medina Sidonia, a person
very remarkable at that time in Spain. To those who
knew the original, the figures were lively and easily
discovered themselves, as they are also here, and the
images were just; and therefore, when a malicious but
foolish writer, in the abundance of his gall, spoke of the
quixotism of R. Crusoe, as he called it, he showed,
evidently, that he knew nothing of what he said; and
perhaps will be a little startled when I shall tell him
that what he meant for a satire was the greatest of
panegyrics.
Without letting the reader into a nearer explication
of the matter, I proceed to let him know, that the
happy deductions I have employed myself to make,
from all the circumstances of my story, will abundantly
make him amends for his not having the emblem ex-
plained by the original; and that when in my obser-
vations and reflections of any kind in this volume I
mention my solitudes and retirements, and allude to
the circumstances of the former story, all those parts
of the story are real facts in my history, whatever
borrowed lights they may be represented by. Thus
the fright and fancies which succeeded the story of
the print of a man's foot, and surprise of the old goat,
and the thing rolling on my bed, and my jumping out
in a fright, are all histories and real stories; as are
likewise the dream of being taken by messengers, being
arrested by officers, the manner of being driven on shore by the surge of the sea, the ship on fire, the
description of starving, the story of my man Friday,
and many more most material passages observed here,
and on which any religious reflections are made, are all
historical and true in fact. It is most real that I had
a parrot and taught it to call me by my name; such a
servant a savage, and afterwards a Christian, and that
his name was called Friday, and that he was ravished
from me by force, and died in the hands that took
him, which I represent by being killed; this is all
literally true, and should I enter into discoveries many
alive can testify them. His other conduct and assist-
ance to me also have just references in all their parts
to the helps I had from that faithful savage in my
real solitudes and disasters.
The story of the bear in the tree, and the fight with
the wolves in the snow, is likewise matter of real
history; and, in a word, the "Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe" are one whole scheme of a real life of eight
and twenty years, spent in the most wandering, deso-
late, and afflicting circumstances that ever man went
through, and in which I have lived so long in a life of
wonders, in continued storms, fought with the worst
kind of savages and man-eaters; by unaccountable
surprising incidents, fed by miracles greater than that of
ravens; suffered all manner of violences and oppressions,
injurious reproaches, contempt of men, attacks of devils,
corrections from Heaven, and oppositions on earth; have
had innumerable upsand downs in matters of fortune,
been in slavery worse than Turkish, escaped by an ex-
quisite management, as that in the story of Xury, and
the boat at Sallee; been taken up at sea in distress,
raised again and depressed again, and that oftener perhaps in one man's life than ever was known be-
fore; shipwrecked often, though more by land than
by sea. In a word, there is not a circumstance in the imaginary story but has its just allusion to a real story,
and chimes part for part and step for step with the
inimitable Life of Robinson Crusoe. In like manner, when in these reflections I speak of
the times and circumstances of particular actions done,
or incidents which happened, in my solitude and island-life, an impartial reader will be so just to take it as
it is, viz., that it is spoken or intended of that part
of the real story which the island-life is a just allu-
sion to; and in this the story is not only illustrated,
but the real part I think most justly approved. For
example, in the latter part of this work called the
Vision, I begin thus: "When I was in my island-kingdom I had abundance of strange notions of my
seeing apparitions," &c. All these reflections are just
history of a state of forced confinement, which in my
real history is represented by a confined retreat in
an island; and it is as reasonable to represent one
kind of imprisonment by another, as it is to represent
anything that really exists by that which exists not.
The story of my fright with something on my bed was
word for word a history of what happened, and indeed
all those things received very little alteration, except
what necessarily attends removing the scene from one
place to another.
My observations upon solitude are the same; and I
think I need say no more than that the same remark is
to be made upon all the references made here to the
transactions of the former volumes, and the reader is
desired to allow for it as he goes on.
Besides all this, here is the just and only good end
of all parable or allegoric history brought to pass,
viz., for moral and religious improvement. Here is
invincible patience recommended under the worst of
misery, indefatigable application and undaunted reso-
lution under the greatest and most discouraging cir-
cumstances; I say, these are recommended as the
only way to work through those miseries, and their
success appears sufficient to support the most dead-
hearted creature in the world.
Had the common way of writing a man's private
history been taken, and I had given you the conduct or
life of a man you knew, and whose misfortunes and in-
firmities perhaps you had sometimes unjustly triumphed
over, all I could have said would have yielded no diver-
sion, and perhaps scarce have obtained a reading, or at
best no attention; the teacher, like a greater, having
no honour in his own country. Facts that are formed
to touch the mind must be done a great way off, and by
somebody never heard of. Even the miracles of the
blessed Saviour of the world suffered scorn and con-
tempt, when it was reflected that they were done by the
carpenter's son; one whose family and original they
had a mean opinion of, and whose brothers and sisters
were ordinary people like themselves.
There even yet remains a question whether the in-
struction of these things will take place, when you are
supposing the scene, which is placed so far off, had its
original so near home.
But I am far from being anxious about that, seeing,
I am well assured, that if the obstinacy of our age
should shut their ears against the just reflections made
in this volume upon the transactions taken notice of in
the former, there will come an age when the minds of
men shall be more flexible, when the prejudices of their
fathers shall have no place, and when the rules of virtue
and religion, justly recommended, shall be more grate-
fully accepted than they may be now, that our children
may rise up in judgment against their fathers, and one
generation be edified by the same teaching which
another generation had despised.

THE PUBLISHER'S INTRODUCTION.
THE publishing this extraordinary volume will
appear to be no presumption, when it shall be
remembered with what unexpected good and
evil will the former volumes have been accepted in
the world.
If the foundation has been so well laid, the structure
cannot but be expected to bear a proportion; and while
the parable has been so diverting, the moral must cer-
tainly be equally agreeable.
The success the two former parts have met with
has been known by the envy it has brought upon the
editor, expressed in a thousand hard words from the
men of trade—the effect of that regret which they
entertained at their having no share in it. And I must
do the author the justice to say, that not a dog has
wagged his tongue at the work itself, nor has a word
been said to lessen the value of it, but which has been
the visible effect of that envy at the good fortune of
the bookseller.
The riddle is now expounded, and the intelligent
reader may see clearly the end and design of the whole
work; that it is calculated for, and dedicated to, the
improvement and instruction of mankind in the ways of
virtue and piety, by representing the various circum-
stances to which mankind is exposed, and encouraging
such as fall into ordinary or extraordinary casualties of
life, how to work through difficulties with unwearied
diligence and application, and look up to Providence
for success.
The observations and reflections, that take up this
volume, crown the work; if the doctrine has been
accepted, the application must of necessity please; and
the author shows now, that he has learned sufficient
experience how to make other men wise and himself
happy.
The moral of the fable, as the author calls it, is
most instructing; and those who challenged him most
maliciously, with not making his pen useful, will have
leisure to reflect, that they passed their censure too
soon, and, like Solomon's fool, judged of the matter
before they heard it.
Those whose avarice, prevailing over their honesty,
had invaded the property of this book by a corrupt
abridgment, have both failed in their hope and been
ashamed of the fact; shifting off the guilt, as well as
they could, though weakly, from one to another. The
principal pirate is gone to his place, and we say no
more of him—De mortuis nil nisi bonum: it is satis-
faction enough that the attempt has proved abortive, as
the baseness of the design might give them reason to
expect it would.
SERIOUS REFLECTIONS
ROBINSON CRUSOE
INTRODUCTION
I MUST have made very little use of my solitary and
wandering years if, after such a scene of wonders,
as my life may be justly called, I had nothing to
say, and had made no observations which might be
useful and instructing, as well as pleasant and diverting,
to those that are to come after me.
Chapter t.
Of Solitude.
How incapable to make us happy, and how unqualified
to a Christian life.
IHAVE frequently looked back, you may be sure,
and that with different thoughts, upon the notions
of a long tedious life of solitude, which I have
represented to the world, and of which you must have III. A
formed some ideas, from the life of a man in an
island. Sometimes I have wondered how it could be
supported, especially for the first years, when the change
was violent and imposed, and nature unacquainted with
anything like it. Sometimes I have as much wondered
why it should be any grievance or affliction, seeing upon
the whole view of the stage of life which we act upon
in this world it seems to me that life in general is, or
ought to be, but one universal act of solitude; but I
find it is natural to judge of happiness by its suiting or
not suiting our own inclinations. Everything revolves
in our minds by innumerable circular motions, all
centering in ourselves. We judge of prosperity and of
affliction, joy and sorrow, poverty, riches, and all the
various scenes of life—I say, we judge of them by
ourselves. Thither we bring them home, as meats
touch the palate, by which we try them; the gay
part of the world, or the heavy part; it is all one,
they only call it pleasant or unpleasant, as they suit our
taste.
The world, I say, is nothing to us but as it is more
or less to our relish. All reflection is carried home,
and our dear self is, in one respect, the end of living.
Hence man may be properly said to be alone in the
midst of the crowds and hurry of men and business.
All the reflections which he makes are to himself; all
that is pleasant he embraces for himself; all that is
irksome and grievous is tasted but by his own palate.
What are the sorrows of other men to us, and what
their joy? Something we may be touched indeed with
by the power of sympathy, and a secret turn of the
affections; but all the solid reflection is directed to
ourselves. Our meditations are all solitude in perfec-
tion; our passions are all exercised in retirement; we
love, we hate, we covet, we enjoy, all in privacy and
solitude. All that we communicate of those things to any other is but for their assistance in the pursuit of
our desires; the end is at home; the enjoyment, the
contemplation, is all solitude and retirement; it is for
ourselves we enjoy, and for ourselves we suffer.
What, then, is the silence of life? And how is it afflicting while a man has the voice of his soul to speak to God and to himself? That man can never want
conversation who is company for himself, and he that cannot converse profitably with himself is not fit for any conversation at all. And yet there are many good reasons why a life of solitude, as solitude is now understood by the age, is not at all suited to the life of a
Christian or of a wise man. Without inquiring, there-
fore, into the advantages of solitude, and how it is to
be managed, I desire to be heard concerning what
solitude really is; for I must confess I have different
notions about it, far from those which are generally
understood in the world, and far from all those notions
upon which those people in the primitive times, and
since that also, acted; who separated themselves into
deserts and unfrequented places, or confined them-
selves to cells, monasteries, and the like, retired, as
they call it, from the world. All which, I think,
have nothing of the thing I call solitude in them, nor
do they answer any of the true ends of solitude, much
less those ends which are pretended to be sought after
by those who have talked most of those retreats from
the world.
As for confinement in an island, if the scene was
placed there for this very end, it were not at all amiss.
I must acknowledge there was confinement from the
enjoyments of the world, and restraint from human
society. But all that was no solitude; indeed no part
of it was so, except that which, as in my story, I
applied to the contemplation of sublime things, and
that was but a very little, as my readers well know, compared to what a length of years my forced retreat
lasted.
It is evident then that, as I see nothing but what is
far from being retired in the forced retreat of an island,
the thoughts being in no composure suitable to a retired
condition—no, not for a great while; so I can affirm,
that I enjoy much more solitude in the middle of the
greatest collection of mankind in the world, I mean, at
London, while I am writing this, than ever I could say
I enjoyed in eight and twenty years' confinement to a
desolate island.
I have heard of a man that, upon some extraordinary
disgust which he took at the unsuitable conversation of
some of his nearest relations, whose society he could
not avoid, suddenly resolved never to speak any more.
He kept his resolution most rigorously many years;
not all the tears or entreaties of his friends — no, not of
his wife and children— could prevail with him to break
his silence. It seems it was their ill-behaviour to him,
at first, that was the occasion of it; for they treated
him with provoking language, which frequently put him
into undecent passions, and urged him to rash replies;
and he took this severe way to punish himself for being
provoked, and to punish them for provoking him. But
the severity was unjustifiable; it ruined his family, and
broke up his house. His wife could not bear it, and
after endeavouring, by all the ways possible, to alter
his rigid silence, went first away from him, and after-
wards away from herself, turning melancholy and dis-
tracted. His children separated, some one way and
some another way; and only one daughter, who loved
her father above all the rest, kept with him, tended
him, talked to him by signs, and lived almost dumb
like her father near twenty-nine years with him; till
being very sick, and in a high fever, delirious as we call
it, or light-headed, he broke his silence, not knowing when he did it, and spoke, though wildly at first.
He recovered of the illness afterwards, and frequently
talked with his daughter, but not much, and very
seldom to anybody else.
Yet this man did not live a silent life with respect to
himself; he read continually, and wrote down many
excellent things, which deserved to have appeared in
the world, and was often heard to pray to God in his
solitudes very audibly and with great fervency; but
the unjustice which his rash vow — if it was a vow — of
silence was to his family, and the length he carried it,
was so unjustifiable another way, that I cannot say his
instructions could have much force in them.
Had he been a single man, had he wandered into a
strange country or place where the circumstance of it
had been no scandal, his vow of silence might have
been as commendable and, as I think, much more than
any of the primitive Christians' vows of solitude were,
whose retreat into the wilderness, and giving themselves
up to prayer and contemplation, shunning human society
and the like, was so much esteemed by the primitive
fathers; and from whence our religious houses and
orders of religious people were first derived.
The Jews said John the Baptist had a devil because
he affected solitude and retirement; and they took it
from an old proverb they had in the world at that time,
that "every solitary person must be an angel or a
devil."
A man under a vow of perpetual silence, if but
rigorously observed, would be, even on the Exchange
of London, as perfectly retired from the world as a
hermit in his cell, or a solitaire in the deserts of Arabia;
and if he is able to observe it rigorously, may reap all
the advantages of those solitudes without the unjusti-
fiable part of such a life, and without the austerities of
a life among brutes. For the soul of a man, under a due and regular conduct, is as capable of reserving
itself, or separating itself from the rest of human society,
in the midst of a throng, as it is when banished into a
desolate island.
The truth is, that all those religious hermit-like
solitudes, which men value themselves so much upon, are
but an acknowledgment of the defect or imperfection
of our resolutions, our incapacity to bind ourselves to
needful restraints, or rigorously to observe the limitations
we have vowed ourselves to observe. Or, take it thus,
that the man first resolving that it would be his felicity
to be entirely given up to conversing only with heaven
and heavenly things, to be separated to prayer and good
works, but being sensible how ill such a life will agree
with flesh and blood, causes his soul to commit a rape
upon his body, and to carry it by force, as it were, into
a desert, or into a religious retirement, from whence it
cannot return, and where it is impossible for it to have
any converse with mankind, other than with such as are
under the same vows and the same banishment. The
folly of this is evident many ways.
I shall bring it home to the case in hand thus:
Christians may, without doubt, come to enjoy all the
desirable advantages of solitude by a strict retirement
and exact government of their thoughts, without any
of these formalities, rigours, and apparent mortifications,
which I think I justly call a rape upon human nature,
and consequently without the breach of Christian duties,
which they necessarily carry with them, such as reject-
ing Christian communion, sacraments, ordinances, and
the like.
There is no need of a wilderness to wander among
wild beasts, no necessity of a cell on the top of a
mountain, or a desolate island in the sea; if the mind
be confined, if the soul be truly master of itself, all is
safe; for it is certainly and effectually master of the -
body, and what signify retreats, especially a forced
retreat as mine was? The anxiety of my circum-
stances there, I can assure you, was such for a time
as was very unsuitable to heavenly meditations, and even
when that was got over, the frequent alarms from the
savages put the soul sometimes to such extremities of
fear and horror, that all manner of temper was lost,
and I was no more fit for religious exercises than a
sick man is fit for labour.
Divine contemplations require a composure of soul,
uninterrupted by any extraordinary motions or disorders
of the passions; and this, I say, is much easier to be
obtained and enjoyed in the ordinary course of life,
than in monkish cells and forcible retreats.
The business is to get a retired soul, a frame of
mind truly elevated above the world, and then we may
be alone whenever we please, in the greatest apparent
hurry of business or company. If the thoughts are
free, and rightly unengaged, what imports the employ-
ment the body is engaged in? Does not the soul act
by a differing agency, and is not the body the servant,
nay, the slave of the soul? Has the body hands to
act, or feet to walk, or tongue to speak, but by the
agency of the understanding and will, which are the
two deputies of the soul's power? Are not all the
affections and all the passions, which so universally
agitate, direct, and possess the body, are they not all
seated in the soul? What have we to do then, more
or less, but to get the soul into a superior direction and
elevation? There is no need to prescribe the body to
this or that situation; the hands, or feet, or tongue
can no more disturb the retirement of the soul, than a
man having money in his pocket can take it out, or
pay it, or dispose of it by his hand, without his own
knowledge.
It is the soul's being entangled by outward objects that interrupts its contemplation of Divine objects, which
is the excuse for these solitudes, and makes the removing
the body from those outward objects seemingly neces-
sary; but what is there of religion in all this? For
example, a vicious inclination removed from the object
is still a vicious inclination, and contracts the same
guilt as if the object were at hand; for if, as our Saviour
says, "He that looketh on a woman to lust after her"
—that is, to desire her unlawfully — has committed the
adultery already, so it will be no inverting our Saviour's
meaning to say that he that thinketh of a woman to
desire her unlawfully has committed adultery with her
already, though he has not looked on her, or has not
seen her at that time. And how shall this thinking of
her be removed by transporting the body? It must
be removed by the change in the soul, by bringing the
mind to be above the power or reach of the allure-
ment, and to an absolute mastership over the wicked
desire; otherwise the vicious desire remains, as the
force remains in the gunpowder, and will exert itself
whenever touched with the fire.
All motions to good or evil are in the soul. Out-
ward objects are but second causes; and though, it is
true, separating the man from the object is the way to
make any act impossible to be committed, yet where
the guilt does not lie in the act only, but in the inten-
tion or desire to commit it, that separation is nothing at
all, and effects nothing at all. There may be as much
adultery committed in a monastery, where a woman
never comes, as in any other place, and perhaps is so.
The abstaining from evil, therefore, depends not only
and wholly upon limiting or confining the man's actions,
but upon the man's limiting and confining his desires;
seeing to desire to sin is to sin; and the fact which we
would commit if we had opportunity is really com-
mitted, and must be answered for as such. What, then, is thereof religion, I say, in forced retirements
from the world, and vows of silence or solitude?
They are all nothing. 'Tis a retired soul that alone
is fit for contemplation, and it is the conquest of our
desires to sin that is the only human preservative
against sin.
It was a great while after I came into human society
that I felt some regret at the loss of the solitary hours
and retirements I had in the island; but when I came
to reflect upon some ill-spent time, even in my soli-
tudes, I found reason to see what I have said above—
that a man may sin alone several ways, and find subject
of repentance for his solitary crimes as well as he may
in the midst of a populous city.
The excellency of any state of life consists in its
freedom from crime; and it is evident to our experi-
ence that some society may be better adapted to a
rectitude of life than a complete solitude and retire-
ment. Some have said that next to no company, good
company is best; but it is my opinion, that next to
good company, no company is best; for as it is certain
that no company is better than bad company, so 'tis
as certain that good company is much better than no
company.
In solitude a man converses with himself, and as~a~~[
wise man said, he is not always sure that he does not converse with his enemy; but he that is in good company is sure to be always among his friends. ,,- A
The company of religious and good men is a constant
restraint from evil, and an encouragement to a religious
life. You have there the beauty of religion exemplified;
you never want as well instruction in, as example for,
all that is good; you have a contempt of evil things
constantly recommended, and the affections moved to
delight in what is good by hourly imitation. If we are
alone we want all these, and are led right or led wrong, as the temper of the mind, which is sometimes too
much the guide of our actions as well as thoughts,
happens to be constituted at that time. Here we have
no restraint upon our thoughts but from ourselves, no
restraint upon our actions but from our own consciences,
and nothing to assist us in our mortifications of our
desires, or in directing our desires, but our own reflec-
tions, which, after all, may often err, often be pre-
possessed.
If you would retreat from the world, then be sure
to retreat to good company, retreat to good books, and
retreat to good thoughts; these will always assist one
another, and always join to assist him that flies to them
in his meditations, direct him to just reflections, and
mutually encourage him against whatever may attack
him from within him or without him; whereas to
retreat from the world, as it is called, is to retreat from
good men, who are our best friends. Besides, to
retreat, as we call it, to an entire perfect solitude, is to
retreat from the public worship of God, to forsake the
assemblies, and, in a word, is unlawful, because it
obliges us to abandon those things which we are com-
manded to do.
S" Solitude, therefore, as I understand by it, a retreat
from human society, on a religious or philosophical
account, is a mere cheat; it neither can answer the end
it proposes, or qualify us for the duties of religion,
which we are commanded to perform, and is therefore
both irreligious in itself, and inconsistent with a Christian
life many ways. Let the man that would reap the
advantage of solitude, and that understands the meaning
of the word, learn to retire into himself. Serious
meditation is the essence of solitude; all the retreats
into woods and deserts are short of this; and though a
man that is perfectly master of this retirement may be
a little in danger of quietism, that is to say, of an 
affectation of reservedness, yet it may be a slander upon
him in the main, and he may make himself amends
upon the world by the blessed calm of his soul, which
they perhaps who appear more cheerful may have
little of.
Retiring into deserts in the first days of religion, and
into abbeys and monasteries since, what have they been,
or what have they been able to do, towards purchasing
the retirement I speak of? They have indeed been
things to be reckoned among austerities and acts of
mortification, and so far might be commendable; but I
must insist upon it, that a retired soul is not affected
with them any more than with the hurries of company
and society. When the soul of a man is powerfully
engaged in any particular subject, 'tis like that of St. Paul, wrapt up, whether it be into the third heaven, or
to any degree of lower exaltation. Such a man may
well say with the apostle above, "Whether I was in
the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell." It was
in such a wrapt-up state, that I conceived what I call
my vision of the angelical world, of which I have here
subjoined a very little part.
Is it rational to believe, that a mind exalted so far
above the state of things with which we ordinarily con-
verse, should not be capable of a separation from them,
which, in a word, is the utmost extent of solitude?
Let such never afflict themselves that they cannot
retreat from the world; let them learn to retreat in
the world, and they shall enjoy a perfect solitude, as
complete, to all intents and purposes, as if they were to
live in the cupola of St. Paul's, or as if they were to live
upon the top of Cheviot Hill in Northumberland.
They that cannot be retired in this manner must not
only retire from the world, but out of the world, before
they can arrive to any true solitude. Man is a creature
so formed for society, that it may not only be said that it is not good for him to be alone, but 'tis really im-
possible he should be alone. We are so continually in
need of one another, nay, in such absolute necessity of
assistance from one another, that those who have pre-
tended to give us the lives and manner of the solitaires,
as they call them, who separated themselves from man-
kind, and wandered in the deserts of Arabia and Lybia,
are frequently put to the trouble of bringing the angels
down from heaven to do one drudgery or another for
them, forming imaginary miracles to make the life
of a true solitaire possible. Sometimes they have no
bread, sometimes no water, for a long time together,
and then a miracle is brought upon the stage, to make
them live so long without food; at other times they
have angels come to be their cooks, and bring them
roast-meat; to be their physicians, to bring them
physic, and the like. If St. Hilary comes in his
wanderings to the river Nile, an humble crocodile is
brought to carry him over upon his back; though they
do not tell us whether the crocodile asked him to ride,
or he asked the crocodile, or by what means they came
to be so familiar with one another. And what is all
this to the retirement of the soul, with which it con-
verses in heaven in the midst of infinite crowds of men,
and to whom the nearest of other objects is nothing at
all, any more than the objects of mountains and deserts,
lions and leopards, and the like, were to those that
banished themselves to Arabia?
Besides, in a state of life where circumstances are
easy, and provision for the necessaries of life, which
the best saint cannot support the want of, is quietly and
plentifully made, has not the mind infinitely more room
to withdraw from the world, than when at best it must
wander for its daily food, though it were but the pro-
duct of the field?
Let no man plead he wants retirement, that he loves solitude, but cannot enjoy it because of the embarrass-
ment of the world; 'tis all a delusion; if he loves it,
if he desires it, he may have it when, where, and as
often as he pleases, let his hurries, his labours, or his
afflictions be what they will; it is not the want of an op-
portunity for solitude, but the want of a capacity of being
solitary, that is the case in all the circumstances of life.
I knew a poor but good man, who, though he was
a labourer, was a man of sense and religion, who, being
hard at work with some other men removing a great
quantity of earth to raise a bank against the side of a
pond, was one day so out of himself, and wrapt up in
a perfect application of his mind to a very serious
subject, that the poor man drove himself and his
wheelbarrow into the pond, and could not recover
himself till help came to him. This man was cer-
tainly capable of a perfect solitude, and perhaps really
enjoyed it, for, as I have often heard him say, he
lived alone in the world: (1) Had no family to
embarrass his affections;(2) his low circumstances
placed him below the observation of the upper degrees
of mankind;(3) and his reserved meditations placed
him above the wicked part, who were those in a sphere
equal to himself, among whom, as he said, and is most
true, it was very hard to find a sober man, much less a
good man; so that he lived really alone in the world,
applied himself to labour for his subsistence, had no
other business with mankind but for necessaries of life,
and conversed in heaven as effectually, and, I believe,
every way as divinely, as St. Hilary did in the deserts
of Lybia among the lions and crocodiles.
If this retirement, which they call solitude, consisted
only of separating the person from the world — that is
to say, from human society — it were itself a very mean
thing, and would every way as well be supplied by
removing from a place where a man is known to a place where he is not known, and there accustom him-
self to a retired life, making no new acquaintance, and
only making the use of mankind which I have already
spoken of, namely, for convenience and supply of neces-
sary food; and I think of the two that such a man, or
a man so retired, may have more opportunity to be an
entire recluse, and may enjoy more real solitude than a
man in a desert. For example :—
In the solitude I speak of, a man has no more to do
for the necessaries of life than to receive them from the
hands of those that are to furnish them, and pay them
for so doing; whereas in the solitude of deserts and
wandering lives, from whence all our monkish devotion
springs, they had every day their food, such as it was,
to seek, or the load of it to carry, and except where,
as is said, they put Providence to the operation of a
miracle to furnish it, they had frequently difficulties
enough to sustain life; and if we may believe history,
many of them were starved to death for mere hunger
or thirst, and as often the latter as the former.
Those that had recourse to these solitudes merely as
a mortification of their bodies, as I observed before,
and delivering themselves from the temptations which
society exposed them to, had more room for the pre-
tence, indeed, than those who allege that they did it
to give up themselves to prayer and meditation. The
first might have some reason in nature for the fact, as
men's tempers and constitutions might lead; some
having an inordinate appetite to crime, some addicted by
nature to one ill habit, some to another, though the
Christian religion does not guide us to those methods
of putting a force upon our bodies to subdue the
violence of inordinate appetite. The blessed apostle
St. Paul seems to have been in this circumstance when
being assaulted with what is called in the text "a
thorn in the flesh;" be it what it will that is meant there, it is not to my purpose, but he prayed to the
Lord thrice; that was the first method the apostle
took, and thereby set a pious example to all those who
are assaulted by any temptation. He did not imme-
diately fly to austerities and bodily modifications, sepa-
rating himself from mankind, or flying into the desert
to give himself up to fasting, and a retreat from the
world, which is the object of all private snare, but he
applied himself by serious prayer to Him who had
taught us to pray, "Lead us not into temptation."
And the answer likewise is instructing in the case; he
was not driven out as Nebuchadnezzar into the desert
—he was not commanded to retire into the wilderness
that he might be free from the temptation; nothing
less; but the answer was, "My grace is sufficient for
thee"— sufficient without the help of artificial morti-
fication.
So that even in the case of these forcible morti-
fications they are not required, much less directed, for
helps to meditation; for if meditation could not be
practised beneficially, and to all the intents and pur-
poses for which it was ordained a duty, without flying
from the face of human society, the life of man would
be very unhappy.
But doubtless the contrary is evident, and all the
parts of a complete solitude are to be as effectually
enjoyed, if we please, and sufficient grace assisting,
even in the most populous cities, among the hurries of
conversation and gallantry of a court, or the noise and
business of a camp, as in the deserts of Arabia and
Lybia, or in the desolate life of an uninhabited island.

Chapter ii
An Essay upon Honesty.
WHEN I first came home to my own country,
and began to sit down and look back upon
the past circumstances of my wandering state,
as you will in charity suppose I could not but do very
often, the very prosperity I enjoyed led me most
naturally to reflect upon the particular steps by which
I arrived to it. The condition I was in was very
happy, speaking of human felicity; the former captivity
I had suffered made my liberty sweeter to me; and
to find myself jumped into easy circumstances at once,
from a condition below the common rate of life, made
it still sweeter.
One time as I was upon my inquiries into the happy
concurrence of the causes which had brought the event
of my prosperity to pass, as an effect, it occurred to
my thoughts how much of it all depended, under the
disposition of Providence, upon the principle of honesty
which I met with in almost all the people whom it
was my lot to be concerned with in my private and
particular affairs; and I that had met with such extra-
ordinary instances of the knavery and villainy of men's
natures in other circumstances, could not but be some-
thing taken up with the miracles of honesty that I had
met with among the several people I had had to do
with, I mean, those whom I had more particularly to
do with in the articles of my liberty, estate, or effects,
which fell into their hands. I began with my most trusty and faithful widow, the
captain's wife with whom I first went to the coast of
Africa, and to whom I entrusted ^200, being the
gain I had made in my first adventures to Guinea,
as in the first volume, page 18, appears.
She was left a widow, and in but indifferent circum-
stances; but when I sent to her so far off as the Brazils,
where I was in such a condition as she might have
reasonably believed I should never have been able to
come myself, and if I had, might be in no con-
dition to recover it of her, and having myself nothing
to show under her hand for the trust, yet she was so
just that she sent the full value of what I wrote for,
being ^ioo; and to show, as far as in her lay, her
sincere honest concern for my good, put in among
many necessary things which I did not write for, I
say, put in two Bibles, besides other good books, for my
reading and instruction, as she said afterwards, in Popish
and heathen countries, where I might chance to fall.
Honesty not only leads to discharge every debt and
every trust to our neighbour, so far as is justly to be
demanded, but an honest man acknowledges himself
debtor to all mankind, for so much good to be done for
them, whether for soul or body, as Providence puts an
opportunity into his hands to do. In order to dis-
charge this debt, he studies continually for opportunity
to do all the acts of kindness and beneficence that is
possible for him to do; and though very few consider it, a
man is not a completely honest man that does not do this. Upon this consideration I question much whether a
covetous, narrow, stingy man, as we call him, one who
gives himself up to himself, as born for himself only,
and who declines the advantages and opportunities of
doing good, I mean extremely so — I say, I much ques-
tion whether such a man can be an honest man; nay,
I am satisfied he cannot be an honest man, for though
he may pay every man his own, and be just, as he thinks
it, to a farthing, yet this is part of the justice which, in
the common phrase, is the greatest injustice. This is
one meaning of that saying, summumjus, summa injuria. To pay every man their own is the common law in. b
of honesty, but to do good to all mankind, as far as you
are able, is the chancery law of honesty j and though,
in common law or justice, as I call it, mankind can
have no claim upon us if we do but just pay our debts,
yet in heaven's chancery they will have relief against us,
for they have a demand in equity of all the good to be
done them that it is in our power to do, and this
chancery court, or court of equity, is held in every man's
breast —'tis a true court of conscience, and every man's
conscience is a lord chancellor to him. If he has not
performed, if he has not paid this debt, conscience will
decree him to pay it, on the penalty of declaring him a
dishonest man, even in his own opinion; and if he
still refuses to comply, will proceed by all the legal
steps of a court of conscience process, till at last it will
issue out a writ of rebellion against him, and proclaim
him a rebel to nature and his own conscience.
But this is by the way, and is occasioned by the
observations I have made of many people who think they
are mighty honest if they pay their debts, and owe no
man anything, as they call it; at the same time, like
true misers, who lay up all for themselves, they think
nothing of the debt of charity and beneficence which
they owe to all mankind.
Rich men are their Maker's freeholders; they enjoy
freely the estate He has given them possession of, with
all the rents, profits, and emoluments, but charged with
a fee-farm rent to the younger children of the family,
namely, the poor; or if you will, you may call them
God's copy-holders, paying a quit-rent to the lord of
the manor, which quit-rent he has assigned for the use
of the rest of mankind, to be paid in a constant dis-
charge of all good offices, friendly, kind, and generous
actions; and he that will notpay his rent cannot be an
honest man, any more than he that would not pay his
other just debts.

The Scripture concurs exactly with this notion of
mine; the miser is called by the prophet Isaiah a
vile person, one that works iniquity, and practises
hypocrisy, and utters error before the Lord (Isaiah
xxxii. 6). How does this appear? The very next
words explain it. "He makes empty the soul of the
hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to
fail." But lest this should seem a strained text, let us
read on, both before and after verse 5. "The vile
person shall no more be called liberal, nor the churl
said to be bountiful." Here the opposite to a liberal
man is called a vile person, and the opposite to a bounti-
ful man is called a churl; and in the verse following,
the same vile person, as opposed to the liberal man,
is called a wicked man, and the liberal man is set up
a pattern for us all, in opposition to the vile, churlish,
covetous wretch. — Vers. 7, 8. "The instruments also
of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to
destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
needy speaketh right; but the liberal deviseth liberal
things, and by liberal things shall he stand."
In a word, I think my opinion justified by this text,
that a churl, a morose, sour disposition, a covetous,
avaricious, selfish-principled man, cannot be an honest
man: he does not pay the common debt of mankind to
one another, nor the fee-farm or quit-rent of his estate
to God, who is his great landlord or lord of the manor,
and who has charged the debt upon him. I know
the miser will laugh at this notion, but I speak my own
opinion, let it go as far as reason will carry it.
I come back to the examples I was giving in my
private case. As the widow was honest to me, so
was my good Portuguese captain; and it is this man's
original honesty that makes me speak of the honest
man's debt to mankind. It was honesty, a generous
honesty, that led the poor man to take me up at sea, which, if he had neglected, my boy Xury and 1 had
perished together; it was no debt to me in particular,
but a debt to mankind, that he paid in that action, and
yet he could not have been an honest man without it.
You will say, if he had gone away and left me, he had
been barbarous and inhuman, and deserved to be left to
perish himself in the like distress; but, I say, this is
not all the case; custom and the nature of the thing
leads us to say it would have been hard-hearted and
inhuman, but conscience will tell any man that it was a
debt, and he could not but be condemned by the court
of conscience in his own breast if the had omitted it—
nay, in the sight of Heaven he had tacitly killed us, and
had been as guilty of our death as a murderer, for he
that refuses to save a life thrown into his hands takes it
away; and if there is a just retribution in a future state,
if blood is at all required there, the blood of every man,
woman, and child whom we could have saved, and did
not, shall be reckoned to us at that day as spilt by our
own hands; for leaving life in a posture in which it must
inevitably perish, is without question causing it to perish,
and will be called so then, by whatever gilded dressed-up words we may express and conceal it now.
But I go farther, for my good Portuguese went
farther with me; he not only paid the debt he owed
to Heaven in saving our lives, but he went farther — he
took nothing of what I had, though, in the common
right of the sea, it was all his due for salvage, as the
sailors call it; but he gave me the value of everything,
bought my boat, which he might have turned adrift,
my boy Xury, who was not my slave by any right, or,
if he had, became free from that time; and the life of
Xury, which he had saved, as a servant, was his own,
yet he bought everything of me for the full value, and
took nothing of me, no, not for my passage.
Here was the liberal man devising liberal things, and the sequel made good the promissory text, for by
these liberal things the honest liberal man might be
truly said to stand. When I came to reward him at
my coming to Lisbon to sell my plantation at Brazil,
then he being poor and reduced, and not able to pay
even what he owed me, I gave him a reward sufficient
to make his circumstances easy all his life after.
The bounty of this man to me, when first he took
me up out of the sea, was the highest and most com-
plete act of honesty — a generous honesty, laying hold
of an opportunity to do good to an object offered by
the providence of Heaven, and thereby acknowledging
the debt he had to pay to his Maker in the persons of
His most distressed creatures.
And here also let me remind my readers of what,
perhaps, they seldom much regard; it is not only a
gift from Heaven to us to be put in a condition of
doing good, but 'tis a gift, and a favour from Heaven,
to have an opportunity of doing the good we are in
a condition to do, and we ought to close with the
opportunity, as a particular gift from above, and be as
thankful for it, I say, as thankful for the occasion of
doing good, as for the ability.
I might mention here the honesty of my fellow-
planter in the Brazils, and of the two merchants and
their sons, by whose integrity I had my share in the
plantation preserved and taken care of; as also the
honesty of the public treasurer for the church there,
and the like; but I am carried off in my thoughts, to
enlarge upon this noble principle, from the two examples
I have already mentioned, viz., the Guinea captain's
widow and the Portuguese; and this in particular,
because, since I came to England to reside, I have met
with abundance of disputes about honesty, especially in
cases where honest men come to be unhappy men,
when they fall into such circumstances as they cannot be honest, or rather, cannot show the principle of
honesty which is really at the bottom of all their
actions, and which, but for those circumstances which
entirely disable them, would certainly show itself in
every branch of their lives; such men I have too often
seen branded for knaves by those who, if they come
into the same condition, would perhaps do the same
things, or worse than they may have done. Both my widow and my Portuguese captain fell
into low circumstances, so that they could not make
good to me my money that was in their hands; and
yet both of them showed to me that they had not only a
principle of justice, but of generous honesty too, when
the opportunity was put into their hands to do so.
This put me upon inquiring and debating with
myself what this subtle and imperceptible thing called
honesty is, and how it might be described, setting
down my thoughts at several times, as objects pre-
sented, that posterity, if they think them worth while,
may find them both useful and diverting. And first,
I thought it not improper to lay down the conditions
upon which I am to enter upon that description, that
I may not be mistaken, but be allowed to explain
what I mean by honesty, before I undertake to enter
upon any discourses or observations about it.
And to come directly to it, for I would make as
few preambles as possible, I shall crave the liberty, in
all the following discourse, to take the term honesty,
as I think all English expressions ought to be taken,
namely, honestly, in the common acceptation of the
word, the general vulgar sense of it, without any
circumlocutions or double-entendres whatsoever; for I
desire to speak plainly and sincerely. Indeed, as I
have no talent at hard words, so I have no great vene-
ration for etymologies, especially in English, but
since I am treating of honesty, I desire to do it, as I say above, honestly, according to the genuine significa-
tion of the thing.
Neither shall I examine whether honesty be a
natural or an acquired virtue — whether a habit or a
quality — whether inherent or accidental: all the philo-
sophical part of it I choose to omit.
Neither shall I examine it as it extends to spirituals
and looks towards religion; if we inquire about honesty
towards God, I readily allow all men are born knaves,
villains, thieves, and murderers, and nothing but the
restraining power of Providence withholds us all from
showing ourselves such on all occasions.
No man can be just to his Maker; if he could, all
our creeds and confessions, litanies and supplications,
were ridiculous contradictions and impertinences, in-
consistent with themselves, and with the whole tenor
of human life.
In all the ensuing discourse, therefore, I am to be
understood of honesty, as it regards mankind among
themselves, as it looks from one man to another, in
those necessary parts of man's life, his conversation
and negotiation, trusts, friendships, and all the inci-
dents of human affairs.
The plainness I profess, both in style and method,
seems to me to have some suitable analogy to the sub-
ject, honesty, and therefore is absolutely necessary to
be strictly followed; and I must own, I am the better
reconciled, on this very account, to a natural infirmity
of homely plain writing, in that I think the plainness
of expression, which I am condemned to, will give no
disadvantage to my subject, since honesty shows the
most beautiful, and the more like honesty, when arti-
fice is dismissed, and she is honestly seen by her own
light only; likewise the same sincerity is required in
the reader, and he that reads this essay without
honesty, will never understand it right; she must, I r
say, be viewed by her own light. If prejudice, parti-
ality, or private opinions stand in the way, the man's
a reading knave, he is not honest to the subject; and
upon such an one all the labour is lost—this work is
of no use to him, and, by my consent, the bookseller
should give him his money again.
If any man, from his private ill-nature, takes excep-
tions at me, poor, wild, wicked Robinson Crusoe, for
prating of such subjects as this is, and shall call either
my sins or misfortunes to remembrance, in prejudice of
what he reads, supposing me thereby unqualified to
defend so noble a subject as this of honesty, or, at
least, to handle it honestly, I take the freedom to tell
such, that those very wild wicked doings and mistakes
of mine render me the properest man alive to give
warning to others, as the man that has been sick is half
a physician. Besides, the confession which I all along
make of my early errors, and which Providence, you
see, found me leisure enough to repent of, and, I hope,
gave me assistance to do it effectually, assists to qualify
me for the present undertaking, as well to recommend
that rectitude of soul which I call honesty to others, as
to warn those who are subject to mistake it, either in
themselves or others. Heaven itself receives those who
sincerely repent into the same state of acceptance as if
they had not sinned at all, and so should we also.
They who repent, and their ill lives amend,
Stand next to those who never did offend.
Nor do I think a man ought to be afraid or ashamed
to own and acknowledge his follies and mistakes, but
rather to think it a debt which honesty obliges him to
pay; besides, our infirmities and errors, to which all
men are equally subject, when recovered from, leave such impressions behind them on those who sincerely
repent of them, that they are always the forwardest 
to accuse and reproach themselves. No man need
advise them or lead them; and this gives the greatest
discovery of the honesty of the man's heart, and sin-
cerity of principles. Some people tell us they think
they need not make any open acknowledgment of their
follies, and 'tis a cruelty to exact it of them—that they
could rather die than submit to it — that their spirits
are too great for it — that they are more afraid to come
to such public confessions and recognitions than they
would be to meet a cannon bullet, or to face an enemy.
But this is a poor mistaken piece of false bravery; all
shame is cowardice, as an eminent poet tells us that
all courage is fear; the bravest spirit is the best qualified
for a penitent. 'Tis a strange thing that we should
not be ashamed to offend, but should be ashamed to
repent; not afraid to sin, but afraid to confess. This
very thought extorted the following lines from a friend
of mine, with whom I discoursed upon this head:—
Among the worst of cowards let him be named,
Who, having sinned, 's afraid to be ashamed;
And to mistaken courage he's betrayed,
Who, having sinned, 's ashamed to be afraid. But to leave the point of courage and cowardice in
our repenting of our offences, I bring it back to the
very point I am upon, namely, that of honesty. A
man cannot be truly an honest man without acknow-
ledging the mistakes he has made, particularly without
acknowledging the wrong done to his neighbour; and
why, pray, is justice less required in his acknowledg-
ment to his Maker? He, then, that will be honest
must dare to confess he has been a knave; for, as
above, speaking of our behaviour to God, we have
been all knaves, and all dishonest; and if we come to
speak strictly, perhaps it would hold in our behaviour
to one another also, for where's the man that is not
chargeable by some or other of his neighbours, or by '
himself, with doing wrong, with some oppression or
injury, either of the tongue or of the hands?
I might enlarge here upon the honesty of the tongue,
a thing some people, who call themselves very honest
men, keep a very slender guard upon, I mean, as to
evil-speaking, and of all evil-speaking that worst kind
of it, the speaking hard and unjust things of one
another.
This is certainly intended by the command of God,
which is so express and emphatic, Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour; at least that part
which is what we call slander, raising an injurious and
false charge upon the character and conduct of our
neighbour, and spreading it for truth. But this is not all; that honesty I am speaking of
respects all detraction, all outrageous assaults of the
tongue; reproach is as really a part of dishonesty as
slander, and though not so aggravated in degree, yet
'tis the same in kind.
There is a kind of murder that may be committed
with the tongue, that is in its nature as cruel as that of
the hand. This can never be the practice of an honest
man; nay, he that practises it cannot be an honest man.
But perhaps I may come to this again, but I must
go back to explain myself upon the subject a little
farther in the general, and then you shall hear more of
me as to the particulars.
Of Honesty in General.
I have always observed, that however few the real
honest men are, yet every man thinks himself and
proclaims himself an honest man. Honesty, like
heaven, has all men's good word, and all men pretend
to a share of it; so general is the claim, that like a
jest which is spoiled by the repetition, 'tis grown of no value for a man to swear by his faith, which is, in
its original meaning, by his honesty, and ought to be
understood so.
Like heaven, too, 'tis little understood by those
who pretend most to it; 'tis too often squared accord-
ing to men's private interest, though at the same time
the latitude which some men give themselves is incon-
sistent with its nature.
Honesty is a general probity of mind, an aptitude
to act justly and honourably in all cases, religious and
civil, and to all persons, superior or inferior; neither
is ability or disability to act so any part of the thing
itself in this sense.
It may be distinguished into justice and equity, or,
if you will, into debt and honour, for both make up
but one honesty.
Exact justice is a debt to all our fellow-creatures;and honourable, generous justice is derived from that
golden rule, Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris;and all this put together, makes up honesty; honour,
indeed, is a higher word for it, but 'tis the same thing,
and
Differs from justice only in the name,
For honesty and honour are the same.
This honesty is of so qualifying a nature, that 'tis
the most denominative of all possible virtues; an
honest man is the best title can be given in the world;
all other titles are empty and ridiculous without it, and
no title can be really scandalous if this remain. Tis the capital letter, by which a man's character will be
known, when private qualities and accomplishments
are worm-eaten by time; without it a man can neither
be a Christian or a gentleman. A man may be a
poor honest man, an unfortunate honest man; but a
Christian knave, or a gentleman knave, is a contradic-
tion. A man forfeits his character and his family by r
knavery, and his escutcheon ought to have a particular
blot, like that of bastardy. When a gentleman loses
his honesty, he ceases to be a gentleman, commences
rake from that minute, and ought to be used like one.
Honesty has such a general character in the minds
of men, that the worst of men, who neither practise or
pretend to any part of it, will yet value it in others;
no man ever could be so out of love with it as to
desire his posterity should be without it; nay, such
is the veneration all men have for it, that the general
blessing of a father to his son is, "Pray God make thee
an honest man."
Indeed, so general is the value of it, and so well
known, that it seems needless to say anything in behalf
of it. So far as it is found upon earth, so much of
the first rectitude of nature and of the image of God
seems to be restored to mankind.
The greatest mischief which to me seems to attend
this virtue, like the thorn about the rose, which pricks
the finger of those who meddle with it, is pride; 'tis
a hard thing for a man to be very honest, and not be
proud of it; and though he who is really honest has,
as we say, something to be proud of, yet I take this
honesty to be in a great deal of danger who values
himself too much upon it.
True honest honesty, if I may be allowed such an
expression, has the least relation to pride of any view
in the world; 'tis all simple, plain, genuine, and
sincere; and if I hear a man boast of his honesty, I
cannot help having some fears for him, at least, that
'tis sickly and languishing.
Honesty is a little tender plant, not known to all
who have skill in simples, thick sowed, as they say, and
thin come up; 'tis nice ofgrowth, it seldom thrives in
a very fat soil, and yet a very poor ground, too, is apt
to starve it, unless it has taken very good root. When it once takes to a piece of ground, it will never be quite
destroyed; it may be choked with the weeds of pros-
perity, and sometimes 'tis so scorched up with the
droughts of poverty and necessity, that it seems as if it
were quite dead and gone; but it always revives upon
the least mild weather, and if some showers of plenty
fall, it makes full reparation for the loss the gardener
had in his crop.
There is an ugly weed, called cunning, which is
very pernicious to it, and which particularly injures it,
by hiding it from our discovery, and making it hard to
find. This is so like honesty, that many a man has
been deceived with it, and has taken one for t'other
in the market; nay, I have heard of some who have
planted this wild honesty, as we may call it, in their
own ground, have made use of it in their friendships
and dealings, and thought it had been the true plant,
but they always lost credit by it. And that was not
the worst neither, for they had the loss who dealt with
them, and who chaffered for a counterfeit commodity;
and we find many deceived so still, which is the occa-
sion there is such an outcry about false friends, and
about sharping and tricking in men's ordinary dealings
in the world.
This true honesty, too, has some little difference in
it, according to the soil or climate in which it grows,
and your simplers have had some disputes about the sorts
of it; nay, there have been great heats about the several
kinds of this plant, which grows in different countries,
and some call that honesty which others say is not; as,
particularly, they say, there is a sort of honesty in my
country, Yorkshire honesty, which differs very much
from that which is found in these southern parts about
London; then there is a sort of Scots honesty, which
they say is a meaner sort than that of Yorkshire; and in
New England I have heard they have a kind of honesty r
which is worse than the Scottish, and little better than
the wild honesty called cunning, which I mentioned
before. On the other hand, they tell us that in some
parts of Asia, at Smyrna, and at Constantinople, the
Turks have a better sort of honesty than any of us. I
am sorry our Turkey Company have not imported some
of it, that we might try whether it would thrive here or
no. 'Tis a little odd to me it should grow to such
a perfection in Turkey, because it has always been
observed to thrive best where it is sowed with a sort of
grain called religion; indeed, they never thrive in these
parts of the world so well apart as they do together.
And for this reason, I must own, I have found that
Scots honesty, as above, to be of a very good kind.
How it is in Turkey I know not, for, in all my travels,
I never set my foot in the Grand Seignior's dominions.
But to waive allegories; disputes about what is or is
not honesty are dangerous to honesty itself, for no case
can be doubtful which does not border upon the fron-
tiers of dishonesty; and he that resolves not to be
drowned had best never come near the brink of the
water.
That man who will do nothing but what is barely
honest, is in great danger. It is certainly just for me
to do everything the law justifies, but if I should only
square my actions by what is literally lawful, I must
throw every debtor, though he be poor, in prison, and
never release him till he has paid the uttermost farthing;
I must hang every malefactor without mercy; I must
exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture of
every indenture. In short, I must be uneasy to all
mankind, and make them so to me; and in a word, be
a very knave too, as well as a tyrant, for cruelty is not
honesty.
Therefore, the Sovereign Judge of every man's
honesty has laid us down a general rule, to which all the particulars are resolved, Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne
feceris. This is a part of that honesty I am treating of,
and which indeed is the more essential of the two;
this is the test of behaviour, and the grand article to
have recourse to when laws are silent.
I have heard some men argue, that they are not
bound to any such considerations of the indigence of
persons as lead to concessions of time, or compositions
with them for debts; that 'tis all ex gratia, or the effects
of policy, because circumstances lead them to judge
it better to take what they can get than lose the
whole.
Speaking of the letter of the law, I allow that they
may be in the right.
On the other hand, a man who gives a bond for a debt,
pleads he is answerable for no more than the law will
force him to; that is, he may defend a suit, stand out
to the last extremity, and at last keep out of the way,
so as not to have judgment or execution served on him;
he may secure his estate from the execution, as well as
his person, and so never pay the debt at all, and yet in
the eye of the law be an honest man; and this part of
legal literal honesty is supported only by the other,
namely, the cruel part; for really such a man, speaking
in the sense of common justice, is a knave; he ought
to act according to the true intent and meaning of his
obligation, and in the right of a debtor to a creditor,
which is to pay him his money when it became due,
not stand out to the last, because he cannot be forced
to it sooner.
The laws of the country indeed allow such actions
as the laws of conscience can by no means allow, as in
this case of the creditor suing for his debt, and the
debtor not paying it till he is forced by law. The
argument made use of to vindicate the morality of such
a practice, stands thus :—
If a man trusts me with his money or goods upon my
common credit, or upon my word, he then takes me for
his money, and depends both upon my ability and my
honesty; but if he comes and demands my bond, he
quits his dependence upon my honesty, and takes the
law for his security; so that the language of such an
action is, he will have a bond, that it may be in his
power to make me pay him whether I will or no; and
as for my honesty, he'll have nothing to do with it;
what relief, then, I can have against this bond by the
same law to which the person refers himself, is as legal
an action on my side as the other man's suing for his
own is on his.
And thus the letter of the law will ruin the honesty
of both debtor and creditor, and yet both shall be
justified too.
But if I may give my opinion in this case, neither of
these are the honest man I am speaking of; for honesty
does not consist of negatives, and 'tis not sufficient to do
my neighbour no personal injury in the strict sense and
letter of the law; but I am bound, where cases and
circumstances make other measures reasonable, to have
such regard to these cases and circumstances as reason
requires. Thus, to begin with the creditor to the
debtor, reason requires that where a man is reduced to
extremities, he should not be destroyed for debt; and
what is unreasonable cannot be honest.
Debt is no capital crime, nor ever was; and starving
men in prison, a punishment worse than the gallows,
seems to be a thing so severe as it ought not to be in the
power of a creditor to inflict it. The laws of God never
tolerated such a method of treating debtors as we have
since thought proper, I won't say honest, to put in
practice; but since the politics of the nation have left
the debtor so much at mercy by the letter of the law,
'tis honest, with respect to the law, to proceed so; yet compassion is in this case thought reasonable — why
shouldst thou take his bed from under him? says the
text; which implies, 'tis unnatural and unreasonable.
I have heard some men insist upon it, that if a man
be sued wrongfully at law, he ought rather to submit to
the injury than oppose the wrong by the same law; and
yet I never found those gentlemen so passive in matters
of law, but they would sue a debtor at law if they
could not otherwise obtain their right.
I confess I cannot blame them for the last, but I
blame them for pretending to the first. I am not
arguing against recovering a just debt by a just law,
where the person is able but unwilling to be honest; but
I think pursuing the debtor to all extremities, to the
turning his wife and children into the street, expressed
in the Scripture by taking his bed from under him, and
by keeping the debtor in prison when really he is not
able to pay it — there is something of cruelty in it, and
the honest man I am speaking of can never do it.
But some may object, if I must serve all mankind as
I would be served in like case, then I must relieve every
beggar and release every poor debtor; for if I was a
beggar I would be relieved, and if I was in prison I
would be released; and so I must give away all I have.
This is inverting the argument; for the meaning is in
the negative still, do not to another anything, or put no
hardship upon another, which you would not allow to
be just if you were in their case.
Honesty is equity, every man is lord-chancellor to
himself; and if he would consult that principle within
him would find reason as fair an advocate for his neigh-
bour as for himself. But I proceed.
Of the Trial of Honesty.
Necessity makes an honest man a knave; and if the
world was to be the judge according to the common
I
r
III. Creceived notion, there would not be an honest poor man
left alive.
A rich man is an honest man — no thanks to him;
for he would be a double knave to cheat mankind when
he had no need of it: he has no occasion to press upon
his integrity, nor so much as touch upon the borders
of dishonesty. Tell me of a man that is a very honest
man, for he pays everybody punctually, runs into no-
body's debt, does no man any wrong; very well—what
circumstances is he in? Why, he has a good estate, a
fine yearly income, and no business to do. The devil
must have full possession of this man if he should be a
knave, for no man commits evil for the sake of it; even
the devil himself has some farther design in sinning than
barely the wicked part of it. No man is so hardened
in crimes as to commit them for the mere pleasure of
the fact—there is always some vice gratified; ambition,
pride, or avarice makes rich men knaves, and necessity
the poor. But to go on with this rich honest man;
his neighbour, a thriving merchant, and whose honesty
had as untainted a character as he can pretend to, has
a rich ship cast away, or a factor abroad broke in his
debt, and his bills come back protested, and he fails—
is fain to abscond and make a composition. Our rich
honest man flies out upon him presently — he is a knave,
a rogue, and don't pay people what he owes them; and
we should have a law that he that runs into debt farther
than he is able to pay should be hanged, and the like.
If the poor man is laid hold on by some creditor, and
put in prison —ay, there let him lie, he deserves it;
'twill be an example to keep others from the like.
And now, when all is done, this broken merchant may
be as honest a man as the other.
You say you are an honest man: how do you know
it? Did you ever want bread, and had your neigh-
bour's loaf in your keeping, and would starve rather than eat it? Was youever arrested, and being not able
by yourself or friends to make peace with your plain-
tiff, and at the same time having another man's money
in your cash chest committed to your keeping, suffered
yourself to be carried to gaol rather than break bulk and
break in upon your trust? God Himself has declared
that the power of extremity is irresistible, and that so,
as to our integrity, that He has bid us not despise the
thief that steals in such a case; not that the man is less
a thief, or the fact less dishonest. But the text is most
remarkably worded for instruction in this point; don't
you despise the man, but remember, if you were driven
to the same exigence, you would be the same man and
do the same thing, though now you fancy your principle
so good; therefore, whatever his crime may be as to
God, don't reproach him with it here; but you that
think you stand, take heed lest you fall.
I am of the opinion that I could state a circumstance
in which there is not one man in the world would be
honest. Necessity is above the power of human nature,
and for Providence to suffer a man to fall into that
necessity is to suffer him to sin, because nature is not
furnished with power to defend itself, nor is grace itself
able to fortify the mind against it.
What shall we say to five men in a boat at sea,
without provision, calling a council together, and re-
solving to kill one of themselves for the others to feed
on, and eat him? With what face could the four look
up and crave a blessing on that meat? With what
heart give thanks after it? And yet this has been done
by honest men, and I believe the most honest man in the
world might be forced to it; yet here is no manner of
pretence, but necessity, to palliate the crime. If it be
argued it was the loss of one man to save the four, it is
answered, but what authority to make him die to save
their lives? How came the man to owe them such a '
debt? 'Twas robbery and murder; 'twas robbing him
of his life, which was his property, to preserve mine;
'tis murder, by taking away the life of an innocent
man; and at best 'twas doing evil that good may come,
which is expressly forbidden.
But there is a kind of equity pleaded in this case.
Generally, when men are brought to such a pass, they
cast lots who shall be the man, and the voluntary con-
sent of the party makes it lawful (God Himself being
supposed to determine who shall be the man), which I
deny; for it is in no man's power legally to consent to
such a lot; no man has a right to give away his own
life; he may forfeit it to the law and lose it, but that's
a crime against himself, as well as against the law; and
the four men might by our law have been tried and
hanged for murder. All that can be said is, that
necessity makes the highest crimes lawful, and things
evil in their own nature are made practicable by it.
From these extremes of necessity we come to lighter
degrees of it, and so let us bring our honest man to
some exigencies. He would not wrong any man of a
farthing; he could not sleep if he should be in any-
body's debt; and he cannot be an honest man that can.
That we may see now whether this man's honesty
lies any deeper than his neighbour's, turn the scale of his
fortune a little. His father left him a good estate; but
here come some relations, and they trump up a title to
his lands, and serve ejectments upon his tenants, and
so the man gets into trouble, hurry of business, and the
law. The extravagant charges of the law sink him of
all his ready money, and, his rents being stopped, the
first breach he makes upon his honesty (that is, by his
former rules), he goes to a friend to borrow money,
tells him this matter will be over, he hopes, quickly,
and he shall have his rents to receive, and then he will
pay him again; and really he intends to do so. But here comes a disappointment; the trial comes on, and he is
cast, and his title to the estate proves defective; his
father was cheated, and he not only loses the estate,
but is called upon for the arrears of the rent he has
received; and, in short, the man is undone, and has not
a penny to buy bread or help himself, and, besides this,
cannot pay the money he borrowed. Now, turn to his neighbour the merchant, whom he
had so loudly called knave for breaking in his trade;
he by this time has made up with his creditors and
got abroad again, and he meets him in the street in his
dejected circumstances. "Well," says the merchant,
"and why don't you pay my cousin, your old neighbour,
the money you borrowed of him ?" —" Truly," says
he, "because I have lost all my estate, and can't pay;
nay, I have nothing to live on."—" Well, but, re-
turns the merchant, "wan't you a knave to borrow
money, and now can't pay it ?" —" Why, truly," says
the gentleman, "when I borrowed it I really designed
to be honest, and did not question but I should have my
estate again, and then I had been able also, and would
have paid him to a penny, but it has proved otherwise;
and though I would pay him if I had it, yet I am not
able." —"Well, but," says the merchant again, "did
you not call me knave, though I lost my estate abroad
by unavoidable disasters, as you have lost yours at
home? Did you not upbraid me because I could not
pay? I would have paid everybody, if I could, as well
as you." —" Why, truly," says the gentleman, "I was
a fool; I did not consider what it was to be brought
to necessity; I ask your pardon."
Now, let's carry on this story. The merchant
compounds with his creditors, and paying every one
a just proportion as far as 'twill go, gets himself dis-
charged; and being bred to business, and industrious,
falls into trade again, and raises himself to good circum-
stances, and at last a lucky voyage or some hit of trade
sets him above the world again. The man, remembering
his former debts, and retaining his principle of honesty,
calls his old creditors together, and though he was
formerly discharged from them all, voluntarily pays
them the remainder of their debts. The gentleman
being bred to no business, and his fortune desperate,
goes abroad and gets into the army, and behaving
himself well, is made an officer, and, still rising by his
merit, becomes a great man; but in his new condition
troubles not his head with his former debts in his native
country, but settles in the court and favour of the prince
under whom he has made his fortunes, and there sets
up for the same honest man he did before.
I think I need not ask which of these two is the
honest man, any more than which was the honest
penitent, the Pharisee or the publican.
Honesty, like friendship, is tried in affliction; and
he that cries out loudest against those who in the time
of this trial are forced to give ground, would perhaps
yield as far in the like shock of misfortune.
To be honest when peace and plenty flow upon our
hands, is owing to the blessing of our parents; but to
be honest when circumstances grow narrow, relations
turbulent and quarrelsome, when poverty stares at us,
and the world threatens, this blessing is from Heaven,
and can only be supported from thence. God Almighty
is very little beholding to them who will serve Him
just as long as He feeds them. 'Twas a strong argument
the devil used in that dialogue between Satan and his
Maker about Job. "Yes, he is a mighty good man,
and a mighty just man, and well he may while you
give him everything he wants: I would serve you
myself, and be as true to you as Job, if you would be
as kind and as bountiful to me as you are to him: but
now, do but lay your finger on him; do but stop your 
hand a little, and cut him short; strip him a little, and
make him like one of those poor fellows that now bow
to him, and you will quickly see your good man be
like other men; nay, the passion he will be in at his
losses will make him curse you to your face." Tis true the devil was mistaken in the man, but the argument
had a great deal of probability in it, and the moral
may be drawn, both from the argument and from the
consequences:
1. That 'tis an easy thing to maintain the character
of honesty and uprightness when a man has no business
to be employed in, and no want to press him.
2. That when exigencies and distresses pinch a
man, then is the time to prove the honesty of his
principle.
The prosperous honest man can only by boasting
tell the world he is honest, but the distressed and
ruined honest man hears other people tell him he is
honest.
In this case, therefore, since allowance must be made
for human infirmities, we are to distinguish between an
accident and a practice. I am not pleading to encourage
any man to make no scruple of trespassing upon his
honesty in time of necessity; but I cannot condemn
every man for a knave who by unusual pressures, straits,
difficulties, or other temptation, has been left to slip
and do an ill action, as we call it, which perhaps this
person would never have stooped to if the exigence had
not been too great for his resolution. The Scripture
says of David, "He was a man after God's own
heart;" and yet we have several things recorded of
him, which, according to the modern way of censuring
people in this age, would have given him the character
of a very ill man. But I conceive the testimony of
David's uprightness, given us so authentically from the
Scripture, is given from this very rule, that the inclina-
tion of his heart and the general bent of his practice
were to serve and obey his great Sovereign Benefactor,
however human frailty, backed with extremities of
circumstances or powerful temptations, might betray
him to commit actions which he would not otherwise
have done. The falling into a crime will not denomi-
nate a man dishonest; for humanum est errare. The
character of a man ought to be taken from the general
tenor of his behaviour, and from his allowed practice.
David took the shew-bread from the priests, which it
was not lawful for him to eat. David knew that God,
who commanded the shew-bread should not be eaten,
had, however, commanded him by the law of Nature
not to be starved, and therefore, pressed by his hunger,
he ventures upon the commandment. And the Scrip-
ture is very remarkable in expressing it, "David, when
he was an hungry." And the occasion for which our
blessed Lord Himself quoted this text is very remark-
able, viz., to prove that things otherwise unlawful may
be made lawful by necessity.—Matt. xii. 4.
Another time, David in his passion resolves the
destruction of Nabal and all his family, which, without
doubt, was a great sin; and the principle which he
went upon, to wit, revenge for his churlish and saucy
answer to him, was still a greater sin; but the tempta-
tion, backed by the strength of his passion, had the
better of him at that time; and this upright, honest
man had murdered Nabal and all his house if God had
not prevented him.
Many instances of like nature the Scripture has left
upon record, giving testimony to the character of good
men, from the general practice and bent of their hearts,
without leaving any reproach upon them for particular
failings, though those sins have been extraordinary
provoking, and in their circumstances scandalous
enough.

If any man would be so weak as from hence to draw
encouragement to allow himself in easy trespasses upon
his honesty, on the pretence of necessities, let him go
on with me to the further end of this observation, and
find room for it if he can.
If ever the honest man I speak of, by whatsoever
exigence or weakness, thus slips from the principle of
his integrity, he never fails to express his own dislike
of it; he acknowledges upon all occasions, both to God
and to man, his having been overcome, and been
prevailed upon to do what he does not approve of;
he is too much ashamed of his own infirmity to pretend
to vindicate the action, and he certainly is restored to
the first regulation of his principles as soon as the
temptation is over. No man is fonder to accuse him
than he is to accuse himself, and he has always upon him
the sincere marks of a penitent.
Tis plain from hence that the principle of the man's
integrity is not destroyed, however he may have fallen,
though seven times a day; and I must, while I live,
reckon him for an honest man.
Nor am I going about to suppose that the extremities
and exigencies which have pressed men of the best
principles to do what at another time they would not
do, make those actions become less sinful, either in
their own nature or circumstances. The guilt of a
crime with respect to its being a crime, viz., an offence
against God, is not removed by the circumstances of
necessity. It is without doubt a sin for me to steal
another man's food, though it was to supply starving
nature; for how do I know whether he whose food
I steal may not be in as much danger of starving for
want of it as I? And if not, 'tis taking to my own
use what I have no right to, and taking it by force or
fraud; and the question is not as to the right or wrong,
whether I have a necessity to eat this man's bread or '
no, but whether it be his or my own? If it be his,
and not my own, I cannot do it without a manifest
contempt of God's law, and breaking the eighth article
of it, "Thou shalt not steal." Thus, as to God, the
crime is evident, let the necessity be what it will.
But when we are considering human nature sub-
jected, by the consequences of Adam's transgression,
to frailty and infirmity, and regarding things from man
to man, the exigencies and extremities of straitened
circumstances seem to me to be most prevailing
arguments why the denomination of a man's general
character ought not by his fellow-mortals (subject to
the same infirmities) to be gathered from his mistakes,
his errors, or failings; no, not from his being guilty of
any extraordinary sin, but from the manner and method
of his behaviour. Does he go on to commit frauds,
and make a practice of his sin? Is it a distress i Is
it a storm of affliction and poverty has driven him upon
the lee-shore of temptation? Or is the sin the port he
steered for? A shipmay by stress of weather be driven
upon sands and dangerous places, and the skill of the
pilot not be blamable; but he that runs against the
wind, and without any necessity, upon a shelf which
he sees before him, must do it on purpose to destroy
the vessel, and ruin the voyage.
In short, if no man can be called honest but he who
is never overcome to fall into any breach of this recti-
tude of life, none but he who is sufficiently fortified
against all possibility of being tempted by prospects,
or driven by distress, to make any trespass upon his
integrity — woe be unto me that write, and to most
that read! where shall we find the honest man?
The Scripture is particularly expressive of this in
the words, "The righteous man falleth seven times a
day, and riseth again." Why, this is very strange; if
a man come to commit seven crimes in a day, that is, 
many, for the meaning is indefinite, can this be an
honest man? What says the world of him? Hang
him; he is a knave, a rascal, a dishonest fellow.
This is the judgment of men; but in the judgment of
Scripture this may be a righteous man.
The main design of this head, and the proper appli-
cation of it, is to tell us we ought not to be too hasty
to brand our brother for his sins, his infirmities, or
misfortunes, since he that is dishonest in your eyes, by
a casual or other crime which he commits, may rise
from that disaster by a sincere repentance, and be to-
morrow an honester man than thyself in the eyes of
his Maker.
But here I am assaulted with another censorious
honest man. Here you talk of falling to-day, and
rising again to-morrow; sinning and repenting; why,
here is a fellow has cheated me of 56*500, and he
comes canting to me of his repentance, tells me he
hopes God has forgiven him, and it would be hard for
me to call to remembrance what God has wiped out;
he is heartily sorry for the fault, and the like, and
begs my pardon, that is, begs my estate indeed. For
what is all this to my money? Let him pay me, and I
will forgive him too. God may forgive him the sin,
but that's nothing to my debt.
Why, truly, in answer to this in part, you are in
the right if the man be able to make you any satisfac-
tion, and does not do it; for I question not, but every
trespass of this nature requires restitution as well as
repentance; restitution as far as the possible power of
the party extends; and if the last be not found, the
first is not likely to be sincere.
But if the man either is not able to make you any
restitution at all, or does make you restitution to the
utmost of his capacity, and then comes and says as
before, then the poor man is in the right, and you in r
the wrong; for I make no question likewise to affirm,
and could prove it by unanswerable arguments, he may
be an honest man who cannot pay his debts, but he
cannot be an honest man who can, and does not.
Innumerable accidents reduce men from plentiful
fortunes to mean and low circumstances; some pro-
cured by their own vices and intemperance; some by
infirmities, ignorance, and mere want of judgment to
manage their affairs; some by the frauds and cheats of
other men; some by mere casualty and unavoidable
accidents, wherein the sovereignty of Providence shows
us, that the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the
strong, or riches to men of understanding. First, some by vices and intemperance are reduced
to poverty and distress. Our honest man cannot fall
in the misfortunes of this class, because there the very
poverty is a sin, being produced from a sinful cause.
As it is far from being allowed as an excuse to a mur-
derer to say he was in drink, because it is excusing a
crime with a crime, so for a man to ruin his fortunes,
as the prodigal in the Gospel, with riotous living, all the
effects are wicked and dishonest, as they partake of the
dishonesty of the cause from whence they proceed; for
he cannot be an honest man who wants wherewith to
pay his debts after having spent what should have dis-
charged them in luxury and debauches.
Secondly, some by ignorance and want of judgment
to manage their affairs are brought to poverty and dis-
tress. These may be honest men, notwithstanding
their weakness, for I won't undertake that none of our
honest men shall be fools. Tis true the good man is
the wise man as to the main part of wisdom, which is
included in his piety; but many a religious man, who
would not do any wrong wilfully to his neighbour, is
obliged at last to injure both his own family and other
people's for want of discretion to guide him in his 
affairs, and to judge for himself; and therefore I dare
not tax all our fools with being knaves, nor will I say
but such a man may be honest. Some will say that
such a man should not venture into business which he
is not able to manage, and therefore 'twas the vice of
his understanding, and, like the case in the first article,
is excusing a fault with a fault.
I cannot allow this, for if I am asked why a fool
ventures into trade, I answer, because he is a fool, not
because he is a knave.
If fools could their own ignorance discern,
They'd be no longer fools, because they'd learn.
If you would convince a man that he wants discre-
tion, you must give him discretion to be convinced;
till then he cannot know he has it not, because he has
it not. No man is answerable either to God or man
for that which he never was master of. The most
proper expression that ever I met with in this nature,
was of a certain idiot or natural which a gentleman of
my acquaintance kept in his family, who being on his
deathbed, was observed to be very pensive and much
concerned about dying. The gentleman sent a minister
to him, who, as well as he could to his understanding,
discoursed with him about death and judgment to come.
The poor creature, who was hardly ever able to give a
rational answer to a question before, after hearing him
very attentively, broke out into tears with this expres-
sion—that he hoped God would not require anything of
him that He had not given him judgment to understand.
Whatever it may be as to the soul, I am positive, in the
case of human affairs, no man is answerable to man for
any more than his discretion. Events are not in our
power; a man may be nicely honest in life, though he
may be weak enough in judgment.
Thirdly, some are ruined, and are yet merely passive, being either defrauded and cheated by knaves, or plun-
dered and rifled by thieves, or by immediate casualties,
as fire, enemies, storms, floods, and the like; these are
things which neither touch the man's honesty nor his
discretion. Thus Job was, by God's permission and the
agency of the devil, reduced in a moment from a plenti-
ful estate to be as naked as he came out of his mother's
womb. I would fain ask those who say no man can be
an honest man if he does not pay his debts, who paid
Job's debts if he owed any, and where was his dis-
honesty if he did not pay them? I still readily grant that
he cannot be an honest man who does not pay his debts
if he can; but if otherwise, then the words ought to be
altered, and they should say, he cannot be an honest
man who borrows any money, or buys anything upon
his credit; and this cannot be true.
But since I have led myself into the argument, I
cannot but make a small digression concerning people
who fail in trade. I conceive the greatest error of such
is their terror about breaking, by which they are tempted
while their credit is good, though their bottom be
naught, to push farther in, expecting, or at least hoping,
by the profits of some happy voyage, or some lucky
hit, as they call it, to retrieve their circumstances, and
stand their ground.
I must confess I cannot vindicate the honesty of this;
for he who, knowing his circumstances to be once
naught, and his bottom worn out, ought not in justice
to enter into any man's debt, for then he trades on their
risk, not on his own, and yet trades for his own profits,
not theirs. This is not fair, because he deceives the
creditor, who ventures his estate on that bottom which
he supposes to be good, and the other knows it not.
Nay, though he really pays this creditor, he is not
honest; for, in conscience, his former creditors had
a right to all his effects in proportion to their debts; and if he really pays one all, and the rest but a share,
'tis a wrong to the whole.
I would therefore advise all tradesmen who find
their circumstances declining, as soon, at least, as they
first discern themselves to be incapable of paying their
debts, if not while yet they can pay every one all,
make a full stop, and call all people together; if there
is enough to pay them all, let them have it; if not let
them have their just shares of it. By this means you
will certainly have God's blessing, and the character
of an honest man left to begin again with; and credi-
tors are often prevailed with, in consideration of such
a generous honesty, to throw back something to put
such a man in a posture to live again, or by further
voluntary credit and friendship to uphold him. This
is much better also with respect to interest, as well as
honesty, than to run on to all extremities, till the
burden falls too heavy either for debtor or creditor to
bear. This would prevent many of the extremities,
which, I say, puts the honesty of a man to so extra-
ordinary a trial.
An honest principle would certainly dictate to the
man, if it were consulted with, that when he knows he
is not able to pay, it is not lawful for him to borrow.
Taking credit is a promise of payment: a promise of
payment is tacitly understood, and he cannot be honest
who promises what he knows he cannot perform, as I
shall note more at large on another head. But if the
man be paid, yet it was not an honest act; 'twas de-
ceiving the man, and making him run a greater risk
than he knew of, and such a risk as he would not have
run had he known your circumstances and bottom as
you do; so that here is deceit upon deceit.
This I know is a disputed point, and a thing which
a great many practise who pass for very honest men in
the world, but I like it not the better for that; I am very positive, that he who takes my goods on the foot
of his credit, when, if he should die the next day, he
knows his estate will not pay me five shillings in the
pound, though he should not die, but does pay me at
the time appointed, is as much guilty of a fraud as if
he actually robbed my house. Credit is a received
opinion of a man's honesty and ability, his willingness
to pay, and his having wherewith to pay; and he who
wants either of these, his credit is lame. Men won't
sell their goods to a litigious, quarrelsome man, though
he be never so rich, nor to a needy man, though he be
never so honest. Now if all the world believe that I
am honest and able, and I know that I am not the
last, I cannot be the first if I take their goods upon
credit; 'tis vain to pretend men trade upon the general
risk of men's appearance, and the credit of common
fame, and all men have an equal hazard. I say no;
men may venture their estates in the hands of a flourish-
ing bankrupt, and he by virtue of his yet unshaken
credit is trusted; but he cannot be honest that takes
this credit, because he knows his circumstances are
quite otherwise than they are supposed to be, that the
man is deceived, and he is privy to the deceit. This digression is not so remote from the purpose
as I expected when I began it: the honesty that I am
speaking of chiefly respects matters of commerce, of
which credit and payment of debt are the most con-
siderable branches.
There is another article in trade, which many very
honest men have made familiar to themselves, which
yet, I think, is in no case to be defended, and that is
relating to counterfeit money. Custom, before the old
money was suppressed in England, had prevailed so
far upon honesty, that I have seen some men put all
their brass money among their running cash, to be told
over in every sum they paid, in order to have somebody 
or other take it; I have heard many people own they
made no scruple of it, but I could never find them
give one good reason to justify the honesty of it.
First, they say it comes for money, and it ought to
go so: to which I answer, that is just as good a
reason as this: A has cheated me, and therefore I
may cheat B. If I have received a sum of money for
good, and knowing not that any of it is otherwise
offer it in payment to another, this is just and honest;
but if, on this other man's telling it over, he returns
me a piece of brass or counterfeit money which I
change again, and afterwards, knowing this to be
such, offer the same piece to another, I know no
worse fraud in its degree in the world, and I doubt
not to prove it so beyond contradiction.
If the first person did not take this piece of money,
it was because, being both watchful and skilful, he
could discover it; and if I offer it to another, 'tis
with an expectation that he, being either less watchful
or less skilful, shall overlook it, and so I shall make
an advantage of my neighbour's ignorance, or want of
care.
I'll put some parallel cases to this, to illustrate it.
Suppose a blind man comes into a shop to buy goods
of me, and giving me a guinea to change, I shall give
him the remainder in bad money, would not everybody
say 'twas a barbarous thing? Why, the other is all
one, for if the person be ignorant of money, he is blind
as to the point in hand; and nothing can be more
unfair than to take the advantage.
Suppose, again, a young boy or a servant newly
entered in trade is sent to buy goods, and by his
master's order he asks for such a commodity; and
you, presuming upon the rawness of the messenger,
deliver a sort of a meaner quality, and take the full
price of him; would you grudge to be used scurvily /"
III. D
for such a trick? Why, no less or better is offering
brass for silver, presuming only the want of care or
skill in the receiver shall pass it unobserved.
"Ay, but," says a learned tradesman, who would
be thought honester than ordinary, "I always change
it again, if it be brought back." Yes, sir, so does a
pickpocket give you your handkerchief again when
you have fastened on him, and threatened him with
the mob. The matter, in short, is this: if the man
whom you have cheated can cheat nobody else, then
no thanks to you; when he comes to you, and charges
the fraud upon you, you'll make satisfaction, because,
if you won't, the law will compel you to it.
But if the fraud may be carried on, as you are mani-
festly willing, consenting, and instrumental in it that
it should, behold the consequence: your first sin
against honesty is multiplied in all the hands through
whom this piece of bad money knowingly so passes,
till at last it happens to go single to a poor man that
can't put it off, and the wrong and injury may issue
where it was wanted to buy bread for a starving
family.
All the excuses I could ever meet with could never
satisfy me that it can consist with honesty to put brass
or copper away for gold or silver, any more than it
would to give a blind messenger sand instead of sugar,
or brown bread instead of white.
Of Honesty In Promises.
"A man is known by his word, and an ox by his
horns," says an old English proverb. If I understand
the true meaning of it, 'tis that the honesty of a man
is known by his punctually observing his word, as
naturally and plainly as any creature is known by the
most obvious distinction. 'Tis the peculiar quality of 
an honest man, the distinguishing mark to know him
by. His word or promise is as sacred to him in all
his affairs in the world as the strongest obligation which
can be laid on him; nor is it a thing formed by him
from settled resolutions, or measures of policy taken
up of course to raise or fix his reputation, but it is the
native produce of his honest principle; 'tis the con-
sequence, and his honesty is the cause; he ceases to be
honest when he ceases to preserve this solemn regard
to his word.
If he gives his word, any man may depend upon it
for the safety of his life or estate; he scorns to prevari-
cate or shift himself off from the punctual observance
of it, though it be to his loss.
I can't abate an honest man an inch in the punctual
observance of a promise made upon parole if it be in the
man's possible power to perform it, because there seems
to be something too base to consist with honesty in the
very nature of a man that can go back from his word.
The reverence our ancestors paid to their promises,
or word passed, I am of the opinion, gave that remark-
able brand of infamy and scandal upon the affront of
giving the lie. A gentleman, which is, in short, the
modern term for an honest man, or a man of honour,
cannot receive a greater reproach than to be told he
lies; that is, that he forfeits his word, breaks his
veracity; for the minute he does that he ungentlemans
himself, disgraces the blood of his family, degenerates
from his ancestors, and commences rake, scoundrel,
and anything.
Some people, who have run their points of honour to
the extremes, are of the opinion that this affront of the
lie ought not to be given to anything they call a gentle-
man, or that calls himself so, till he has so far exposed
himself to all other degrees of infamy as to bear kicking
or caning, and the like; that after this, when he breaks .
his word, he may be told he lies, or anything else; but
till then the very thing itself is so intolerable an abuse,
that the person who ventures to trespass so foully on
the rules of good manners deserves not the honour of
fair play for his life; but as some beasts of prey are
refused the fair law of the field, and are knocked down
in every hedge, so these, like bullies and mere rakes,
may be pistolled in the dark and stabbed at the corner
of an alley; that is to say, any measure may be used
with them to dismiss them from the society of mankind,
as fellows not sufferable in the commonwealth of good
manners.
I do not argue for these extremes; but I instance in
this to testify the veneration all good men have for the
word or promise of an honest man, and the esteem
which the integrity of the mind, expressed by a zealous
regard to the words of the mouth, has obtained in the
world. The French, when they express themselves
in vindication of their honour, always bring it about
by this, Je suis homme de parole, I am an honest
man, or a man of my word; that is, I am a man
that may be trusted upon my parole, for I never break
my word.
Such was the value put upon the promises of men in
former time, that a promise of payment of money was
recoverable in our courts by law, till the inconveniences
proved so many that an Act was made on purpose to
restrain it to a sum under ten pounds. But to this day
if a man promises marriage to a woman, especially if
she has granted him any favours upon that condition,
the laws of the land, which therein have regard to the
laws of honour, will oblige him to make it good, and
allow it to be a sufficient plea to forbid his marrying
with anybody else. There are innumerable instances of the veneration all
nations pay to the expressive article of human veracity. In the war you meet with frequent instances of prisoners
dismissed by a generous enemy upon their parole, either
to pay their ransom, or to procure such or such condi-
tions, or come back and surrender themselves prisoners;
and he that should forfeit this parole would be posted
in the enemy's army, and hissed out of his own.
I know nothing a wise man would not choose to do
rather than, by breaking his word, give the world such
an undeniable testimony of his being a knave. This is
that good name which Solomon says is better than life,
and is a precious ointment, and which when a man has
once lost he has nothing left worth keeping. A man
may even hang himself out of the way, for no man that
looks like a man will keep his company.
When a man has once come to breaking his word,
no man that has any value for his reputation cares to be
seen in his company; but all good men shun him, as if
he were infected with the plague.
There are men, indeed, who will be exceeding
punctual to their words and promises, who yet cannot
be called honest men, because they have other vices and
excursions that render them otherways wicked. These
give their testimony to the beauty of honesty by choosing
it as the best mask to put a gloss upon their actions, and
conceal the other deformities of their lives; and so
honesty, like religion, is made use of to disguise the
hypocrite, and raise a reputation upon the shadow, by
the advantage it takes of the real esteem the world has
of the substance. I say of this counterfeit honesty, as
is said of religion in like cases. If honesty was not the
most excellent attainment, 'twould not be made use of
as the most specious pretence; nor is there a more
exquisite way for a man to play the hypocrite, than to
pretend an extraordinary zeal to the performance of his
promises; because, when the opinion of any man's
honesty that way has spread in the thoughts of men, f
there is nothing so great but they will trust him with,
nor so hard but they will do it for him.
All men reverence an honest man: the knaves stand
in awe of him, fools adore him, and wise men love him;
and thus is virtue its own reward.
Honest men are in more danger from this one
hypocrite than from twenty open knaves; for these have
a mark placed upon them by their general character, as
a buoy upon a rock to warn strangers from venturing
upon it. But the hypocrites are like a pit covered
over, like shoals under water, and danger concealed
which cannot be seen. I must confess I have found
these the most dangerous, and have too deeply suffered
by throwing myself on their protestations of honesty.
The esteem I always entertained of the most beautiful
gift God has bestowed, or man could receive, has
made me the easier to be deceived with the resemblance
of it.
So much as I, or any one else, by the viciousness of
our own nature, or the prevailing force of accidents,
snares, and temptations, have deviated from this shining
principle, so far as we have been foolish as well as
wicked, so much we have to repent of towards our
Maker, and be ashamed of towards our neighbour.
For my part, I am never backward to own, let who
will be the reader of these sheets, that to the dishonour
of my Maker, and the just scandal of my own honesty,
I have not paid that due regard to the rectitude of this
principle which my own knowledge has owned to be its
due; let those who have been juster to themselves, and
to the Giver of it, rejoice in the happiness, rather than
triumph over the infirmity.
But let them be sure they have been juster on their
own parts; let them be positive that their own integrity
is untainted, and would abide all the trials and racks
that a ruined fortune, strong temptations, and deep 
distresses, could bring it into; let them not boast till
these dangers are past, and they put their armour off;
and if they can do it, then I will freely acknowledge
they have less need of repentance than I.
Not that I pretend, as I noted before, and shall
often repeat, that these circumstances render my fail-
ing, or any man's else, the less a sin, but they make
the reason why we that have fallen should rather be
pitied than reproached by those who think they stand,
because, when the same assaults are made upon the
chastity of their honour, it may be every jot as likely
to be prostituted as their neighbour's.
And such is the folly of scandal, as well as the
blindness of malice, that it seldom fixes reproach upon
the right foot. I have seen so much of it, with respect
to other people, as well as to myself, that it gives me
a very scoundrel opinion of all those people whom I
find forward to load their neighbours with reproach.
Nothing is more frequent in this case than to run away
with a piece of a man's character, in which they err,
and do him wrong, and leave that part of him un-
touched which is really black, and would bear it; this
makes me sometimes, when with the humblest and
most abasing thoughts of myself I look up, and be-
twixt God and my own soul, cry out, "What a
wretch am I!" at the same time smile at the hare-
brained enemy, whose tongue, tipped with malice, runs
ahead of his understanding, and missing the crimes
for which I deserve more than he can inflict, reproaches
me with those I never committed. Methinks I am
ready to call him back, like the huntsman, when the
dogs run upon the foil, and say, "Hold, hold, you are
wrong; take him here, and you have him."
I question not but 'tis the same with other people;
for when malice is in the heart, reproach generally goes
a mile before consideration, and where is the honesty of the man all this while? This is trampling upon my
pride, ted majori fastu, but with greater pride; 'tis
exposing my dishonesty, but with the highest knavery;
'tis a method no honest man will take, and when taken,
no honest man regards; wherefore, let none of these
sons of slander take satisfaction in the frequent ac-
knowledgments I am always ready to make of my own
failing, for that humility with which I always find
cause to look into my own heart, where I see others
worse, and more guilty of crimes than they can lay to
my charge, yet makes me look back upon their weak-
ness with the last contempt, who fix their impotent
charges where there is not room to take hold, and
run away with the air and shadow of crimes never
committed.
I have instanced this, not at all on my own account,
for 'tis not worth while, for if I am injured, what's
that to troubling the world with when I am forgotten?
But while I am examining the nicest article in the
world, honesty, I cannot but lay down these three
heads from the preceding observations :—
1. He who is forward to reproach the infirmities of
other men's honesty, is very near a breach of his own.
2. He that hastily reproaches another without suffi-
cient ground, cannot be an honest man.
3. Where there may be sufficient ground of reproach,
yet an honest man is always tender of his neighbour's
character from the sense of his own frailty.
But I return to honesty, as it affects a man's pledging
his word, which is the counterpart of his principle, and
this because, as I said, I should chiefly regard this
honesty as it concerns human affairs, conversation, and
negotiation.
And here I meet with a tradesman come just in
from dunning one of his neighbours. "Well, I have
been at a place for money," says he, "but I can get 
none. There's such an one, he passes for an honest
man, but I am sure he is a great rogue to me, for he
has promised me my money a long time, but puts me
off still from time to time; he makes no more of
breaking his word, than of drinking a glass of beer. I
am sure he has told me forty lies already. This is
one of your honest men; if all such honest men were
hanged, we should have a better trade." And thus he
runs on.
If all such honest men were hanged, they that were
left might have a better trade; but how many of them
would there be?
Now, though I shall in no way vindicate men's
hasty promises absolutely to perform what is doubtful
in the event, yet I cannot agree that every man who,
having promised a payment, does not perform it to his
time, is a knave or a liar. If it were so, the Lord
have mercy upon three parts of the city.
Wherefore, to state this matter clearly, it must be
taken a little to pieces, and the articles spoken to apart.
First. Without question, when a man makes a
promise of payment to another on a set day, knowing
in his own thoughts that it is not probable he should be
capable to comply with it, or really designing not to com-
ply with it, or not endeavouring to comply with it, 'tis
a deceit put upon the party, 'tis a premeditated formal lie,
the man that made it is a stranger to honesty; he is a
knave, and everything that is base and bad. But,
Secondly. Promises ought to be understood, both
by the person to whom and the person by whom they
are made, as liable to those contingencies that all human
affairs and persons are liable to, as death, accidents,
disappointments, and disorder. Thus, if a man who
ought to pay me to-day tells me, "Sir, I cannot
comply with you to-day; but if you call for it next
week, you shall have it;" if I may put this answei

into plainer English, and I suppose the man to be an
honest man, I cannot understand his meaning otherwise
than thus :—
"Sir, I acknowledge your money is due. I have
not cash enough by me to pay you to-day, but I have
several running bills, and several persons who have
promised me money, which I doubt not I shall receive
against such a time; and if you call then, I make no
question but I shall be able to do it; and if it is
possible for me to pay you, I will do it at that time
without fail."
I confess it were as well to express themselves thus
at large in all the appointments people make for pay-
ment, and would the persons who make them consider
it, they would do so; but custom has prevailed in our
general way of speaking, whereby all things that are
subject to the common known contingents of life, or
visible in the circumstances of the case, are understood
without beingexpressed. For example:—
I make an appointment of meeting a man positively
at such a town, such a certain day or hour. If I were
talking to a Turk or a pagan that knows nothing, or
believes nothing of supreme Providence, I would say—
If the Lord of heaven and earth, that governs all my
actions, please to preserve and permit me. But when
I am talking to a Christian, it should seem to be so
universally supposed that every appointment is subjected
and submits to the government of Providence, that the
repetition would be needless; and that when a man
promises positively to meet, 'tis with a general sub-
intelligitur, a reserve as natural as Nature itself, to the
Divine permission. All men know, that unless I am
alive I cannot come there, or if I am taken sick, both
which may easily happen, I shall disappoint him. And,
therefore, if he should urge me again to come without
fail, and I should reply, "I won't fail if I am alive 
and well," the man ought to take it for an affront, and
ask me if I take him for a fool, to think if I am taken
sick, I should come with my bed at my back, or if
death should intervene, he had occasion to speak with
my ghost.
In this sense, a tradesman who promises payment of
money at a set time; first, 'tis supposed he has it not
now in his hands, because he puts off the person
demanding to a further day, and promises to comply
with it then. This promise, therefore, can be under-
stood no otherwise than that he expects to receive
money by that time. Now, if this man, by the like
disappointments from other men, or any other involun-
tary casualty, is really and bondfide unable to comply
with the time of promised payment, I cannot see but
this may befall an honest man, and he neither designing
to fail when he promised, not being able to prevent
the accident that obliged him to do it, nor in any way
voluntary in the breach, is not, in my opinion, guilty
of a lie, or breach of his honour, though he did not
make those verbal reserves in the promises he had
given.
If every man who cannot comply with promised
payments should be thus branded with lying and dis-
honesty, then let him who is without the sin cast the
stone, for nobody else ought to do it.
'Tis true, there is a difference between an accident
and a practice; that is, in short, there is a difference
between him who meets with a great many occasions
thus to break his word, and he that meets with but few;
but if it bea crime, he that commits it once is no more
an honest man than he that commits it forty times; and
if it be not a crime, he that does it forty times is as
honest as he that has occasion to do it but once.
But let no man take encouragement from hence to
be prodigal of his word, and slack in his performance; .
r
for this nice path is so near the edge of the pit of knavery,
that the least slip lets you fall in.
These promises must have abundance of circumstances
to bring the honest man out of the scandal.
As, first. The disappointments which occasioned
this breach of his word must have been unforeseen and
unexpected, otherwise the expectation of performing
his promise was ill grounded, and then his honesty is
answerable for the very making the promise, as well as
the breaking it.
Second. No endeavours must be wanting to comply
with the promise, otherwise 'tis wrong to say, "I am
disappointed, and can't make good my word." The
man ought to say, "Sir, I have disappointed myself by
my negligence or wilfulness, and have obliged myself
to break my word;" or, in English, "Sir, I am a
knave; for though I made you a promise which I
might have performed, I took no care about it, not
valuing the forfeiture of my word."
If, then, the case is so nice, though, in the strictness
of speaking, such a disappointment may oblige an honest
man to break his word, yet every honest man, who
would preserve that character to himself, ought to be
the more wary, and industriously avoid making such
absolute unconditional promises, because we are to avoid
the circumstances of offence.
But as to the nature of the thing, 'tis plain to me
that a man may in such cases be obliged to break his
word unwillingly; and nothing can be a fraud or dis-
honest action in that case, which is not either voluntary
in itself, or the occasion voluntarily procured.
Of Relative Honesty.
As honesty is simple and plain, without gloss and
pretence, so it is universal. He that may uphold an untainted reputation in one particular, may be justly
branded with infamy in another. A man may be
punctual in his dealings, and a knave in his relations;
honest in his warehouse, and a knave at his fireside;
he may be a saint in his company, a devil in his family;
true to his word, and false to his friendship; but who-
soever he be, he is no honest man. An honest man
is all of a piece the whole contexture of his life; his
general conduct is genuine, and squared according to
the rules of honesty; he never runs into extremes and
excesses on one hand or other.
I confess I find this thing which they call relative
honesty very little thought of in the world, and that
which is still worse, 'tis very little understood. I'll
bring it down to but a few examples, some of which
frequently happen among us, and will therefore be the
more familiarly received.
There are relative obligations entailed on us in our
family circumstances, which are just debts, and must
be paid, and which, in a word, a man can no more be
honest if he does not make conscience of discharging,
than he can in the case of the most unquestionable debts
between man and man.
The debts from children to parents, and from wives
to their husbands, are in a manner relatively changed,
and the obligation transferred into the order of religious
duties. God, the guide and commander of all subordi-
nation, has, as it were, taken that part into His own
hand. 'Tis rather called a duty to Him than a relative
duty only. But if men take this for a discharge to
them of all relative obligations to wives and to children,
or that God had less required one than the other, they
must act upon very wrong principles.
Nature, indeed, dictates in general a man's providing
subsistence for his family, and he is declared to be so
far from a Christian that he is worse than an infidel that neglects it. But there are other parts of our
obligations which honesty calls upon us to perform.
A wife and children are creditors to the father of the
family, and he cannot be an honest man that does not
discharge his debt to them, any more than he could if
he did not repay money borrowed to a stranger; and
not to lead my reader on to intricate and disputed par-
ticulars, I instance principally in those that nobody can
dispute, as, first, education. By this I mean, not only
putting children to school, which some parents think is
all they have to do with or for their children, and in-
deed with some is all that they know how to do, or
are fit to do; I say, I do not mean this only, but
several other additional cares, as: (1.) Directing what
school, what parts of learning are proper for them,
what improvements they are to be taught; (2.) study-
ing the genius and capacities of their children in what
they teach them. Some children will voluntarily learn
one thing, and can never be forced to learn another,
and for want of which observing the genius of children
we have so many learned blockheads in the world, who
are mere scholars, pedants, and no more. (3.) But the
main part of this debt which relative honesty calls upon
us to pay to our children, is the debt of instruction, the
debt of government, the debt of example. He that
neglects to pay any of these to his family is a relative
knave, let him value himself upon his honesty in paying
his other debts as much as he will.
'Tis a strange notion men have of honesty and of their
being honest men, as if it related to nothing but trades-
men or men who borrow and lend, or that the title was
obtained by an ordinary observance of right and wrong
between man and man. 'Tis a great mistake; the
name of an honest man is neither so easily gained, nor
so soon lost as these men imagine. David was a very
honest man, notwithstanding his passion and revenge in the case of Nabal, his murder in the case of Uriah, or
his adultery in the case of Bathsheba. The intent and
main design of his life was upright; and whenever he
fell by the power of that temptation that overcame him,
he rose again by repentance.
Let no vain men flatter themselves with the pride of
their honesty in mere matters of debtor and creditor,
though that is also absolutely necessary and essential to
an honest man.
But trace this honest man home to his family. Is
he a tyrant or a churl to his wife? Is he a stranger to
the conduct and behaviour of his children? Is he an
Eli to their vices? Are they uninstructed, uncorrected,
unexhorted, ungoverned, or ill governed? That man
is a knave, a relative knave; he neither does his duty
to God, or pays the debt of a husband, or of a parent,
to his wife or his family.
Secondly, after the debt of education, there is the
debt of induction due from us to our children. The
debt from a parent is far from ending when the chil-
dren come from school, as the brutes who turn their
young off from them when they are just able to pick for
themselves. It is our business, doubtless, to introduce
them into the world, and to do it in such a manner as
suits the circumstances we are in, as to their supply,
and the inclinations and capacities of our children.
This is a debt the want of paying which makes many
children too justly reproach their parents with neglect-
ing them in their youth, and not giving them the neces-
sary introduction into the world, as might have qualified
them to struggle and shift for themselves.
Not to do this is to ruin our children negatively on
one hand, as doing it without judgment and without
regard to our family circumstances, and our children's
capacities, is a positive ruining them on the other. I
could very usefully run out this part into a long r"
discourse on the necessity there is of consulting the in-
clinations and capacities of our children in our placing
them out in the world. How many a martial spirit do
we find damned to trade, while we spoil many a good
porter, and convert the able limbs and bones of a block-
head into the figure of a long robe, or a gown and
cassock?
How many awkward clumsy fellows do we breed to
surgery or to music, whose fingers and joints Nature
originally designed, and plainly showed it us by their
size, were better suited for the blacksmith's sledge or the
carpenter's axe, the waterman's oar or the carman's whip?
Whence comes it to pass that we have so many
young men brought to the bar and to the pulpit with
stammering tongues, hesitations and impediments in
their speech, unmusical voices, and no common utter-
ance; while, on the other hand, Nature's cripples—
bow-legged, battle-hammed, and half-made creatures—are bred tumblers and dancing-masters?
I name these because they occur most in our com-
mon observation, and are all miserable examples, where
the children curse the knavery of their fathers in not
paying the debt they owed to them as parents, in put-
ting them to employments that had been suitable to
their capacities, and suitable to what Nature had cut
them out for.
I came into a public-house once in London, where
there was a black mulatto-looking man sitting, talking
very warmly among some gentlemen, who, I observed,
were listening very attentively to what he said, and I
sat myself down and did the like. 'Twas with great
pleasure I heard him discourse very handsomely on
several weighty subjects. I found he was a very good
scholar, had been very handsomely bred, and that
learning and study were his delight; and, more than
that, some of the best of science was at that time his employment. At length I took the freedom to ask him
if he was born in England?
He replied with a great deal of good humour in the
manner, but with an excess of resentment at his father,
and with tears in his eyes, "Yes, yes, sir, I am a true-born Englishman; to my father's shame be it spoken,
who, being an Englishman himself, could find it in his
heart to join himself to a negro woman, though he must
needs know the children he should beget would curse
the memory of such an action, and abhor his very name
for the sake of it. Yes, yes," says he, repeating it
again, "I am an Englishman, and born in lawful wed-
lock; happy had it been for me, though my father had
gone to the devil for whoredom, had he lain with a
cook-maid, or produced me from the meanest beggar-
woman in the street. My father might do the duty of
nature to his black wife; but, God knows, he did no
justice to his children. If it had not been for this
damned black face of mine," says he, then smiling, "I
had been bred to the law, or brought up in the study of
divinity; but my father gave me learning to no manner
of purpose, for he knew I should never be able to rise
by it to anything but a learned valet de chambre. What
he put me to school for I cannot imagine; he spoiled a
good tarpauling when he strove to make me a gentle-
man. When he had resolved to marry a slave and lie
with a slave, he should have begot slaves, and let us
have been bred as we were born; but he has twice
ruined me — first, with getting me a frightful face, and
then going to paint a gentleman upon me."
It was a most affecting discourse indeed, and as such
I record it; and I found it ended in tears from the
person, who was in himself the most deserving, modest,
and judicious man that I ever met with under a negro
countenance in my life.
After this story I persuaded myself I need say no III. E
more to this case; the education of our children,
their instruction, and the introducing them into the
world, is a part of honesty, a debt we owe to them;
and he cannot be an honest man that does not, to
the utmost of his ability and judgment, endeavour to
pay it.
All the other relative obligations, which family
circumstances call for the discharge of, allow the same
method of arguing for, and are debts in their pro-
portion, and must be paid upon the same principle of
integrity. I have neither room nor is there any occasion
to enlarge upon them.
Chapter Hi.
Of the Immorality of Conversation, and the Vulgar
Errors of Behaviour.
CONVERSATION is the brightest and most
beautiful part of life; 'tis an emblem of the
enjoyment of a future state, for suitable society
is a heavenly life; 'tis that part of life by which man-
kind are not only distinguished from the inanimate
world, but by which they are distinguished from one
another. Perhaps I may be more particularly sensible
of the benefit and of the pleasure of it, having been so
effectually mortified with the want of it. But as I
take it to be one of the peculiars of the rational life
that man is a conversable creature, so it is his most
complete blessing in life to be blessed with suitable
persons about him to converse with. Bringing it down
from generals to particulars, nothing can recommend a
man more, nothing renders him more agreeable, nothing
can be a better character to give of one man to another, 
next to that of his being an honest and religious man,
than to say of him that he is very good company.
How delightful is it to see a man's face always
covered with smiles, and his soul shining continually in
the goodness of his temper; to see an air of humour
and pleasantness sit ever upon his brow, and to find
him on all occasions the same, ever agreeable to others
and to himself—a steady calm of mind, a clear head,
and serene thoughts always acting the mastership upon
him. Such a man has something angelic in his very
countenance; the life of such a man is one entire scene
of composure; 'tis an anticipation of the future state,
which we well represent by an eternal peace.
To such a man to be angry, is only to be just to
himself, and to act as he ought to do; to be troubled
or sad is only to act his reason, for as to being in a
passion he knows nothing of it; passion is a storm in
the mind, and this never happens to him; for all ex-
cesses, either of grief or of resentment, are foreigners,
and have no habitation with him. He is the only man
that can observe that Scripture heavenly dictate, "be
angry and sin not;" and if ever he is very angry, 'tis
with himself, for giving way to be angry with any
one else.
This is the truly agreeable person, and the only one
that can be called so in the world; his company is a
charm, and is rather wondered at than imitated. 'Tis
almost a virtue to envy such a man; and one is apt
innocently to grieve at him, when we see what is so
desirable in him, and cannot either find it or make it in
ourselves.
But take this with you in the character of this happy
man, namely, that he is always a good man, a religious
man. 'Tis a gross error to imagine that a soul blackened
with vice, loaded with crime, degenerated into im-
morality and folly, can be that man— can have this calm, serene soul, those clear thoughts, those constant
smiles upon his brow, and the steady agreeableness
and pleasantry in his temper, that I am speaking of;
there must be intervals of darkness upon such a mind.
Storms in the conscience will always lodge clouds upon
the countenance, and where the weather is hazy within
it can never be sunshine without; the smiles of a dis-
turbed mind are all but feigned and forged; there may
be a good disposition, but it will be too often and too
evidently interrupted by the recoils of the mind, to
leave the temper untouched and the humour free and
unconcerned; when the drum beats an alarm within,
it is impossible but the disturbance will be discovered
without.
Mark the man of crime; sit close to him in com-
pany; at the end of the most exuberant excursion of
his mirth, you will never fail to hear his reflecting
faculty whisper a sigh to him; he will shake it off, you
will see him check it and go on. Perhaps he sings it
off, but at the end of every song, nay, perhaps of every
stanza, it returns; a kind of involuntary sadness breaks
upon all his joy; he perceives it, rouses, despises it,
and goes on; but in the middle of a long laugh in drops
a sigh; it will be, it can be no otherwise; and I never
conversed closely with a man of levity in my life but I
could perceive it most plainly; 'tis a kind of respiration
natural to a stifled conviction — a hesitation that is the
consequence of a captivated virtue, a little insurrection
in the soul against the tyranny of profligate principles.
But in the good man the calm is complete — it is all
nature, no counterfeit; he is always in humour, because
he is always composed:
He's calm without, because he's clear within.
A stated composure of mind can really proceed from
nothing but a fund of virtue; and this is the reason 
why it is my opinion that the common saying, that
content of mind is happiness, is a vulgar mistake, unless
it be granted that this content is first founded on such a
basis as the mind ought to be contented with, for other-
wise a lunatic in Bedlam is a completely happy man;
he sings in his hutch, and dances in his chain, and is as
contented as any man living. The possession or power
which that vapour or delirium has upon his brain makes
him fancy himself a prince, a monarch, a statesman, or
just what he pleases to be; as a certain duchess is said
to have believed herself to be an empress, has her foot-
men drawn up, with javelins, and dressed in antic
habits, that she may see them through a window, and
believe them to be her guards; is served upon the knee,
called her majesty, imperial majesty, and the like; and
with this splendour her distempered mind is deluded,
forming ideas of things which are not, and at the same
time her eyes are shut to the eternal captivity of her cir-
cumstances; in which she is made a property to other
persons, her estate managed by guardianship, and she a
poor demented creature to the last degree, an object of
human compassion, and completely miserable.
The only contentment which entitles mankind to
any felicity is that which is founded upon virtue and
just principles, for contentment is nothing more or less
than what we call peace; and what peace where crime
possesses the mind, which is attended, as a natural
consequence, with torment and disquiet? What peace
where the harmony of the soul is broken by constant
regret and self-reproaches? What peace in a mind
under constant apprehensions and terrors of something
yet attending to render them miserable; and all this is
inseparable from a life of crime:
For where there's guilt, there always will be fear.
Peace of mind makes a halcyon upon the countenance, r
I
i
it gilds the face with a cheerful aspect, such as nothing
else can procure; and which indeed, as above, it is
impossible effectually to counterfeit.
Bow, mighty reason, to thy Maker's name,
For God and Peace are just the same;
Heaven is the emanation of His face,
And want of peace makes hell in ev'ry place. Tell us, ye men of notion, tell us why
You seek for bliss and wild prosperity
In storms and tempests, feuds and war —
Is happiness to be expected there?
Tell us what sort of happiness
Can men in want of peace possess?
Blest charm of Peace, how sweet are all those hours
We spend in thy society 1
Afflictions lose their acid powers,
And turn to joys when join'd to thee.
The darkest article of life with peace Is but the gate of happiness;Death in his blackest shapes can never fright, Thou can'st see day beyond his night;The smile of Peace can calm the frown of Fate, And, spite of death, can life anticipate, Nay, hell itself, could it admit of peace, Would change its nature, and its name would cease;The bright transforming blessing would destroy The life of death, and damn the place to joy;The metamorphosis would be so strange,
'Twould fright the devils, and make them bless the change;Or else the brightness would be so intense
They'd shun the light, and fly from thence.
Let heav'n, that unknown happiness,
Be what it will, 'tis best described by peace.
No storms without, or storms within;
No fear, no danger there, because no sin:
'Tis bright essential happiness,
Because He dwells within whose name is Peace.
Who would not sacrifice for thee
All that men call felicity?
Since happiness is but an empty name,
A vapour without heat or flame,
But what from thy original derives—
And dies with thee, by whom it lives.
But I return to the subject of conversation, from
which this digression is made only to show that the
fund of agreeable conversation is, and can only be,
founded in virtue; this alone is the thing that keeps a
man always in humour, and always agreeable. They mistake much who think religion or a strict
morality discomposes the temper, sours the mind, and
unfits a man for conversation. Tis irrational to think
a man can't be bright unless he is wicked; it may as
well be said a man cannot be merry till he is mad, not
agreeable till he is offensive, not in humour till he is
out of himself. 'Tis clear to me no man can be truly
merry but he that is truly virtuous; wit is as consistent
with religion as religion is with good manners; nor is
there anything in the limitations of virtue and religion,
I mean the just restraints which religion and virtue lay
upon us in conversation, that should abate the pleasure
of it; on the contrary, they increase it. For example:
restraints from vicious and indecent discourses; there's
as little manners in those things as there is mirth in
them, nor indeed does religion or virtue rob conversa-
tion of one grain of true mirth. On the contrary, the
religious man is the only man fully qualified for mirth
and good humour, with this advantage, that when the
vicious and the virtuous man appears gay and merry, but
differ, as they must do, in the subject of their mirth,
you may always observe the virtuous man's mirth is
superior to the other, more suitable to him as a man,
as a gentleman, as a wise man, and as a good man; and,
generally speaking, the other will acknowledge it, at
least afterward, when his thoughts cool, and as his
reflections come in.
But what shall we do to correct the vices of conver-
sation? How shall we show men the picture of their
own behaviour? There is not a greater undertaking
in the world, or an attempt of more consequence to the good of mankind, than this; but 'tis as difficult also as
it is useful, and at best I shall make but a little progress
in it in this work: let others mend it.
Of Unfitting Ourselves for Conversation.
Before I enter upon the thing which I call the im-
morality of conversation, let me say a little about the
many weak and foolish ways by which men strive, as
it were, to unfit themselves for conversation. Human
infirmities furnish us with several things that help to
make us unconversable; we need not study to increase
the disadvantages we lie under on that score. Vice
and intemperance, not as a crime only, that I should
speak of by itself, but even as a distemper, unfit us for
conversation; they help to make us cynical, morose,
surly, and rude. Vicious people boast of their polite
carriage and their nice behaviour, how gay, how good-humoured, how agreeable! For a while it may be so;
but trace them as men of vice, follow them till they
come to years, and observe, while you live, you never
see the humour last, but they grow fiery, morose,
positive, and petulant. An ancient drunkard is a thing
indeed not often seen, because the vice has one good
faculty with it, viz., that it seldom hands them on to
old age; but an ancient and good-humoured drunkard
I think I never knew.
It seems strange that men should affect unfitting
themselves for society, and study to make themselves
unconversable, whereas their being truly sociable as
men is the thing which would most recommend them,
and that to the best of men, and best answers to the
highest felicity of life. Let no man value himself upon
being morose and cynical, sour and unconversable —'tis
the reverse of a good man; a truly religious man
follows the rule of the apostle —" Be affable, be courteous, be humble; in meekness esteeming every man
better than ourselves;" whereas conversation now is
the reverse of the Christian rule; 'tis interrupted with
conceitedness and affectation — a pride, esteeming our-
selves better than every man; and that which is worse
still, this happens generally when indeed the justice of
the case is against us, for where is the man who, thus
overruling himself, is not evidently inferior in merit to
all about him? Nay, and frequently those who put
most value upon themselves, have the least merit to
support it. Self-conceit is the bane of human society,
and, generally speaking, is the peculiar of those who
have the least to recommend them: 'tis the ruin of
conversation, and the destruction of all improvement;
for how should any man receive any advantage from the
conversation of others, who believes himself qualified
to teach them, and not to have occasion to learn any-
thing from them?
Nay, as the fool is generally the man that is con-
ceited most of his own wit, so that very conceit is the
ruin of him; it confirms him a fool all the days of his
life, for he that thinks himself a wise man is a fool,
and knows it not; nay, 'tis impossible he should con-
tinue to be a fool if he was but once convinced of his
folly:
If fools could their own ignorance discern,
They'd be no longer fools, because they'd learn.
It will be objected here, indeed, that folly and con-
ceit may be hurtful to conversation, may rob men of
the advantage of it, unfit one side for conversing, and
make it unprofitable, as well as unpleasant to the other;
but that this is nothing to the immorality of conversation;
that ignorance and conceit may be an infirmity, but is not
always a crime; that the mischief of men's being fools
is generally their own, but the mischief of their being knaves is to other people; and this is very true. But
certainly egregious folly merits one paragraph of rebuke;
perhaps it may touch the senses of some weak brethren
one time or other, and the labour may not be lost.
I never saw a more simple, or yet a more furious
irreconcilable quarrel, than once between two of the
most empty, conceited people that ever I knew in the
world; and it was upon one calling the other fool,
which, on both sides, was unhappily very true. They
fought upon the spot, but were parted by the company;
they challenged, and could not meet, their friends
getting notice of it; in short, it ruined them both;
they made new appointments, and at last deceived their
friends and fought again; they were both wounded,
and one died; the other fled the country, and never
returned. The first owned he was a fool, which was
indeed some diminution of his folly. I say he knew
himself to be a fool, but could not bear the other to
tell him so, who was more a fool than himself. The
other boldly asserted his own capacities to be infinitely
greater than they were, and despised the first to the
last degree, who indeed, if he had not more wit, had
more modesty than the other; but both, like fools,
fought about nothing, for such, indeed, the question about
their wit might very well have been called.
But it is true, after all, the want of a conversable
temper, if from a want or defect of sense, may be an
infirmity, not an immorality; that is to say, the cause
is not so in itself, but it may be so in its consequences
that way also, for the conversation of fools is vanity in
the abstract. I might here, indeed, find subject for a
large tract upon the infinite diversity of fools, and by
consequence the wondrous beauty of their conversation.
I have on this occasion reckoned up a list of about
seven and thirty several sorts of fools, besides Solomon's
fool, whom I take to be the wicked fool only; these I
R Vents
have diversified by their tempers and humours, and in
the infinite variety of their follies of several sorts, in
every one of which they rob themselves, and all that
keep them company, of the felicity of conversation,
there being nothing in them but emptiness, or a fulness
of what is ridiculous, and only qualified to be laughed
at or found fault with.
I have likewise described some of their conversation,
their vain repetitions, their catchwords, their laughings
and gestures, and adapted them to make the world
merry. I have thoughts of running it on into foreign
characters, and describe French, Spanish, Portuguese
fools, and fools of Russia, China, and the East Indies;
but as this is something remote from the design in hand,
which is more serious, and done on a much better view,
and likewise of an unmeasurable length, like the weighty
subject it is upon (for folly is a large field), so I refer
it to another opportunity.
The truth is, that part of conversation which I am
now to speak of, or which I mean by what I have said
upon this subject, is the weighty and serious part, and
is not the mere common talk, or a conversation which
fools are capable of; 'tis exercised in a solid and well-tempered frame, and when regulated, as it ought to be,
by virtue and good morals, is qualified to make man-
kind happy in the enjoyment of the best things and of
the best company; and therefore the evils that creep
into and corrupt this part of our conversation are of the
more fatal quality, and worth our exposing, that people
may see and shun them, and that conversation may be
restored among us to what it should be.
I. Of the Immorality of Conversation in General.
Some may object against the term, the immorality
of conversation, and think the word improper to the subject; but to save any critic the dearly beloved labour
of cavilling in favour of ill manners and unbecoming be-
haviour, I shall explain myself before I go any farther.
I call conversation immoral where the discourse is
indecent, where 'tis irreligious or profane, where 'tis
immodest or scandalous, or where 'tis slanderous and
abusive. In these and such cases, loqui est agere; thus
talking lewdly, or talking profanely, is an immodest
action. Such is the power of words, that mankind is
able to act as much evil by their tongues as by their
hands; the ideas that are formed in the mind from
what we hear are most piercing and permanent, and the
force of example in this case is not more powerful than
the force of argument.
Some of the worst sins are not to be committed but
by the tongue, as the sin of blasphemy, speaking treason
against the majesty of God, cursings and imprecations
among men, lies, slanders, and a vast variety of petty
excursions, which are grown modish by custom, and
seem too small to be reproved.
We are here in England, after many years' degene-
racy, arrived to a time wherein vice is in general dis-
countenanced by authority; God in mercy to the age
has inspired our government with a resolution to dis-
courage it; the king, now his wars are over, and his
foreign enemies allow him some rest, will, we hope,
declare war against this domestic enemy.
The late Queen Mary, of heavenly memory for
her piety and blessed example, appeared in her time
gallantly in the cause of virtue; magistrates were en-
couraged to punish vice, new laws made to restrain it,
and justice seemed to be at work to reclaim it. But
what can kings, or queens, or parliaments do? Laws
and proclamations are weak and useless things, unless
some secret influence can affect the practices of those
whom no laws can reach.

To make laws against words would be as fruitless as
to make a shelter against the lightning. There are so
many inlets to the breach that the informers would
be as numerous as the criminals, and the trespass as
frequent as the minutes we live in.
Conversation has received a general taint, and the
disease is become a charm. The way to cure it is
not by forcible restraints on particulars, but by some
general influence on the public practice. When a dis-
temper becomes pleasant to a patient he is the harder
to be cured; he has a sort of aversion to the remedy
because he has none to the disease. Our modern
people have such a passion for the mode, that if it be
but the fashion to be lewd, they will scandalise their
honour, debauch their bodies, and damn their souls to
be genteel. If the beaux talk blasphemy, the rest
will set up for atheists, and deny their Maker, to be
counted witty in the defence of it; when our trades-
men would be thought wise, and make themselves appear
nice and learned in their conversation, nothing will
satisfy them but to criticise upon things sacred, run up
to discuss the inscrutables of religion, search the arcana
even of heaven itself. The divinity of the Son of
God, the hypostatic union, the rational description of
the state everlasting, nay, the demonstrations of un-
demonstrable things, are the common subject of their
fancied affected capacities. Hence come heresies and delusions. Men affecting
to search into what is impossible they should clearly
discover, learn to doubt because they cannot describe,
and deny the existence because they cannot explain the
manner of what they inquire after; as if a thorough
impossibility of their acting by their sense upon objects
beyond its reach was an evidence against their being.
Thus, because the Trinity cannot appear to their
reasoning, they oppose their reasoning to its reality; f
they will divest the Son of God of His divinity, and of
the hypostatic union of the Godhead in the person of
Christ, because they cannot distinguish between the
actions done by Him in His mediatorial capacity, in
virtue of His office, and those actions which He did in
virtue of His omnipotence and Godhead.
This is not an immorality and error in conversation
only, or not so much so as I think it is a judgment
upon it, a blast from Heaven upon the arrogance of the
tongue. When proud men give themselves a loose to
talk blasphemously to be thought witty, their Maker
gives them up to suggest damnable errors till they begin
to believe them, and to broach their own wicked hints,
till they by custom learn to espouse and defend them,
as children tell feigned stories till they believe them to
be true. If our town fopperies were visible only in the
little excursions of dress and behaviour, it would be
satisfaction enough for a wise man either to pity or
laugh at them; but when wit is set on work, and
invention racked to find out methods how they may
be more than superlatively wicked, when all the
endowments of the mind and helps of art, with the
accomplishments of education, are ranged in battle
against Heaven, and joined in confederacy to make
mankind more wicked than ever the devil had the
impudence to desire of them, this calls out aloud
for the help of all the powers of government, and
all the strength of wit and virtue, to detect and
expose it.
Indeed I had some thoughts to leave upon record a
melancholy kind of genealogy of this horrid perfection
of vice, which so increases in our age, I mean as it
respects this nation, in which 'tis too ancient, indeed,
to trace it back to its original; yet since its visible
increase has been within the reach of our own memory,
and it is, as I may say, the adopted child of our age, 
we may judge of the extent of its influence, and may
take a short view of it in miniature. None, indeed,
can judge of the extent of its influence but such as have
conversed with all sorts of people, from the court to
the plough-tail, where you may too sadly see the effect
of it in the general debauching both the principles
and practice of all sorts and degrees of this nation;
but it will be an ungrateful task; it would lead me to
the characters of persons, and to write satires upon
the times, as well those past as those present, which,
indeed, is not my business in this work, and there-
fore I throw by some keen observations which I had
made upon this subject, my business here, or at least
my design, being rather to instruct the age than to
reproach it; and as for the dead, they are gone to
their place.
St. Augustine observes, De civitate Dei, that the
ancients justified their liberty in all excesses of vice
which they practised in those times from the patterns
of their gods; that the stories of the rapes and incest
of Jupiter, the lewdness of Venus and Mars, and the
like, made those crimes appear less heinous, since people
had them frequently in the histories of the deities they
worshipped, and that they must of necessity be lawful,
seeing they were practised by those famous persons
whom they had placed above the skies, and thought fit
to adore.
If modern times have received unhappy impressions
from vicious courts, and princes have not taken the
needful caution not to guide to evil by their example,
instead of turning this into satire upon those that are
past, I choose to give it another turn, which our kings,
and people too, in time to come may make good use of,
and I hope will not be offended at supposing that they
will do so. 1. To kings or sovereigns in future reigns; for I am not in this intending the present reign: It may
without offence be said, that they have a glorious
advantage put into their hands to honour their
Maker, and advantage their people, to the
immortal glory of their own memory, by prompt-
ing virtue and discouraging vice by their happy
examples; by removing the vicious habits of
conversation from the court-modes, and making
vice unfashionable as it is unseemly. Why may
not the royal example go as far to reform a
nation as it has formerly done to debauch and
ruin it? But as this respects the heads* of the
people, I desire to speak it with the deference
of a subject, and close this discourse with only
saying, that I pray and wish it may be so. 2. To the people, with more freedom, I apply it thus: Let past examples be what they will, the
present reign encourages no crime; why then
should our modern conversation receive this
taint? Why should we be volunteers in the
devil's service while the power we are under
gives us neither precept or example? If we
are guilty, 'tis by mere choice; the crime is all
our own, and we are patterns to ourselves.
II. Of Reforming the Errors of Conversation.
But I leave this part as less grateful, and perhaps not
more significant than what I have yet to say upon this
subject; 'tis not so absolutely material to inquire how
his conversation came first to be corrupted, as how it shall
be reformed or recovered. The question before us is,
by what method to retrieve this miserable defection,

and to bring back the nation to some tolerable degree
of good manners, that morality at least may regain
its authority, and virtue and sobriety be valued again
as it ought to be. This, I say, is a difficult thing to
direct.
- Facilis descensus Averno:
Sed revocare gradum,

Englished thus:
It is easy into hell to fall,
But to get back from thence is all.
The method might be easier prescribed than practised,
though it cannot be perfectly prescribed neither. Some-
thing may, however, be said by way of observation;
perhaps other well-wishers may hereafter throw their
mites into this treasury, and some zealous reformers
may at last make the attempt upon these foundations.
1. A strict execution of the laws against vice. We
have already and are every day making very good laws
to reform the people; but the benefit of laws consists
in the executive power, which if not vigorously put
forth, laws become useless, and it were better they were
not made at all. I was once going to have added here a
treatise, intituled, "An Essay upon the Insignificancy
of Laws and Acts of Parliament in England;" but
upon second thoughts, resolving to mingle no satire
with my serious observations, I omitted this also. The
deficiency of our laws is chiefly in the want of laws to
reform the lawmakers, that the wheel of executive
justice might be kept going. Of what use else can
laws be?
2. An exemplary behaviour in our gentry, after
whose copy the poor people generally write; not but
that I acknowledge it will be harder to reform a nation
than it would be to debauch it, though virtue should

obtain upon custom, and become the fashion, because
inclination does not stand neuter; but it would be a
great step to this reformation if we could all join to
discourage immorality by example. That if a man will
be drunk or lewd, he shall, as a thief robs a house, do
it in the dark, and be ashamed of it. If these two
heads were brought to pass, I question not but refor-
mation would come to such an height, that if a poor
man happened to be drunk he should come and desire
the constable to set him in the stocks for fear of a
worse punishment; and if a rich man swore an oath in
his passion, he should send his footman to the next
justice of the peace with his fine and get a discharge
for fear of being informed against and exposed.
In order to the furthering this great work it would
be very necessary, if possible, to draw the picture of our
modern vices, to let mankind see by a true light what
they are doing, and how ugly a phiz the mistress they
court really appears with when inclination, which paints
her in different colours, is taken off.
It will be impossible to bring vice out of fashion if
we cannot bring men to an understanding of what it
really is; but could we prevail upon a man to examine his
vice, to dissect its parts, and view the anatomy of it; to
see how disagreeable it is to him as a man, as a gentleman,
or as a Christian; how despicable and contemptible in
its highest fruition; how destructive to his senses, estate,
and reputation; how dishonourable, and how beastly,
in its public appearances: such a man would certainly be
out of love with it; and be but mankind once out of
love with vice, the reformation is half brought to pass.
I shall not pretend to invade the province of the
learned, nor offer one argument from Scripture or
Providence; for I am supposed to be talking to men
that doubt or deny them both. Divinity is not my
talent, nor ever like to be my profession; the charge of 
priestcraft and schoolmen would not lie against me;
besides, it is not the way of talking that the world
relishes at this time; in a word, talking Scripture is
out of fashion. But I must crave leave to tell my
reader that if there were no God or Providence, devil
or future state, yet they ought not to be drunken and
lewd, passionate, revengeful, or immoral; 'tis so un-
natural, so unruly, so ungenteel, so foolish and foppish,
that no wise man, as a man, can justify it so much as
to his own reason or the memory of his ancestors. I
suppose myself talking to men that have nothing to do
with God, and desire He should have nothing to do
with them; and yet even to such a vicious conversation,
looked on without the gust of inclination, would appear
too brutish to be meddled with, if we will but choose
like men, not to say like Christians. Virtue and
morality is more agreeable to human nature, more manly
than vice and intemperance; 'tis more suitable to all
the ends of life, to the being of society, to the public
peace of families, as well as nations. Mankind would
rather be virtuous than vicious, if they were to choose
only for their own ease and convenience. Vice tends
to oppression, war, and confusion; virtue is peaceable
and honest; vice is a poison to society; no man is
safe if men have neither sobriety nor honesty, for the
innocent will be robbed by the thief, ravished by the
lewd, and murdered by the drunkard.
It might not be a needless digression if I should
examine here whether whoring and drunkenness be not
the two mother sins of the times, the spring and original
of all our fashionable vices. I distinguish this because
other sins, as murders, thefts, rapes, and the like, are
now come so much in vogue, we are content the laws
should be executed for them, but should think it very
hard a man should be hanged for whoring or trans-
ported for being drunk.
s*
I would not have any of our gentlemen think
that my laying the charge of our debauchery on
the examples of the gods, has taken off anything of
the blame from those who have industriously pro-
pagated the spreading evil among their tenants and
neighbours, by their own vicious example; and I
could turn the whole observation into a satire on the
manners of our gentlemen, and describe with what
easiness our magistrates let fall the reins of their
authority, and connive at the practice of all manner
of intemperance and excess among the people; with
what eagerness the poor countrymen are called in to
be made drunk upon every occasion; with what con-
tempt any person is looked upon either in town or
country, that either will not be drunk, or cannot bear
an excessive quantity of wine; how our common
mirth is filled with songs and poems, recommending
drunkenness and lewdness; and rampant vice rides
riot through the nation. But, as above, I avoid
satire; I shall endeavour to treat this foul subject in
as civil terms as the case will bear, and only examine
general conversation in particular heads, with some
vulgar errors of behaviour which are crept in, and
which seem authorised by custom.
III. Of Atheistical and Profane Discourse.
God Almighty Himself is the least beholding to this
age of any that ever was from the beginning of time;
for that being arrived to a degree of knowledge superior
to all that went before us, or at least fancying it to be
so, whereby the greater glory might accrue to Himself,
the Author of all wisdom, that every gift, the brightest
of all the heavenly blessings, is made use of to put the
greatest contempt upon His majesty that mankind is
capable of—to deny His essence; such an affront that the devils themselves never had the impudence to
suggest to the world till they found man arrived to a
degree of hardness fit for something never done before.
All the heathen nations in the world came short of
this; the most refined philosophers owned a first cause
of all things, and that something was superior, whose
influence governed, and whose being was sacred and to
be adored. The devil himself, who is allowed to be
full of enmity against the Supreme Being, has often
set up himself to be worshipped as a God, but never
prompted the most barbarous nations to deny the being
of a God; and 'tis thought that even the devil him-
self believed the notion was too absurd to be imposed
upon the world. But our age is even with him for
his folly, for since they cannot get him to join in the
denial of a God they will deny his devilship too, and
have neither one nor other.
'Tis worth observation, after the most convincing
arguments that nature and reason can produce for the
existence of a deity, what weak, foolish, ridiculous
shifts the most refined of our atheistical disputants fly
to in defence of their notion, with what senseless pains
they labour to reason themselves into an opinion
which their own constitution, nature, and way of
living give the lie to every moment; with how little
consistency they solve all the other phenomena of
nature and creation; that when in all other points
they are capable of arguing strenuously, and are not
to be satisfied but with strength of reason and sound
argument, here they admit sophisms, delusive supposi-
tions, and miserable shams and pretences to prevail
upon their own judgments. This is touched at in the
following lines upon the system of Prometheus, which
I could not omit upon this occasion, relating to the
heathens' ignorance in the great doctrine of first
causes:
The great Promethean artist, poets say,
First made the model of a man in clay,
Contrived the form of parts, and when he had done,
Stole vital heat from the prolific sun;
But not a poet tells us to this day
Who made Prometheus first, and who the clay,
Who gave the great prolific to the sun,
And where the first productive work begun.
Also Epicurus, his philosophy will satisfy some people,
who fancy the world was made by a strange fortuitous
conjunction of atoms, without any pre-existent influence,
or without any immediate power, which Mr. Creech
very well translates thus:
But some have dreamt of atoms strangely hurled
Into the decent order of the world,
And so by chance combined, from whence began
The earth, the heaven, the sea, and beast, and man.
To which I crave leave to subjoin one complement,
by way of confutation of this folly:
Forgetting first that something must bestow
Existence on those atoms that did so.
The arguments for the existence of a deity are so
many, so nicely handled, and so unanswerable, that 'tis
needless to attempt anything that way; no man in his
wits needs any further demonstration of it than what
he may find within himself, nor is it any part of the
work I am upon; I have only a few things to ask of our modern atheists.
1. Whether their more serious thoughts do not
reflect upon them in the very act, and give the lie
to their arguments. My Lord Rochester, who was
arrived to an extraordinary pitch in this infernal learn-
ing, acknowledged it on his deathbed; the sense nature
has upon her of the certainty of this great truth, will
give some convulsions at so horrid an act.
Nature pays homage with a trembling bow,
And conscious men but faintly disallow;
The secret trepidation racks the soul,
And while he says, no God, replies, "Thou fool."
2. I would ask the most confident atheist, what
assurance he has of the negative, and what a risk he
runs if he should be mistaken? This we are sure of,
if we want demonstration to prove the being of a God,
they are much more at a loss for a demonstration to
prove the negative. Now, no man can answer it to his
prudence, to take the risk they run, upon an uncertain
supposititious notion; for if there be such a thing as
a First Cause, which we call God, they have very little
reason to expect much from Him who have made it
their business to affront Him by denying His existence.
Nor have they acted in their denial like wise men, for
they have not used so much as the caution of good
manners; but as if they were as sure of His nonentity as
of the strongest demonstration, they have been witty
upon the thing, and made a jest of the supposition,
turned all matters of faith into ridicule, burlesqued upon
religion itself, and made ballads and songs on the Bible.
Thus Rochester has left us a long lewd song, beginning
thus:
Religion's a politic cheat,
Made up of many a fable;Ne'er trouble the wise or the great,
But only amuses the rabble.
Now, I am not in this discourse entering into any
of the arguments in these grand questions on one side
or other — that would be to make this work a collection
of polemics; nor am I casuist enough for such a work—
but I am observing or remarking upon the wickedness
of the treating these subjects with levity and ignorance
in the common road of conversation.
Methinks these gentlemen act with more courage
than discretion; for if it should happen at last that r
there should be a God, and that He has the power of
rewards and punishments in His hand, as He must have
or cease to be almighty, they are but in an ill case:
If it should so fall out, as who can tell,
But there may be a God, a heaven, a hell,
Mankind had best consider well for fear,
'Tshould be too late when their mistakes appear.
Nor do they, in my opinion, discover any great wit in
it; there is, if I might pass for a judge, something
flat, something that shocks the fancy, in all the satire
upon religion that ever I saw; as if the muse were not
so much an atheist as the poet, but baulks the hint, and
could not favour a blasphemous flight with so much
freedom and spirit that at other times it has shown;
which is a notice that there is a tacit sense of the Deity,
though they pretend to deny it, lodged in the under-
standing; that it is not stifled without some difficulty,
and struggles hard with the fancy, when the party strives
to be more than ordinarily insolent with his Maker.
In the next place, as 'tis one of the worst immoralities
of conversation when it is profane, so blasphemy is the
extreme of profaneness; you cannot come into company
with an atheist but you have it in his common discourse;
he is always putting some banter or foolish pun upon
religion, affronting the invisible Power, or ridiculing
his Maker; all his wit runs out into it, as all diseases
run into the plague in a time of infection, and you must
have patience to hear it or quarrel with him. Below these we have a sort of people who will
acknowledge a God, but he must be such a one as they
please to make him; a fine, well-bred, good-natured,
gentleman-like deity, that cannot have the heart to damn
any of his creatures to an eternal punishment, nor could
not be so weak as to let the Jews crucify his own son.
These men expose religion, and all the doctrines of
repentance, and faith in Christ, with all the means of i

a Christian salvation, as matter of banter and ridicule.
The Bible, they say, is a good history in most parts,
but the story of our Saviour they look upon as a mere
novel, and the miracles of the New Testament as a
legend of priestcraft.
Further, besides these, we have Arians and Socinians,
the disciples of an ancient heretic who went out of the
church always at the singing the Gloria Patri, that he
might be out of the noise, and would sit down at the
doxology of the prayers, to note his disowning the
godhead of Jesus Christ.
These are iniquities, as Job said, should be punished
by the judges (chap. xxii. ver. 20), and these are the
things which have given such a stroke to the ruin of
the nation's morals; for no method can be so direct to
prepare people for all sorts of wickedness as to persuade
them out of a belief of any Supreme Power to restrain
them. Make a man once cease to believe a God, and
he has nothing left to limit his appetite but mere
philosophy; if there is no supreme judicature, he must
be his own judge and his own law, and will be so;
the notion of hell, devil, and infernal spirits are empty
things, and have nothing of terror in them, if the belief
of a Power superior to them be obliterated.
But to bring this particular case nearer to the point of
conversation, the errors of which lie before me: though
we live in an age where these horrid degrees of impiety
are too much practised, yet we live in a place where
religion is professed, the name of God owned and
worshipped, religion and the doctrines of Christianity
established; and as it is so, it ought as much to be
preserved by the civil power from the horrid invasion of
atheists, deists, and heretics, as the public peace ought to
be defended against freebooters, thieves, and invaders.
Tis very improbable any reformation of manners
should be brought to pass, if the debauching the religious principles of the nation goes on with an un-
restrained liberty. How incongruous is it to the
decoration * of government, that a man shall be
punished for drunkenness and set in the stocks for
swearing, but shall have liberty to deny the God of
heaven and dispute against the very sum and substance
of the Christian doctrine, shall banter the Scripture
and make ballads of the Pentateuch, turn all the prin-
ciples of religion — the salvation of the soul, the death
of our Saviour, and the revelation of the Gospel — into
ridicule. And shall we pretend to reformation of
manners and suppressing immoralities, while such as
this is the general mixture of conversation? If a man
talk against the government, or speak scurrilously of the
king, he is had to the Old Bailey, and from thence to
the pillory or whipping-post, and it is fit it should be
so; but he may speak treason against the Majesty of
heaven, deny the godhead of His Redeemer, and make
a jest of the Holy Ghost — and thus affront the Power
we all adore — and yet pass with impunity. Perhaps
some in the company may have courage enough to
blame him, and vindicate their religion with a "Why
do you talk so?" but where is the man or the magistrate
that ever vindicated the honour of his Maker with a
resentment becoming the crime? If a man give the lie
to a gentleman in company he takes it as an affront, flies
into a passion, quarrels, fights, and perhaps murders
him; nay, some have done it for an absent friend
whom they have heard abused; but where is the
gentleman that ever thought himself so much concerned
in the quarrel of his Maker but that he could hear Him
affronted, His being denied, the lie given to His divine
authority, nay, to His divine being, andall His commands
ridiculed and exposed, without any motion of spirit to
punish the insolence of the party, and without drawing * Perhaps this is a misprint for "declaration."

his sword in the quarrel, or letting him know he does
not like it?
Methinks I need not make an apology for this, as
if I meant that quarrelling and fighting were a proper
practice in the case; the law does not admit it in any
case, nor is it reasonable it should; and God Almighty
is far from desiring us to run any risk in His service.
But I choose to bring the cases into a parallel, to signify
that I think it is a vulgar error in our behaviour not
to show our resentment when we hear the honour and
essence of God slighted and denied, His majesty abused,
and religion bantered and ridiculed in common dis-
courses. I think it would be very reasonable to tell a
gentleman he wants manners when he talks reproachfully
of his Maker, and to use him scurvily if he resented it.
It would very well become a man of quality to cane a
lewd fop, or kick him downstairs, when his insolence
took a loose at religion in his company, else men may
be bullied out of their Christianity and lampooned into
profaneness, for fear of being counted fools.
Besides, it is in this as in all other like cases; he
that will talk atheistically in my company, either believes
me to be an atheist like himself, or ventures to impose
upon me; and by imposing upon me, either accounts me
a fool that cannot tell when I am put upon, or a coward
that dare not resent it.
Upon which account, even in good manners, it ought
to be avoided; for it cannot be introduced into any part
of conversation where the company are not all alike,
without the greatest affront upon the rest that can be
offered them.
IV. Of Lewd and Immodest Discourse.
Talking bawdy, that sodomy of the tongue, has the
most of ill manners and the least of a gentleman in it of any part of common discourse. Sir George Mac-
kenzie has very handsomely exposed it in its proper
colours; but it may not be an intrenchment at all
upon his province to say something to it in these
observations.
This part is the peculiar practice of such persons as
are hardened to a degree beyond other men, proficients
in debauchery, whose lives are so continually devoted
to lewdness, that their mouths cannot contain it; who
can govern their tongues no better than their tails, and
are willing to be thought what really they are. In
these it is neither so strange nor so much a crime as in
others; these are persons not to be reclaimed. This
part of my observation is not designed for their use;
they are not to be talked out of their vice; they must
go on and run their length. Nothing but a gaol or an
hospital ever brings them to a reformation; they repent
sometimes in that emblem of hell, a fluxing house, and,
under the surgeon's hands, wish a little they had been
wiser; but they follow one sin with another, till their
carcass stinks as bad as their discourse, and the body
becomes too nasty for the soul to stay any longer in it.
From these no discourse is to be expected but what is
agreeable to the tenor of their lives; for then to talk
otherwise would be strained and eccentric, and become
them as little as it would be tedious to them; but for a
gentleman, a man of seeming modesty and a man of
behaviour, not arrived to that class in the devil's
school, for such a one to mix his discourse with lewd
and filthy expressions, has something in it of a figure
which intends more than is expressed.
Either we must believe such a one to be very lewd
in his practice, or else, that not being able yet to arrive
to such a degree of wickedness as he desires, he would
supply that defect with a cheat, and persuade you to
believe he is really worse than he is.
Which of these two characters I would choose to
wear I cannot tell, for he that desires to be worse than
he thinks he is, is certainly as bad as he desires to be;
and he that is so bad as to let fly the excrescences of
it at his mouth, is as wicked as the devil can in reason
desire of him.
But I descend from the wickedness to the indecency
of the matter; its being a sin against God is not so
much the present argument as its being unmannerly — a
sin against breeding and society, a breach of behaviour,
and a saucy, insolent affront to all the company.
I do not deny but that modesty, as it respects the
covering our bodies, was at first an effect of the fall of
our parents into crime, and is therefore said still to be
the consequences of criminal nature, and no virtue in
itself, because no part of the body had been unfit to be
exposed if vice had not made the distinction necessary.
But from this very argument lewd discourse appears
to be a sin against custom and decency; for why must
the tongue industriously expose things and actions at
which Nature blushes, and which custom, let the
original be what it will, has dedicated to privacy and
retirement? What if it be true that shame is the
consequence of sin, and that modesty is not an original
virtue; it cannot but be allowed that sin has thereby
brought us to a necessity of making modesty be a
virtue, and sin would have a double influence upon us
if, after it had made us ashamed, it should make us not
ashamed again.
'Tis, in my opinion, a mistake when we say sin was
the immediate cause of shame; 'twas sin indeed gave a
nudity to our natures and actions; the innocence, which
served as a glory and covering, being gone, then shame
came in as the effect of the conscious sinner; so the text
says, they knew that they were naked. Shame was the
effect of nakedness, as nakedness was the effect of sin.
From hence, then, I argue, and this is the reason of
my naming it, that to be ashamed of our nakedness is a
token of our wisdom and a monument of our just sense
of the first sin that made it so, and as much a duty
now as any other part of our repentance.
To give the tongue then a liberty in that which there
is so much reason to blush at, argues no sense of the
original degeneracy. Where is the man that partakes
not of Adam's fall, has no vicious contracted habit and
nature conveyed to him from his grand predecessor?
Let him come forth, let him go naked and live by
himself, and let his posterity partake of his innocence;
his tongue cannot offend, nothing can be indecent for
him to say, nothing uncomely for him to see. But if these gentlemen think it proper to cover their
nakedness with their clothes, methinks they should not
be always uncovering it again with their tongues; if
there are some needful things which Nature requires to
be done in secret, and which they by inclination choose
to act in private, what reason can they give for speak-
ing of them in public?
There is a strange incongruity in the behaviour of
these people, that they fill their mouths with the foul
repetition of actions and things which their own prac-
tising in private condemns them for, nay, which they
would be ashamed to do in public; such men ought to
act the common requirements of Nature in the most
publickest places of the streets, bring their wives or
whores to the exchange and to the market-places, and
lie with them in the street, or else hold their tongues,
and let their mouths have no more the stench of their
vices in public than their actions.
And why, of all the rest of the parts of life, must
the tongue take a peculiar licence to revel thus upon
Nature, as if she had a mind to reproach her with the
infirmities she labours under? The customs we are 
obliged to, though they are clogs upon Nature and a
badge of original defection, yet neither is there any-
thing so odious or so burdensome that these gentlemen
should triumph over the nurse that brought them up.
Take the lewdest and most vicious wretch that ever
gave his tongue a loose in this hateful practice, and turn
him about to his mother, you shall hardly prevail upon
him to talk his lewd language to her; there is some-
thing nauseous and surfeiting in that thought. This
talking bawdy is like a man going to debauch his own
mother; for it is raking into the arcana and exposing
the nakedness of Nature, the common mother of us all. If, as a famous man of wit pretended, lying with a
woman was the homeliest thing that man can do, 'tis
much more true that talking of it is the homeliest thing
that man can say.
Nor is there to me any jest in these things, any
appearance of mirth. There may be some pleasure in
wicked actions, as the world rates pleasure, but I must
profess 'tis dull, and for want of other more regular
tastes that there should be pleasure in the discourse.
'Tis a profaning of Nature, and bringing forth those
things she has hallowed to secrecy and retirement to
the scandalous indecency of public banter and jest.
But men, who have always something to say for
their folly, tell us 'tis custom only which has made
any of these things uncommon, and there's no sin in
speaking that which there was no sin in doing.
Let us grant them that custom only has done this;
but if custom has made these things uncommon, and
concealed, or, at least, banished them from the voice
of conversation, 'tis a sin then against custom to expose
them again. Lawful customs become allowed virtues,
and ought to be preserved. Custom is a good reason
in such concealments; if custom has locked them up,
let them remain so, at least, till you can give a better reason for calling them abroad again than custom has
given for restraining them. Custom has made these
things uncommon, because that sin which first made
Nature naked left her so captivated by some of her
parts more than others, that she could not but blush at
those where sin had taken up its peculiar residence.
Now, as I noted before, no man can with any tolerable
satisfaction expose the parts till he has first extracted
and separated the sin which, having possessed them,
covered them at first with shame. He that can do
this may go naked and talk anything.
And, for the same reason, no man can justify talking
lewdly but he that at the same time throws away his
clothes, for to cover himself with his hands and un-
cover himself with his tongue are contradictions in their
own nature, and one condemns the other. He that
scorns the decency of words should also scorn the de-
cency of clothes, let his body be as bald as his discourse,
and let him scorn the shame of one as well as the shame
of the other.
It is no sin, they say, to talk of what it is no sin to
do; and, I may add, it is no sin at all to show what
it is no sin to describe. Why is the eye to be less
offended than the ear, since both are but the common
organs of the understanding?
But the weather and inconveniences of the climate
are urged for clothing our bodies, and I urge decency
and good manners for the government of our tongues;
and let any one contend it with me that thinks he can
prove that the obligation of the first is greater than the
obligation of the last.
Much more might be said to this, but I make but
an essay, and am unwilling to run out into a long
discourse.
Of Talking Falsely.
By talking falsely, I do not design to enter upon a long
dissertation upon the sin of lying in general. I suppose
all men that read me will acknowledge lying to be one
of the most scandalous sins between man and man, a
crime of a deep dye, and of an extensive nature, leading
into innumerable sins, that is, as lying is practised to
deceive, to injure, betray, rob, destroy, and the like.
Lying in this sense, is the concealing of all other
crimes; it is the sheep's clothing hung upon the wolfs back, it is the Pharisee's prayer, the whore's blush, the
hypocrite's paint, the murderer's smile, the thiePs
cloak; 'tis Joab's embrace and Judas's kiss; in a
word, it is mankind's darling sin and the devil's dis-
tinguishing character.
But this is not the case I am upon, this is not the
talking falsely I am upon, but a strange liberty which
(particularly in conversation) people take to talk falsely,
without charging themselves with any offence in it either
against God or man. This is to be considered in two
or three parts, not but that it has many more.
1. The liberty of telling stories, a common vice in
discourse. The main end of this extraordinary part
of tittle-tattle is to divert the company and make them
laugh; but we ought to consider whether that very
empty satisfaction, either to ourselves or friends, is to
be purchased at so great an expense as that of conscience
and of a dishonour done to truth.
'Tis scarce fit to say how far some people go in
this folly, to call it no worse, even till sometimes they
bring the general credit of their conversation into
decay, and people that are used to them learn to lay
no stress upon anything they say.
For once, we will suppose a story to be in its
substance true, yet to what monstrous a bulk doth it r
III. G
grow by that frequent addition put to it in the relation,
till not only it comes to be improbable, but even im-
possible to be true; and the ignorant relater is so
tickled with having made a good story of it, whatever
it was when he found it, that he is blind to the absur-
dities and inconsistencies of fact in relation, and tells
it with a full face even to those that are able to con-
fute it by proving it to be impossible.
I once heard a man, who would have taken it very
ill to be thought a liar, tell a story, the facts of which
were impossible to be true, and yet assert it with so
much assurance, and declare so positively that he had
been an eye-witness of it himself, that there was
nothing to do but, in respect to the man, let him alone
and say nothing. A gentleman who sat by, and whose
good breeding restrained his passion, turned to him and
said, "Did you see this thing done, sir ?"—" Yes, I
did, sir," says the relater. —"Well, sir," replies the
gentleman, "since you affirm that you did see it, I am
bound in regard to you to believe it; but upon my
word, 'tis such a thing, that if I had seen it myself,
I would not have believed it." This broke the
silence, set all the company a-laughing, and exposed
the falsehood more than downright telling him it
was a lie, which might, besides, have made a broil
about it.
It is a strange thing that we cannot be content to tell
a story as it is, but we must take from it on one side
or add to it on another till the fact is lost among the
addenda, and till in time even the man himself, remem-
bering it only as he told it last, really forgets how it
was originally. This being so generally practised now,
nothing is more common than to have two men tell the
same story quite differing one from another, yet both of
them eye-witnesses to the fact related. These are that
sort of people who, having once told a story falsely, tell 
f people who, hav
it so often in the same or like manner, till they really
believe it to be true.
This supplying a story by invention is certainly a
most scandalous crime, and yet very little regarded in
that part. It is a sort of lying that makes a great hole
in the heart, at which by degrees a habit of lying enters
in. Such a man comes quickly up to a total disregard-
ing the truth of what he says, looking upon it as a trifle,
a thing of no import, whether any story he tells be true
or no, so it but commands the company, as they call it,
that is to say, procures a laugh or a kind of amazement,
things equally agreeable to these story-tellers, for the
business is to affect the company; either startle them with
something wonderful never heard of before, or made them laugh immoderately, as at something prodigiously
taking, witty, and diverting.
It is hard to place this practice in a station equal to
its folly; 'tis a meanness below the dignity of common-sense. They that lie to gain, to deceive, to delude, to
betray, as above, have some end in their wickedness;
and though they cannot give the design for an excuse
of their crime, yet it may be given as the reason and
foundation of it; but to lie for sport, for fun, as the boys
express it, is to play at shuttlecock with your soul, and
load your conscience for the mere sake of being a fool,
and the making a mere buffoonery of a story, the plea-
sure of what is below even madness itself.
And yet, how common is this folly? How is it the
character of some men's conversation that they are made
up of story! And how mean a figure is it they bear in
company! Such men always betray their emptiness by
this, and having only a certain number of tales in their
budget, like a pedlar with his pack, they can only at
every house show the same ware over again, tell the
same story over and over, till the jest is quite worn
out; and to convince us that much of it, if not all, is r
born of invention, they seldom tell it the same way
twice, but vary it even in the most material facts; so
that though it may be remembered that it was the same
story, it ought never to be remembered that it was told
by the same man.
With what temper should I speak of these people?
What words can express the meanness and baseness of
the mind that can do thus, that sin without design,
and not only have no end in the view, but even no
reflection in the act? The folly is grown up to a
habit, and they not only mean no ill, but indeed mean
nothing at all in it.
It is a strange length that some people run in this
madness of life; and it is so odd, so unaccountable,
that indeed 'tis difficult to describe the man, though
not difficult to describe the fact. What idea can be
formed in the mind of a man who does ill without
meaning ill; that wrongs himself, affronts truth, and
imposes upon his friends, and yet means no harm; or,
to use his own words, means nothing; that if he thinks
anything, it is to make the company pleasant? and
what is this but making the circle a stage, and himself
the Merry Andrew?
The best step such men can take is to lie on; and
this shows the singularity of the crime. It is a strange
expression, but I shall make it out. Their way is, I
say, to lie on, till their character is completely known,
and then they can lie no longer; for he whom nobody
believes can deceive nobody, and then the essence of
lying is removed; for the description of a lie is, that
it is spoken to deceive, or 'tis a design to deceive.
Now, he that nobody believes can never lie any more,
because nobody can be deceived by him. Such a man's
character is a bill upon his forehead, by which every-
body knows, "Here dwells a lying tongue." When
everybody knows what is to be had of him they know 
what to expect, and so nobody is deceived; if they
believe him afterwards 'tis their fault as much as his.
There are a great many sorts of those people who
make it their business to go about telling stories; it
would be endless to enumerate them. Some tell formal
stories forged in their own brain without any retrospect
either on persons or things, I mean, as to any particular
person or passage known or in being, and only with
the ordinary introduction of "There was a man," or
"There was a woman," and the like.
Others again, out of the same forge of invention,
hammer out the very person, man or woman, and begin,
"I knew the man," or, "I knew the woman," and
these ordinarily vouch their story with more assurance
than others, and vouch also that they knew the persons
who were concerned in it. The selling or writing a parable, or an illusive alle-
goric history, is quite a different case, and is always
distinguished from this other jesting with truth, that it
is designed and effectually turned for instructive and
upright ends, and has its moral justly applied. Such
are the historical parables in the Holy Scripture, such
"The Pilgrim's Progress," and such, in a word, the
adventures of your fugitive friend, "Robinson Crusoe."
Others make no scruple to relate real stories with
innumerable omissions and additions; I mean, stories
which have a real existence in fact, but which, by the
barbarous way of relating, become as romantic and
false as if they had no real original. These tales, like
the old "Galley of Venice," which had been so often
new vamped, doubled, and redoubled, that there was
not one piece of the first timber in her, have been told
wrong so often, and so many ways, till there would
not be one circumstance of the real story left in the
relating.
There are many more kinds of these, such, namely, as are personal and malicious, full of slander and abuse;
but these are not of the kinds I am speaking of; the
present business is among a kind of white devils, who
do no harm or injury to any but to themselves; they
are like the grasshopper, that spends his time to divert
the traveller, and does nothing but starve himself. The
conversation of these men is full of emptiness, their
words are levity itself, and, according to the text, they
not only tell untruths, but "the truth is not in them."
There is not a settled awe or reverence of truth upon
their minds; it is a thing of no value to them, it is not
regarded in their discourse, and they give themselves
a liberty to be perfectly unconcerned about the thing
they say, or the story they tell, whether it be true
or no.
This is a most abominable practice on another ac-
count, namely, that these men make a jest of their
crime. They are a sort of people that sin laughing,
that play upon their souls as a man plays upon a fiddle,
to make other people dance and wear itself out; they
may be said to make some sport indeed, but it is all at
themselves — they are the hearers' comedy and their
own tragedy, and, like a penitent jack-pudding, they
will at last say, "I have made others merry, but I
have been the fool."
I would be glad to shame men of common-sense out
of this horrid piece of buffoonery; and one thing I
would warn them of, namely, that their learning to lie
so currently in story will insensibly bring them to a
bold entrenching upon truth in the rest of their con-
versation. The Scripture command is, "Let every
man speak truth unto his neighbour." If we must tell
stories, tell them as stories, and nothing wilfully to
illustrate or set it forth in the relation. If you doubt
the truth of it say so, and then every one will be at
liberty to believe their share of it.

Besides, there is a spreading evil in telling a false
story as true, namely, that you put it into the mouths
of others, and it continues a brooding forgery to the
end of time. It is a chimney-corner romance, and has
in it this distinguishing article, that whereas parables
and the inventions of men, published historically, are
once for all related, and, the moral being drawn, the
history remains allusive only as it was intended (as in
several cases * may be instanced within our time f and
without), here the case alters; fraud goes unto the
world's end, for story never dies; every relater
vouches it for truth, though he knows nothing of the
matter.
These men know not what foundations they are
laying for handing on the sport of lying, for such they
make of it to posterity, not only leaving the example,
but dictating the very materials for the practice; like
family lies handed on from father to son, till what
begun in forgery ends in history, and we make our
lies be told for truth by all our children that come
after us.
If any man object here that the preceding volumes of
this work seem to be hereby condemned, and the history
which I have therein published of myself censured, I
demand in justice such objector stay his censure till he
sees the end of the scene, when all that mystery shall
discover itself, and I doubt not but the work shall
abundantly justify the design, and the design abun-
dantly justify the work.

An Essay on the Present State of Religion in the World.
IN that part of my work which may be called history,
I have frequently mentioned the unconquerable im-
pressions which dwelt upon my mind and filled up
all my desires, immovably pressing me to a wandering,
travelling life, and which pushed me continually on from
one adventure to another, as you have heard.
There is an inconsiderate temper which reigns in
our minds, that hurries us down the stream of our
affections by a kind of involuntary agency, and makes
us do a thousand things, in the doing of which we pro-
pose nothing to ourselves but an immediate subjection to
our will, that is to say, our passion, even without the
concurrence of our understandings, and of which we
can give very little account after 'tis done.
You may now suppose me to be arrived, after a long
course of infinite variety on the stage of the world, to
the scene of life we call old age, and that I am writing
these sheets in a season of my time when (if ever) a
man may be supposed capable of making just reflections
upon things past, a true judgment of things present, and
tolerable conclusions of things to come.
In the beginning of this life of composure (for now,
and not till now, I may say that I began to live, that
is to say, a sedate and composed life), I inquired of
myself very seriously one day what was the proper
business of old age. The answer was very natural, and
indeed returned quick upon me, namely, that two things
were my present work, as above:
i. Reflection upon things past. 2. Serious application to things future. Having resolved the business of life into these heads,
I began immediately with the first; and as sometimes 
I took my pen and ink to disburden my thoughts when
the subject crowded in fast upon me, so I have here
communicated some of my observations for the benefit
of those that come after me.
About the time that I was upon these inquiries, being
at a friend's house, and talking much of my long travels,
as you know travellers are apt to do, I observed an
ancient gentlewoman in the company listened with a
great deal of attention, and, as I thought, with some
pleasure, to what I was saying; and after I had done,
"Pray, sir," says she, turning her speech to me, "give
me leave to ask you a question or two." —" With all
my heart, madam," said I; so we began the following
short dialogue:—
Old Gent. Pray, sir, in all your travels, can you
tell what is the world a-doing? What have you
observed to be the principal business of mankind?
Rob. Cru. Truly, madam, 'tis very hard to answer
such a question, the people being so differently em-
ployed, some one way, and some another; and par-
ticularly according to the several parts of the world
through which our observations are to run, and accord-
ing to the differing manners, customs, and circumstances
of the people in every place.
Old. Gent. Alas! sir, that is no answer at all to me,
because I am not a judge of the differing customs and
manners of the people you speak of; but is there not
one common end and design in the nature of men,
which seems to run through all their actions, and to
be formed by Nature as the main end of life, and by
consequence is made the chief business of living?
Pray, how do they spend their time?
R. C. Nay; now, madam, you have added a
question to the rest of a different nature from what,
if I take you right, you meant at first. Old Gent. What question, sir?r
R. C. Why, how mankind spend their time; for I
cannot say that one-half of mankind spend their time
in what they themselves may acknowledge to be the
main end of life.
Old Gent. Pray, don't distinguish me out of my
question; we may talk of what is the true end of life,
as we understood it here in a Christian country, another
time; but take my question as I offer it, what is man-
kind generally a-doing as their main business?
R. C. Truly, the main business that mankind seems
to be doing is to eat and drink; that's their enjoyment,
and to get food to eat is their employment, including
a little their eating and devouring one another.
Old Gent. That's a description of them as brutes. R. C. It is so in the first part, namely, their living
to eat and drink; but in the last part they are worse
than the brutes; for the brutes destroy not their own
kind, but all prey upon a different species; and besides,
they prey upon one another for necessity, to satisfy
their hunger, and for food; but man for baser ends,
such as avarice, envy, revenge, and the like, devours
his own species, nay, his own flesh and blood, as my
Lord Rochester very well expresses it:
But judge yourself, I'll bring it to the test, Which is the basest creature, man or beast?Birds feed on birds, beasts on each other prey, But savage man alone does man betray. Pressed by necessity, they kill for food,
Man undoes man, to do himself no good.
With teeth and claws, by Nature armed they hunt,
Nature's allowance to suppy their want:
But man with smiles, embraces, friendship, praise,
Inhumanly his fellow's life betrays.
With voluntary pains works his distress,
Not for necessity, but wantonness.
Old Gent. All this I believe is true; but this does
not reach my question yet. There is certainly some-
thing among them which is esteemed as more particularly 
the end of life and of living than the rest; to which
they apply in common as the main business, and which
is always esteemed to be their wisdom to be employed
in. Is there not something that is apparently the great
business of living?
R. C. Why, really, madam, I think not. For ex-
ample: great part of the world, and a greater part by
far than we imagine, is resolved into the lowest de-
generacy of human nature, I mean, the savage life;
where the chief end of life seems to be merely to eat
and drink, that is to say, to get their food, just as the
brutal life is employed, and indeed with very little dif-
ference between them; for except only speech and
idolatry, I see nothing in the life of some whole nations
of people, and for ought I know, containing millions
of souls, in which the life of a lion or an elephant in the
deserts of Arabia is not equal.
Old Gent. I could mention many things, sir, in
which they might differ, but that is not the present
thing I inquire about; but, pray, sir, is not religion the
principal business of mankind in all the parts of the
world? for I think you granted it when you named
idolatry, which they, no doubt, call religion.
R. C. Really, madam, I cannot say it is; because,
what with ignorance on one hand, and hypocrisy on
the other, 'tis very hard to know where to find religion
in the world.
Old Gent. You avoid my question too laboriously,
sir; I have nothing to do either with the ignorance or
hypocrisy of the people; whether they are blindly de-
vout, or knavishly and designedly devout, is not the
case; but whether religion is not apparently the main
business of the world, the principal apparent end of life,
and the employment of mankind.
R. C. What do you call religion?
Old Gent. By religion, I mean the worshipping and paying homage to some supreme being; some God,
known or unknown is not to the case, so it be but to
something counted supreme.
R. C. It is true, madam, there are scarce any
nations in the world so stupid but they give testi-
mony to the being of a God, and have some notion of
a supreme power.
Old Gent. That I know also, but that is not the
main part of my question; but my opinion is, that
paying a Divine worship, acts of homage and adoration,
and particularly that of praying to the Supreme Being
which they acknowledge, is derived to mankind from
the light of Nature with the notion or belief itself.
R. C. I suppose, madam, you mean by the question
then, whether the notion or belief of a God in general,
and the sense of worship in particular, are not one and
the same natural principle.
Old Gent. I do so, if you and I do but agree about
what we call worship.
R. C. By worship, I understand adoration.
Old Gent. But there you and I differ again a little;
for by worship, I understand supplication.
R. C. Then you must take them both in together,
for some part of the Indian savages only adore.
Old Gent. I confess there is much adoration, where
there is little supplication. R. C. You distinguish too nicely, madam. Old Gent. No, no, I do not distinguish in what I
call worship; I allege that all the adoration of those
poor savages is mere supplication: you say they lift up
their hands to their idols, for fear they should hurt
them.
R. C. I do say so, and it is apparent.
Old Gent. Why, that is the same thing, for then
they lift up their hands to him, that is to say, pray to
him not to hurt them; for all the worship in the world, especially the outward performance, may be resolved
into supplication.
R. C. I agree with you in that, if you mean the
apparent endof worship.
Old Gent. Why, did not your man Friday and the
savage woman you tell us of, talk of their old idol they
called Benamuckee? And what did they do?
R. C. It is very true they did.
Old Gent. And did not Friday tell you they went up
to the hills, and said " O" to him? Pray, what was
the meaning of saying "O" to him, but "O do not
hurt us; for thou art omnipotent, and canst kill us: O
heal our distempers; for thou art infinite, and canst do
all things: O give us what we want, for thou art
bountiful: O spare us, for thou art merciful:" and so
of all the other conceptions of a God?
R. C. Well, madam, I grant all this; pray what
do you infer from it? What is the reason of your
question?
Old Gent. O sir, I have many inferences to draw
from it for my own observation; I do not set up to
instruct you.
I thought this serious old lady would have enter-
tained a farther discourse with me on so fruitful a sub-
ject, but she declined it, and left me to my own
meditation, which, indeed, she had raised up to an
unusual pitch; and the first thing that occurred to me,
was to put me upon inquiring after that nice thing I
ought to call religion in the world, seeing really I found
reason to think that there was much more devotion
than religion in the world; in a word, much more
adoration than supplication; and I doubt, as I come
nearer home, it will appear that there is much more
hypocrisy than sincerity — of which I may speak by
itself.
In my first inquiries, I looked back upon my own travels, and it afforded me but a melancholy reflection,
that in all the voyages and travels which I have em-
ployed two volumes in giving a relation of, I never set
my foot in a Christian country; no, not in circling
three parts of the globe; for excepting the Brazils,
where the Portuguese indeed profess the Roman Catholic
principles, which, however, in distinction from pagan-
ism, I will call the Christian religion — I say, except
the Brazils, where also I made little stay, I could not
be said to set foot in a Christian country, or a country
inhabited by Christians, from the bay of Larache, and
the port of Sallee, by the Strait's mouth, where I
escaped from slavery, through the Atlantic Ocean, the
coasts of Africa on one side, and of Caribbee, on the
American shore, on the other side; from thence to
Madagascar, Malabar, and the bay and city of Bengal,
the coast of Sumatra, Malacca, Siam, Cambodia,
Cochin China, the empire and coast of China, the de-
serts of Karakathie, the Mongol Tartars, the Siberian,
the Samoiede barbarians, and till I came within four or
five days of Archangel in the Black Russia.
It is, I say, a melancholy reflection to think how all
these parts of the world, and with infinite numbers of
millions of people, furnished with the powers of reason
and gifts of Nature, and many ways, if not every way,
as capable of the reception of sublime things as we are,
are yet abandoned to the grossest ignorance and de-
pravity; and that not in religion only, but even in all
the desirable parts of human knowledge, and especially
science and acquired knowledge.
What the Divine wisdom has determined concerning
the souls of so many millions, it is hard to conclude,
nor is it my present design to inquire; but this I may
be allowed here, as a remark: if they are received to
mercy in a future state, according to the opinion of
some, as having not sinned against saving light, then their ignorance and pagan darkness is not a curse, but
a felicity; and there are no unhappy people in the
world, but those lost among Christians, for their sins
against revealed light; nay, then being born in the
regions of Christian light, and under the revelation of
the Gospel doctrines, is not so much a mercy to be
acknowledged as some teach us, and it may in a negative
manner be true that the Christian religion is an efficient
in the condemnation of sinners, and loses more than it
saves, which is impious but to imagine. On the other
hand, if all those nations are included under the sentence
of eternal absence from God, which is hell in the
abstract, then what becomes of all the sceptical doc-
trines of its being inconsistent with the mercy and
goodness of an infinite and beneficent Being to condemn
so great a part of the world, for not believing in Him of
whom they never had any knowledge or instruction?
But I desire not to be the promoter of unanswerable
doubts in matters of religion; much less would I
promote cavils at the foundations of religion, either as
to its profession or practice, and therefore I only name
things. I return to my inquiry after religion as we
generally understand the word.
And in this I confine myself in my present inquiries
to the particular nations professing the Christian religion
only; and I shall take notice afterward what influence
the want of religion has upon the manners, the genius,
and the capacities of the people, as to all the improvable
parts of human knowledge.
The Moors of Barbary are Mahometans, and that
of the most unpolished and degenerate sort, especially
of that part of the world where they live; they are
cruel as beasts, vicious, insolent, and inhuman as de-
generated nature can make them: moral virtues have
so little recommended themselves to any among them,
that they are accounted no accomplishment, and are in r
no esteem; nor is a man at all respected for being
grave, sober, judicious, or wise, or for being just in his
dealings, or most easy in his conversation; but rapine
and injury is the custom of the place, and it is to
recommend a great man that he is rich, powerful in
slaves, merciless in his government of them, and im-
periously haughty in his whole household. Every man
is a king within himself, and regards neither justice or
mercy, humanity or civility, either to those above him
or those below him, but just as his arbitrary passions
guide him.
Religion here is confined to the biram and the
ramadan, the feast and the fast, to the mosque and the
bath; reading the Alcoran on one hand, and performing
the washings and purifications on the other, make up
their religious exercises; and for the rest, conversation
is eaten up with barbarisms and brutish customs; so
that there is neither society, humanity, confidence in
one another, or conversation with one another; but
men live like the wild beasts, for every man here really
would destroy and devour the other if he could.
This guided me to a just reflection, in honour of the
Christian religion, which I have often since made use
of, and which on this occasion I will make a digression
to, viz., that it is to be said for the reputation of the
Christian religion in general, and by which it is justly
distinguished from all other religions, that wherever
Christianity has been planted or professed nationally
in the world, even where it has not had a saving
influence, it has yet had a civilising influence. It
has operated upon the manners, the morals, the politics,
and even the tempers and dispositions of the people;
it has reduced them to the practice of virtue, and to
the true methods of living; has weaned them from the
barbarous customs they had been used to, infusing a
kind of humanity and softness of disposition into their very natures; civilising and softening them, teaching
them to love a regularity of life, and filling them with
principles of generous kindness and beneficence one to
another; in a word, it has taught them to live like men,
and act upon the foundations of clemency, humanity,
love, and good neighbourhood, suitable to the nature
and dignity of God's image, and to the rules of justice
and equity, which it instructs them in.
Nay, farther, I must observe also, that as the
Christian religion has worn out, or been removed from
any country, and they have returned to heathenism
and idolatry, so the barbarisms have returned, the
customs of the heathen nations have been again restored,
the very nature and temper of the people have been
again lost, all their generous principles have forsaken
them, the softness and goodness of their dispositions
have worn out, and they have returned to cruelty,
inhumanity, rapine, and blood.
It is true, and it may be named as an objection to
this remark of mine, that the Romans though heathens,
and the Grecians by the study of philosophy in par-
ticular persons, and by the excellency of their govern-
ment in their general or national capacity, were filled
with notions of virtue and honour, with most generous
and just principles, and acted with an heroic mind on
many occasions; practising the most sublime and ex-
alted height of virtue, such as sacrificing their lives for
their country with the utmost zeal; descending to
great examples of humanity and beneficence, scorning
to do base or vile actions, as unworthy the Roman
name, to save their lives; and a great many most
excellent examples of virtue and gallantry are found
in the histories of the Roman Empire.
This does not oppose, or rather indeed illustrates,
what I say; for with all the philosophy, all the
humanity and generosity they practised, they had yet III. H
their remains of barbarity, were cruel and unmerciful
in their natures, as appeared by the barbarity of their
customs, such as throwing malefactors to wild beasts,
the fightings of their gladiators, and the like; which
were not only appointed as punishments and severities
by the order of public justice, but to show it touched
the very article I am upon, it was the subject of their
sport and diversion, and these things were exhibited
as shows to entertain the ladies; the cutting in pieces
forty or fifty slaves, and the seeing twenty or thirty
miserable creatures thrown to the lions and tigers, was
no less pleasant to them than the going to see an opera,
a masquerade, or a puppet-show is to us; so that I think
the Romans were very far from a people civilised and
softened in their natures by the influences of religion.
And this is evident because that as the Christian reli-
gion came among them, all those cruel customs were
abhorred by them, the famous theatres and circles for
their public sports were overthrown, and the ruins of
them testify the justice of my observation at this very
day.
Nor will it be denied if I should carry this yet
farther, and observe, that even among Christians, those
who are reformed, and farther and farther Chris-
tianised, are still in proportion rendered more human,
more soft and tender; and we do find, without being
partial to ourselves, that even the Protestant countries
are much distinguished in the humanity and softness
of their tempers; the meek, merciful disposition ex-
tends more among Protestants than among the Papists,
as I could very particularly demonstrate from history
and experience.
But to return back to the Moors, where I left off;
they are an instance of that cruelty of disposition which
was anciently in their nature, and how in a country
abandoned of the true Christian religion, after it has been first planted and professed among them, the return
of heathenism or Mahometanism has brought back with
it all the barbarisms of a nation void of religion and good
nature.
I saw enough of these dreadful people to think them
at this time the worst of all the nations of the world;
a nation where no such thing as a generous spirit, or a
temper with any compassion mixed with it, is to be
found; among whom Nature appears stripped of all the
additional glories which it derives from religion, and
yet whereon a Christian flourishing church had stood
several hundred years.
From these I went among the negroes of Africa;
many of them I saw without any the least notion of a
Deity among them, much less any form of worship;
but I had not any occasion to converse with them on
shore, other than I have done since by accident, but
went away to the Brazils. Here I found the natives,
and that even before the Portuguese came among them,
and since also, had abundance of religion, such as it
was; but it was all so bloody, so cruel, consisting of
murders, human sacrifices, witchcrafts, sorceries, and
conjurings, that I could not so much as call them honest
pagans, as I do the negroes.
As for the cannibals, as I have observed in the dis-
course of them, on account of their landing on my
island, I can say but very little of them. As to their
eating human flesh, I take it to be a kind of martial
rage rather than a civil practice, for it is evident they
eat no human creatures but such as are taken prisoners
in their battles, and, as I have observed in giving the
account of those things, they do not esteem it murder,
no, nor so much as unlawful. I must confess, saving
its being a practice in itself unnatural, especially to us,
I say, saving that part, I see little difference between
that and our way, which in the war is frequent in heat of action, viz., refusing quarter; for as to the difference
between eating and killing those that offer to yield, it
matters not much. And this I observed at the same
time, that in their other conduct those savages were as
human, as mild, and gentle as most I have met with in
the world, and as easily civilised.
From these sorts of people I come to the Indians;
for as to the Madagascar men, I saw very little of them,
but that they were a kind of negroes, much like those
on the coast of Guinea, only a little more used and
accustomed to the Europeans by their often landing
among them.
The East Indians are generally pagans or Maho-
metans, and have such mixtures of savage customs with
them, that even Mahometanism is there in its corrup-
tion; neither have they there the upright just dealing,
in matters of right and wrong, which the Turks in
Europe have, with whom 'tis generally very safe trading,
but here they act all the parts of thieves and cheats,
watching to deceive you, and proud of being thought
able to do it.
The subjects of the Great Mogul have a seeming
polite government, and the inhabitants of Ceylon are
under very strict discipline, and yet what difficulty do
we find to trade with them? Nay, their very economy
renders them fraudulent, and in some places they cannot
turn their thoughts to being honest.
China is famous for wisdom, that is to say, that they,
having such a boundless conceit of their own wisdom,
we are obliged to allow them more than they have; the
truth is, they are justly said to be a wise nation among
the foolish ones, and may as justly be called a nation
of fools among the wise ones.
As to their religion, 'tis all summed up in Confu-
cius's maxims, whose theology I take to be a rhapsody
of moral conclusions; a foundation, or what we may 
call elements of polity, morality, and superstition,
huddled together in a rhapsody of words, without
consistency, and, indeed, with very little reasoning in
it; then 'tis really not so much as a refined paganism,
for there are, in my opinion, much more regular doings
among some of the Indians that are pagans, in America,
than there are in China; and if I may believe the
account given of the government of Montezuma in
Mexico, and of the Uncas of Cusco in Peru, their
worship and religion, such as it was, was carried on
with more regularity than these in China. As to the
human ingenuity, as they call it, of the Chinese, I shall
account for it by itself. The utmost discoveries of it
to me appeared in the mechanics, and even in them
infinitely short of what is found among the European
nations.
But let us take these people to pieces a little, and
examine into the great penetration they are so famed for.
First of all, their knowledge has not led them that
length in religious matters which the common notions
of philosophy would have done, and to which they did
lead the wise heathens of old among the Grecian and
Roman Empires, for they, having not the knowledge of
the true God, preserved, notwithstanding, the notion of
a God to be something immortal, omnipotent, sublime;
exalted above in place as well as authority, and there-
fore made heaven to be the seat of their gods, and the
images by which they represented their gods and god-
desses had always some perfections that were really to
be admired as the attendants of their gods, as Jupiter
was called the Thunderer for his power, father of gods
and men, for his seniority; Venus, adored for her
beauty; Mercury for swiftness; Apollo for wit, poetry,
music; Mars for terror and gallantry in arms, and the
like. But when we come to these polite nations of China, which yet we cry up for sense and greatness of genius, we see them grovelling in the very sink and filth
of idolatry; their idols are the most frightful monstrous
shapes, not the form of any real creature, much less the
images of virtue, of chastity, of literature, but horrid
shapes, of their priests' invention; neither hellish or
human monsters, composed of invented forms, with
neither face or figure, but with the utmost distortions,
formed neither to walk, stand, fly, or go, neither to
hear, see, or speak, but merely to instil horrible ideas of
something nauseous and abominable into the minds of
men that adored them.
If I may be allowed to give my notions of worship,
I mean as it relates to the objects of natural homage,
where the name and nature of God is not revealed, as
in the Christian religion, I must acknowledge the sun,
the moon, the stars, the elements, as in the pagan and
heathen nations of old; and above all these, the
representations of superior virtues and excellences
among men, such as valour, fortitude, chastity,
patience, beauty, strength, love, learning, wisdom,
and the like—the objects of worship in the Grecian
and Roman times — were far more eligible and more
rational objects of Divine rights than the idols of
China and Japan, where, with all the economy of
their State maxims and rules of civil government,
which we insist so much on as tests of their wisdom,
their great capacities and understandings, their worship
is the most brutish, and the objects of their worship
the coarsest, the most unmanly, inconsistent with
reason or the nature of religion, of any the world
can show; bowing down to a mere hobgoblin, and
doing their reverence not to the work of men's hands
only, but the ugliest, basest, frightfullest things that
man could make; images so far from being lovely and
amiable, as in the nature of worship is implied, that they
are the most detestable and nauseous, even to nature.
How is it possible these people can have any claim
to the character of wise, ingenious, polite, that could
suffer themselves to be overwhelmed in an idolatry
repugnant to common-sense, even to nature, and be
brought to choose to adore that which was in itself
the most odious and contemptible to nature; not
merely terrible, that so their worship might proceed
from fear, but a complication of nature's aversions?
I cannot omit, that being in one of their temples, or
rather in a kind of oratory or chapel, annexed to one
part of the great palace at Peking, there appeared a
mandarin with his attendants, or, as we may say, a
great lord and his retinue, prostrate before the image,
not of any one of God's creatures, but a creature of
mere human forming, such as neither was alive, nor
was like anything that had life, or had ever been seen
or heard of in the world.
The like image, or something worse, if I could give
it a true representation, may be found in a garden
chapel, if not defaced by wiser heads, of a great Tar-
tarian mandarin, at a small distance from Nanking, and
to which the poor abandoned creatures pay their most
blinded devotions.
It had a thing instead of a head, but no head; it
had a mouth distorted out of all manner of shape, and
not to be described for a mouth, being only an unshapen chasm, neither representing the mouth of a
man, beast, fowl, or fish; the thing was neither any
of the four, but an incongruous monster; it had feet,
hands, fingers, claws, legs, arms, wings, ears, horns,
everything mixed one among another, neither in the
shape or place that Nature appointed, but blended
together and fixed to a bulk, not a body, formed of
no just parts, but a shapeless trunk or log, whether of
wood or stone, I know not; a thing that might have
stood with any side forward, or any side backward, any end upward, or any end downward, that had as
much veneration due to it on one side as on the other
—a kind of celestial hedgehog, that was rolled up
within itself, and was everything every way; that to a
Christian could not have been worthy to have repre-
sented even the devil, and to men of common-sense
must have been their very soul's aversion. In a word,
if I have not represented their monstrous deities right,
let imagination supply anything that can make a mis-
shapen image horrid, frightful, and surprising; and
you may withjustice suppose those sagacious people
called the Chinese, whom, forsooth, we must admire—
I say, you may suppose them prostrate on the ground,
with all their pomp and pageantry, which is in itself
not a little, worshipping such a mangled, promiscuous-
gendered creature.
Shall we call these a wise nation who represent God
in such hideous, monstrous figures as these, and can
prostrate themselves to things ten thousand times more
disfigured than the devil? Had these images been
contrived in the Romans' time, and been set up for
the god of ugliness, as they had their god of beauty,
they might, indeed, have been thought exquisite, but
the Romans would have spurned such an image out of
their temples.
Nothing can render a nation so completely foolish
and simple as such an extravagance in matters of re-
ligious worship; for if gross ignorance in the notion
of a God, which is so extremely natural, will not demon-
strate a nation unpolished, foolish, and weak, even next
to idiotism, I know nothing that will.
But let me trace this wise nation that we talk so
much of, and who not only think themselves wise, but
have drawn us in to pay a kind of homage to their
low-prized wit.
Government and the mechanic arts are the two 
main things in which our people in England, who have
admired them so much, pretend they excel. As to
their government, which consists in an absolute tyranny,
which, by the way, is the easiest way of ruling in the
world where the people are disposed to obey as blindly
as the mandarin commands or governs imperiously,
what policy is required in governing a people of whom
it is said, that if you command them to hang them-
selves, they will only cry a little, and then submit
immediately? Their maxims of government may do
well enough among themselves, but with us they would
be all confusion. In their country it is not so, only
because whatever the mandarin says is a law, and God
Himself has no power or interest among them to con-
tradict it, unless He pleases to execute it brevi manu
from heaven.
Most of their laws consist in immediate judgment,
swift executions, just retaliations, and fair protection
from injuries. Their punishments are cruel and ex-
orbitant, such as cutting the hands and the feet off for
theft, at the same time releasing murders and other
flagrant crimes.
Their mandarins are their judges in very many cases,
like our justices of the peace; but then they judge
by customs, oral tradition, or immediate opinion, and
execute the sentence immediately,without room or
time to reflect upon the justice of it, or to consider
of mitigations, as in all Christian countries is practised,
and as the sense of human frailty would direct.
But let me come to their mechanics, in which their
ingenuity is so much cried up. I affirm there is little
or nothing sufficient to build the mighty opinion we
have of them upon, but what is founded upon the com-
parisons which we make between them and other pagan
nations, or proceeds from the wonder which we make
that they should have any knowledge of mechanic arts, r
/
because we find the remote inhabitants of Africa and
America so grossly ignorant and so entirely destitute in
such things; whereas we do not consider that the Chinese
inhabit the continent of Asia, and though they are
separated by deserts and wildernesses, yet they are a
continuous continent of land with the parts of the
world once inhabited by the politer Medes, Persians,
and Grecians; that the first ideas of mechanic arts
were probably received by them from the Persians,
Assyrians, and the banished transplanted Israelites,
who are said to be carried into the regions of Parthia
and the borders of Karakathie, from whence they are
also said to have communicated arts, and especially
handicraft, in which the Israelites excelled, to the
inhabitants of all those countries, and, consequently,
in time to those beyond them.
But let them be received from whom they will, and
how long ago soever, let us but compare the improve-
ment they have made with what others have made;
and, except in things peculiar to themselves, by their
climate, we shall find the utmost of their ingenuity
amounts but to a very trifle, and that they are outdone
even in the best of their works by our ordinary artists,
whose imitations exceed their originals beyond all com-
parison.
For example, they have gunpowder and guns,
whether they have learned to make them by direc-
tion of Europeans, which is most likely, or that they
found it out by mere strength of invention, as some
would advance, though without certainty, in their
favour — be it which it will, as I say, it matters not
much, their powder is of no strength for the needful
operations of sieges, mines, batteries, no, nor for shoot-
ing of birds, as ours is, without great quantities put
together; their guns are rather an ostentation than for
execution, clumsy, heavy, and ill-made; neither have 
they arrived to any tolerable degree of knowledge in
the art of gunnery or engineering. They have no bombs,
carcasses, hand-grenades; their artificial fireworks are
in no degree comparable or to be named with ours;
nor have they arrived to anything in the military skill
—in marshalling armies, handling arms, discipline, and
the exercise in the field — as the Europeans have; all
which is depending on the improvement of firearms,
&c., in which, if they have had the use of gunpowder
so many ages as some dream, they must be unaccount-
able blockheads that they have made no farther improve-
ment; and if it is but lately, they are yet apparently
dull enough in the managing of it, at least compared
to what ought to be expected of an ingenious people,
such as our people cry them up to be.
I might go from this to their navigation, in which
it is true they outdo most of their neighbours; but
what is all their skill in sailing compared to ours?
Whither do they go? and how manage the little and
foolish barks and junks they have? What would they
do with them to traverse the great Indian, American,
or Atlantic oceans? What ships, what sailors, what
poor, awkward, and ignorant doings are there among
them at sea! And when our people hire any of them,
as sometimes they are obliged to do, how do our sailors
kick them about, as a parcel of clumsy, ignorant, un-
handy fellows!
Then for building of ships, what are they? and
what are they able to do towards the glorious art of
building a large man-of-war? It is out of doubt with
me, that all the people of China could not build such
a ship as the "Royal Sovereign" in a hundred years;
no, not though she was there for them to look at and
take pattern by.
I might go on to abundance more things, such as
painting, making glasses, making clocks and watches, making bone-lace, frame-work knitting; all of which,
except the two first, they know little or nothing; and
of the two first nothing compared to what is done in
Europe.
The height of their ingenuity, and for which we
admire them with more colour of cause than in other
things, is their porcelain or earthenware work, which,
in a word, is more due to the excellent composition
of the earth they make them of, and which is their
peculiar, than to the workmanship; in which, if we
had the same clay, we should soon outdo them as much
as we do in other things. The next art is their manu-
facturing in fine silks, cotton, herba, gold, and silver,
in which they have nothing but what is in common
with our ordinary poor weavers.
The next mechanic art is their lacquering, which is
just, as in their China ware, a peculiar to their country,
in the materials, not at all in the workmanship; and as
for the cabinet-work of it they are manifestly outdone
by us; and abundance is every year sent thither framed
and made in England, and only lacquered in China, to
be returned to us. I might run the like parallel through most of the
things these people excel in, which would all appear to
be so deficient as would render all their famed wisdom
and capacity most scandalously imperfect. But I am
not so much upon their cunning in arts as upon their
absurdity and ridiculous folly in religious matters, and
in which I think the rudest barbarians outdo them.
From this wise nation we have a vast extent of
ground, near two thousand miles in breadth, partly
under the Chinese government, partly under the Mus-
covite, but inhabited by Tartars of Mongol Tartary,
Karakathie, Siberian, and Samoiedes pagans, whose
idols are almost as hideous as the Chinese's, and whose
religion is all Nature — and not only so, but Nature under 
the greatest degeneracy, and next to brutal. Father le
Comte gives us the pictures of some of their house idols,
and an account of their worship; and this lasts, as I have
observed, to within a few days of Archangel. So that,
in a word, from the mouth of the Straits, that is to say,
from Sallee over to Caribbee, from thence round Africa
by the Cape of Good Hope, across the vast Indian
Ocean, and upon all the coast of it, about by Malacca
and Sumatra, through the straits of Singapore and the
coast of Siam northwards to China, and through China
by land over the deserts of the Grand Tartary to the
river Dwina, being a circuit three times the diameter
of the earth, and every jot as far as the whole circum-
ference, the name of God is not heard of, except
among a few of the Indians that are Mahometans;
the Word of God is not known, or the Son of God
spoken of.
Having some warmth in my search after religion,
occasioned by this reflection, and so little of it appear-
ing in all the parts which I had travelled, I resolved
to travel over the rest of the world in books, for my
wandering days are pretty well over; I say, I resolved
to travel the rest in books; and sure, said I, there
must appear abundance of serious religion in the rest
of the world, or else I know nothing at all of where I
shall find it.
But I find by my reading, just as I did in travelling,
that all the customs of nations, as to religion, were
much alike; that, one with another, they are more
devout in their worship of something, whatever it be,
than inquisitive after what it is they worship; and
most of the altars of worship in the world might to
this day be inscribed to the unknown God.
This may seem a strange thing; but that wonder
may cease when further inquiry is made into the par-
ticular objects of worship which the several nations of the world bow down to, some of which are so horrid,
so absurd, as one would think human nature could not
sink so low as to do her homage in so irrational a
manner.
And here, being to speak of religion as idolatrous,
it occurs to me that it seemed strange that, except in
Persia and some part of Tartary, I found none of the
people look up for their gods, but down; by which it
came into my mind that, even in idolatry itself, the
world was something degenerated, and their reason was
more hoodwinked than their ancestors'.
By looking up and looking down, I mean, they do
not, as the Romans, look up among the stars for their
idols, place their gods in the skies, and worship, as we
might say, like men, but look down among the brutes,
form idols to themselves out of the beasts, and figure
things like monsters, to adore them for their ugliness
and horrible deformity.
Of the two, the former, in my opinion, was much
the more rational idolatry, as particularly the Persians
worshipping the sun; and when I had a particular ac-
count of that of Bengal, it presently occurred to my
thoughts that there was something awful, something
glorious and godlike in the sun, that, in the ignorance
of the true God, might rationally bespeak the homage
of the creatures; and to whom it seemed reasonable,
where reason was its own judge only, without the helps
of Revelation, to pay an adoration as the parent of
light, and the giver of life to all the vegetative world,
and as in a visible manner enlivening and influencing
the rational and sensitive life, and which might, for
aught they knew, at first create, as it did since so
plainly affect, all things round us.
This thought gave birth to the following excursion,
with which I shall close this observation:
Hail 1 glorious lamp, the parent of the day,
Whose beams not only heat and life convey;
But may that heat and life, for aught we know,
On many, many distant worlds bestow.
Immense, amazing globe of heavenly fire. To whom all flames ascend, in whom all lights expire,
Rolling in flames, emits eternal ray,
Yet self-sufficient suffers no decay.
Thy central vigour never, never dies,
But life the motion, motion life supplies,
When lesser bodies rob us of thy beams,
And intercept thy flowing, heavenly streams;
Fools by mistake eclipse thee from their sight, When 'tis the eyes eclipsed, and not thy light.
Thy absence constitutes effectual night
When rolling earth deprives us of thy light;
And planets all opaque and beggarly,
Borrow thy beams, and strive to shine like thee;
In their mock, lifeless light we starve and freeze,
And wait the warmth of thy returning rays.
Thy distance leaves us all recline and sad,
And hoary winter governs in thy stead:
Swift thy returning vigour, warm and mild,
Salutes the earth, and gets the world with child.
Great soul of nature, from whose vital spring
Due heat and life diffused through everything:
Govern'st the moon and stars by different ray, \
She queen of night, thee monarch of the day, The moon, and stars, and earth, and plants obey. When darker nations see thee placed on high,
And feel thy warmth their genial heat supply;How imperceptible thy influence
Slides through their veins, and touches every sense;By glimmering nature led, they bow their knee,
Mistake their God, and sacrifice to thee,
Mourn thy declining steps, and hate the night,
But when in hope of thy approaching light,
Bless thy return, which brings the cheerful day,
And to thy wond'rous light false adorations pay.
Nor can we blame the justice of the thought,
In minds by erring reason only taught.
Nature, it seems, instructs a deity,
And reason says there's none so bright as thee.
Nor is thy influence so much a jest,
There's something shocks our nature in the rest:To make a God, and then the tool adore,
And bow to that that worshipped us before.
The nonsense takes off all the reverence,
That can't be worshipping that is not sense.
'
But when the spring of Nature shows its face, The glory of its rays, the swiftness of its race, Stupendous height and majesty divine, And with what awful splendour it can shine, Who that no other news from heaven could hear, }
Would think but this was God, would think and fear, J.
No other idol ever came so near. J
Certain it is that the Persians, who thus paid their
adoration to the sun, were at that time some of the
wisest people in the world. Some tell us that the
great image that Nebuchadnezzar set up for all his
people to worship, was represented holding the sun in
his right hand; and that it was to the representation
of the sun that he commanded all nations and kindreds
to bow and to worship. If so, then the Assyrians
were worshippers also of the sun as well as the Per-
sians, which is not at all improbable. We read also in
the Scripture of those nations who worshipped all the
host of heaven, a thing much more rational, and nearer
of kin to worshipping the great God of heaven than
worshipping the whole host of the earth, and worship-
ping the most abject and loathsome creatures, or but
even the representations of those creatures, which was
still worse than the other.
But what are all the absurdities of heathenism, which
at last are resolved into the degeneracy of mankind, and
their being fallen from the knowledge of the true God,
which was once, as we have reason to believe, diffused
to all mankind? I say, what are these? And how
much ground for just reflection do they afford us,
compared to the gross things in practice which we find
every day among those nations who profess to have had
the clear light of Gospel revelation?
How many self-contradicting principles do they
hold? How contrary to their profession do they act?
How does one side burn for what another side abhors?
And how do Christians, taking that venerable name for a general appellation, doom one another to the devil for
a few disagreeing clauses of the same religion, while all
profess to worship the same Deity, and to expect the
same salvation?
With what preposterous enthusiasms do some mingle
their knowledge, and with as gross absurdities others
their devotion? How blindly superstitious; how
furious and raging in their zeal? How cruel, inexor-
able, and even inhuman and barbarous to one another,
when they differ? as if religion divested us of humanity,
and that in our worshipping a God of mercy, and in
whose compassions alone it is that we have room to
hope, we should, to please and serve Him, banish
humanity from our nature, and show no compassion
to those that fall into our hands.
In my travelling through Portugal, it was my lot to
come to Lisbon while they held there one of their courts
of justice called Auto-de-fe, that is to say, a court of
justice of the Inquisition. It is a subject which has
been handled by many writers, and indeed exposed by
some of the best Catholics; and my present business is
not to write a history, or engage in a dispute, but to
relate a passage.
They carried in procession all their criminals to the
great church, where eight of them appeared first,
dressed up in gowns and caps of canvas, upon which
were painted all that man could devise of hell's torments,
devils broiling and roasting human bodies, and a
thousand such frightful things, with flames and devils
besides in every part of the dress.
Those I found were eight poor creatures condemned
to be burnt, and for they scarce knew what, but for
crimes against the Catholic faith, and against the blessed
Virgin, and they were burnt. One of them, it was
said, rejoiced that he was to be burnt, and being asked
why, answered that he had much rather die than be III. 1
carried back to the prison of the Inquisition, where
their cruelties were worse than death. Of those eight,
as I was told, some were Jews, whose greatest crime,
as many there did not scruple to say, was that they
were very rich; and some Christians were in the
number at the same time, whose greatest misery was
that they were very poor.
It was a sight that almost gave me a shock in my
notion of Christianity itself, till I began to recollect
that it might be possible that Inquisitors were scarce
Christians, and that I knew many Catholic countries
do not suffer this abominable judicature to be erected
among them.
I have seen much, and read more, of the unhappy
conduct, in matters of religion, among the other nations
of the world professing the Christian religion; and
upon my word I find some practices infinitely scandal-
ous, some which are the common received customs of
Christians, which would be the abhorrence of heathens;
and it requires a strong attachment to the foundation,
which is indeed the principal part in religion, to guard
our minds against being offended even at the Christian
religion itself, but I got over that part afterward.
Let it not offend the ears of any true lover of the
Christian religion that I observe some of the follies of
the professors of the Christian religion, assuring you
'tis far from being my design to bring the least scandal
upon the profession itself.
And here, therefore, let me give the words of a
judicious person who travelled from Turkey through
Italy. His words are these :—
"When I was in Italy I ranged over great part of
the patrimony of St. Peter, where one would think,
indeed, the face of religion would be plainest to be
seen, and without any disguise; but, in short, I found
there the face of religion, and no more.
"At Rome there was all the pomp and glory of
religious habits: the Pope and the cardinals walked
with a religious gravity, but lived in a religious luxury,
kept up the pomp of religion and the dignity of religious
titles; but, like our Lord's observation on the Pharisees,
I found within they were all ravening wolves.
"The religious justice they do there is particularly
remarkable, and very much recommends them. The
Church protects murderers and assassins, and then
delivers the civil magistrates over to Satan for doing
justice. They interdict whole kingdoms, and shut up
the churches for want of paying a few ecclesiastic dues,
and so put a stop to religion for want of their money.
I found the courtesans were the most constant creatures
at the church, and the most certain place for an assigna-
tion with another man's wife was at prayers.
"The Court of Inquisition burnt two men for
speaking dishonourably of the blessed Virgin, and the
missionaries in China tolerated the worshipping the
devil by their new convert. A Jew was likewise
burnt for denying Christ, while the Jesuits joined the
paganism of the heathen with the high mass, and sung
anthems to the immortal idols of Tonquin.
"When I saw this I resolved to inquire no more
after religion in Italy, till by accident meeting with a
quietist, he gave me to understand that all religion was
internal, that the duties of Christianity were summed up
in reflection and ejaculation. He inveighed bitterly
against the game of religion which he said was playing
over the world by the clergy; and said Italy was a
theatre, where religion was the grand opera, and the
Popish clergy were the stage players. I liked him in
many of his notions about other people's religion; but
when I came to talk with him a little closely about his
own, it was so wrapped up in his internals, concealed in
the cavities and dark parts of the soul, viz., meditation without worship, doctrine without practice, reflection
without reformation, and zeal without knowledge, that
I could come to no certainty with him but in this, that
religion in Italy was really invisible."
This was very agreeable to my notions of Italian
religion, and to what I had met with from other people
that had travelled the country, but one observation of
blindness and superstition I must give within my own
knowledge, and nearer home. When passing through
Flanders I found the people in a certain city there in
a very great commotion. The case was this. A
certain scelerate (so they call an abandoned wretch
given up to all wickedness) had broken into a chapel
in the city, and had stolen the pix or casket wherein
the sacred host was deposited; which host, after rightly
consecrated, they believe to be the real body of our
blessed Saviour, being transubstantiated, as they call it,
from the substance of bread.
The fact being discovered, the city, as I said above,
was all up in a tumult; the gates were shut up, nobody
suffered to go out, every house was searched, and the
utmost diligence used; and at length, as it was next to
impossibility he should escape, he was discovered.
His execution was not long deferred. But first he
was examined, and I think by torture, what he had
done with the sacred thing which was in the pix,
which he had stolen? And at length he confessed
that he had thrown it into a house of office, and was
carried with a guard to show them the place.
As it was impossible to find a little piece of a wafer
in such a place, though no pains were spared in a most
filthy manner to search for it; but, as I say, it could
not be found; immediately the place was judged con-
secrated ipso facto, turned into an oratory, and the
devout people flocked to it to expiate, by their prayers,
the dishonour done to the Lord God by throwing His precious body into so vile a place. It was determined
by the wiser part that the body would not fall down
into the place, but be snatched up by its inherent
power, or by the holy angels, and not be suffered to
touch the excrements in that place. However, the
people continued their devotions for some time just in
the place where it was, and afterwards a large chapel
was built upon it, where the same prayers are con-
tinued, as I suppose, to this day.
I had a particular occasion to come at a very ac-
curate account of Poland by a Polish gentleman, in
whose company I travelled, and from whom I learned
all that was worth inquiring of about religious affairs in
Prussia on one side and Muscovy on the other.
As for Poland, he told me they were all confusion
both in Church and in State; that notwithstanding their
wars they were persecutors of the worst kind, that they
let the Jews live among them undisturbed to such a
degree, that in the country about Lemburg and Kiow
there were reckoned above 30,000 Jews; that these
had not toleration only but many privileges granted
them, though they denied Christ to be the Messiah,
or that the Messiah was come in the flesh, and blas-
phemed His name upon frequent occasions; and at
the same time they persecuted the Protestants, and
destroyed their churches, wherever they had power to
do it.
On the other hand, when I came to inquire of those
Protestants, and what kind of people they were who
suffered so severely for their religion, I found they were
generally a sort of Protestants called Socinians, and that
Lelius Socinus had spread his errors so universally over
this country that our Lord Jesus Christ was reduced
here to little more than a good man sent from heaven
to instruct the world, and far from capable of effecting
by the influence of His Spirit and grace the glorious work of redeeming the world. As for the divinity of
the Holy Ghost, they have no trouble about it.
Having given this account of knowledge and piety
in the countries inhabited by Christians of the Roman
Church, it seems natural to say something of the Greek
Church.
There are in the Czar of Muscovy's dominions abun-
dance of wooden churches, and had not the country
been as full of wooden priests something might have
been said for the religion of the Muscovites, for the
people are wonderfully devout there; which would
have been very well, if it had not been attended with
the profoundest ignorance that was ever heard of in
any country where the name of Christian was so much
as talked of. But when I came to inquire about their worship,
I found our Lord Jesus Christ made so much a
meaner figure among them than St. Nicholas that I
concluded religion was swallowed up of superstition,
and so indeed I found it was upon all occasions: as to
the conduct of the people in religious matters, their
ignorance is so established upon obstinacy, which is
the Muscovite's national sin, that it would be really to
no purpose to look any longer for a reformation among
them.
In short, no man will, I believe, say of me that I
do the Muscovites any wrong when I say they are the
most ignorant and most obstinate people in the Christian
world, when I tell the following story of them.
It was after the battle at Narva, where the late King
of Sweden, Charles XII., defeated their great army,
and after the victory extended his troops pretty far into
their country, and perhaps plundered them a little as
he advanced; when the Muscovites, we may be sure,
being in the utmost distress and confusion, fell to their
prayers. We read of nothing they had to say to God Almighty in that case; but to their patron saint they
addressed this extraordinary prayer:
"O thou, our perpetual comforter in all our adver-
sities! thou infinitely powerful St. Nicholas, by what
sin, and how have we highly offended thee in our
sacrifices, genuflections, reverences, and actions of
thanksgiving, that thou hast thus forsaken us? We
had therefore sought to appease thee entirely, and we
had implored thy presence and thy succour against the
terrible, insolent, dreadful, enraged, and undaunted
enemies and destroyers; when, like lions, bears, and
other savage beasts that have lost their young ones, they
attacked us after an insolent and terrible manner; and
terrified and wounded, took and killed us by thousands,
us who are thy people. Now, as it is impossible that
this should happen without witchcraft and enchantment,
seeing the great care that we had taken to fortify our-
selves, after an impregnable manner, for the defence and
security of thy name, we beseech thee, O St. Nicholas,
to be our champion, and the bearer of our standard, to
be with us both in peace and in war, and in our neces-
sities, and at the time of our death, to protect us against
this horrible and tyrannical crew of sorcerers, and to
drive them far enough off from our frontiers, with the
recompense which they may deserve."
It may be hoped I may give a better account of
religion among the Protestants than I have among the
Roman and Grecian Churches; and I will, if in justice
it is possible.
The next to the nations I have been mentioning, I
mean in geographical order, are those reformed Christians
called Lutherans; to say no worse of them, the face
of religion indeed is altered much between these and
the latter. But I scarce know what name to give it,
at least as far as I have inquired into it, or what it is
like. -^
It was Popery and no Popery; there was the consub.
but not the transub. The service differed indeed from
the mass, but the deficiency seemed to be made up very
much with the trumpets, kettle-drums, fiddles, haut-
boys, &c., and all the merry part of the Popish de-
votion; upon which it occurred to me presently, that if
there was no danger of Popery among the Lutherans,
there was danger of superstition; and as for the pious
part, I saw very little of it in either of them.
By religion, therefore, the reader is desired to under-
stand here not the principles upon which the several
nations denominate themselves, so much as the manner
in which they discover themselves to be sincere in the
profession which they make. I had no inclination
here to enter into the inquiry after the creeds which
every nation professed to believe, but the manner in
which they practised that religion which they really
professed; for what is religion to me without practice?
And although it may be true that there can be no true
religion where it is not professed upon right principles;
yet, that which I observe here, and which to me is the
greatest grievance among Christians, is the want of a
religious practice even where there are right principles
at bottom, and where there is a profession of the
orthodox faith.
In brief, I am not hunting after the profession of
religion, but the practice. The first I find almost in
every nation—nulla gens tarn barbara; but the last I am
like to travel through the histories of all Christendom
with my search, and perhaps may hardly be able, when
I have done, to tell you where it is.
All the satire of this inquiry will look this way; for
where God has not given a people the blessing of a true
knowledge of Himself, it would call for our pity, not
reproach. It would be a very dull satire indeed that a
man should be witty upon the negroes in Africa for not 
knowing Christ, and not understanding the doctrine of
a Saviour; but if turning to our modern Christians of
Barbadoes and Jamaica for not teaching them, not in-
structing them, and for refusing to baptize them, there
the satire would be pointed and seasonable, as we shall
hear farther by-and-by.
But to return to the Lutherans, for there I am sup-
posed to be at this time, I mean, among the courts and
cities of Brandenburg, Saxony, &c.,— I had oppor-
tunity here to view a court affecting gallantry, magni-
ficence, and gay things, to such a height, and with
such a passion, to exceed the whole world in that empty
part of human felicity called show, that I thought
it was impossible to pursue it with such an impetuous
torrent of the affections without sacrificing all things
to it which wise men esteem more valuable.
Nor was my notion wrong; for the first thing I
found sacrificed, as I say, to this voluptuous humour
was the liberties of the people, who being by constitution
or custom rather under absolute government, and at the
arbitrary will of the prince, are sure to pay, not all they
can spare, but even all they have, to gratify the un-
bounded appetite of a court given up to pleasure and
exorbitance.
By all I have read of the manner of living there,
both court and people, the latter are entirely given up
to the former, not by necessity only, but by the consent
of custom and the general way of management through
the whole country; nay, this is carried to such a height
that, as I have been told, the king's coffers are the
general cesspool of the nations, whither all the money
of the kingdoms flows, and only disperses again as that
gives it out — whether by running over or running out
at its proper vent, I do not inquire; so that as all the
blood in the human body circulates in twenty-four hours
through the ventricles of the heart, so all the money in the kingdom is said to pass once a year through the
king's treasury.
How far poverty and misery may prompt piety and
devotion among the poor inhabitants, I cannot say; but
if luxury and gallantry, together with tyranny and
oppression to support it, can subsist with true religion
in the great men, then, for aught I know, the courts of
Prussia and Dresden may be the best qualified in the
world to produce this thing called religion, which, I
have hitherto seen, is hard to be found.
It is true, that the magnificence of the wisest king in
the world in Jerusalem was esteemed the felicity of his
people; but it seems to be expressed very elegantly, not
as a testimony of his glory only, but of the flourishing
condition of his people at the same time, under the
prosperous circumstances which his reign brought them
to, viz., that he made gold to be for plenty like the
stones in the streets, amply expressing the flourishing
condition of his people under him.
I have likewise read, indeed, and heard much of the
same kind of the King of Prussia, and that even from
his own subjects, who were always full of the generous
and truly royal qualities of that prince; he was the first
king of the country, which before was a dukedom or
electorate only. The sum of their discourse is, that
his majesty was so true a father of his country and of
his people, that his whole care was the flourishing of
their trade, establishing their manufactures, increasing
their numbers, planting foreigners—French, Swiss, and
other nations — among them to instruct and encourage
them; and being no way accessory to any of their
oppressions, but relieving and redressing all their griev-
ances as often and as soon as they came to his know-
ledge; and, indeed, I could not but entertain a great
regard to the character of so just and good a prince.
But all I could infer from that was, that a government 
may be tyrannical, and yet the king not be a tyrant;
but the grievances to the people are oftentimes much
the same. And every administration, where the con-
stitution is thus stated, as it seems to be in most, if not
all of the northern courts, Protestant as well as others,
seems inconsistent with the true ends of government;
the thing we call government was certainly established
for the prosperity of the people; whereas, on the con-
trary, in all those German courts, where I have made
my observations, the magnificence of the court and the
prosperity of the people stand like the two poles; what
excess of light you see at one is exactly balanced by
so much darkness at the other.
And where, pray, is the religion of all this? that a
whole nation of people should appear miserable that
their governors may appear gay; the people starve, that
the prince may be fed; or rather, the people be lean,
that their sovereign may be fat; the subjects sigh, that
he may laugh; be empty, that he may be full; and all
this for mere luxury, not for the needful defence of the
government — resisting enemies, preserving the public
peace, and the like, but for mere extravagance, luxury,
and magnificence, as in Prussia; or for ambition, and
pushing at crowns, and the lust of domination, as in
Saxony.
But to come back to the religious transactions of
these countries: how are the ecclesiastics, jealous of
their hierarchy, afraid to reform farther lest, as they
gave a mortal stab to the perquisites and vails of God
Almighty's service in the Romish Church, modern re-
formation might give the like to them i For this reason
they set a pale about their Church, and there, as well as
in other places, they cry to their neighbours, "Stand
off, I am holier than thou;" and with what persecution
and invasion — persecuting for religion, and invading the
principles of one another. If there was any peace '
'
among them, it was that only which passes all under-
standing. It presently occurred to me, what charity
can here be where there is no peace? and what religion
where there is no charity? And I began to fear I
should find little of what I looked for in those odd
climates.
I had travelled personally through the heart of
France, where I had occasion to look round me often
enough in my route from the foot of the Pyrenean
mountains to Toulouse, from thence to Paris and
Calais. Here I found the people so merry and yet
so miserable, that I knew not where to make any judg-
ment. The poverty of the poor was so great that it
seemed to leave them no room to sigh for anything but
their burdens, or to pray for anything but bread. But
the temper of the people was so volatile, that I thought
they went always dancing to church and came singing
out of it.
I found a world of teachers here, but nobody
taught. The streets were everywhere full of priests,
and the churches full of women; but as for religion,
I found most of the clergy were so far from having
much of it, that few of them knew what it was.
Never surely was a nation so full of truly blind
guides; for nothing can be more grossly ignorant of
religion than many of their clergy are, nothing more
void of morals than many of those to whom other
people go to confess their sins.
I made some inquiry about religion; and among
the rest I happened to fall in company with a good
honest Huguenot incognito; and he told me very
honestly that the state of religion in France stood
thus: First, that for some years ago it was put to
the test by the king, and that was when the edicts
came out to banish and ruin the Huguenots; "At
which time," said he, "we thought there had been a great deal of religion in it; but really, when it came
to the push," said he, "it was hard to tell where we
should find it. The persecution, as it was thought
at first, would be ingrateful to the more religious
Roman Catholics, and that some would be found too
good to do the drudgery of the devil. But we were
mistaken; the best fell in with persecution when it was
done by other hands and not their own, and those
that would not do it acknowledged they rejoiced that
it was done; which showed," said he, "that the
Catholics either had no principle, or acted against
principle, which is much as one. And as for us
Huguenots," says he, "we have shown that we have
no religion lost among us; for, first, some run away
for their religion and yet left it behind them, and we
that stayed behind did it at the price of our principles.
For now," says he, "we are mere hypocrites, neither
Papists nor Huguenots, for we go to mass with Pro-
testant hearts; and while we call ourselves Protestants,
we bow in the house of Rimmon." —" Where, then,"
said I, "is the religion once boasted of here to be
found?" —"Indeed," said he, "it is hard to tell you,
and except a little that is in the galleys, I can give you
no good account of it." This, indeed, was confining
the remains of a flourishing church to about 350 con-
fessors, who really suffered martyrdom for it — for it
was no less. So I minuted down French religion
tugging at the oar, and would have come away.
But it came into my thought to ask him what he
meant by telling me that those who run away for their
religion out of France left most of it behind them?
He answered, I should judge of it better if I observed
them when I came into my own country; where, if
I found they lived better than other people, or showed
anything of religion suitable to a people that suffered
persecution for their profession, I should send word of it; for he had heard quite otherwise of them, which
was the reason why he and thousands of others did
not follow them.
It happened, while I was warm in my inquiries thus
after religion, a proclamation came out in London for
appointing a general thanksgiving for a great victory
obtained by the English forces and their confederates
over the French at [Ramillies]. I care not to put
names to the particular times of things.
I started at the noise when they cried it in the
streets. Ah! said I, then I have found it at last;
and I rejoiced, in particular, that having looked so
much abroad for religion I should find it out at home.
Then I began to call myself a thousand fools, that I
had not saved myself all this labour and looked at
home first; though, by-the-bye, I had done no more in
this than other travellers often or indeed generally do,
viz., go abroad to see the world and search into the
curiosities of foreign countries, and know nothing of
their own.
But to return to my observations. I was resolved
to see the ceremonies of this pious piece of work; and
as the preparations for it were prodigiously great, I
inquired how it would be; but nobody could re-
member that the like had ever been in their time before.
Every one said it would be very fine, that the queen
would be there herself, and all the nobility; and that
the like had never been seen since Queen Elizabeth's
time.
This pleased me exceedingly; and I began to form
ideas in my mind of what had been in former times
among religious nations; I could find nothing of what I
was made to expect, unless it was Solomon's dedication
of the temple, or Josiah's great feast of the reformation;
and I expected God would have a most royal tribute of
praise.

But it shocked me a little that the people said there
had never been such a thanksgiving since Queen Eliza-
beth's time. What, thought I, can be the reason of
that? and musing a little, O! says I to myself, now I
have found it; I suppose nobody gives God thanks in
our country but queens. But this looked a little harsh,
and I rummaged our histories a little for my farther
satisfaction, but could make nothing of it. At last,
talking of it to a good old cavalier, that had been a
soldier for King Charles, "Oh," says he, "I can
tell you the reason of it; they have never given
thanks," says he, "because they have had nothing to
give thanks for. Pray," says he, "when have they
had any victories in England since Queen Elizabeth's
time, except two or three in Ireland in King William's
time? and then they were so busy, had so many losses
with them abroad, that they were ashamed to give
thanks for them."
This I found had too much truth in it, however
bitter the jest of it; but still heightened my expecta-
tion, and made me look for some strange seriousness
and religious thankfulness in the appearance that was
to be on the occasion in hand; and accordingly I
secured myself a place, both without and within the
church, where I might be a witness to every part of
the devotion and joy of the people.
But my expectations were wound up to a yet greater
pitch when I saw the infinite crowds of people throng
with so much zeal, as I, like a charitable coxcomb,
thought it to be, to the place of the worship of God; and
when I considered that it was to give God thanks for
a great victory, I could think of nothing else than the
joy of the Israelites, when they landed on the banks of
the sea and saw Pharaoh's army, horses, and chariots,
swallowed up; and I doubted not I should hear some-
thing like the song of Moses and the children of Israel on the occasion, and should hear it sung with the same
elevation of soul.
But when I came to the point, the first thing I
observed was that nine parts of ten of all the company
came there only to see the queen and the show, and
the other tenth part, I think, might be said to make
the show.
When the queen came to the rails, and descended
from her coach, the people, instead of crying out
"Hosannah, blessed be the queen that cometh in the
name of the Lord," I say, the people cried "Murder"
and "Help, for God's sake," treading upon one another,
and stifling one another at such a rate, that in the rear
of the two lines or crowds of people through which the
queen passed it looked something like a battle where
the wounded were retired to die and to get surgeons
to come to them; for there lay heaps of women and
children dragged from among the feet of the crowd,
and gasping for breath. I went among some of them,
and asked them what made them go into such a crowd?
and their answer was all the same, "O sir, I had a
mind to see the queen, as the rest did."
Well, I had my answer here indeed; for in short,
the whole business of the thanksgiving without doors
was to see the queen, that was plain; so I went away
to my stand, which, for no less than three guineas, I
had secured in the church.
When I came there it was my fate to be placed be-
tween the seats where the men of God performed the
service of His praise, and sung out the anthems and the
Te Deum, which celebrated the religious triumph of
the day.
As to the men themselves, I liked their office, their
vestments, and their appearance; all looked awful and
grave enough, suitable in some respects to the solemnity
of a religious triumph; and I expected they would be as solemn in their performances as the Levites that blew
the trumpets at Solomon's feast, when all the people
shouted and praised God.
But I observed these grave people, in the intervals
of their worshipping God, when it was not their turn
to sing, or read, or pray, bestowed some of the rest of
their time in taking snuff, adjusting their perukes, looking
about at the fair ladies, whispering, and that not very
softly neither, to one another, about this fine lady, that
pretty woman, this fine duchess, and that great fortune,
and not without some indecencies, as well of words as
of gestures. Well, says I, you are none of the people
I look for; where are they that give God thanks?
Immediately the organ struck up for the Te Deum, up
starts all my gentlemen, as if inspired from above, and
from their talking together, not over-modestly, fall to
praising God with the utmost precipitation, singing
the heavenly anthems with all the grace and music
imaginable.
In the middle of all this music and these exalted
things, when I thought my soul elevated with Divine
melody, and began to be reconciled to all the rest, I
saw a little rustling motion among the people, as if they
had been disturbed or frighted. Some said it thundered,
some said the church shook; the true business was, the
Te Deum within was answered without by the thunder
of a hundred pieces of cannon and the noise of drums,
with the huzzas and shouts of great crowds of people in
the streets. This I did not understand, so it did neither
disturb nor concern me; I found indeed no great
harmony in it; it bore no consort in the music, at least
as I understood it; but it was over pretty soon, and so
we went on.
When the anthem was sung, and the other services
succeeded them, I, that had been a little disturbed
with the lucid intervals of the choristers and the III. K
gentlemen that sat crowded in with them, turned my
eyes to other places, in hopes I should find some
saints among the crowd, whose souls were taken up
with the exalted raptures of the day.
But, alas! it was all one, the ladies were busy
singling out the men and the men the ladies. The
star and garter of a fine young nobleman — beautiful
in person, rich in habit, and sparkling in jewels, his
blue ribbon intimating his character — drew the eyes
of so many women off their prayer-books, that I think
his grace ought to have been spoken to by the vergers
to have withdrawn out of the church, that he might
not injure the service, and rob God Almighty of the
homage of the day.
As for the queen, her majesty was the star of the
day, and infinitely more eyes were directed to her than
were lifted up to heaven, though the last was the
business of the whole procession.
Well, said I, this is mighty fine, that's true; but
where's the religion of all this? Heavens bless me,
said I, out of this crowd, and I'll never mock God
any more here when the queen comes again. Cannot
these people go and see the queen where the queen is
to be seen, but must they come hither to profane the
church with her, and make the queen an idol? And
in a great passion I was, both at the people and at the
manner of the day, as you may easily see by what
follows.
N.B.—I had made some other satirical reflections
upon the conduct of the day; but as it looks too near
home, I am not willing that poor Robinson Crusoe
should disoblige anybody.
I confess, the close of the day was still more extra-
vagant; for there the thanksgiving was adjourned
from the church to the tavern, and to the street; and 
instead of the decency of a religious triumph, there was
indeed a triumph of religious indecency; and the
anthems, Te Deum, and thanksgiving of the day ended
in the drunkenness, the bonfires, and the squibs and
crackers of the street.
How far religion is concerned in all this, or whether
God Almighty will accept of these noisy doings for
thanksgivings, that I have nothing to do with; let
those people consider of it that are concerned in it.
Of Differences in Religion.
'Tis known alone to the Divine Wisdom why He
has been pleased to suffer any part of religion, and the
adoration paid to His majesty, the supplications made
to Him, and the homage which His creatures owe to
His glorious being, to be so doubtfully directed, or so
differently understood by His creatures, as that there
should be any mistakes or disagreements about them.
How comes it to pass, that the paying a reverence
to the name and being of God should not be as in-
capable of being disputed in the manner of it as in the
thing itself? That all the rules of worshipping, believ-
ing in, and serving the great God of heaven and earth,
should be capable of being understood any more than
one way? And that the infallible Spirit of God, who
is our guide to heaven, should leave any one of its
dictates in a state of being misunderstood?
Why have not the rules of religion, as well those of
doctrine as of life, been laid down in terms so plain,
and so impossible to be mistaken, that all men in the
world, in every age, should have the same notions of
them, and understand them, in every tittle of them,
exactly alike? Then as heaven is but one blessed
great port, at which all hope to arrive, there would
have been but one road to travel the journey in; all men would have gone the same way, steered the same
course; and brethren would no more have fallen out by
the way.
God alone, for wise and righteous reasons, because
He can do nothing but what is wise and righteous, has
otherwise ordered it, and that is all we can say of it;
as to the reason and justice of it, that is a thing of
which, like as of the times and of the seasons, we may
say, knoweth no man.
In the state of uncertainty we are now in, so it is;
two men, believing in the same God, holding the same
faith, the same Saviour, the same doctrine, and aiming
at the same heaven, yet cannot agree to go to that
heaven, or worship that God, or believe in that
Saviour, the same way, or after the same manner;
nay, they cannot know, or conceive of God, or of
heaven, or of the Redeemer, or indeed of any one
principle of the Christian religion, in the same manner,
or form the same ideas of those things in their minds.
It is true, the different capacities and faculties of
men are in part a reason for this, by which it is
occasioned, that scarce two men together have the
same notions and apprehensions even of one and the
same thing, because their understandings are led by
different guides, and they see by different lights.
But this is not all; they are not alike honest to the
light they have. Three men read the same doctrinal
article, say it be of the Trinity, or of any other, and
they all examine the foundation of it in the Scripture; one
thinks verily he has found out the mystery effectually,
goes on with his inquiries, and brings every Scripture
and every passage to correspond exactly with his first
notion, and thus he confirms himself immovably in his
opinion; and it is so clear to him, that he can not
only never be argued out of it, but can entertain no
good opinion of any man that conceives of it in any 
other way, but takes him for an enemy to the orthodox
doctrine, and that he merits to be expelled out of
Christ's Church, denied the Christian communion, and,
in short, treats him with no respect, no, nor thinks of
him with charity.
Another comes to the same Scripture, and in quest
of the same doctrine, and he reads over the same texts,
and receives notions from them directly opposite to
the other, or, at least, very remote from them; he
follows in his search through all the corroborating texts
and is confirmed in his first opinion from them all; he
grows as immovable in his received construction of
the Scripture as the other, and all is so clear to him,
that he not only can never be argued out of his opinion,
but can entertain no good opinion of any man that
conceives of it any other way, but takes him for an
enemy to the orthodox doctrine.
The third man, he reads over all the same texts
of Scripture, but doing it with an indifferency as to the
substance, and whether he receives right information
or no, truly he comes away with a calmness of mind as
to the substance; and as he went with no great concern
about being certain, so he comes back as uncertain as
he went. These three men are enough to fill the whole world
full of disputes about religion. The first two meet,
and being equally positive of their being infallibly
guided, equally warm in defending their opinions, and
equally tenacious of them, and above all, equally void
of charity to the other, truly they fall out, part, condemn,
censure, revile, and as opportunity and power offers,
at last persecute one another, and all one another's
adherents. The third, half informed, indifferent man, he comes
in between these two, laughs at them both, says they
are a parcel of furious Christians, that the thing is not absolutely necessary to be known, that it is no article
of faith, so as that without deciding it a man cannot be
saved; says they are a parcel of fools to fall out thus
about what they cannot be certain of, and which they
may go to heaven though they should not understand
it till they come there; and thus the world comes to
be divided. Could they differ with humility, they would differ
with charity, but it is not to be in religion, whatever
it may be in civil or politic affairs; for there is a
thing called zeal, which men call a grace in religion,
and esteem a duty, and this makes men fall out
in religious matters with a more fatal warmth and
more animosity than in other cases, according to
Hudibras—
Zeal makes men fight, like mad or drunk,
For Dame Religion as for punk.
Nor is this the fate only of the Christian religion,
though 'tis more so there than in any other, but 'tis
the same in other cases, as between the Persians
and the Turks about the successors of their prophet
Mahomet. It was so of old between the heathen and
the Jews; and the Assyrian monarch prepared a fiery
furnace for those that would not fall down and worship
the great image that he had set up.
In the primitive times of God's Church, the heathen
did the like by the Christians, and Christianas ad hones
was the common cry; but when the Church came to
its halcyon days, Constantine the Great gave peace to
the Christians, and it was but a little while that they
enjoyed that peace before they fell out by the way.
The Arian heresies rose up, and differing opinions rent
the State into factions, the Church into schisms, and
in the space of two reigns the Arians persecuted the
orthodox, and the orthodox the Arians, almost with the same fury as the heathen had persecuted them both
with before.
From thence to our time persecution has been the
practice even of all parties, as they have been clothed
with power, and as their differences have moved them;
for example, in all the Christian countries, there is a
mortal feud between Popish and the Protestant; and
though,indeed, the former have carried their zeal farthest,
yet the latter have not been able to say they have not
persecuted in their turn, though not with fire and faggot.
What wars and bloodshed molested Europe on the
account of religion in Germany! Especially till the
general pacification of those troubles at the treaty of
Westphalia, when the Protestants, having had the
apparent advantage of the war, obtained the everlasting
settlement of their religion as well as liberties through
the whole empire.
Since those times, what persecution, in the same
country, between the Lutheran and Calvinist churches,
and how little charity is among them, insomuch that
the Lutherans to this day will not allow the Reformed
Evangelic churches, so the Calvinists are called, liberty
to assemble for worship within the gates of their cities,
or give them Christian burial.
I avoid looking too near home, or searching in
Scotland and England, among the unhappy divisions of
Episcopal and Presbyterian, Church of England and
Dissenter, and this I do because it is at home; but it
is too evident that all these come either from men's
being negligent of right informations, or too tenacious
when they have it; for it is evident, if all men would
be honest to the light they have, and favourable to
their neighbours, we might hope that, how many several
ways soever we chose to walk towards heaven, we should
all meet there at last. I look upon all the seeds of religious dissension as '
r
tares sowed by the devil among the wheat; and it
may be observed, that though, as I have already said,
the Assyrians persecuted the Jews, and the Romans
the Christians, yet where the devil is immediately and
personally worshipped, there we meet with little or no
persecution; for Satan, having a kind of peaceable
dominion there, offers them no disturbance; he desires
no innovation for ever; he finds the sweetness of it,
and lets it all alone.
But if once they talk of other gods before him, he
is far less easy; there he is continually sowing strife
and hatching divisions among them, for, like all other
monarchs, the devil loves to reign alone.
It would be too long a task here to reckon up the
several sorts of differences in religion even among us
in England, where, if two happen to differ, presently,
like St. Paul to St. Peter, they withstand one another to
the face; that is to say, carry on the dispute to the
utmost extremity.
But there is another question before me, and that is
not only why there are such differences on the point
of religion, and why are religious differences hotter
and more irreconcilable than other breaches, but why
are there more differences of this kind among us than
among any other nation in the world?
Certainly this pushing on our religious broils to the
extremity is the peculiar of this country of England,
and is not the same thing in other places; and the
variety is such here, that 'tis said there are more
several communions or communities of religious kinds
in England than in all the other Protestant countries
in the world.
The best and most charitable answer that I can
think of to give for this is to compliment ourselves,
and say, 'tis because we are the most religious nation
in the world; that is to say, that we in general set more seriously to work to inquire into the substance
and nature of religion; to examine principles, and
weigh the reasons of things, than other people, being
more concerned for and anxious about the affairs of
God, of heaven, and our souls; that thinking, as we
ought to do, that religion is of the utmost concern
to us, and that it is of the last moment to us to be
certain about it and well-grounded in the points before
us, particularly whether we are rightly informed or
not. This anxious concern makes us jealous of every
opinion and tenacious of our own, breaks much in
upon the custom of submitting our judgments to the
clergy, as is the case in countries where people are
more indifferent in their search after these things,
and more unconcerned in the certainty or uncertainty
of them.
I must acknowledge that I think the true and the
only just reason that can be given for this matter, is
not that we are more furious than other people, more
censorious and rash in our judgment, that we have less
charity, or less patience, in debating religious points
than other people; but the truth is, that we have less
indifference about them, and cannot sit down contented
with a slight and overly inquiry, or a cursory or school
answer to the doubts in question; but we make it a
thing of absolute necessity to be fully informed of, and
therefore, are earnest in the inquiry, and knowing the
Scripture to be the great rule of faith, the standard for
life and doctrine, we fly thither and search for our-
selves, not having Popery enough to expect an infallible
judge, not indifference enough to acquiesce in the judg-
ment of the clergy, and perhaps a little too tenacious of
our own interpretation even in things we are uninstructed about.
This, indeed, I take to be the true reason why
religious disputes increase so much here, and why there are such separations and schisms among us, more than
there are in any other nation in the world.
I know much of it is laid to the door of the con-
fusions they were all in here during the bloody intestine
wars in the years 1640 to 1656, and the liberty given
to all opinions to set up themselves at that time; but
I waive that as a question that tends to more division.
I believe the reason I have given for it stands as well
grounded, and as likely to be approved, as any I can
give, or as any that has been given in this case.
There is another difficult question which still remains
before us, and that is, what remedy can we apply to
this malady? And first, I must answer negatively, not to
have us be less religious, that we might differ less about
it, but to have us exercise more charity in our disputes,
that we might differ more like men of temper, and more
like Christians than we do. This is striking at the
root of religious differences; for if they were carried
on mildly, with a peaceable spirit, willing to be in-
formed, a disposition to love as brethren, though in
everything not like-minded — our variety of opinions
would not then have the name of differences, we should
not separate in communion and in charity, though we
did not agree in everything we were to believe or not
to believe about religion.
It is hard that we should say these differences are the
consequences of a nation having more religion than their
neighbours, since we have still this one part too little;
and as I suppose us to have more religion, I must be
obliged to grant we have not enough more; for if, as
we have just so much more religion as is sufficient to
make us quarrelsome in religious disputes, we had yet
as much more as were sufficient to make us peaceable
again after it, then we should be religious to purpose.
So that, in a word, our being so religious as above
is only an unhappy middle composition between the inquiring and fully-informed Christian on one hand, and
the careless, indifferent, unconcerned temper that takes
up with anything on the other hand. And this I take
to be a just though short account of our differences in
England about religion.
It might be a very useful question to start here,
namely, where will all our unhappy differences end?
I, that am not willing to give the worst-natured
answer, where the best and kindest will hold water, am
for the present disposed to answer in general, rather
than descend to particulars, viz., in heaven. There
all our unkind, unchristian, unneighbourly, unbrotherly
differences will end. We shall freely shake hands
there with many a pardoned sinner that here we bid
stand off; embrace many a publican that here we think
it a dishonour to converse with; see many a heart that
we have broken here, with censures, reproachings, and
revilings, made whole again by the balm of the same
Redeemer's blood.
There we shall see that there have been other flocks
than those of our fold, other paths to heaven than those
we shut men out from; that those we have excom-
municated have been taken into that superior com-
munion; and those we have placed at our left hand
have been there summoned to the right hand; all sepa-
rations will be there taken away, and the mind of every
Christian be entirely reconciled to one another; no
divisions, no differences, no charging sincere minds
with hypocrisy, or embracing painted hypocrites for
saints; everything to be seen and to be known as it
really is, and by a clear light; none will desire to
deceive, none be subject to be deceived.
There we shall look upon all we have done and
said in prejudice of the character of our brethren with
a just change, and sufficiently repair to one another all
the injurious things we have said, or indeed but thought;
of one another, by rejoicing in the common felicity and
praising the Sovereign Glory that had received those
we had foolishly rejected, and let those into the same
heaven whom we had, in the abundance of our pride
and the penury of our charity, shut out.
How many actions of men which we, seeing only
their outside, have now censured, shall we find there by
that penetration that cannot err, be accepted for their
inside sincerity? How many an opinion that we con-
demn here shall we see then to be orthodox? In a
word, how many contradicting notions and principles
which we thought inconsistent with true religion shall
we find then to be reconcilable to themselves, to one
another, and to the fountain of truth?
All the difficulties in our conceptions of things invi-
sible will then be explained; all the doctrines of the
immutability of the Divine counsels will then be recon-
cilable to the changeable events of things, and to the
varieties often happening in the world. The unchangeableness of the Eternal decrees will then appear; and
yet the efficacy of praying to God to do this, or not do
that, to pardon, forgive, spare, and forbear, which we
now say is inconsistent with those unchangeable decrees,
shall be reconcilable to that unchangeableness in a
manner to us now inconceivable.
And this is the foundation of what I now advance,
viz., that in heaven all our differences in religion will
be reconciled, and will be at an end. If any man ask
me whether they cannot be ended before, I answer, if
we were all thoroughly convinced that they would be
reconciled then, we should certainly put an end to them
before; but it is impossible to be done. Men's con-
victions of the greatest and most certain truths are not
equal to one another, or equal to the weight and significancy of those truths; and therefore such a general effect
of this affair cannot be expected on this side of time.

There is one very great reconciler of religious differ-
ences in this world, which has sometimes been made
use of by Providence to heal the breaches in Christian
charity among religious people, and it is, generally
speaking, very effectual; but it is a bitter draught, a
potion that goes down with great reluctance, and that
is persecution. This generally reconciles the differ-
ences of Christians about the lesser matters in re-
ligion. The primitive churches, while under the
Roman persecutions, had a much greater harmony
among themselves, and very few schisms and divisions
broke out among them. When they did differ in any
particular points, they wrote healing epistles to one
another, contended with modesty and with charity, and
referred willingly their notions to be decided by one
another. They did not separate communion, and ex-
communicate whole churches and nations, for a dispute
about the celebration of Easter, or unchurch one
another for the question of receiving and rebaptizing
of penitents, as was afterwards the case. The furnace
of affliction burnt up all that dross, the fury of their
persecutors kept their minds humble, their zeal for re-
ligion hot, and their affection for and charity to one
another increased as their liberty and their number were
lessened.
Thus Bishop Ridley and Bishop Hooper, the first a
rigid Church of England bishop, the other almost a
Presbyterian, or at least a Calvinist, like Peter and
Paul, differed hotly, and withstood one another to the
face in the very beginning of the Reformation; but
when they came to burn for their religion, fire and
faggot showed them the reconcilableness of all their
disputes, convinced them that it was possible for both
to hold fast the truth in sincerity and yet entertain
differing notions of the rites and outsides of the Divine
economy, and at the stake they ended all their dis-
putes, wrote healing letters to one another, and became
fellow-martyrs and confessors for that very profes-
sion which was so intermixed with censure and dislike
before.
And let all that think of this remedy remember that
whenever these quarrelsome Christians come, by perse-
cution or any other incident, to be thus reconciled in
their charity, they find always a great deal to ask
pardon of one another for with respect to what is past;
all their violence, heat of zeal, and much more heat of
passion, all their breach of charity, their reproaches and
censures and hard words, which have passed between
them, will only then serve to bring them together with
more affection, and to embrace more warmly; for,
depend upon it, all the differences in religion among
good men (for I do not mean essential, doctrinal, and
fundamental differences), serve only to make them all
ashamed of themselves at last.
Of the wonderful Excellency of Negative Religion and
Negative Virtue.
Negative virtue sets out like the Pharisee with "God,
I thank thee;" it is a piece of religious pageantry, a
jointed baby dressed up gay, but, stripped of its gewgaws,
it appears a naked lump, fit only to please children and
deceive fools. 'Tis the hope of the hypocrite, it is
a cheat upon the neighbourhood, a dress for without
doors, for 'tis of no use within; 'tis a mask put on for
a character, and as generally it is used to cheat others,
'tis so ignorantly embraced that we cheat even our-
selves with it.
In a word, negative virtue is positive vice, at least
when it is made use of in any of the two last cases;namely, either as a mask to deceive others, or as a mist
to deceive ourselves. If a man were to look back upon it to see in what part he could take up his nest, or lay
a foundation of hope for the satisfaction of his mind as
to future things, he would find it the most uncomfort-
able condition to go out of the world with that any
man in the world can think.
The reason is plain; compare it with the publican,
whom such a man despises. "Here is my landlord a
drunkard, one of my tenants is a thief, such a poor
man is a swearer, such a rich man a blasphemer, such
a tradesman is a cheat, such a justice of the peace is
an atheist, such a rakish fellow is turned highwayman,
such a beau is debauched; but I — I that am clothed in
negatives, and walk in the light of my own vanity — I
live a sober, regular, retired life, I am an honest man;
I defraud nobody; no man ever heard me swear, or an
ill word come out of my mouth; I never talk irreli-
giously or profanely, and I am never missed out of my
seat at church. God, I thank thee! I am not de-
bauched, I am no highwayman, no murderer," &c.
Now, what is the difference of all these? I must con-
fess, speaking of all these together, and of what is usually
the end of them, I think a man had better be any of
them, nay, almost all of them together, than the man
himself, and my reason is in a few words as follows.
All these know themselves to be wicked persons;
conscience, though for a time oppressed and kept under,
yet upon all occasions tells them plainly what their con-
dition is, and oftentimes they repent. 'Tis true, some-
times they do not; God is pleased sometimes to treat
them in the vindictive attribute, and they are cut off in
their crimes, insensible and stupid, without a space or a
heart to repent; and therefore let none take hope in
their profligate living from what I am going to say.
Again, others, though they do repent, and God is
pleased to give them the grace to return to Him as
penitents, come to it very late, and sometimes under a severe hand, as perhaps on a deathbed, or under some
disaster, and oftentimes at the gallows.
But still, I say, those men, though they sin, they do
it as a crime, and when they come to be told of it often
they are brought to repent. But the negative Chris-
tian I speak of is so full of himself, so persuaded that
he is good enough, and religious enough already, that
he has no thoughts of anything unless it be to pull off
his hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank Him
that he has no need of Him. This is the opiate that
doses his soul even to the last gasp; and it is ten thou-
sand to one but the lethargic dream shoots him through
the gulf at once, and he never opens his eyes till he
arrives in that light where all things are naked and
open; where he sees too late that he has been a cheat
to himself, and has been hurried by his own pride in a
cloud of negatives into a state of positive destruction
without remedy.
I am reading no particular man's fate; God forbid!
I restrain it to no circumstances, I point out no per-
sons; it is too solemn a thing to make it a satire; 'tis
the state, not the man, I speak of. Let the guilty apply
it to themselves, and the proud good man humble him-
self and avoid it.
I have observed that many fall into this case by the
excessive vanity of being thought well of by their
neighbours, obtaining a character, &c. It is a delusion
very fatal to many; a good name is indeed a precious
ointment, and in some cases is better than life. But
with your pardon, Mr. Negative, it must be a good
name for good deeds, or otherwise a good name upon a
bad life is a painted whore, that has a gay countenance
upon a rotten, diseased, corrupted carcass.
Much to be preferred is the general slander of a
prejudiced age and a state of universal calumny, where
the mind is free from the guilt they charge. Such a man, though the world spits upon and despises him,
looks in with comfort, and looks up with hope.
-Hie murus aeneus esto,
Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa. —Horace.
General contempt, universal reproach, is a life that
requires a world of courage and steadiness of mind to
support; but be this my portion in this world, with a
heart that does not reproach me with the guilt, much
rather than to be a man of negatives only, and who all
the world caresses with their good wishes and good
opinion, but is himself empty of real virtue, a hypocrite
at bottom, a cheat, and under the delusion of it; whose
portion is with hypocrites, and who can neither look in,
or look up, with pleasure, but must look without him-
self, for all that can be called good, either by others or
by himself.
As at the great and last day the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed, so I am persuaded the opinion we
have of one another here, will be one of the things which
will be there, and perhaps not till then fully rectified;
and we shall be there thoroughly enlightened, we shall
find room to see that we have been much mistaken in
our notions of virtue and vice, religion and irreligion,
in the characters of our neighbours. And I am per-
suaded we shall see many of our acquaintances placed
at the right hand of a righteous Judge, whose characters
we have oppressed with slanders, and who we have
censoriously placed at His left hand here; and many a
painted hypocrite, who has insulted his neighbour with,
"Stand off, I am holier than thou," or whom he has
turned from with disdain, and with a "This publican!"
placed at the left hand, who we made no doubt we
should have seen at the right hand in triumph.
This is a support to the mind of a good man, even
when his enemies, as David says, "gnash upon him III. L
with their teeth, and have him in derision," that is to
say, when he is run down by universal clamour, and
damned by the tongues of men, even for this world and
another.
Happy the man, who with exalted soul,
Knows how to rate the great, the prosp'rous fool,
Who can the insults of the street contemn,
And values not the rage or tongues of men.
He, like the sun, exists on his own flame,
And, when he dies, is to himself a fame.
But take this with you as you go, that as negative
praise will build no man comfort, so negative virtue
will not support the mind under universal contempt.
Scandal is much worse than slander; for the first is
founded upon real guilt, the other attacks innocence.
Nothing is a scandal, but what is true; nothing is a
slander, but what is false.
He that fortifies himself against reproach, must do
it with a certain reserve of real and solid virtue and
piety; it must be uprightness and integrity that must
preserve him; nothing but a fund of what is good can
support the mind under the reproach of being all that
is bad; I do not mean neither that the man must be
perfect, have no follies or failings, have made no ex-
cursions, have nothing to be laid to the charge of his
character; for where then shall the man be found I
am speaking of? And I may be said to be describing
the black swan, a person that is not, and never was to
be found; but the right way of judging men, and the
way which alone can be just, is to judge of them by
their general conduct; and so a man may in his own
mind justly denominate himself: as every good action
does not denominate me to be a good man, so neither
does every failing, every folly, no, nor every scanda-
lous action, denominate me a hypocrite, or a wicked
man; otherwise some of the most eminent saints in 
Scripture, and of every age since the Scripture was
written, are gone to the devil; and 'twill be hard to
say there was ever a good man in the world.
But I return to my subject, the negative good man;
and let me examine him a little in his just character,
in his conduct, public and private. He is no drun-
kard, but is intoxicated with the pride of his own
worth; he is a good neighbour, a common arbitrator
and peacemaker in other families, but a cursed tyrant
in his own; he appears in a public place of worship
for a show, but never enters into his closet and shuts
the door about him, to pray to Him that sees in secret;
he is covered with the vainglorious and ostentatious
part of charity, but does all his alms before men, to be
seen of them; he is mighty eager in the duties of the
second table, but regardless of the first; appearingly
religious to be seen and taken notice of by men; but
between God and his own soul no intercourse, no com-
munication. What is this man? and what comfort is
there of the life he lives? He knows little, or perhaps
nothing, of faith, repentance, and a Christian mortified
life; in a word, he is a man perfect in the circum-
stances of religion, and perfectly a stranger to the
essential part of religion.
Take this man's conversation apart, enter into the
private and retired part of it, what notions has he of
misspent hours, and of the natural reflux of all our
minutes, on to the great centre and gulf of life, eter-
nity? Does he know how to put a right value upon
time? Does he esteem it the life-blood of his soul,
as it really is, and act in all the moments of it, as one
that must account for them? Alas! this is of no
weight with such a man; he is too full of himself to
enter into any notions about an account, either for mis-
spent time, or anything else misdone; but persuading
himself that he never did anything amiss, entertains no r
notion of judgment to come, eternity, or anything
in it.
What room has a man to expiate, in his thoughts
upon so immense and inconceivable a subject as that of
eternal duration, whose thoughts are all taken up, and
swelled top-full with his own extraordinary self? It
would be impossible for any man in the world to enter-
tain one proud thought of himself, if he had but one
right idea of a future state. Could such a man think
that anything in him, or anything he could do, could
purchase for him a felicity that was to last to eternity?
What! that a man should be capable in one moment
(for life is not that in length compared to eternity) to
do anything for which he should deserve to be made
happy to eternity?
If, then, you can form no equality between what he
can do and what he shall receive, less can it be founded
upon his negative virtue, or what he has forborne to do;
and if neither his negative nor his positive piety can be
equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is
to last for, what then is become of the Pharisee? he
must think no more of himself, for all his boasts;
neither of his negatives nor his positives, but of a rich
unbounded grace, that rewards according to itself, not
according to what we can do; and that to be judged
at the last day according to our works, if literally
understood, would be to be undone; but we are to
be judged by the sincerity of our repentance, to be
rewarded according to the infinite grace of God, and
purchase of Christ, with a state of blessedness to an
endless eternity.
Indeed this eternity is not a meditation suitable to
the man I am talking of; 'tis a sublime thought, which
his bloated imagination has never descended to or
engaged in; and when it comes he is like to have as
little comfort of it as he has had thought about it.

This thought of eternity raises new ideas in my mind,
and I cannot go forward without a digression upon so
important a subject; if the reader approves the thought,
he will not quarrel about its being a digression.
ETERNITY
Hail! mighty circle, unconceived abyss.
Centre of worlds to come, and grave of this;
Great gulf of Nature, in whose mighty womb,
Lies all that thing called Past, that nothing called To come.
Ever and never, both begun in thee,
The weak description of eternity,
Mere sounds which only can thy being confess;
For how should finite words thee infinite express?
Thou art duration's modern name,
To be, or to have been, in thee are all the same.
Thy circle holds the pre-existent state
Of all that's early, or that shall be late.
Thou know'st no past or future; all in thee,
Make up one point, Eternity:
And, if things mortal measure things sublime,
Are all one great ubiquity of time.
To end, begin, be born, and die,
The accidents of time and life,
Are nonsense in thy speech, Eternity
Swallows them all, in thee they end their strife.
In thee the ends of Nature form one line,
And generation with corruption join.
Ages of life describe thy state in vain,
Even death itself, in thee, lives o'er again.
Thy radiant, bright, unfaded face,
Shines over universal space.
All limits from thy vast extent must flee,
Old everlasting's but a point to thee,
Ten everlastings make not one Eternity.
To thee things past exist as things that are;
And things to come, as if they were;
Thou wast the first great when, while there was yet no where.
Even time itself's a little ball of space,
Borrowing a flame from thy illustrious face,
Which, wheeling round, in its own circle burns,
Rolls out from thy first spring, and into thee returns.
r
What we have been, and what we are,
The present and the time that's past, We can resolve to nothing here,
But what we are to be in thee at last.
Deeds soon shall die, however nobly done,
And thoughts of men, like as themselves decay;
But time when to eternity roll'd on,
Shall never, never, never waste away.
Years, ages, months, weeks, days, and hours
Wear out, and words to number them shall fail,
One endless all the wild account devours,
And thy vast unit casts up all the tale.
Numbers as far as numbers run
Are all in thy account but one,
Or rather are thy reck'ning just begun.
Thou art the life of immortality,
When time itself drowns and expires in thee.
All the great actions of aspiring men,
By which they build that trifling thing called fame,
In thy embrace lose all their where and when, Reserving not so much as a mere empty name.
How vain are sorrows of a human state,
Why mourn th' afflicted at their fate?
One point, one moment's longer far
Than all their days of sorrow shall appear,
When wrapt in wonders we shall see,
And measure their extent by thee.
In vain are glorious monuments of fame,
Which fools erect t'immortalise a name,
Not half a moment when compared with thee,
Lives all their fancied immortality.
Start back, my soul! and with some horror view,
If with these eyes thou can'st look through,
Inquire what gives the pain of loss a sting,
Even hell itself's a hell, in no one other thing. Then with a brightness on thy face,
An emanation from that glorious place,
A joy which no dark cloud can overcast,
And which Eternity itself cannot outlast,
Reflect, my soul I Duration dwells on high,
And heaven itselfs made heaven, by blest Eternity.

But to the purpose in hand, for I have not done with
this man of negatives yet. And now let us bring him
more nearly and seriously to a converse with the in-
visible world. He looks into it with horror and dread-
ful apprehensions, as Felix, when St. Paul reasoned of
temperance, righteousness, and of judgment to come.
Felix was a moral heathen, that is to say, a man of
negatives, like him I am speaking of. What was then
the case? He trembled. Pray, what is it reasonable
to think Felix trembled at? If I may give my opinion,
who am but a very mean expositor of texts, it was this
or something like it. Felix was a philosopher as well as a man of power;
and by his wisdom, as also by his reverence of the
gods, which at that time was the sum of religion,
had been a man of morals, a man that had practised
temperance and righteousness, as the life which was
unquestionably to be rewarded by the powers above
with an Elysian felicity, that is to say, according to
the Roman maxim, that the gods were the rewarders
of virtue.
But when the blessed Apostle came to reason with
Felix how unlikely it was that these negatives should
purchase our happiness hereafter, he showed him that
the gods could not be in debt to us for the practice
of virtue, which was indeed no more than living most
suitable to our reason; that a life of virtue and temper-
ance was its own reward, by giving a healthy body, a
clear head, a composed life, &c., fitting the man for
all other worldly enjoyments adequate to his reason and
his present felicity as a man. But eternal happiness
must come from another spring, namely, from the
infinite, unbounded grace of a provoked God, who
having erected a righteous tribunal, where every heart
should be searched, and where every tongue would
confess itself guilty, and stand self-condemned. Jesus 
Christ, whom Paul preached, would separate such as
by faith and repentance He had brought home and
united to Himself by the grace of adoption, and on
the foot of His having laid down His life a ransom for
them, had appointed them to salvation.
When poor negative Felix heard of this, and that
all his philosophy, his temperance, and righteousness,
if it had been ten thousand times as great, would weigh
nothing and plead nothing for him at that judicature,
and that he began to see the justice and reason of this,
for Paul reasoned him into it; I say, when he saw
this, he trembled indeed, as well he might, and as all
negative people will.
What a strange idea must that Pharisee have of God,
who went up with the publican to the temple to pray.
'Tis observable he went with a good stock of assurance
in his face that could come to the altar as he did, not
to offer any sacrifice; we do not find he carried any
offering, or bespoke the priest to make any atonement;
he wanted no priests to make any confession to. Good
man, as he thought he was, he had no sins to confess;
he rather came up to the altar to even accounts with
heaven, and like the other man in the Gospel, tell God
that he had fulfilled the whole law, and had done
all those things that were commanded, even from his
youth; so, as before, he only pulled off his hat to his
God, and let Him know that there was nothing between
them at present, and away he goes about his business.
But the poor wretch whom he despised, and whom
he had left behind him, for he durst come no further,
acted quite another part. He had at first, indeed, in
sense of his duty, resolved to go up to the temple;
but when he saw the splendour and majesty of God
represented by the glory of that elevated building, I say,
when he saw that, though a great way off, and then
looked into his own heart, all his negative confidences failing him, and a sense of miserable circumstances
coming upon him, he stops short, and with a blow of
reflection, and perfectly unmixed with any of the
Pharisee's pride, he looks down in humility, but lifts up
his heart in a penitential faith, with a "Lord, be merci-
ful to me a sinner."
Here was faith, repentance, duty, and confession, all
conjoined in one act, and the man's work was done
at once, he went away justified. When the negative
Pharisee went home, the self-same vain wretch that he
came out, with "God, I thank thee," in his mouth,
and a mass of pride in his heart, that nothing could
convince.
In what glorious colours do the Scriptures upon all
occasions represent those two hand-in-hand graces,
faith and repentance! There is not one mention of
faith in the whole Scripture but what is recommending
some way or other to our admiration and to our prac-
tice; 'tis the foundation and the top-stone of all religion,
the right hand to lead and the left hand to support, in
the whole journey of a Christian, even through this
world and into the next. In a word, 'tis the sum and
substance of the Gospel foundation.
Religion seems to have been founded upon three
establishments in the world, in all which the terms of
life are laid down at the end of our acceptance of it.
The first establishment was with Adam in Paradise;
the terms of which were, "Forbear and live." The second establishment was with the children of
Israel, in the giving of the Law; the terms of which
were, "Do and live."
The third establishment is that of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ; the terms of which are, "Believe and
live."
So that, in a word, faith is the substance and
fulfilling of Gospel religion, the plan of righteousness,
and the great efficient of eternal life. Let me break
out here upon this glorious subject, and pardon the
excursion, I entreat you.
FAITH
Hail! mystic, realising vision, hail!
Heaven's duplicate, eternity's entail;
God's representative to hand us on,
And for us claim a station near His throne.
Not the eternal battlements of brass,
Gates, a whole hell of devils could never pass;
Not angels, not the bright seraphic train,
Which drove out Adam from the sacred plain;
Not all the flaming swords Heaven ever drew,
Shall shut thee out, or intercept thy view.
Boldly thou scal'st the adamantine wall,
Where heaps of fainting suppliants fall,
Where doubt has thousands and ten thousands slain,
And hypocrites knock hard in vain.
Soaring above the dark abyss of fear,
Quite out of sight, behind thou leav'st despair,
Who fainting, and unable to keep pace,
Gives up the prize, gives out the race,
Faints by the way, and fainting cries,
I can't, and so for fear of dying, dies.
While thou, on air of hope, fanning thy wings, With gentle gales of joy, from whence assurance springs,
Mount'st on, and passing all th' aethereal bounds.
Thy head with beatific rapture crowns.
Great pilot of the soul, who goes before
The dangers of the dreadful voyage t' explore,
Enters the very place, and when 'tis there,
Sends back expresses to support us here,
Negotiates peace, gains the great pledge of love,
And gets it ratified above.
With awful confidence at Heaven's high throne,
It rather humbly claims than merely prays.
Pleads, promises, and calls them all its own,
And trusts to have, even then, when Heaven denies.
ay, )
a,' },
>bey.)
On earth what wonders has it wrought!Rather what wonders has it not?It has parted rivers, dried up seas. Made hills of those, and walls of these,
And if to this great mountain it should say,
"Move off, O hill, and roll to yonder sea,"
The sea and mountain, too, must both obey.
If towards heaven it looks, 'tis ne'er in vain,
From thence 't has brought down fire, 't has brought down
rain,
And thither it ascends in flame again.
Its influence is so vigorous and intense,
It pierces all the negatives of sense.
Things quite invisible to sight it sees,
Things difficult performs with ease:
Things imperceptible to us it knows,
Things utterly impossible it does:
Things unintelligible it understands,
Things high (superior to itself) commands,
Things in themselves unnatural reconciles,
Weakness to strength, and to its sorrows smiles,
Hopes against hope, and in despair's resigned,
And spite of storms without, it calms the mind.
Say, unborn lamp, what feeds thy flame,
In all varieties the same?What wonder-working hand thy power supplies?
Nature and reason's just surprise.
Nature and reason join thee hand in hand, And to thy just dominion stoop the mind:But neither can thy workings understand, And in thy swifter pace thou leav'st them both behind.
'Twas from thy motion fortified by thee,
Peter asked leave to walk upon the sea,
When his great Lord said, "Come," and Faith said, "Go,"
What heart could fear? What coward tongue say, no?Boldly he stept upon the flowing wave, And might have marched through fire or through the grave, >
While He stood by who had the power to save. j
But soon as Peter lost his hold of thee,
He sunk like lead into the sea.
All thy magnetic power disperst and gone,
The heavenly charm was broke, and Peter quite undone;
And had not help been just at hand,
Peter had gone the nearest way to land.
Made up of wonders, and on wonders fixed,
Of contradicting qualities thou'rt mixed.
Small as a grain, yet as a mountain great,
A child in growth, yet as a giant strong;
A beggar, yet above a king in state:
Of birth but short, yet in duration long.
How shall we reconcile thee to our sense?
Here thou would'st pass for mere impertinence.
Thy teasing nature would thy end defeat,
So humble, and yet so importunate.
See the great test of faith, the greatest sure,
That Heaven e'er put a mortal to endure.
She cried, she begged, nay, she believed and prayed,
Yet long neglected, and as long denied;
At last, as if commanded to despair,
She's almost told it was not in His power,
That she was out of His commission placed,
Shut out by Heaven, by race accurst.
Woman 1 I am not sent to thee!
Woman! thou hast no share in Me!
Was ever creature born, but this, could hear
Such words proclaimed from Heaven and not despair?
But still she prays, adheres, petitions, cries,
And on the Hand that thrusts her back relies:
Till moved, as 'twere, with her impertinence,
He calls her dog, and challenges her sense,
To tell her whether such as she are fed. With food appropriate, or the household bread.
But all was one; her faith so often tried,
Too strong to fail, too firm to be denied:
She follows still, allows her outcast state,
The more thrust off, the more importunate:
Every repulse she meets, revives her prayer.
And she builds hope because she's bid despair;
He call her dog, she calls herself so too,
But pleads as such the fragments that are due.
The case so doubtful, the repulse so long,
Her sex so weak, and yet her faith so strong. Heaven yields! The victory of faith's obtained,
And all she asked, and all she sought for, gained.
Mysterious flame! tell us from whence
Thou draw'st that cleaving confidence,
That strange, that irresistible desire. That with such magic force sets all the soul on fire;By which thou can'st to Heaven itself apply,
In terms which Heaven itself cannot deny.
A power so great, an influence so sure,
Not Heaven itself the wrestlings can endure.
See how the struggling angel yields the day,
When Jacob's faith bids Jacob pray.
Let me alone, the heavenly vision cries.
No, no, says conquering faith, never without my prize.
Heaven yields 1 Victonous faith prevailed.
And all the blessings asked for he entailed.
Blest humble confidence, that finds the way
To know we shall be heard before we pray;
Heav'n's high insurance-office, where we give
The premium faith, and then the grant receive.
Stupendous gift I from what strange spring below,
Can such a supernatural product flow?
From Heaven, and Heaven alone it must derive;
For Heaven alone can keep its flame alive.
No spring below can send out such a stream,
No fire below emit so bright a flame,
Of nature and original divine,
It does all other gifts of Heaven outshine.
Thou art the touchstone of all other grace, No counterfeits can keep thy pace.
The weighty standard of our best desires,
The true sublime, which every breast inspires,
By thee we rise to such a height of flame,
As neither thought can reach nor language name,
Such as St Paul himself could hardly know, Whether he really was alive or no:
When clothed in raptures lifted up by thee,
He saw by faith, what none without it see.
Just Heaven, that in thy violence delights, And easily distinguishes thy flights
From the thin outside warmth of hypocrites,
Approves, accepts, rewards, and feeds thy flame,
And gives this glorious witness to thy fame,
That all our gifts are hallowed by thy name.
By thee our souls on wings of joy ascend, Climb the third heaven, an entrance there demand, As sure those gates to thee shall open wide, As without thee we're sure to be denied. No bars, no bolts, no flaming swords appear, To shock thy confidence, or move thy fear.
/
To thee the patent passage always free,
Peter himself received the keys from thee;
Or, which we may conceive with much more ease,
Thou art thyself the gate, thyself the keys.
Thine was the fiery chariot, thine the steeds,
That fetched Elijah from old Jordan's plains;
Such a long journey such a voiture needs,
And thou the steady coachman held the reins.
Thine was the wondrous mantle he threw down,
By which successive miracles were wrought;
For 'twas the prophet's faith, and not his gown,
Elisha so importunately sought.
Bright pole-star of the soul, for ever fixed,
The mind's sure guide, when anxious and perplexed;
When wandering in the abyss of thoughts and cares,
Where no way out and no way in appears;
When doubt and horror, the extremes of fear,
Surround the soul, and prompt her to despair.
Thou shin'st aloft, open'st a gleam of light,
And show'st all heaven to our sight;
Thou gild'st the soul with sudden smiles, and joy,
And peace, that hell itself can ne'er destroy.
If all this be to be said, and all indeed but a poetical
trifle upon this exalted subject, what is become of our
negative Christian in all this? There is not a word of
negative religion in all the description of faith, any more
than there is of faith in all our negative religion.
Now let us follow this poor negative wretch to his
deathbed; and there having very little other notion of
religion — for 'tis the fate of those that trust to their
negatives to have little else in their thoughts — if a good
man come to talk with him, if he talks out of that way
he puts him all into confusion; for if he cannot swim
upon the bladders of his negatives he drowns imme-
diately, or he buoys himself up above your reproofs, and
goes on as before. He is a little like the Polish
Captain Uratz, who was executed for the murder of Mr. Thynne, who, when they talked to him of repentance
and of Jesus Christ, said he was of such and such a family, and he hoped God would have some respect to
,,him as a gentleman.
But what must a poor minister do who, being filled
with better principles, prays for this vainglorious man?
Must he say, "Lord, accept this good man, for he has
been no drunkard, no swearer, no debauched person;
he has been a just, a charitable man, has done a great
deal of good among his neighbours, and never wilfully
wronged any man; he has not been so wicked as it is
the custom of the times to be, nor has he shown bad
examples to others; Lord, be merciful to this excellent
good man"?
No, no, the poor sincere minister knows better
things; and if he prays with him, he turns him quite
inside out, represents him as a poor mistaken creature,
who now sees that he is nothing, and has nothing in
himself, but casts himself entirely, as a miserable lost
sinner, into the arms of a most merciful Saviour, praying
to be accepted on the merits of Jesus Christ, and no
other; so that there is all his negative bottom unravelled
at once; and if this is not his case it must be worse.
Chapter to.
Of Listening to the Voice of Providence.
, A A 7E are naturally backward to inform ourselves
of our duty to our Maker and to ourselves;
it is a study we engage in with great reluc-
tance, and it is but too agreeable to us, when we meet
with any difficulty which we think gives us a just occa-
sion to throw off any farther inquiries of that kind.
Hence I observe the wisest of men often run into
mistakes about the things which, speaking of religion,
we call duty, taking up slight notions of them, and believing they understand enough of them, by which
they rob themselves of the advantages as well as com-
fort of a farther search; or, on the other hand,
taking up with the general knowledge of religious
principles, and the common duties of a Christian life,
are satisfied with knowing what they say is sufficient
to carry them to heaven, without inquiring into those
things which are helpful and assistant to make that
strait path easy and pleasant to themselves, and to
make them useful to others by the way.
Solomon was quite of another opinion, when he
bid us cry after knowledge, and lift up our voice for
understanding — dig for her as for silver, and search
for her as for hid treasure. It is certain here that he
meant religious knowledge, and it is explained in the
very next words, with an encouraging promise to those
that shall enter upon the search, viz., Then shalt
thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the
knowledge of God.
I am of opinion that it is our unquestioned duty to
inquire after everything in our journey to the eternal
habitation which God has permitted us to know, and
thus to raise difficulties in the way of our just search
into Divine discoveries, is to act like Solomon's
sluggard, who saith, "There is a lion without, I shall
be slain in the streets" (Prov. xxii. 13). That is,
he sits down in his ignorance, repulsed with imaginary
difficulties, without making one step in the search after
the knowledge which he ought to dig for as for hid
treasure.
Let us, then, be encouraged to our duty; let us
boldly inquire after everything that God has permitted
us to know. I grant that secret things belong to
God, and I shall labour to keep my due distance;
but I firmly believe that there are no secret things
belonging to God, and which as such we are for-
bidden to inquire into, but what also are so preserved
in secrecy that by all our inquiries we cannot arrive
at the knowledge of them; and it is a most merciful,
as well as wise dispensation, that we are only forbid
inquiring after those things which we cannot know,
and that all those things are effectually locked up from
our knowledge which we are forbidden to inquire into.
The case is better with us than it was with Adam.
We have not the tree of knowledge first planted in our
view, as it were tempting us with its beauty, and
within our reach, and then a prohibition upon pain
of death; but blessed be God, we may eat of all the
trees in the garden, and all those of which we are not
allowed to take are placed both out of our sight and
out of our reach.
I am making way here to one of the trees of sacred
knowledge, which, though it may grow in the thickest
of the wood, and be surrounded with some briars and
thorns, so as to place it a little out of sight, yet I hope
to prove that it is our duty to taste of it, and that the
way to come at it is both practicable and plain.
But to waive the allegory, as I am entering into the
nicest search of Divine things that perhaps the whole
scheme of religion directs us to, it is absolutely neces-
sary at our entrance, if possible, to remove every
difficulty, explain every principle, and lay down every
foundation so undeniably clear, that nothing may appear
dark or mysterious in our first conceptions of things—
no stumbling-block lie at the threshold, and the humble
reader may meet with no repulse from his own apprehen-
sions of not understanding what he is going to read.
Listening to the voice of Providence is my subject;
I am willing to suppose, in the first place, that I am
writing to those who acknowledge the two grand
principles upon which all religion depends. 1. That
there is a God, a first great moving cause of all things, III. M
an eternal Power, prior, and consequently superior, to
all power and being. 2. That this eternal Power,
which I call God, is the Creator and Governor of all
things, viz., of heaven and earth.
To avoid needless distinctions concerning which of
the persons in the Godhead are exercised in the creating
power, and which in the governing power, I offer that
glorious text, Psalm xxxiii. 6, as a repulse to all such
cavilling inquiries, where the whole Trinity is plainly
entitled to the whole creating work:—" By the Word
(God the Son) of the Lord (God the Father) were
the heavens made, and all the host of them by the
breath (God the Holy Ghost) of His mouth."
Having thus presupposed the belief of the being and
the creating work of God, and declared that I am
writing to such only who are ready to own they be-
lieve that God is, and that He created the heaven and
the earth, the sea and all that in them is, I think I
need not make any preamble to introduce the following
propositions, viz.:
1. That this eternal God guides by His providence
the whole world, which He has created by His power.
2. That this Providence manifests a particular care
over and concern in the governing and directing man,
the best and last created creature on earth.
Natural religion proves the first, revealed religion
proves the last of these beyond contradiction. Natural
religion intimates the necessity of a Providence guid-
ing and governing the world, from the consequence
of the wisdom, justice, prescience, and goodness of
the Creator.
It would be absurd to conceive of God exerting
infinite power to create a world, and not concerning
His wisdom, which is His providence, in guiding the
operations of Nature, so as to preserve the order of
His creation, and the obedience and subordination of consequences and causes throughout the course of that
nature, which is in part the inferior life of that
creation.
Revealed religion has given such a light into the
care and concern of this Providence, in an especial
manner, in and over that part of the creation called
man, that we must likewise deny principles if we enter
into disputes about it.
For him the peace of the creation is preserved, the
climates made habitable, the creatures subjected and
made nourishing, all vegetative life made medicinal;
so that indeed the whole creation seems to be entailed
upon him as an inheritance, and given to him for a
possession, subjected to his authority, and governed by
him as viceroy to the King of all the earth; the
management of it is given to him as tenant to the great
Proprietor, who is Lord of the manor, or Landlord of
the soil. And it cannot be conceived, without great
inconsistency of thought, that this world is left entirely
to man's conduct, without the supervising influence and
the secret direction of the Creator.
This I call Providence, to which I give the whole
power of guiding and directing of the creation, and
managing of it, by man who is His deputy or substitute,
and even the guiding, influencing, and overruling man
himself also.
Let critical annotators enter into specific distinctions
of Providence, and its way of acting, as they please,
and as the formalities of the schoolmen direct; the
short description I shall give of it is this, that it is
that operation of the power, wisdom, justice, and
goodness of God by which He influences, governs, and
directs not only the means, but the events, of all things
which concern us in this world.
I say it is that operation, let them call it what they
will, which acts thus; I am no way concerned to show how it acts, or why it acts thus and thus in particular;
we are to reverence its sovereignty, as it is the finger
of God Himself, who is the Sovereign Director; and
we are to observe its motions, obey its dictates, and
listen to its voice, as it is, and because it is, particularly
employed for our advantage.
It would be a very proper and useful observation
here, and might take up much of this work, to illus-
trate the goodness of Providence, in that it is, as I say,
particularly employed for the advantage of mankind.
But as this is not the main design, and will come in
naturally in every part of the work I am upon, I refer
it to the common inferences, which are to be drawn
from the particulars, as I go on. It is, indeed, the most rational foundation of the
whole design before me; it is therefore that we should
listen to the voice of Providence, because it is princi-
pally determined, and determines all other things, for
our advantage.
But I return to the main subject — the voice of Pro-
vidence, the language or the meaning of Providence.
Nothing is more frequent than for us to mistake
Providence, even in its most visible appearances; how
easy, then, must it be to let its silent actings, which
perhaps are the most pungent and significant, pass our
observation.
I am aware of the error many fall into, who, deter-
mining the universal currency of events to Providence,
and that not the minutest thing occurs in the course of
life but by the particular destination of Heaven, by con-
sequence entitle Providence to the efficiency of their
own follies; as if a person presuming to smoke his
pipe in a magazine of gunpowder should reproach
Providence with blowing up the castle, for which
indeed he ought to be hanged; or a man leaving his
house or shop open in the night, should charge Provi-

dence with appointing him to be robbed, and the like.
Nay, to carry it farther, every murderer or thief may
allege Providence, that determines and directs every-
thing, directed him to such wickedness; whereas
Providence itself, notwithstanding the crimes of men,
is actively concerned in no evil.
But I pass all these things; the subject I am
treating upon is of another nature. The design here
is to instruct us in some particular things relating to
Providence and its government of men in the world,
which it will be worth our while to observe, without
inquiring how far it does or does not act in other
methods.
There is, it is true, a difficulty to shake off all the
wry steps which people take to amuse themselves
about Providence, and for this reason I take so much
pains at first to avoid them. Many men entitle Provi-
dence to things which it is not concerned about,
speaking abstractedly; but, which is a much worse
error, many also take no notice of those things which
Providence particularly, and even in a very remarkable
manner, distinguishes itself by its concern in.
If Providence guides the world, and directs the
issues and events of things; if it commands causes and
forms the connection of circumstances in the world,
as no man that owns the principles mentioned above
will deny; and, above all, if the general scope of
Providence, and of the government of the world by
its influence, be for our advantage, then it follows,
necessarily, that it is our business and our interest to
listen to its voice.
By listening to the voice of Providence, I mean to
study its meaning in every circumstance of life, in
every event; to learn to understand the end and de-
sign of Providence in everything that happens, what is
the design of Providence in it respecting ourselves, and '
what our duty to do upon the particular occasion that
offers. If a man were in danger of drowning in a
shipwrecked vessel, and Providence presented a boat
coming towards him, he would scarce want to be told
that it was his business to make signals of distress, that
the people in the said boat might not pass by ignorant
of his condition, and give him no assistance; if he did,
and omitted it, he would have little cause to concern
Providence in his ruin.
There is certainly a rebellion against Providence,
which Heaven itself will not always concern itself to
overrule; and he that throws himself into a river to
drown himself, he that hangs himself up to a beam, he
that shoots himself into the head with a pistol, shall die
in spite of all the notions of decree, destiny, fate, or
whatever we weakly call Providence; in such cases,
Providence will not always concern itself to prevent
it; and yet it is no impeachment of the sovereignty
of Heaven in directing, decreeing, and governing all
events in the world. Providence decrees that events shall attend upon
causes in a direct chain, and by an evident necessity,
and has doubtless left many powers of good and evil
seemingly to ourselves, and, as it were, in our hands,
as the natural product of such causes and consequences,
which we are not to limit and cannot expressly deter-
mine about, but which we are accountable for the good
or evil application of; otherwise we were in vain ex-
horted and commanded to do any good thing, or to avoid
any wicked one. Rewards and punishments would be
incongruous with sovereign justice, and promises and
threatenings be perfectly unmeaning, useless things—mankind being no free agent to himself, or intrusted
with the necessary powers which those promises and
threatenings imply. But all these things are out of my present inquiry. I am for freely and entirely submitting all events to
Providence; but not to be supinely and unconcernedly
passive, as if there was nothing warning, instructing, or
directing in the premonitions of God's providence, and
which He expected we should take notice of, and take
warning by. The "prudent man foreseeth the evil, and
hideth himself." How does he foresee it, since it is not
in man to direct himself? There are intimations given
us, by which a prudent man may sometimes foresee
evil and hide himself; and I must take these all out
of the devil's hands if possible, and place Providence
at the head of the invisible world, as well as at the
helm of this world; and though I abhor superstitious
and sceptical notions of the world of spirits, of which
I purpose to speak hereafter, either in this work or in
some other by itself—I say, though I am not at all a
sceptic, yet I cannot doubt but that the invisible hand
of Providence, which guides and governs this world,
does with a secret power likewise influence the world,
and may, and I believe does, direct from thence silent
messengers on many occasions — whether sleeping or
waking, whether directly or indirectly, whether by
hints, impulses, allegories, mysteries, or otherwise, we
know not; and does think fit to give us such alarms,
such previous and particular knowledge of things that,
if listened to, might many ways be useful to the prudent
man to foresee the evil, and hide himself.
The only objection, and which I can see no method
to give a reason for and no answer to, is, why, if it be
the work of Providence, those things should be so im-
perfect, so broken, so irregular, that men may either
never be able to pass any right judgment of them, as is
sometimes the case, or make a perfect judgment of them,
which is often the case, and so the end of the intima-
tion be entirely defeated, without any fault, neglect, or
omission of the man.

This we can no more account for than we can for
the handwriting upon the wall at the great feast of
Belshazzar, viz., why it was written in a character
which none could understand; and which, if the pro-
phet had not been found, had perhaps never been known,
or at least not till the king's fate, which was even then
irretrievable, had been over.
This, indeed, we cannot account for, and can only
say it is our duty to study these things, to listen to the
voice of them and obey their secret dictates, as far as
reason directs, without an over-superstitious regard to
them any more than a total neglect, leaving the reason
of Providence's acting thus to be better understood
hereafter. But to describe a little what I mean by listening to
the voice of Providence: it is the reverse of the supine
stupid man, whose character I shall come to by-and-by.
The man I would recommend lives, first, in a general
belief that Providence has the supreme direction of all
his affairs, even of his in particular, as well as those of
the world; that 'tis his mercy that it is so, that 'tis
the effect of an infinitely wise and gracious disposition
from above that he subsists; and that it is not below
the dignity any more than 'tis remote from the power
of an infinite, wise, and good Being to take cognisance
of the least thing concerning him.
This, in the consequence, obliges him to all I say;
for to him who firmly believes that Providence stoops
to concern itself for him, and to order the least article
of his affairs, it necessarily follows that he should con-
cern himself in everything that Providence does which
comes within his reach, that he may know whether he
be interested in it or not.
If he neglects this, he neglects himself—he abandons
all concern about himself; since he does not know but
that the very next particular act of Providence, which comes within his reach to distinguish, may be interested
in him and he in it.
It is not for me to dictate here to any man what
particular things relating to him Providence is concerned
in, or what not, or how far any incident of life is or is
not the particular act and deed of the government of
Providence. But as it is the received opinion of every
good man that nothing befalls us without the active or
passive concern of Providence in it, so it is impossible
this good man can be unconcerned in whatever that
Providence determines concerning him.
If it be true, as our Saviour Himself says, that not
a hair falls from our heads without the will of our
heavenly Father, then not a hair ought to fall from
our heads without our having our eyes up to our
heavenly Father in it.
I take the text in its due latitude, namely, that not
the minutest incident of life befalls us without the active
will of our Father directing it, or the passive will of
our Father suffering it; so I take the deduction from
it in the same latitude, that nothing, of how mean a
nature soever, can befall us, but what we ought to have
our eyes up to our heavenly Father in it, be resigned to
Him in the event, and subjected to Him in the means;
and he that neglects this lives in contempt of Providence,
and that in the most provoking manner possible.
I am not answerable for any extremes these things
may lead weak people into; I know some are apt to
entitle the hand of God to the common and most
ridiculous trifles in Nature; as a religious creature I
knew, seeing a bottle of beer being over ripe burst out,
the cork fly up against the ceiling, and the froth follow
it like an engine, cried out, " O! the wonders of omni-
potent Power!" But I am representing how a Christian
with an awful regard to the government of Providence
in the world, and particularly in all his own affairs, subjects his mind to a constant obedience to the
dictates of that Providence, gives an humble preference
to it in all his conclusions, waits the issues of it with a
cheerful resignation, and, in a word, listens carefully to
the voice of Providence, that he may be always obedient
to the heavenly vision.
Whether this Divine emanation has any concern in
the notices, omens, dreams, voices, hints, forebodings,
impulses, &c., which seem to be a kind of communica-
tion with the invisible world, and a converse between
the spirits embodied and those unembodied, and how
far, without prejudice to the honour and our reverence
of Providence, and without danger of scepticism and a
kind of radicated infidelity, those things may be regarded,
is a nice and difficult thing to resolve, and I shall treat
of it by itself.
It has been the opinion of good men of all ages that
such things are not to be totally disregarded; to say
how far they are to be depended upon, I am not to take
upon me.1 How far they may or may not be con-
cerned in the influence of Providence, I also dare not
say. But as the verity of astronomy is evidenced by the
calculation of eclipses, so the certainty of this communi-
cation of spirits is established by the concurrence of
events with the notices they sometimes give; and if it
be true, as I must believe, that the divine Providence
takes cognisance of all things belonging to us, I dare not
exclude it from having some concern, how much I do
not say, in these things also. But of this in its place.
Whenever Providence discovers anything of this
arcanum I desire to listen to the voice of it, and this is
one of the things I recommend to others. Indeed, I
would be very cautious how I listen to any other voices
from that country than such as I am sure are conveyed
* I have here transposed some words which seem to have got
out of their proper place.

to me from Heaven for my better understanding the
whole mystery.
If, then, we are to listen to the voice of Nature, and
to the voices of creatures, viz., to the voice of the
invisible agents of the world of spirits, as above, much
more are we to listen to the voice of God.
I have already hinted that He that made the world
we are sure guides it, and His providence is equally
wonderful as His power. But nothing in the whole
course of His providence is more worthy our regard,
especially as it concerns us His creatures, than the silent
voice, if it may be allowed me to call it so, of His
managing events and causes. He that listens to the
Providence of God listens to the voice of God, as
He is seen in the wonders of His government, and as He
is seen in the wonders of His omnipotence.
If, then, the events of things are His, as well as
the causes, it is certainly well worth our notice, when
the sympathy or relation between events of things and
their causes most eminently appears; and how can any
man who has the least inclination to observe what is
remarkable in the world, shut his eyes to the visible
discovery which there is in the events of Providence of
a supreme Hand guiding them? For example, when
visible punishments follow visible crimes, who can
refrain confessing the apparent direction of supreme
justice? When concurrence of circumstances directs
to the cause, men that take no notice of such remarkable
pointings of Providence openly contemn Heaven, and
frequently stand in the light of their own advantages.
The concurrence of events is a light to their causes,
and the methods of Heaven, in some things, are a happy
guide to us to make a judgment in others; he that is
deaf to these things shuts his ears to instruction, and,
like Solomon's fool, hates knowledge.
The dispositions of Heaven to approve or condemn '
our actions are, many of them, discovered by obser-
vation; and it is easy to know when that hand of
Providence opens the door for, or shuts it against, our
measures, if we will bring causes together, and com-
pare former things with present, making our judgment
by the ordinary rules of Heaven's dealing with men.
How, and from what hand, come the frequent in-
stances of severe judgment following rash and hellish
imprecations, when men call for God's judgment, and
Providence, or justice rather, obeys the summons, and
comes at their call? A man calls God to witness to
an untruth, and wishes himself struck dumb, blind, or
dead, if it is not true, and is struck dumb, blind, or
dead. Is not this a voice? does not Heaven, with the
stroke, cry, Castigo te — be it to thee as thou hast said?
He must be deaf who cannot hear it, and worse than
deaf that does not heed it; such executions from
Heaven are in terrorem, as offenders among men are
punished as well for example to others as to prevent
their doing the like again.
Innumerable ways the merciful disposition of Provi-
dence takes to discover to us what He expects we should
do in difficult cases; and doubtless, then, it expects at the
same time we should take notice of those directions.
We are short-sighted creatures at best, and can see
but a little way before us — I mean, as to the events of
things. We ought, therefore, to make use of all the
lights and helps we can get; these, if nicely regarded,
would be some of the most considerable to guide us in
many difficult cases.
Would we carefully listen to the concurrence of Pro-
vidence in the several parts of our lives, we should stand
less in need of the more dangerous helps of visions,
dreams, and voices from less certain intelligences.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being to go a
journey into the north, was twice taken very ill the day he had appointed to begin his journey, and so was
obliged to put off going. This he took for a direction
from Heaven that he should not go at all; and in very
few days after his wife was taken sick and died, which
made it absolutely necessary for him to be at home to look
after his affairs; and had he gone away before, must
certainly have been obliged to come back again.
The Romans had certainly the foundation of this
principle in their prudent observations of days and cir-
cumstances of days, nor is Scripture itself void of the
like, but rather points out to the observation, particu-
larly that of the children of Israel, who, after 430
years were expired from their coming into Egypt,
"Even in the self-same day departed they thence"
(Exod. xii. 41, 42). This is the day, that remarkable
day; several other Scriptures mention periodical times,
dies infaustus — the prudent shall keep silence in that
time, for it is an evil time. We find Providence stoops to restrain not the actions
of men only, but even its own actions to days and
times; doubtless for our observation, and in some
things for our instruction. I do not so much refer to
the revolutions of things and families on particular days,
which are therefore by some people called lucky and
unlucky days, as I do to the observing how Providence
causes the revolutions of days to form a concurrence
between the actions of men, which it does not approve,
or does approve, and the reward of these actions in this
world, by which men may, if they think fit to dis-
tinguish and observe right upon them, see the crime
or merit of those actions in the Divine resentment,
may read the sin in the punishment, and may learn
conviction from the revolution of circumstances in the
appointment of Heaven.
I have seen several collections of such things made
by private hands, some relating to family circumstances, 
some to public; also, in the unnatural wars in England,
between the King and the Parliament, I have heard
many such things have been observed. For example,
the same day of the year and month that Sir John
Hotham kept out Hull against King Charles the First,
and refused him entrance, was the same Sir John
Hotham put to death by the very Parliament that
he did that exploit for; that King Charles himself
was sentenced to die by the High Court of Justice,
as it was then called, the same day of the month that
he signed the warrant for the execution of the Earl of
Strafford, which, as it was then said by some of his
friends, was cutting off his own right hand. The
same day that King James the Second came to the
crown, against the design of the Bill of Exclusion,
the same day he was voted abdicated by Parliament,
and the throne filled by the Prince of Orange and
his princess.
These, or such as these, seem to be a kind of silent
sentence of Providence upon such actions, animadverting
upon them in a judicial manner, and intimating plainly,
that the animadversion had a retrospect to what was
passed, and those that listen to the voice of Providence
in such things should at least lay them up in their
hearts.
Eminent deliverances in sudden dangers are of the
most significant kind of providences, and which, accord-
ingly, have a loud voice in them, calling upon us to be
thankful to that blessed Hand that has been pleased to
spare and protect us. The voice of such signal deliver-
ances is frequently a just call upon us to repentance,
and looks directly that way; often 'tis a caution
against falling into the like dangers we were exposed
to, from which nothing but so much goodness could
deliver us again. In how many occasions of life, if
God's providence had no greater share in our safety than our own prudence, should we plunge and pre-
cipitate ourselves into all manner of misery and distress?
And how often, for want of listening to those pro-
vidences, do we miscarry?
Innumerable instances present themselves to us every
day, in which the providence of God speaks to us in
things relating to ourselves; in deliverances to excite
our thankfulness; in views of danger to awaken our
caution, and to make us walk wisely and circum-
spectly in every step we take; those that are awake
to these things, and have their ears open to the voice
of them, many times reap the benefit of their instruction
by being protected, while those who neglect them are
of the number of the simple, who pass on and are
punished.
To be utterly careless of ourselves in such cases,
and talk of trusting Providence, is a lethargy of the
worst nature; for as we are to trust Providence with
our estates, but to use, at the same time, all diligence
in our callings, so we are to trust Providence with our
safety, but with our eyes open to all its necessary
cautions, warnings, and instructions, many of which
Providence is pleased to give us in the course of life
for the direction of our conduct, and which we should
ill place to the account of Providence without acknow-
ledging that they ought to be regarded, and a due rever-
ence paid to them upon all occasions.
I take a general neglect of these things to be a kind
of practical atheism, or at least a living in a kind of
contempt of Heaven, regardless of all that share which
His invisible hand has in the things that befall us.
Such a man receives good at the hand of his Maker,
but unconcerned at the very nature or original of it,
looks not at all to the Benefactor; again, he receives
evil, but has no sense of it, as a judicial dispensing of
punishment from Heaven; but, insensible of one or other, he is neither thankful for one, nor humble under the
other, but stupid in both, as if he was out of God's care,
and God Himself out of his thoughts; this is just the
reverse of the temper I am recommending, and let the
picture recommend itself to any according to its merits. When Prince Vandemont commanded the confede-
rate army in Flanders, the same campaign that King
William was besieging Namur, some troops were
ordered to march into the flat country towards Nieuport, in order to make a diversion, and draw down the
Count de Montal, who commanded a flying body about
Menin, and to keep him from joining the Duke de
Villeroy, who commanded the main body of the French
army.
The soldiers were ordered, upon pain of death, not
to stir from their camp, or to plunder any of the
country people; the reason was evident, because pro-
visions being somewhat scarce, if the boors were not
protected they would have fled from their houses, and
the army would have been put to great straits, being
just entered into the enemy's country.
It happened that five English soldiers, straggling
beyond their bounds, were fallen upon, near a farm-
house, by some of the country people (for indeed the
boors were oftentimes too unmerciful to the soldiers),
as if they had plundered them, when, indeed, they had
not; the soldiers defended themselves, got the better,
and killed two of the boors, and being, as they thought,
justly provoked by being first attacked, they broke into
the house, and then used them roughly enough indeed.
They found in the house a great quantity of apples;
the people being fled had left them in possession, and
they made no haste to go away, but fell to work with
the apples, and heating the oven put a great quantity of
apples into the oven to roast. In the meantime the
boors, who knew their number to be but five, and had 381'
ed")
« v. I "fel r
i E-
got more help on their side, came down upon them
again, attacked the house, forced their way in, mastered
the Englishmen, killed two, and took a third and bar-
barously put him into the oven, which he had heated,
where he was smothered to death; it seems it was not
hot enough to burn him.
The other two escaped, but in coming back to the
camp they were immediately apprehended by the pro-
vosts, and brought to a court-martial, where they were
sentenced, not for plundering, for that did not appear,
but for being out of the bounds appointed by the general
order, as above.
When the sentence came to be executed, the general
was prevailed upon to spare one of them, and to order
them to cast lots for their lives. This, as it is known,
is usually done by throwing dice upon a drum-head,
and he that throws highest or lowest, as is appointed
before, is to die; at this time he that threw lowest was
to live.
When the fellows were brought out to throw, the
first threw two sixes, and fell immediately to wringing
his hands, crying he was a dead man, but was as much
surprised with joy when his comrade throwing, there
came up two sixes also.
The officer appointed to see the execution was a
little doubtful what to do, but his orders being positive,
he commanded them to throw again; they did so, and
each of them threw two fives; the soldiers that stood
round shouted, and said neither of them was to die.
The officer, being a sober thinking man, said it was
strange, and looked like something from heaven, and he
would not proceed without acquainting the council of
war, which was then sitting; they considered a while,
and at last ordered them to take other dice and to
throw again, which was done, and both the soldiers
threw two fours.
III. N
The officer goes back to the council of war, who
were surprised very much, and looking on it as the voice
of Heaven, respited the execution till the general was
acquainted with it.
The general sends for the men, and examines them
strictly, who telling him the whole story, he pardoned
them, with this expression to those about him: "I
love," says he, "in such extraordinary cases to listen
to the voice of Providence."
While we are in this uninformed state, where we
know so little of the invisible world, it would be greatly
our advantage if we knew rightly, and without the
bondage of enthusiasm and superstition, how to make
use of the hints given us from above for our direction
in matters of the greatest importance.
It has pleased God very much to straighten the
special and particular directions which He gives to men
immediately from Himself; but I dare not say they are
quite ceased. We read of many examples in Scripture,
how God spake to men by voice immediately from
heaven, by appearance of angels, or by dreams and
visions of the night, and by all these, not in public and
more extraordinary cases only, but in private, personal,
and family concerns.
Thus God is said to have appeared to Abraham, to
Lot, and to Jacob; angels also have appeared in many
other cases, and to many several persons, as to Manoah
and his wife, to Zachariah, to the Virgin Mary, and
to the Apostles; others have been warned in a dream,
as King Abimelech, the false prophet Balaam, Pontius
Pilate's wife, Herod, Joseph, the Apostles also, and
many others.
We cannot say but these and all the miraculous
voices, the prophetic messages prefaced boldly by the
ancients with "thus saith the Lord," are ceased, and
as we have a more sure word of prophecy handed to us by the mission of Gospel ministers, to which the
Scripture says, " We do well that we take heed;" and
to whom our blessed Lord has said, "Lo, I am with
you to the end of the world;" I say, as we have this
Gospel backed with the Spirit and presence of God, we
are no losers if we observe the rule laid down, viz.,
that we be obedient to the heavenly vision, for such it
is, as well as that of the Apostle Peter's dream of the
sheet let down from heaven.
I mention this to pay a due reverence to the suffi-
ciency of Gospel revelation, and to the guiding of the
Spirit of God, who in spiritual things is given to lead
us into all truth; nor would I have anything which I
am going to say tend to lessen these great efficients
of our eternal salvation.
But I am chiefly upon our conduct in the inferior
life, as I may call it; and in this, I think, the voice
of God, even His immediate voice from heaven, is not
entirely ceased from us, though it may have changed
the mediums of communication.
I have heard the divines tell us by way of distinction,
that there is a voice of God in His word, and a voice
of God in His work; the latter I take to be a subject
very awful and very instructing.
This voice of God in His works, is either heard
in His works which are already wrought, such as of
creation, which fill us with wonder and astonishment,
admiration and adoration; "When I view the heavens,
the work of Thy hands, the moon and the stars which
Thou hast made, then I say, what is man?" &c. Or
(2.) His works of government and providence, in which
the infinite variety affords a pleasing and instructing
contemplation; and it is without question our wisdom
and advantage to study and know them, and to listen
to the voice of God in them; for this listening to the
voice of Providence is a thing so hard to direct, and so little understood, that I find the very thought of it
is treated with contempt, even by many pious and good
people, as leading to superstition, to enthusiasm, and
vain fancies tainted with melancholy, and amusing the
mind with the vapours of the head.
It is true, an ill use may be made of these things,
and to tie people too strictly down to a rule, where
their own observation is to be the judge, endangers
the running into many foolish extremes, entitling a
distempered brain too much to the exposition of
the sublimest things, and tacking the awful name of
Providence to every fancy of their own.
From hence, I think, too much proceeds the extra-
ordinary (note, I say extraordinary) homage paid to
omens, flying of birds, voices, noises, predictions, and a
thousand foolish things, in which I shall endeavour to
state the case fairly between the devil and mankind;
but at present I need say no more here, than that they
have nothing to do with the subject I am now upon, or
the subject I am upon with them.
But as my design is serious, and I hope pious, I
shall keep strictly to the exposition I give of my own
meaning, and meddle with no other.
By the voice of Providence, therefore, I shall
confine myself to the particular circumstances, incident,
and accident, which every man's life is full of, and
which are, in a more extraordinary manner, said to be
peculiar to himself or to his family.
By listening to them, I mean, making such due
application of them to his own circumstances as becomes
a Christian, for caution in his conduct, and all manner
of instruction, receiving all the hints as from Heaven,
returning all the praise to, making all the improvement
for, and reverencing the sovereignty of his Maker in
everything, not disputing or reproaching the justice of
Providence; and, which is the main thing I aim at, taking such notice of the several providences that
happen in the course of our lives, as by one circumstance
to learn how to behave in another.
For example, supposing from my own story, when a
young fellow broke from his friends, trampled upon all
the wise advices and most affectionate persuasions of
his father, and even the tears and entreaties of a tender
mother, and would go away to sea, but is checked in
his first excursions by being shipwrecked, and in the
utmost distress saved by the assistance of another ship's
boat, seeing the ship he was in soon after sink to the
bottom ;—ought not such a young man to have listened
to the voice of this providence, and have taken it for a
summons to him, that when he was on shore he should
stay on shore, and go back to the arms of his friends,
hearken to their counsel, and not precipitate himself
into farther mischiefs? what happiness might such a
prudent step have procured, what miseries and mischiefs
would it have prevented in the rest of his unfortunate
life!
An acquaintance of mine, who had several such cir-
cumstances befall him, as those which I am inclined to
call warnings, but entirely neglected them, and laughed
at those that did otherwise, suffered deeply for his
disregard of omens. He took lodgings in a village near
the city of London, and in a house where either he
sought bad company, or, at best, could meet with little
that was good. Providence, that seemed to animadvert
upon his conduct, so ordered it that something or
other mischievous always happened to him there, or
as he went thither; several times he was robbed on the
highway going thither, once or twice taken very ill, at
other times his affairs in the world went ill, while he
diverted himself there. Several of his friends cautioned
him of it, and told him he ought to consider that some
superior Hand seemed to hint to him that he should come there no more; he slighted the hint, or at least
neglected it after some time, and went to the same
place again, but was so terrified with a most dreadful
tempest of thunder and lightning, which fell as it were
more particularly upon that part of the country than upon
others, that he took it as a warning from Heaven, and
resolved not to go there again, and some time after a fire
destroyed that house, very few escaping that were in it.
It would be an ill account we should give of the
government of divine Providence in the world, if we
should argue that its events are so unavoidable, and
every circumstance so determined, that nothing can be
altered, and that therefore these warnings of Provi-
dence are inconsistent with the nature of it. This,
besides that I think it would take from the sovereignty
of Providence, and deny even God Himself the privi-
lege of being a free agent, it would also so contradict
the experience of every man living, in the varieties of
his respective life, that he should be unable to give
any account for what end many things which Provi-
dence directs in the world are directed, and why so
many things happen which do happen. Why are evils
attending us so evidently foretold, that by those foretellings they are avoided, if it was not determined before
they should be avoided and should not befall us?
People that tie up all to events and causes, strip the
providence of God which guides the world of all its
superintendency, and leave it no room to act as a wise
disposer of things.
It seems to me that the immutable wisdom and power
of the Creator, and the notion of it in the minds of
men, is as dutifully preserved, and is as legible to our
understanding, though there be a hand left at liberty
to direct the course of natural causes and events. 'Tis
sufficient to the honour of an immutable Deity, that,
for the common incidents of life, they be left to the 
disposition of a daily agitator, namely, divine Provi-
dence, to order and direct them, as it shall see good,
within the natural limits of cause and consequence.
This seems to me a much more rational system
than that of tying up the hands of the Supreme Power
to a road of things, so that none can be acted or per-
mitted but such as was so appointed before to be acted
and permitted.
But what if, after all, we were to sit down and
acknowledge that the immutability of God's being and
the unchangeableness of His actings are not easy to be
comprehended by us, or that we may say we are not
able to reconcile them with the infinite variation of His
Providence, which in all its actings seems to us to be
at full liberty to determine anew and give events a turn
this way or that way, as its sovereignty and wisdom
shall direct; does it follow that these things are not
reconcilable because we cannot reconcile them? Why
should we not as well say nothing of God is to be
understood, because we cannot understand it? or that
nothing in Nature is intelligible but what we can under-
stand?
Who can understand the reason, and much less the
manner, of the needle tending to the pole by being
touched with the loadstone, and by what operation the
magnetic virtue is conveyed with a touch? Why that
virtue is not communicable to other metals — such as
gold, silver, or copper — but to iron only? What
sympathetic influence is there between the stone and
the star, or the pole? Why tending to that point in
the whole arch and not to any other? And why face
about to the south pole as soon as it has passed the
equinox? Yet we see all these things in their opera-
tions and events; we know they must be reconcilable
in nature, though we cannot reconcile them; and in-
telligible in nature, though we cannot understand them. Sure it is as highly reasonable then for us to believe
that the various actings of Providence, which to us
appear changeable — one decree, as it were, reversing
another, and one action superseding another — may be
as reconcilable to the immutability of God and to
the unchangeableness of His purposes, though we
cannot understand how it is brought to pass, as it is
to believe that there is a reason to be given for the
agreement and sympathetic correspondence between the
magnet and the pole, though at present the manner of
it is not discovered and cannot be understood.
If, then, the hand of divine Providence has a
spontaneous power of acting, and directed by its own
sovereignty proceeds by such methods as it thinks fit,
and as we see daily in the course of human things,
our business is to converse with the acting part of
Providence, with which we more immediately have
to do, and not confound our judgment with things
which we cannot fully comprehend, such as the why,
to what end, and the how, in what manner it acts so
and so.
As we are then conversant with the immediate
actions of divine Providence, it is our business to
study it as much as may be in that part of its act-
ings wherein it is to be known; and this includes
the silent actings of Providence, as well as those
which are more loud, and which, being declared,
speak in public.
There are several silent steps which Providence
takes in the world which summon our attention; and
he that will not listen to them shall deprive himself
of much of the caution and counsel, as well as com-
fort, which he might otherwise have in his passage
through this life; particularly by thus listening to the
voice, as I call it, of Providence, we have the comfort
of seeing that really an invisible and powerful Hand is 
employed in, and concerned for, our preservation and
prosperity in the world. And who can look upon the
manifest deliverances which he meets with in the in-
finite variety of life, without being convinced that they
are wrought for him without his own assistance by
the wise and merciful dispositions of an invisible and
friendly Power?
The bringing good events to pass by the most
threatening causes, as it testifies a Power that has the
government of causes and effects in its hand, so it
gives a very convincing evidence of that Power being
on good terms with us; as on the contrary, when the
like Providence declares against us, we ought to make
a suitable use of it another way, that is to say, take the
just alarm, and apply to the necessary duties of humilia-
tion and repentance.
These things may be jested with by the men of
fashion, but I am supposing myself talking to men that
have a sense of a future state, and of the economy of
an invisible world upon them, and neither to atheists,
sceptics, or persons indifferent, who are, indeed, near
of kin to them both.
As there are just reflections to be made upon the
various conduct of Providence in the several passages
of man's life, so there are infinite circumstances in
which we may furnish ourselves with directions in the
course of life, and in the most sudden incidents, as well
to obtain good as avoid evil.
Much of the honour due to the goodness of Provi-
dence is unjustly taken away from it by men that give
themselves a loose in a general neglect of these things;
but that which is still more absurd to me is, that some
men are [so] obstinately resolved against paying the
homage of their deliverances to their Maker, or paying
the reverence due to His terrors in anything that befalls
them ill, where it ought to be paid, that they will give f
all that honour to another. If it was well, they tell you
they know not how, but so it happened, or it was so by
good chance, and the like. This is a sort of language I
cannot understand; it seems to be a felonious thought
in its very design, robbing Heaven of the honour due to
it, and listing ourselves in the regiment of the ungrateful.
But this is not all, for one crime leads on to another;
if this part is felony or robbery, the next is treason, for
resolving first to deny the homage of good or evil events
to God, from whose hands they come, they go on and
pay it to the devil, the enemy of His praise, and rival of
His power.
Two of these wretches travelled a little journey with
me some years ago, and in their return, some time after
I was gone from them, they met with a very different
adventure, and telling me the story, they expressed
themselves thus: They were riding from Huntingdon
towards London, and in some lanes betwixt Hunting-
don and Caxton, one happened, by a slip of his horse's
foot, which lamed him a little, to stay about half a mile
behind the other, was set upon by some highwaymen,
who robbed him, and abused him very much; the
other went on to Caxton, not taking care of his com-
panion, thinking he had stayed on some particular
occasion, and escaped the thieves, they making off
across the country towards Cambridge.
"Well," says I to the first, "how came you to
escape ?"—" I don't know, not I," says he; "I
happened not to look behind me when his horse
stumbled, and I went forward, and by good luck,"
adds he again, "I heard nothing of the matter." Here
was, "it happened," and "by good luck," but not the
least sense of the government of Providence in this
affair, or its disposition for his good, but an empty idol
of air, or rather an imaginary, nonsensical nothing, an
image more inconsistent than those I mentioned among 
I
the Chinese; not a monster, indeed, of a frightful shape
and ugly figure, loathsome and frightful, but a mere
phantasm, an idea, a nonentity — a name without being, a
miscalled, unborn, nothing, hap, luck, chance; that is
to say, a name put upon the medium, which they set up
in their imagination for want of a will to acknowledge
their Maker, and recognise the goodness which had
particularly preserved him. This was the most ungrate-
ful piece of folly, or, to speak more properly, the
maddest and most foolish piece of ingratitude, that ever
I met with.
Well, if this was foolish and preposterous, the other
was as wicked and detestable; for when the first had
told his tale I turned to the other, and asked him
what was the matter. "Why, how came this to
pass?" said I; "why has this disaster fallen all
upon you? How was it ?" —" Nay," says he, " I do
not know; I was a little behind, and my horse
chanced to slip and lame himself, and he went for-
ward and left me; and as the devil would have it,
these fellows came across the country and chopped
upon me," &c.
Here was first chance, the same mock goddess as
before, lamed his horse, and next, the devil ordered
the highwaymen to chop upon him that moment.
Now, though it may be true that the highwaymen
were, even by their employment, doing the devil's
office of going to and fro, seeking whom they may
plunder, yet 'twas a higher Hand than Satan's that
delivered this poor blind fellow into their power. We have a plain guide for this in Scripture lan-
guage, in the law of manslaughter, or death, as we call
it foolishly enough, by misadventure; it is in Exod.
xxi. 13, in the case of casual killing a man; it is
expressed thus: "If a man lie not in wait, but God
deliver him into his hand." This was not to be accounted murder, but the slayer was to fly to the city
of refuge.
Here it is evident that God takes all these mis-
adventures into His own hand; and a man killed by
accident is a man whom God has delivered up, for what
end in His providence is known only to Himself, to be
killed in that manner, perhaps vindictively, perhaps not.
With what face can any man say, this was as the
devil would have it, or as bad luck would have it, or
it happened, or chanced, or fell out? all which are
our simple and empty ways of talking of things that
are ordered by the immediate hand or direction of
God's providence.
The words last quoted from the Scripture, of God's
delivering a man into another man's hand to be killed
unwillingly, are fully explained in another place, Deut.
xix. 5. "As when a man goeth into the wood with
his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a
stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head
slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neigh-
bour, that he die, he shall flee unto one of these cities
and live."
The wicked thoughtless creature I have just men-
tioned, whose horse fell lame, and stopped his travelling
till he might come just in the way of those thieves,
who, it seems, were crossing the country, perhaps
upon some other exploit, ought to have reflected that
Providence, to chastise him, and bring him to a sense
of his dependence upon and being subjected to His
power, had directed him to be separated from his
companion, that he might fall into the hands that
robbed and abused him; and the other had no less
obligation to give thanks for his deliverance; but how
contrary they acted in both cases you have heard.
We have had abundance of collections, in my re-
membrance, of remarkable providences, as they are *
called, and many people are forward to call them so,
but this does not come up to the case in hand.
Though contemning Providence, and giving the
homage due to it, as above, to the devil, or to chance,
fate, and I know not what embryos of the fancy, are
impious; yet every one that avoids this evil does not
come up to the particular point I am speaking of, for
there is a manifest difference between acknowledging
the being and operations of Providence and listening to
its voice, as many people acknowledge a God that
obey none of His commands, and concern themselves
in nothing of their duty to Him.
To listen to the voice of Providence, is to take strict
notice of all the remarkable steps of Providence which
relate to us in particular, to observe if there is nothing
in them instructing to our conduct, no warning to us
for avoiding some danger, no direction for the taking
some particular steps for our safety or advantage, no
hint to remind us of such and such things omitted, no
conviction of something committed, no vindictive step,
by way of retaliation, marking out the crime in the
punishment. You may easily observe the differences
between the directions and warnings of Providence,
when duly listened to, and the notices of spirits from
an invisible world, viz., that these are darkhints of evil,
with very little direction to avoid it; but those notices,
which are to be taken from the proceedings of Provi-
dence, though the voice be a kind of silent or soft
whisper, yet 'tis generally attended with an offer of the
means for escaping the evil, nay, very often leads by
the hand to the very proper steps to be taken, and even
obliges us, by a strong conviction of the reason of it, to
take those steps.
It is in vain for me to run into a collection of stories;
for example, where the variety is infinite, and things
vary as every particular man's circumstances vary; but as every event in the world is managed by the superintendency of Providence, so every providence has in it
something instructing, something that calls upon us to
look up, or look out, or look in.
Every one of those heads is big with particular
explanations, but my business is not preaching, I am
making observations and reflections, let those make en-
largements who read it; in a word, there is scarce any
particular providence attends our lives, but we shall find,
if we give due weight to it, that it calls upon us, either—
1. To look up, and acknowledge the goodness of
God in sparing us, the bounty of God in providing for
us, the power of God in delivering and protecting us;
not forgetting to look up, and acknowledge, and be
humble under the justice of God in being angry with
and afflicting us.
2. Or to look out, and take the needful caution and
warning given of evil approaching, and prepare either
to meet or avoid it.
3. Or to look in, and reflect upon what we find
Heaven animadverting upon, and afflicting us for taking
notice of the summons to repent and reform.
And this is, in a word, what I mean by listening to
the voice of Providence.
Chapter ni.
Of the Proportion ietiveen the Christian and Pagan
World.
1HAVE said something of this already in my inquiry
after the state of religion in the world, but upon
some reflections which fell in my way since, I
think it may offer further thoughts, very improving, as
well as diverting. When we view the world geographically, take the
plane of the globe, and measure it by line, and cut it
out into latitude and longitude, degrees, leagues, and
miles, we may see, indeed, that a pretty large spot of
the whole is at present under the government of Chris-
tian powers and princes, or under the influence of their
power and commerce, by arms, navies, colonies, and
plantations, or their factories, missionaries, residences, &c.
But I am loath to say we should take this for a
fulfilling the promise made to the Messiah, that His
kingdom should be exalted above all nations, and the
Gospel be heard to the end of the earth; I was going
to say, and yet without any profaneness, that we hope
God will not put us off so. I must acknowledge I
expect, in the fulfilling of these promises, that the time
will come when the knowledge of God shall cover the
earth as the waters cover the sea, that the Church
of God shall be set open to the four winds, that the
mountain of the Lord's house shall be exalted above
the tops of the mountains, and all the nations shall flow
into it (Isaiah ii. 2); that is to say, that the Christian
religion, or the profession of the doctrine of the Messiah,
shall be made national over the whole globe, according
to those words (Matt.xxiv. 14; Markxiii. 13; Luke
xxiv. 17). But this may be a little too apocalyptical
or visionary for the times; and it is no business of
mine to enter upon the interpretation of Scripture
difficulties, whatever I may understand or believe my-
self about them, but rather to make my observations,
as I have begun, upon things which now are, and
which we have seen and know; let what is to come
be as He pleases who has ordered things past, and
knows what is to follow.
The present case is to speak of the mathematical
proportion that there is now to be observed upon the
plane of the globe, and observe how small a part of the world it is where the Christian religion has really
prevailed and is nationally professed — I speak of the
Christian religion where it is, as I call it, national, that
is, in its utmost latitude; and I do so that I may give
the utmost advantage, even against myself, in what I
am going to say; and therefore, when I come to make
deductions for the mixtures of barbarous nations, I shall
do it fairly also.
I have nothing to do with the distinctions of Chris-
tians: I hope none will object against calling the
Roman Church a Christian Church in this respect, and
the professors of the Popish Church Christians; neither
do I scruple to call the Greek Church Christian,
though in some places so blended with superstition and
barbarous customs, as in Georgia, Armenia, and the
borders of Persia and Tartary, likewise in many parts
of the Czar of Muscovy's dominions, that, as before,
the name of Christ is little more than just spoken of,
and literally known, without any material knowledge of
His person, nature, and dignity, or of the homage due
to Him as the Redeemer of the world.
The nations of the world, then, where Christ is
acknowledged, and the Christian religion is professed
nationally, be it Romish Church or Greek Church, or
even the Protestant Church, including all the several
subdivisions and denominations of Protestants, take them
all as Christians, I say, these nations are as follow:—
1. In Europe: Germany, France, Spain, Italy,
Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Muscovy,
Poland, Hungary, Transylvania, Moldavia, and
Wallachia.
2. In Asia: Georgia and Armenia.
3. In Africa: no place at all, the few factories of
European merchants only excepted.
4. In America: The colonies of Europeans only, as follow:—
i. The Spaniards in Mexico and Peru, the coasts
of Chili, Carthagena, and St. Martha, and a
small colony at Buenos Ayres on the Rio de
la Plata.
2. The Portuguese in the Brazils.
3. The British on the coast of America, from the
Gulf of Florida to Cape Breton, on the mouth
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or the great river
of Canada, also a little in Newfoundland and
Hudson's Bay.
4. The French in the river of Canada and the great
river of Mississippi.
5. The English, French, and Dutch on the islands
called the Caribbees, &c.
The chief seat of the Christian religion is at present
in Europe. But if we measure the quarter of the
world we call Europe upon the plan of the globe, and
cast up the northern, frozen, and indeed uninhabitable
part of it, such as Laponia, Petzora, Candora, Obdora,
and the Samoiedes, with part of Siberia, they are all
pagans, with the eastern unpeopled deserts bordering
on Asia, on the way to China, and the vast extent of
land on that side, which, though nominally under the
dominion of Muscovy, is yet all pagan, even nationally
so — under no real government, but of their own pagan
customs.
If we go from thence to the south, and take out of
it the European Tartars, viz., of Circassia, the Crimea,
and Budziack — if you go on, and draw a line from the
Crim Tartary to the Danube, and from thence to the
Adriatic Gulf, and cut off all the Grand Seignior's
European dominions — I say, take this extent of land
out of Europe, and the remainder does not measure
full two-thirds of land in Europe under the Christian
government, much of which is also desert and un-
inhabited, or at least by such as cannot be called
in. o
Christians and do not concern themselves about it,
as, particularly, the Swedish and Norwegian Lapland,
the more eastern and southern Muscovy, beyond the
Volga, even to Karakathie, and to the borders of
Asia, on the side of India — I say, taking in this part,
not above one-half of Europe is really inhabited by
Christians.
The Czar of Muscovy, of the religion of whose
subjects I have said enough, is lord of a vast extended
country; and those who have measured it critically
say his dominions are larger than all the rest of
Europe, that is to say, that he possesses a full half as
much as Europe; and in those dominions he is master
of abundance of nations that are pagan or Mahomedan,
as, in particular, Circassia, being conquered by him,
the Circassian Tartars, who are all Mahomedans, or
the most of them, are his subjects.
However, since a Christian monarch governs them,
we must, upon the plan I laid down, call this a Chris-
tian country; and that alone obliges me to give two-thirds of Europe to the Christians. But this will bring another account upon my hands
to balance it, viz., that excepting this two-thirds, there
will not come one Christian to be accounted for in any
of the other three parts of the world, except Georgia
and Armenia. As for Africa, there is nothing to be
mentioned on that side, all the Christians that are
on the continent of Africa consisting only of a few
merchants residing at the coast towns in the Mediter-
ranean, as at Alexandria, Grand Cairo, Tunis, Tripoli,
Algiers, &c.; the factories of the English and Dutch
on the coast of Guinea, the Gold Coast, the coast of
Angola, and at the Cape of Good Hope; all which put
together, as I have calculated them, and as they are
calculated by a better judgment than mine, will not
amount to 5000 people, excepting Christian slaves in Sallee, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, &c., which are not so
many more.
America is thronged with Christians, God wot,
such as they are; for I must confess the European
inhabitants of some of the colonies there, as well
French and English as Spanish and Dutch, very ill
merit that name.
Some part of America is entirely under the dominion and government of the European nations; and having indeed destroyed the natives, and made desolate the country, they may be said to be Christian countries in
. the sense as above.
But what numbers do these amount to compared to
the inhabitants of so great a part of the world as that of
America, which at least is three times as big as Europe,
and in which are still vast extended countries, infinite
numbers of people, of nations unknown and even un-
heard of, which neither the English, French, Spanish, or
Portuguese have ever seen? Witness the populous cities
and innumerable nations which Sir Walter Raleigh met
with in his voyage up the great river Oronooque, in
one of which they talk of two millions of people;
witness the nations, infinitely populous, spread on
both sides the river Amazon, and all the country be-
tween these two prodigious rivers, being a country
above 400 miles in breadth and 1600 miles in length,
besides its extent south, even to the Rio Paraguay, and
S.E. to the Brazils, a rich, fruitful, and populous
country; and in which, by the accounts given, there
must be more people inhabiting at this time than in all
the Christian part of Europe put together, being the
chief if not the only part of America into which the
Spaniards never came, and whither the frighted people
fled from them, being so fortified with rivers and im-
passable bays and rapid currents, and so inaccessible by
the number of inhabitants, the heat of the climate, and the mountains, waterfalls, and such other obstructions,
that the Spaniards durst never attempt to penetrate the
way.
What are the numbers of Christians in America,
put them all together, to the inhabitants of these parts
of America, besides the northern parts of America, not
inquired into?
But we are not calculating of people yet, but the
extent of land that the Christians possess; the British
colonies in the north are by far the most populous,
even more than the Spaniards themselves, though the
latter extend themselves over more land.
The British colonies in the north of America are
supposed to contain three hundred thousand souls, in-
cluding Nova Scotia, New England, New York, New
Jersey, East and West Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
and Carolina; and these lie extended upon the coast
from the latitude of 32 degrees to 47, or thereabouts,
being about 750 miles in length; but then much of
this is very thinly peopled, and the breadth they lie
west into the country is little or nothing, 50 or 60
miles is in many places the most. And except some
plantations in Virginia, in Rappahanock, and James River
in Virginia, occasioned by the great inlet of the bay
there, and of the rivers that fall into it, we can see
nothing a hundred miles within that land but waste and
woods, whose inhabitants seem to be fled farther up
into the country, from the face of their enemies the
Christians.
So that all this planting, though considerable, amounts
to no more, compared to the country itself, than a long
narrow slip of land upon the sea-coast, there being very
few English inhabitants planted anywhere above twenty
miles from the sea, or from some navigable river, and
even that sea-coast itself very thinly inhabited, and
particularly from New England to New York, from 
New England north to Annapolis, from Virginia to
Carolina; so that all this great colony or collection
of colonies — nay, though we include the French at
Canada — are but a point, a handful, compared to the
vast extent of land lying west and north-west from
them, even to the South Sea, an extent of continent
full of innumerable nations of people unknown, un-
discovered, never searched into, or indeed heard of
but from one another, much greater in its extent than
all Europe.
If we take the north part of America, exclusive
of all the country which the Spaniards possess, and
which they call the empire of Mexico, and exclusive
too of what the English and French possess on the
coast and in the two rivers of Canada and Mississippi
as above, which indeed are but trifles, the rest of that
country, which, as far as it has been travelled into, is
found exceeding populous, is a great deal larger than
all Europe, though we have not reckoned the most
northern, frozen, and almost uninhabitable part of it,
where no end can be found, and where it is there can
be no doubt but there is a contiguous continent with
the northern part of Asia, or so near joining it as to be
only parted by a narrow gulf or strait of sea, easily
passed over both by man and beast, or else it would be
hard to give an account how man or beast came into
that part of the world — I say this vast continent, full
of people, and no doubt inhabited by many millions of
souls, is all wrapt up in idolatry and paganism, given up
to ignorance and blindness, worshipping the sun, the
moon, the fire, the hills their fathers, and, in a word,
the devil.
As to the thing we call religion, or the knowledge
of the true God, much less the doctrine of the Messiah
and the name of Christ, they not only have not, but
never had the least intimation of it on earth, or revelation of it from heaven, till the Spaniards came among them;
nay, and now Christians are come among them, it is
hard to say whether the paganism is much abated except
by the infinite ravages the Spaniards made where they
came, who rooted out idolatry by destroying the idol-
aters, not by converting them; having cruelly cut off,
as their own writers affirm, above seventy millions of
people, and left the country naked of its inhabitants for
many hundred miles together.
But what need we come to calculations for the
present time with respect to America? Let us but be
at the trouble to look back a little more than a hundred
years, which is as nothing at all in the argument; how
had the whole continent of America, extended almost
from pole to pole, with all the islands round it, and
peopled with such innumerable multitudes of people,
been as it were entirely abandoned to the devil's
government, even from the beginning of time, or at
least from the second peopling the world by Noah
to the sixteenth century, when Ferdinando Cortez,
general for the famous Charles the Fifth, first landed
in the Gulf of Mexico.
We have heard much of the cruelty of the Spaniards
in destroying such multitudes of the inhabitants there,
and of cutting off whole nations by fire and sword; but
as I am for giving up all the actions of men to the
government of Providence, it seems to me that Heaven
had determined such an act of vengeance should be
executed, and of which the Spaniards were instruments,
to destroy those people, who were come up (by the
influence of the devil, no doubt) to such a dreadful
height, in that abhorred custom of human sacrifices,
that the innocent blood cried for it, and it seemed
to be time to put a stop to that crime, lest the very
race of people should at last be extinct by their own
butcheries.

The magnitude of this may be guessed at by the
temple consecrated to the great idol of Vistlipustli, in
the city of Mexico, where, at the command of Monte-
zuma, the pagan monarch, twenty thousand men were
sacrificed in a year, and the wall hung a foot thick with
clotted blood, dashed in ceremony against the side of
that place on those occasions.
This abomination God in His providence put an end
to by destroying those nations from the face of the
earth, bringing a race of bearded strangers upon them,
cutting in pieces man, woman, and child, destroying
their idols, and even the idolatry itself by the Spaniards,
who, however wicked in themselves, yet were in this
to be esteemed instruments in the hand of Heaven to
execute the Divine justice on nations whose crimes
were come up to a full height, and that called for
vengeance.
I make no doubt (to carry on this digression a little
farther) that when God cast out the heathen, so the
Scripture calls it, from before the Israelites, and the
iniquity of the people of the land was full, Joshua,
Moses, and the Israelites were taxed with as much
cruelty and inhumanity in destroying the cities, killing
man, woman, and child, nay, even destroying the
very cattle, and trees, and fruits of the earth, as
ever the Spaniards were charged with in the conquest
of Mexico.
This is apparent by the terror that was spread upon
the minds of the people round about them, whereof
thousands fled to other parts of the world. History
tells us that the first builders of the city of Carthage,
long before the Roman times, or before the fable of
Queen Dido, were some Phoenicians, that is to say,
Canaanites, who, flying for their lives, got ships and
went away to sea, planting themselves on the coast of
Africa as the first place of safety they arrived at; and to prove this a pillar of stone was found not far from
Tripoli, on which was cut, in Phoenician characters,
these words: "We are of those who fled from the face
of Joshua the robber."
The cruelties of the Israelites, in destroying the
nations of the land of Canaan, was commanded from
heaven, and therein Joshua was justified in what was
done. The cruelties of the Spaniards, however ab-
horred by us, was doubtless an appointment of God
for the destruction of the most wicked and abominable
people upon earth.
But this is all a digression; I come to my calculation.
It is true that the Spaniards, whom I allow to be
Christians, have possessed the empires of Mexico and
Peru; but after all the havoc they made, and the mil-
lions of souls they dismissed out of life there, yet the
natives are infinitely the majority of the inhabitants;
and though many of them are Christianised, they are
little more than subjected; and take all the Spaniards,
Christians, and all the Portuguese in the Brazils, all
the English and French in the north, and, in a word,
all the Christians in America, and put them together,
they will not balance one part of the pagans or Maho-
metans in Europe; for example, take the Crim Tartars
of Europe, who inhabit the banks of the Euxine
Sea, they are more in number than all the Christians in
America; so that setting one nation against the other,
and you may reckon that there is not one Christian, or
as if there were not one Christian, in those three parts
of the world, Asia, Africa, and America, except the
Greeks of Asia.
This is a just but a very sad account of the small
extent of Christian knowledge in the world; and were
it considered as it ought, would put the most powerful
princes of Europe upon thinking of some methods, at
least, to open a way for the spreading Christian know-

ledge. I am not much of the opinion, indeed, that
religion should be planted by the sword; but as the
Christian princes of Europe, however few in number,
are yet so superior to all the rest of the world in martial
experience and the art of war, nothing is more certain
than that, if they could unite their interest, they are
able to beat paganism out of the world. Nothing is
more certain than this, that would the Christian princes
unite their powers and act in concert, they might de-
stroy the Turkish Empire and the Persian kingdom, and
beat the very name of Mahomet out of the world.
It is no boast to say that, were there no intestine
broils among us, the Christian soldiery is so evidently
superior to the Turkish at this time, that had they all
joined after the late battle at Belgrade to have sent
80,000 veteran soldiers to have joined Prince Eugene,
and supplied him with money and provisions by the ports
of the Adriatic Gulf and the Archipelago, that prince
would in two or three campaigns have driven the
Mahomedans out of Europe, taken Constantinople, and
have overturned the Turkish Empire.
After such a conquest, whither might not the Christian
religion have spread? The King of Spain with the
same ease would reduce the Moors of Barbary, and
dispossess those sons of hell, the Algerines, Tripolines,
Tunizens, and all the Mahomedan pirates of that coast,
and plant again the ancient churches of Africa, the
sees of Tertullian, St Cyprian, &c.
Nay, even the Czar of Muscovy, an enterprising
and glorious prince, well assisted and supported by
his neighbours, the northern powers, who together are
masters of the best soldiery in the world, would not find
it impossible to march an army of 36,000 foot and
16,000 horse, in spite of waste and inhospitable deserts,
even to attack the Chinese Empire, who, notwithstand-
ing their infinite numbers, pretended policy, and great i
skill in war, would sink in the operation; and such an
army of disciplined European soldiers would beat all
the forces of that vast empire with the same or greater
ease as Alexander with 30,000 Macedonians destroyed
the army of Darius, which consisted of 680,000 men.
And let no man ridicule this project on account of
the march, which I know they will call 3000 miles,
and more. While there is no obstruction but the
length of the way, it is not so difficult as some may
imagine; 'tis far from impossible to furnish sufficient
provisions for the march, which is indeed the only
difficulty that carries any terror in it.
Such a prince as the Czar of Muscovy cannot want
the assistance of innumerable hands for the amassing,
or carriage for conveying, to proper magazines sufficient
stores of provisions for the maintaining a select chosen
body of men to march over the deserts, for in the
grand march no useless mouths should be found to
feed.
Why, then, should not the Christian princes think it
a deed of compassion to the souls of men, as well as
an humble agency to the work of Providence, and to
the fulfilling the promises of their Saviour, by a moderate
and, as far as in them lies, a bloodless conquest, to
reduce the whole world to the government of Christian
power, and so plant the name and knowledge of Christ
Jesus among the heathens and Mahomedans? I am
not supposing that they can plant real religion in this
manner; the business of power is to open the way to
the gospel of peace; the servants of the king of the
earth are to fight, that the servants of the King of
Heaven may preach.
Let but an open door be made for the preaching
of the word of God, and the ministers of Christ be
admitted, if they do not spread Christian knowledge
over the face of the earth the fault will be theirs. Let but the military power reduce the pagan world, and
banish the devil and Mahomet from the face of the
earth, the knowledge of God be diligently spread, the
word of God duly preached, and the people meekly
and faithfully instructed in the Christian religion, the
world would soon receive the truth, and the knowledge
of Divine things would be the study and delight of
mankind.
I know some nice and difficult people would object
here, How are the present body of Christians, as you
call them, qualified to convert the pagan and
Mahomedan world, when they are not able to settle
the main point, viz., What the Christian religion is,
or what they would convert them to? That Chris-
tianity is subdivided into so many parts and particular
principles, the people so divided in their opinion; and,
that which is still worse, there is so little charity
among the several sorts, that some of them would
sooner side with Mahomet against their neighbours
than assist to propagate that particular doctrine in
religion which they condemn. Thus the members
of the Protestant faith would make it a point of
principle not to support or propagate the interest of
Popery in such a conquest as this; and again, the
Catholics would as much make it a duty on them to
root out heresy — so they call the Protestant doctrine—
as they would to root out paganism and the worship
of devils.
I would not answer for some Protestants that they
would not be of the same mind, as to particular
divisions among Protestants. The difference among
some opinions is such, and their want of charity one
to another sets them at such variance, that if they
do not censure one another for devil-worshippers, yet
we know they frequently call some of the opposite
principles doctrines of devils, and persecute one another with as much fury as ever the heathen persecuted the
primitive churches.
Witness the violences which have reigned between
the Episcopal and Presbyterian parties in the north
of Ireland and in Scotland, which has so often broken
out into a flame of war, and that flame been always
quenched with blood.
Witness the frequent persecutions, wars, massacres,
and other cruel and unnatural doings, which have been
in these parts of the world among Christians the effect
of a mistaken zeal for the Christian religion; which,
as it was not planted by blood and violence, so much
less can Christians justify the endeavours to erect this
or that opinion in it by the ruin and blood of their
brethren.
But this is far from being a reason why we should
not think it our duty to subdue the barbarous and
idolatrous nations of the world in order to suppress
the worshipping the devil, who is the enemy not only
of God and of all true religion in the world, but who
is the great destroyer and enemy of mankind, and of
his future or present felicity; and whose business is
always, to the utmost of his power, to involve or retain
them either in ignorance or in error.
I distinguish between forcing religion upon people,
or forcing them to entertain this or that opinion of
religion — I say, I distinguish between that and opening
the door for religion to come among them. The
former is a violence, indeed, inconsistent with the
nature of religion itself, whose energy prevails and
forces its way into the minds of men by another sort
of power; whereas the latter is removing a force
unjustly put already upon the minds of men, by the
artifice of the devil, to keep the Christian religion out
of the world; so that, indeed, I propose a war not
with men, but with the devil — a war to depose Satan's infernal tyranny in the world and set open the doors
to religion, that it may enter if men will receive it;
if they will not receive it, be that to themselves.
In a word, to unchain the wills of men, set their
inclinations free, that their reason may be at liberty
to influence their understandings, and that they may
have the faith of Christ preached to them, whether
they will hear or forbear, I say, as above, is no part
of the question; let the Christian doctrine and its
spiritual enemies alone to struggle about that. I am
for dealing with the temporalities of the devil, and
deposing that human power which is armed in the
behalf of obstinate ignorance, and resolute to keep out
the light of religion from the mind.
I think this is a lawful and just war, and, in the
end, kind both to them and their posterity: let me
bring the case home to ourselves.
Suppose neither Julius Caesar or any of the Roman
generals or emperors had cast their eyes towards Britain
for some ages, or till the Christian religion had spread
over the whole Roman Empire: 'tis true the Britons
might at last have received the Christian faith in
common with the rest of the northern world, but
they had yet lain above three hundred years longer
in ignorance and paganism than they did; and some
hundred thousands of people who proved zealous
Christians, nay, even martyrs for the Christian doc-
trine, would have died in the professed paganism of
the Britons.
Now 'tis evident the invasion of the Romans was an
unjust, bloody, tyrannical assault upon the poor Britons,
against all right and property, against justice and neigh-
bourhood, and merely carried on for conquest and
dominion. Nor, indeed, had the Romans any just
pretence of war; yet God was pleased to make this
violence be the kindest thing that could have befallen the British nation, since it brought in the knowledge of
God among the Britons, and was a means of reducing
a heathen and barbarous nation to the faith of Christ,
and to embrace the Messias.
Thus Heaven serves itself of men's worst designs,
and the avarice, ambition, and rage of men have been
made use of to bring to pass the glorious ends of
Providence, without the least knowledge or design
of the actors. Why, then, may not the great under-
takings of the princes of Europe, if they could be
brought to act in concert, with a good design to bring
all the world to open their doors to the Christian
religion, and by consequence their ears—I say, why
may not such an attempt be blessed from heaven with
so much success, at least as to make way for bringing
in nominal Christianity among the nations? For as
to obliging the people to be of this or that opinion
afterward, that is another case. There is a great pother made in the world among
the several denominations of Christians about coercion,
erecting a church, and compelling men to come in;
that is to say, one sort of Christians persecuting another
sort of Christians to make them worship Christ their
way, as if Christ had no sheep but one fold.
I distinguish much between using force to reduce
heathens and savages to Christianity, and using force to
reduce those that are already Christians to be of this
or that opinion; I will not say but a war might be
very just, and the cause be righteous, to reduce the
worshippers of the pagodas of India to the knowledge
and obedience of Christianity, when it would be a
horrible injustice to commence a like war to reduce
even a Popish nation to be Protestant.
But my proposed war does not reach so far as that
neither; for though I would have a nation of pagans
conquered that their idols and temples might be destroyed, and their idol worship be abolished, yet I
would be very far from punishing and persecuting the
people for not believing in Christ; for if we believe that
faith, as the Scripture says, is the gift of God, how can
we, upon any Christian foundation, punish or persecute
the man for not exercising that which God had not
given him? Hence, compelling men to conform to this
or that particular profession of the Christian religion, is
to me impious and unchristian.
And shall I speak a word here of the unhappy
custom among Christians of reviling one another with
words on account of differing opinions in religion? It
was a part of apocryphal scripture, taken from one of
the traditional sayings of the Rabbis, "Thou shalt not
mock at the gods of the heathens;" but ribaldry, satire,
and sarcasms are the usage we give one another every
day on the subject of religion, as if slander and the
severities of the tongue were not the worst kind of
violence in matters of the Christian religion.
In a word, I must acknowledge, if I am to speak of
reproach in general, I know no worse persecution than
that of the tongue. Solomon says, "There are that
speak like the piercing of a sword;" and King David
was so sensible of the bitterness of the tongue, that he
is full of exclamations upon the subject; among the
rest, he says of his enemies, "They have compassed me
about with words of hatred. ... He clothed himself with
cursing like as with his garment" (Psalm cix. 3,18).
It is indeed remote from the subject I am upon to
talk of this kind of uncharitable dealing, but as just
observations are never out of season, it may have its
uses; let no man slight the hint, though it were meant
for religion only, for that, indeed, is my present subject:
there is doubtless as severe a persecution by the tongue
as that of fire and faggot, and some think 'tis as hard
to be borne.
I have never met with so much of this anywhere in
all my travels as in England, where the mouths of the
several sects and opinions are so effectually open against
one another, that, albeit common charity commands us
to talk the best of particular persons in their failings and
infirmities, yet here, censuring, condemning, and re-
proaching one another on account of opinions is carried
on with such a gust, that lets every one see nothing but
death and destruction can follow, and no reconciliation
can be expected.
I have lived to see men of the best light be mistaken,
as well in party as in principles, as well in politics as in
religion, and find not only occasion, but even a necessity,
to change hands or sides in both; I have seen them
sometimes run into contrary extremes, beyond their
first intention, and even without design; nay, in those
unhappy changes I have seen them driven into lengths
they never designed, by the fiery resentment of those
whom they seemed to have left, and whom they
differed from. I have lived to see those men acknow-
ledge, even publicly and openly, they were wrong and
mistaken, and express their regret for being misled very
sincerely; but I cannot say I have lived to see the
people they have desired to return to forgive or receive
them. Perhaps the age I have lived in has not been a
proper season for charity; I hope futurity will be fur-
nished with better Christians; or perhaps 'tis appointed
so to illustrate the Divine mercy, and let mankind see
that they are the only creatures that never forgive. I
have seen a man in the case I speak of, offer the most
sincere acknowledgments of his having been mis-
taken, and this not in matters essential either to the
person's morals or Christianity, but only in matters
of party, and with the most moving expressions desire
his old friends to forgive what has been passed, and
have seen their return be mocking him with what they y
called a baseness of spirit, and a mean submission; I
have seen him expostulate with them, why they should
not act upon the same terms with a penitent, as God
Himself not only prescribed, but yields to; and have
seen them in return tell him God might forgive him
if He pleased, but they would never, and then ex-
pose all those offers to the first comer in banter and
ridicule: but take me right too, I have seen at the
same time, that to wiser men it has been always
thought to be an exposing themselves, and an honour
to the person.
I speak this too feelingly, and therefore say no more;
there is a way by patience, to conquer even the universal
contempt of mankind; and though two drams of that
drug be a vomit for a dog, it is, in my experience,
the only method; there is a secret peace in it, and
in time the rage of men will abate. A constant steady
adhering to virtue and honesty, and showing the world
that whatever mistakes he might be led into, supposing
them to be mistakes, that yet the main intention and
design of his life was sincere and upright: He that
governs the actions of men by an unbiassed hand, will
never suffer such a man to sink under the weight
of universal prejudice and clamour.
I, Robinson Crusoe, grown old in affliction, borne
down by calumny and reproach, but supported from
within, boldly prescribe this remedy against universal
clamours and contempt of mankind: patience, a steady
life of virtue and sobriety, and a comforting dependence
on the justice of Providence, will first or last restore
the patient to the opinion of his friends, and
justify him in the face of his enemies; and in the
meantime will support him comfortably in despising
those who want manners and charity, and leave them
to be cursed from Heaven with their own passions
and rage.
ill. P
r
This very thought made me long ago claim a kind
of property in some good old lines of the famous
George Withers, Esq., made in prison in the Tower.
He was a poetical gentleman who had, in the time of
the civil wars in England, been unhappy in changing
sides too often, and had been put into the Tower by
every side in their turn; once by the King, once by
the Parliament, once by the Army, then by the Rump,
and at last again, I think, by General Monk; in a
word, whatever side got up, he had the disaster to be
down. The lines are thus:
The world and I may well agree,
As most that are offended;
For I slight her, and she slights me,
And there's our quarrel ended. For service done and love expressed, Though very few regard it,
My country owes me bread at least;But if I am debarred it,
Good conscience is a daily feast, And sorrow never marred it.
But this article of verbal persecution has hurried me
from my subject, which I must return to.
I have spoken of a project for the Czar of Muscovy,
worthy of a monarch who is lord of so vast an extent
of country as the Russian Empire reaches to, which is
in effect, as I have said, much more than half Europe,
and consequently an eighth part of the world. I have
given my thoughts how a war to open a door for the
Christian religion may be justifiable, and that it has not
the least tincture of persecution in it. If the Christian
princes of the world, who now spend their force so
much to an ill purpose in real persecution, would join
in an universal war against paganism and devil-worship,
the savage part of mankind would, in one age, be
brought to bow their knees to the God of Truth, and 
would bless the enterprise itself in the end of it, as the
best thing that ever befell them; nor could such an
attempt fail of success, unless Heaven in justice had
determined to shut up the world longer in darkness,
and the cup of their abominations was not yet full.
But I may venture to say there would be much more
ground for such Christian princes to hope and expect
the concurrence of Heaven in such an undertaking, than
in sheathing their swords in the bowels of their brethren,
and making an effusion of Christian blood upon every
slight pretence, as we see has been the case in Europe
for above thirty years past.
I had intended to remark here that, as the country
possessed by Christians is but a spot of the globe com-
pared to the heathen, pagan, and Mahometan world,
so the number of real Christians among the nations
professing the Christian name is yet a more disproportioned part, a mere trifle, and hardly to be compared
with the infinite numbers of those who, though they
call themselves Christians, yet know as little of God
and religion as can be imagined to be known where the
word Christian is spoken of, and neither seek or desire
to know more; in a word, who know but little of
God or Jesus Christ, heaven or hell, and regard none
of them.
This is a large field, and being thoroughly searched
into, would, I doubt not, reduce the real faithful sub-
jects of the kingdom of Jesus Christ to a much fewer
number than those of Mahomet; nay, than those of
the monarch of Germany, and make our Lord appear
a weaker prince, speaking in the sense of kingdoms,
than many of the kings of the earth. And if it be
true that the old king of France should say, that he
had more loyal subjects than King Jesus, I do not
know but, in the sense his most Christian majesty
meant it, the thing might be very true.
But this observation is something out of my present
road, and merits to be spoken of by itself.
The number of true Christians will never be known
on this side the great bar, where they shall be critically
separated. No political arithmetic can make a calcula-
tion of the number of true Christians while they live
blended with the false ones, since it is not only hard,
but impossible, to know them one from another in this
world.
We shall perhaps be surprised at the last day to
see some people at the right hand of the righteous
Judge whom we have condemned with the utmost
zeal in our opinions, while we were contemporary
with them in life; for charity, as it is generally
practised in this world, and mixed with our human
infirmities, such as pride, self-opinion, and personal
prejudice, is strangely misguided, and makes us
entertain notions of things and people quite different
from what they really deserve; and there is hardly
any rule to prescribe ourselves, except it be of the
text—"In meekness, every one esteeming others
better than themselves," which, by the way, is diffi-
cult to do.
But though we shall thus see at the great audit a
transposition of persons from the station they held in
our charity, we shall only thereby see that our judgment
was wrong; that God judgeth not as man judgeth, and
that we too rashly condemn whom He has thought fit
to justify and accept.
Let, then, the number of Christians be more or less,
as He that makes them Christians determines, this is
not for us to enter into; and this brings me back to
what I said before, that though we cannot make
Christians, we both can and may, and indeed ought,
to open the door to Christianity, that the preaching of
God's word, which is the ordinary means of bringing 
mankind to the knowledge of religion, may be spread
over the whole world.
With what vigour do we consult, and how do the
labouring heads of the world club together, to form pro-
jects, and to raise subscriptions to extend the general
commerce of nations into every corner of the world!
But 'twould pass for a bubble of all bubbles, and a
whimsey that none would engage in, if ten millions
should be asked to be subscribed for sending a strong
fleet and army to conquer heathenism and idolatry,
and protect a mission of Christians, to be employed in
preaching the Gospel to the poor heathens, say it were
on the coast of Coromandel, the island of Ceylon,
and country of Malabar, or any of the dominions of
the Great Mogul; and yet such an attempt would
not only be just, but infinitely advantageous to the
people who should undertake it, and to the people
of the country on whom the operation should be
wrought.
In the occasional discourses I had on this subject, in
conversation with men of good judgment and principles,
I have been often asked in what manner I would
propose to carry on such a conquest as I speak of, and
how it should answer the end; and that I may not be
supposed to suggest a thing impracticable in itself, or
for which no rational scheme might be proposed, I
shall make a brief essay, at the manner, in which
the conquest I speak of should be, or ought to be,
carried on; and if it be considered seriously, the
difficulties and perhaps all the reasonable objections
might vanish in an instant. I will therefore, first, for
the purpose only, suppose that an attempt was made
by a Christian nation to conquer and subdue some
heathen or Mahometan people at a distance from them,
place the conquest where and among whom we will;
for example, suppose it was the great island of Mada-
gascar, or that of Ceylon, Borneo in the Indies, or
those of Japan, or any other where you please.
I would first suppose the place to be infinitely popu-
lous, as any of those countries, though they are islands,
are said to be; and because the Japanese are said to be
a most sensible, sagacious people, under excellent forms
of government, and capable more than ordinarily of
receiving impressions, supported by the argument and
example of a virtuous and religious conqueror.
For this purpose you must grant me, that the island
or islands of Japan were in a situation proper for the
undertaking, and that a powerful European army, being
landed upon them, had in a great battle, or in divers
battles, overthrown all their military force, and had
entirely reduced the whole nation to their power; as,
to go back to examples, the Venetians had done by the
Turks in the Morea in a former war, or as the Turks
did in the isles in Candia, Cyprus, and the like. The
short scheme for establishing the government in those
countries should be this :—
First, as the war is pointed chiefly against the king-
dom of the devil in behalf of the Christian worship, so
no quarter should be given to Satan's administration;
and as nothing else should willingly be treated with
violence, so, indeed, no part of the devil's economy
should have any favour, but all the idols should be im-
mediately destroyed and publicly burnt, all the pagodas
and temples burnt, and the very face and form of
paganism, and the worship attending it, be utterly
defaced and destroyed.
Secondly, the priests and dedicated persons of every
kind, by whatsoever names or titles known or distin-
guished, should be at least removed, if not destroyed.
Thirdly, all the exercise of profane and idolatrous
rites, ceremonies, worship, festivals, and customs should
be abolished entirely, so as by time to be forgotten, and 
clean wiped out of the minds as well as out of the
practice of the people.
This is all the coercion I propose, and less than this
cannot be proposed; because, though we may not by
arms and force compel men to be religious — because if
we do we cannot make them sincere, and so by per-
secution we only create hypocrites — yet I insist that
we may by force, and that with the greatest justice
possible, suppress paganism, and the worship of God's
enemy the devil, and banish it out of the world; nay,
that we ought to do it to the utmost of our power.
But I return to the conquest. The country being thus entirely reduced under
Christian government, the inhabitants, if they submit
quietly, ought to be used with humanity and justice,
no cruelty, no rigour. They should suffer no oppression,
injury, or injustice, that they may not receive evil
impressions of the people that are come among them;
lest, entertaining an abhorrence of Christians from their
evil conduct, cruelty, and injustice, they should enter-
tain an abhorrence of the Christian religion for their
sakes; as the poor wretches the Indians in America,
who, when they were talked to of the future state, the
resurrection of the dead, eternal felicity in heaven,
and the like, inquired where the Spaniards went after
death, and if any of them went to heaven; and being
answered in the affirmative, shook their heads, and
desired they might go to hell then, for that they were
afraid to think of being in heaven if the Spaniards were
there.
A just and generous behaviour to the natives, or at
least to such of them as should show themselves willing
to submit, would certainly engage them in their interest,
and accordingly would in a little while bring them to
embrace that truth which dictated such just principles
to those who espoused it.
Thus prejudices being removed, the way to instruc-
tion would be made the more plain, and then would be
the time for Gospel labourers to enter upon the harvest;
ministers should be instructed to teach them our lan-
guage, to exhort them to seek the blessings of religion
and of the true God, and so gradually to introduce right
principles among them at their own request.
From hence they should proceed to teach all the
young children the language spoken by them, who
would then be their benefactors rather than conquerors;
and a few years wearing the old generation out, the
posterity of them and of their conquerors would be all
one nation.
In case any rejected the instruction of religious men
and adhered obstinately to his idolatry, and would not
be reclaimed by gentle and Christian usage, suitable
methods are to be taken with such, that they might not
make a religious faction in the country and gain others to
side with them in order to recover their liberty, as they
might call it, to serve their own gods, that is to say,
idols; for it must be for ever as just not to permit them
to go back to idolatry by force as it was to pull them
from it by force.
By this kind of conquest the Christian religion would
be most effectually propagated among innumerable
nations of savages and idolaters, and as many people be
brought to worship the true God as may be said to do
it at this time in the whole Christian world.
This is my crusado; and it would be a war as justi-
fiable on many accounts as any that was ever undertaken
in the world, a war that would bring eternal honour to
the conquerors and an eternal blessing to the people
conquered.
It were easy now to cut out enterprises of this nature
for other of the princes of the world than the Czar of
Muscovy; and I could lay very rational schemes for such undertakings, and the schemes that could, if
thoroughly pursued, never fail of success. For ex-
ample, an expedition against the Moors of Africa by
the French, Spanish, and Italian princes, who daily
suffer so much by them, and the last of whom are at
perpetual war with them; how easy would it be to
those powers to join in a Christian confederacy to plant
the Christian religion again in the Numidian and Mauritanian kingdoms — where was once the famous church
of Carthage, and from whence thousands of Christians
have gone to heaven — the harvest of the primitive
labours of St. Cyprian, Tertullian, and many more,
whose posterity now bow their knees to that latest and
worst of all impostors, Mahomet.
But unchristian strife was always a bar against the
propagation of the Christian religion, and unnatural
wars, carried on among the nations I speak of, are
made so much the business of the Christian world, that
I do not expect in our time to see the advantages taken
hold of that the nature of the thing offers. But I am
persuaded, and leave it upon record as my settled
opinion, that one time or other the Christian powers
of Europe shall be inspired from Heaven for such a
work, and then the easiness of subduing the king-
dom of Africa to the Christian power shall shame the
generations past, who had the opportunity so often in
their hands, but made no use of it.
Note. — In this part of the subject I am upon, I must
acknowledge there is a double argument for a war:
(1.) In point of the interfering interests, Europe ought
to take possession of those shores, without which it is
manifest her commerce is not secured; and indeed,
while that part of Africa bordering on the sea is in the
hands of robbers, pirates cannot be secured. Now, this
is a point of undisputed right, for a war-trade claims
the protection of the powers to whom it belongs, and we make no scruple to make war upon one another for
the protection of our trade, and it is allowed to be a
good reason why we should do so. Why, then, is it
not a good reason to make war upon thieves and rob-
bers? If one nation take the ships belonging to an-
other, we immediately reclaim the prize from the
captors, and require of the prince that justice be done
against the aggressor, who is a breaker of the peace;
and if this is refused we make war.
But shall we do thus to Christians, and scruple to
make an universal war for the rooting out a race of
pirates and rovers, who live by rapine, and are continu-
ally employed, like the lions and tigers of their own
Lybia, in devouring their neighbours? This, I say,
makes such a war not only just on a religious account,
but both just and necessary upon a civil account.
The war, then, being thus proved to be just on
other accounts, why should not (2.) the extirpation
of idolatry, paganism, and devil-worship be the con-
sequence of the victory? If God be allowed to be
the giver of victory, how can it be answered to Him
that the victory should not be made use of for the
interest and glory of the God of war, from whom it
proceeds? But these things are not to be offered to
the world till higher principles work in the minds of
men in their making war and peace than yet seems to
take up their minds.
I was tempted upon this occasion to make an excur-
sion here upon the subject of the very light occasions
princes and powers, states and statesmen, make use of for
the engaging in war and blood one against another; one
for being ill satisfied with the other, and another for
preserving the balance of power; this for nothing at all,
and that for something next to nothing; and how little
concern the blood that is necessarily spilt in these wars
produces among them. But this is not a case that will so well bear to be entered upon in a public manner at
this time. All I can add is, I doubt no such zeal for the Chris-
tian religion will be found in our days, or perhaps in any
age of the world, till Heaven beats the drums itself, and
the glorious legions from above come down on purpose
to propagate the work, and to reduce the whole world
to the obedience of King Jesus — a time which some
tell us is not far off, but of which I heard nothing in all
my travels and illuminations, no, not one word.
FINIS.
A VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD
THEY must be much taken up with the satisfaction
of what they are already, that never spare their
thoughts upon the subject of what they shall be. The place, the company, the employment which we
expect to know so much of hereafter, must certainly be
well worth our while to inquire after here.
I believe the main interruptions which have been
given to these inquiries, and perhaps the reason why
those that have entered into them have given them up,
and those who have not entered into them have satis-
fied themselves in the utter neglect, have been the wild
chimeric notions, enthusiastic dreams, and unsatisfying
ideas, which most of the conceptions of men have led
them into about these things.
As I endeavour to conceive justly of these things, I
shall likewise endeavour to reason upon them clearly,
and, if possible, convey some such ideas of the invisible
world to the thoughts of men as may not be confused
and indigested, and so leave them darker than I find
them.
The locality of heaven or hell is no part of my •37
search; there is doubtless a place reserved for the re-
ception of our souls after death; as there is a state of
being for material substances, so there must be a place;
if we are to be, we must have a where; the Scripture
supports reason in it — Judas is gone to his place;
Dives in hell lifted up his eyes, and saw Lazarus in
Abraham's bosom: the locality of bliss and misery
seems to be positively asserted in both cases.
But there is not so clear a view of the company as
of the place; it is not so easy to inquire into the world
of spirits, as it is evident that there are such spirits and
such a world. We find the locality of it is natural, but
who the inhabitants are is a search of still a sublimer
nature, liable to more exception, encumbered with more
difficulties, and exposed to much more uncertainty.
I shall endeavour to clear up as much of it as I can,
and intimate most willingly how much I rejoice in the
expectation that some other inquirers may go farther,
till at last all that Providence has thought fit to discover
of that part may be perfectly known.
The discoveries in the Scripture which lead to this
are innumerable, but the positive declaration of it seems
to be declined. When our Saviour walking on the
sea frighted His disciples, and they cried out, what do
we find terrified them? Truly they thought they had
seen a spirit. One would have thought such men as
they, who had the vision of God manifest in the flesh,
should not have been so much surprised if they had
seen a spirit, that is to say, seen an apparition, for to
see a spirit seems to be an allusion, not an expression to
be used literally, a spirit being not visible by the organ
of human sight.
But what if it had been a spirit i If it had been a
good spirit, what had they to fear? And if a bad spirit,
what would crying out have assisted them? When
people cry out in such cases, it is either for help, and then they cry to others; or for mercy, and then they
cry to the subject of their terror to spare them. Either
way it was either the foolishest or the wickedest thing
that ever was done by such grave men as the apostles;
for if it was a good spirit as before, they had no need
to cry out; and if it was a bad one, who did they cry
to? for 'tis evident they did not pray to God, or cross
and bless themselves, as was afterwards the fashion; but
they cried out, that is to say, they either cried out for
help, which was great nonsense to call to man for help
against the devil; or they cried to the spirit they saw,
that it might not hurt them, which was, in short, neither
less nor more than praying to the devil.
This put me in mind of the poor savages in many of
the countries of America and Africa, who, really in-
structed by their fear, that is to say, by mere nature,
worship the devil that he may not hurt them.
Here I must digress a little, and make a transition
from the story of the spirit to the strange absurdities of
men's notions at that time, and particularly of those upon
whom the first impressions of Christ's preachings were
wrought; and if it be looked narrowly into, one cannot
but wonder what strange ignorant people even the
disciples themselves were at first; and indeed their
ignorance continued a great while, even to after the
death of Christ Himself—witness the foolish talk of
the two disciples going to Emmaus. It is true they were
wiser afterwards when they were better taught; but
the Scripture is full of the discoveries of their igno-
rance, as in the notions of sitting at His right hand
and His left in His kingdom, asked for by Zebedee's
children; no doubt but the good woman their mother
thought one of her sons should be lord treasurer
there, and the other lord chancellor, and she could
not but think those places their due when she saw
them in such favour with Him here. Just so in their notion of seeing a spirit here, which put them
into such a fright, and indeed they might be said,
according to our dull way of thinking, to be frighted
out of their wits; for had their senses been in exer-
cise, they would either have rejoiced in the appearance
of a good angel, and stood still to hear his message as
from Heaven, or prayed to God to deliver them out
of the hands of the devil on their supposing it, as
above, to be a vision from hell.
But I come to the subject. It is evident that the
notion of spirits, and their intermeddling with the affairs
of men, and even of their appearing to men, prevailed
so universally in those ages of the world, that even God's
own people, who were instructed from Himself, believed
it, nor is there anything in all the New Testament in-
stitution to contradict it, though many things to confirm
it; such particularly as the law against what is called a
familiar spirit, which was esteemed no better or worse
than a conversing with the devil, that is to say, with
some of the evil spirits of the world I speak of.
The witch of Endor, and the story of an apparition
of an old man personating Samuel, which is so plainly
asserted in Scripture, and which the learned opposers of
these notions have spent so much weak pains to disturb
our imaginations about, yet assure us that such appari-
tions are not inconsistent with Nature or with religion;
nay, the Scripture allows this woman to patu <watu, as
the Indians in America call it, and conjure for the
raising this spectre, and when it is come, allows it to
speak a great prophetic truth, foretelling the king, in
all its terrible particulars, what was to happen to him,
and what did befall him the very next day.
Either this appearance must be a good spirit or a
bad; if it was a good spirit it was an angel, as it is ex-
pressed in another place of the Apostle Peter, when he
knocked at the good people's door in Jerusalem (Acts xii. 15); and then it supports my opinion of the spirits
unembodied conversing with and taking care of the
spirits embodied; if it was an evil spirit, then they must
grant God to be making a prophet of the devil, and
making him personate Samuel to foretell things to come;
permitting Satan to speak in the first person of God's
own prophet, and indeed to preach the justice of God's
dealing with Saul for rejecting His prophet Samuel;
which, in short, is not a little odd, putting the spirit of
God into the mouth of the devil, and making Satan a
preacher of righteousness.
When I was in my retirement I had abundance of
strange notions of my seeing apparitions there, and
especially when I happened to be abroad by moonshine,
when every bush looked like a man, and every tree like
a man on horseback; and I so prepossessed myself
with it that I scarce durst look behind me for a good
while, and after that durst not go abroad at all at night;
nay, it grew upon me to such a degree at last, that I as
firmly believed I saw several times real shapes and
appearances, as I do now really believe and am assured
that it was all hypochondriac delusion.
But, however, that the reader may see how far the
power of imagination may go, and judge for me
whether I showed any more folly and simplicity than
other men might do, I'll repeat some little passages,
which for a while gave me very great disturbances,
and every one shall judge for me whether they might
not have been deluded in the like circumstances as
well as I.
The first case was, when I crept into the dark cave
in the valley, where the old goat lay just expiring,
which, wherever it happened, is a true history, I assure
you.
When first I was stopped by the noise of this poor
dying creature, you are to observe that the voice was III. Q
not only like the voice of a man, but even articulate,
only that I could not form any words from it; and
what did that amount to more or less than this, namely,
that it spoke, but only it was in a language that I did
not understand. If it was possible to describe the
surprise of my spirits on that occasion, I would do it
here, how all my blood run, or rather stood still,
chilled in my veins, how a cold dew of sweat sat on
my forehead, how my joints, like Belshazzar's knees,
shook one against another, and how, as I said, my hair
would have lifted off my hat if I had had one on my
head.
But this is not all. After the first noise of the
creature, which was a faint, dying kind of imperfect
bleating, not unusual, as I found afterward; I say,
after this he fetched two or three deep sighs, as lively,
and as like human, as it is possible to imagine, as I
have also said.
These were so many confirmations of my surprise,
besides the sight of his two glaring eyes, and carried it
up to the extreme of fright and amazement; how I
afterwards conquered this childish beginning, and mus-
tered up courage enough to go into the place with a
firebrand for light, and how I was presently satisfied
with seeing the creature whose condition made all the
little accidental noises appear rational, I have already
said.
But I must acknowledge that this real surprise left
some relics or remains behind it that did not wear
quite off a great while, though I struggled hard with
them; the vapours that were raised at first were never
so laid but that on every trifling occasion they re-
turned; and I saw, nay, I felt apparitions as plainly
and distinctly as ever I felt or saw any real substance
in my life.
The like was the case with me before that, when I first found the print of a man's foot upon the sand, by
the seaside, on the north part of the island.
And these, I say, having left my fancy a little
peevish and wayward, I had frequently some returns of
these vapours, on differing occasions, and sometimes
even without occasion; nothing but mere hypochon-
driac whimsies, fluttering of the blood, and rising of
vapours, which nobody could give any account of but
myself.
For example, it was one night, after my having
seen some odd appearances in the air, of no great sig-
nificance, that coming home, and being in bed, but not
asleep, I felt a pain in one of my feet, after which it
came to a kind of numbness in my foot, which a little
surprised me, and after that a kind of tingling in my
blood, as if it had been some distemper running up
my leg. On a sudden I felt, as it were, something alive lie
upon me, as if it had been a dog lying upon my bed,
from my knee downwards, about half way up my leg,
and immediately afterwards I felt it heavier, and felt it
as plainly roll itself upon me upwards upon my thigh,
for I lay on one side, I say, as if it had been a
creature lying upon me with all his weight, and turn-
ing his body upon me.
It was so lively and sensible to me, and I remember
it so perfectly well, though it is now many years ago,
that my blood chills and flutters about my heart at the
very writing it. I immediately flung myself out of my
bed and flew to my musket, which stood always ready
at my hand, and naked as I was, laid about me upon
the bed in the dark, and everywhere else that I could
think of where anybody might stand or lie, but could
find nothing. "Lord deliver me from an evil spirit,"
said I, " what can this be?" And being tired with
groping about, and having broke two or three of my earthen pots with making blows here and there to no
purpose, I went to light my candle, for my lamp which
I used to burn in the night either had not been lighted,
or was gone out.
When I lighted a candle, I could easily see there
was no living creature in the place with me but the
poor parrot, who was waked and frighted, and cried
out, "Hold your tongue," and "What's the matter
with you?" Which words he learned of me, from
my frequent saying so to him, when he used to make
his ordinary wild noise and screaming that I did not
like.
The more I was satisfied that there was nothing in
the room, at least to be seen, the more another concern
came upon me. "Lord!" says I aloud, "this is the
devil!" "Hold your tongue," says Poll. I was so
mad at the bird, though the creature knew nothing of
the matter, that if he had hung near me, I believe I
should have killed him. I put my clothes on, and sat
me down, for I could not find in my heart to go to
bed again, and as I sat down, " I am terribly frighted,"
said I. "What's the matter with you i" says Poll.
"You toad," said I, "I'd knock your brains out if
you were here." "Hold your tongue," says he again,
and then fell to chattering "Robin Crusoe," and "Poor
Robin Crusoe," as he used to do.
Had I been in any reach of a good temper, it had
been enough to have composed me, but I was quite
gone; I was fully possessed with a belief that it was
the devil, and I prayed most heartily to God to be
delivered from the power of the evil spirit.
After some time I composed myself a little, and
went to bed again, and lying just in the posture as I
was in before, I felt a little of the tingling in my
blood which I felt before, and I resolved to lie still,
let it be what it would; it came up as high as my 
knee, as before, but no higher; and now I began to
see plainly that it was all a distemper, that it was
something paralytic, and that affected the nerves; but
I had not either experience of such a thing, or know-
ledge of diseases enough to be fully satisfied of the
nature of them, and whether anything natural, any
numbness or dead palsy affecting one part of the thigh,
could feel as that did, till some months after that I
felt something of the very same again at my first lying
down in my bed for three or four nights together,
which at first gave me a little concern as a distemper,
but at last gave me such satisfaction, that the first was
nothing but the same thing in a higher degree; that
the pleasure of knowing it was only a disease was far
beyond the concern at the danger of it, though a dead
palsy to one in my condition might reasonably have
been one of the most frightful things in Nature, since,
having nobody to help me, I must have inevitably
perished for mere want of food, not being able to go
from place to place to fetch it.
But to go back to the case in hand, and to the
apprehension I had been in all the several months
that passed between the first of this and the last, I
went about with a melancholy, heavy heart, fully
satisfied that the devil had been in my room, and lay
upon my bed.
Sometimes I would try to argue myself a little out
of it, asking myself whether it was reasonable to
imagine the devil had nothing else to do than to come
thither, and only lie down upon me, and go away about
his business, and say not one word to me; what end
it could answer; and whether I thought the devil was
really busied about such trifles; or whether he had
not employment enough of a higher nature, so that
such a thing as that could be worth his while.
But still, then, I was answered with my own thoughts returning thus—What could it be? Or, if
it was not a devil, what was it? This I could not
answer by any means at all; and so I still sunk under
the belief that it was the devil, and nothing but the
devil.
You may be sure, while I had this fancy in my
head, I was of course overrun with the vapours, and
had all the hypochondriac fancies that ever any melan-
choly head could entertain; and what with ruminating
on the print of a foot upon the sand, and the weight of
the devil upon me in my bed, I made no difficulty to
conclude that the old gentleman really visited the
place; and, in a word, it had been easy to have
possessed me, if I had continued so much longer, that
it was an enchanted island, that there were a million
of evil spirits in it, and that the devil was lord of the
manor.
I scarce heard the least noise, near or far off, but I
started, and expected to see a devil; every distant
bush upon a hill, if I did not particularly remember it
before, was a man, and every stump an apparition;
and I scarce went twenty yards together, by night or
by day, without looking behind me.
Sometimes, indeed, I took a little heart, and would
say, "Well, let it be the devil if it will! God is
master of the devil, and he can do me no hurt unless
he is permitted; he can be nowhere but He that made
him is there too;" and, as I said afterwards, when I
was frighted with the old goat in a cave, "He is not
fit to live all alone in such an island for twenty years
that would be afraid to see the devil."
But all these things lasted but a short while, and the
vapours that were raised at first were not to be so
easily laid; for, in a word, it was not mere imagination,
but it was the imagination raised up to disease; nor
did it ever quite wear off till I got my man Friday with me, of whom I have said so much; and then,
having company to talk to, the hypo wore off, and I
did not see any more devils after that.
Before I leave this part, I cannot but give a caution
to all vapourish, melancholy people, whose imaginations
run this way; I mean about seeing the devil, appari-
tions, and the like; namely, that they should never
look behind them, and over their shoulders, as they go
upstairs, or look into the corners and holes of rooms
with a candle in their hands, or turn about to see who
may be behind them in any walks or dark fields, lanes,
or the like; for let such know, they will see the devil
whether he be there or no; nay, they will be so
persuaded that they do see him, that their very imagina-
tion will be a devil to them wherever they go.
But after all this is said, let nobody suggest that
because the brain-sick fancy, the vapourish hypochon-
driac imagination represents spectres and spirits to us,
and makes apparitions for us, that therefore there are
no such things as spirits, both good and evil, any more
than we should conceive that there is no devil, because
we do not see him.
The devil has witnesses of his being and nature, just
as God Himself has of His; they are not indeed so
visible or so numerous, but we are all able to bring
evidence of the existence of the devil from our own
frailties, as we are to bring evidence of the existence
of God from the faculties of our souls, and from the
contexture of our bodies.
As our propensity to evil rather than good is a
testimony of the original depravity of human nature, so
the harmony between the inclination and the occasion
is a testimony which leaves the presence of the evil
spirit with us out of question.
Not that the devil is always the agent in our tempta-
tions, for though the devil is a very diligent fellow, and L-
always appears ready to fall in with the allurement,
yet the Scripture clears him, and we must do so too,
of being the main tempter; 'tis our own corrupt,
debauched inclination, which is the first moving agent;
and therefore the Scripture says, "A man is tempted
when he is drawn away of his own lusts, and enticed."
The devil, who, as I said, is a very diligent fellow in
the infernal work, and is always ready to forward the
mischief, is also a very cunning fellow, and knows how
most dexterously to suit alluring objects to the allurable
dispositions; to procure ensnaring things, and lay them
in the way of the man whom he finds so easily to be
ensnared; and he never fails to prompt all the mischief
he can, full of stratagem and art, to ensnare us by the
help of our corrupt affections, and these are called
"Satan's devices."
But having charged Satan home in that part, I must
do the devil that justice as to own that he is the most
slandered, most abused creature alive; thousands of
crimes we lay to his charge that he is not guilty of;
thousands of our own infirmities we load him with
which he has no hand in; and thousands of our sins,
which, as bad as he is, he knows nothing of 5 calling
him our tempter, and pretending we did so and so as
the devil would have it, when on the contrary the
devil had no share in it, and we were only led away
of our own lusts, and enticed.
But now, having made this digression in the devil's
defence, I return to the main question, that of the
being of the devil, and of evil spirits; this I believe,
there is no room to doubt of; but this, as I have observed,
is not the thing; these are not the spirits I am speak-
ing of, but I shall come directly to what I mean, and
speak plain without any possibility of being misunder-
stood.
I make no question but that there is not only a world of spirits, but that there is a certain knowledge
of it, though to us impossible as to the manner of it;
there is a certain converse between the world of spirits,
and the spirits in this world; that is to say, between
spirits uncased or unembodied and souls of men em-
bodied or cased up in flesh and blood, as we all are
on this side death.
It is true that we cannot describe this converse
of spirits, as to the way of it, the manner of the
communication, or how things are mutually conveyed
from one to another. How intelligences are given
or received, we know not; we know but little of their
being conveyed this way from the spirits unembodied
to ours that are in life; and of their being conveyed
that way, namely, from us to them—of that we know
nothing. The latter certainly is done without the
help of the organ, the former is conveyed by the
understanding, and the retired faculties of the soul, of
which we can give very little account.
"For spirits, without the help of voice, converse."
Let me, however, give, as reasons for my opinion,
some account of the consequences of this converse of
spirits; I mean, such as are quite remote from what
we call apparition or appearance of spirits; and I omit
these, because I know they are objected much against,
and they bear much scandal from the frequent imposi-
tions of our fancies and imaginations upon our judg-
ments and understandings, as above.
But the more particular discoveries of this converse
of spirits, and which to me are undeniable, are such
as follows, namely,—
Dreams Impulses Involuntary sad- Voices Hints ness, &c.
Noises Apprehensions Dreams are dangerous things to talk of; and we
have such dreaming about them, that indeed the least
encouragement to lay any weight upon them is presently
carried away by a sort of people that dream waking,
and that run into such wild extremes about them, that
indeed we ought to be very cautious what we say of
them.
It is certain dreams of old were the ways by which
God Himself was pleased to warn men, as well what
to do, as what not to do; what services to perform,
what evils to shun. Joseph, the husband of the blessed
Virgin Mary, was appeared to in both these (Matt. ii.
13, 19). He was directed of God, in a dream, to go
into Egypt; and he was bid return out of Egypt in a
dream; and in the same chapter, the wise men of the
East were warned of God in a dream to depart into
their own country another way to avoid the fury of
Herod.
Now as this, and innumerable instances through the
whole Scripture, confirm that God did once make use
of this manner to convey knowledge and instruction to
men, I wish I could have this question well answered,
viz., Why are we now to direct people to take no notice
of their dreams?
But farther; it appears that this was not only the
method God Himself took by His immediate power,
but it is evident He made use of it by the ministry
of spirits; the Scripture says in both the cases of
Joseph above named, that the "angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a dream." Now every unem-
bodied spirit is an angel of the Lord in some sense;
and as angels and spirits may be the same thing in
respect of this influence upon us in dreams, so it is
still; and when any notice for good, or warning against
evil, is given us in a dream, I think 'tis no arrogance
at all for us to say the angel of the Lord appeared to us in a dream; or to say some good spirit gave me
warning of this in a dream ;— take this which way you
will.
That I may support this with such undeniable argu-
ments, drawn from examples of the fact, as no man
will, or reasonably can oppose, I first appeal to the
experience of observing people; I mean, such people
as observe these things without a superstitious depen-
dence upon the signification of them, that look upon
dreams but with such a moderate regard to them as
may direct to a right use of them. The question I
would ask of such is, whether they have never found
any remarkable event of their lives so evidently fore-
told them by a dream, as that it must of necessity be
true that some invisible being foresaw the event, and
gave them notice of it? And that, had that notice
been listened to, and the natural prudence used which
would have been used if it had been certainly dis-
covered, that evil event might have been prevented?
I would ask others whether they have not, by
dreams, been so warned of evil really approaching, as
that, taking the hint, and making use of the caution
given in those dreams, the evil has been avoided? If
I may speak my own experience, I must take leave to
say, that I never had any capital mischief befall me in
my life but I have had notice of it by a dream; and
if I had not been that thoughtless, unbelieving creature,
which I now would caution other people against, I
might have taken many a warning, and avoided many
of the evils that I afterwards fell into merely by a total
obstinate neglect of those dreams.
In like manner I have in some of the greatest
distresses of my life been encouraged to believe firmly
and fully that I should one time or other be delivered;
and I must acknowledge, that in my greatest and most
hopeless banishment I had such frequent dreams of my deliverance, that I always entertained a firm and satis-
fying belief that my last days would be better than my
first; all which has effectually come to pass.
From which I cannot determine, as I know some
do, that all dreams are mere dozings of a delirious
head, delusions of a waking devil, and relics of the
day's thoughts and perplexities, or pleasures. Nor do
I see any period of time fixed between the two op-
posite circumstances — namely, when dreams were to
be esteemed the voice of God and when the delusion
of the devil.
I know some have struggled hard to fix that par-
ticular article, and to settle it as a thing going hand
in hand with the Jewish institutions; as if the oracle
ceasing in the temple with the consummation of the
typical law, all the methods which Heaven was pleased
to take in the former times for revealing His will to
men were to cease also at the same time, and the
Gospel revelation being fully and effectually supplied
by the mission of the Holy Spirit, dreams and all the
uses and significations of dreams were at an end, and
the esteem and regard to the warnings and instructions
of dreams was to expire also.
But the Scripture is point-blank against this in the
history of fact relating to Ananias and the conversion
of St Paul, and in the story of St. Peter and Cornelius,
the devout centurion at Antioch; both of them emi-
nent instances of God's giving notice of His pleasure
to men by the interposition or medium of a dream.
The first of these is in Acts ix. 10: "There was a
certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. To
him said the Lord in a vision," &c.; the words
spoken in this vision to Ananias, directing to go to
seek out one Saul of Tarsus, go on thus (ver. 12),
"and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias
coming in."

The other passage is of St. Peter and Cornelius the
centurion (Acts x. vers. 3, 10, 11). In the third verse
it is said, Cornelius, fasting and praying, saw a vision,
which afterwards, in the 22nd verse, is called an holy
angel warning him; in the 30th verse it is said, "a
man stood before me in bright clothing;" at the same
time (ver. 10) it is said, St. Peter was praying and fell
into a trance — this we all agreed to be a possession of
sleep, or a deep sleep — and in this trance it is said he
saw heaven opened; that is to say, he dreamed that
he saw heaven opened; it could be nothing else, for
no interpreters will offer to insist that heaven was
really opened; also, the hearing a voice (vers. 13, 15)
must be in a dream. Thus 'tis apparent the will of
God concerning what we are to do or not to do, what
is or is not to befall us, is and has been thus conveyed
by vision or dream since the expiration of the Levitical
dispensation, and since the mission of the Holy Ghost.
When, then, did it cease 1 And if we do not know
when it ceased, how then are we sure it is at all ceased,
and what authority have we now to reject all dreams
or visions of the night, as they are called, more than
formerly?
I will not say but there may be more nocturnal
delusions now in the world than there were in those
times; and perhaps the devil may have gained more
upon mankind in these days than he had then, though
we are not let into those things enough to know
whether it is so or not; nor do we know that there
were not as many unsignifying dreams in those days
as now, and perhaps as much to be said against
depending upon them 5 though I think there is not
one word in Scripture said to take off the regard men
might give to dreams, or to lessen the weight which
they might lay on them.
The only text that I think looks like it is the flout Joseph's brethren put upon him, or threw out at him,
when they were speaking of him with contempt (Gen.
xxxvii. 19), "Behold, this dreamer cometh; and
again (ver. 20), "Let us slay him and cast him into
some pit, and we shall see what will become of his
dreams."
This, indeed, looks a little like the present language
against dreams; but even this is sufficiently rebuked
in the consequences, for those dreams of Joseph did
come all to pass, and proving the superior influence
such things have upon the affairs of men, in spite of all
the contempt they can cast upon them.
The maxim I have laid down to myself for my
conduct in this affair is, in few words, that we should
not lay too great stress upon dreams, and yet not
wholly neglect them.
I remember I was once present where a long dis-
pute was warmly carried on between two persons of
my acquaintance upon this very subject, the one a
layman, the other a clergyman, but both very pious
and religious persons. The first thought there was
no heed at all to be given to dreams, that they could
have no justifiable original, that they were delusions
and no more, that it was atheistical to lay any stress
upon them, and that he could give such objections
against them as that no man of good principles could
avoid being convinced by; that as to their being a
communication from the invisible to the visible world
'twas a chimera, and that he saw no foundation for
believing any reality in such a thing, unless I would
set up for a Popish limbus, or purgatory, which had no
foundation in the Scripture.
(1.) He said, if dreams were from the agency of any
prescient being, the notices would be more direct and
the discoveries clear — not by allegories and emblematic
fancies, expressing things imperfect and dark. For to 
what purpose should spirits unembodied sport with
mankind, warning him of approaching mischiefs by
the most ridiculous enigmas, figures, &c., leaving the
wretch to guess what awaited him, though of the
utmost consequence, and to perish if he mistook the
meaning of it; and leaving him sometimes perfectly
at a loss to know whether he was right or wrong, and
without any rule or guide to walk by in the most diffi-
cult cases?
(2.) He objected, that with the notice of evil, sup-
pose it to be rightly understood, there was not given a
power to avoid it, and therefore it could not be alleged
that the notice was any way kind, and that it was not
likely to proceed from a beneficent spirit, but merely
fortuitous, and of no significancy.
(3.) He objected, that if such notices as those were
of such weight, why were they not constant, but that
sometimes they were given and sometimes omitted,
though cases were equally important? and that, there-
fore, they did not seem to proceed from any agent
whose actions were to be fairly accounted for.
(4.) He said, that oftentimes we had very distinct
and formal dreams, without any signification at all, that
we could neither know anything probable or anything
rational of them; and that it would be profane to
suggest that to come from heaven which was too
apparently foolish and inconsistent.
(5.) As men were not always thus warned, or sup-
plied with notices of good or evil, so all men were
not alike supplied with them; and what reason could
we give why one man or one woman should not have
the same hints as another?
The clergyman gave distinct answers to all these
objections, and to me, I confess, very satisfactory;
whether they may be so to those that read them, is no
concern of mine; let every one judge for himself.
(1.) He said, that as to the signification of dreams,
and the objections against them, because dark and
doubtful, that they are expressed generally by hiero-
glyphical representations, similes, allusions, and figurative
emblematic ways of expressing things, was true, and
that by this means, for want of interpretation, the thing
was not understood, and consequently the evil not
shunned. This, he said, was the only difficulty that
remained to him in the case, but that he could see
nothing in it against the signification of them, because
thus it was before, for dreams were often allegoric and
allusive when they were evidently from God, and what
the end and design of Providence in that was, we
could not pretend to inquire.
(2.) To the second he said, we charged God fool-
ishly, to say He had given the notice of evil without
the power to avoid it, which he denied, and affirmed
that, if any one had not power to avoid the evil, it was
no notice to him that it was want of giving due heed
to that notice, not for want of the notice being suffi-
cient that any evil followed, and that men first neglected
themselves, and then charged the Judge of all the
earth with not doing right.
(3.) Likewise he said, the complaint that these notices
were not constant, was unjust, for he doubted not but
they were so, but our discerning was crazed and
clouded by our negligence in not taking due notice
of it; that we hookwinked our understanding by pre-
tending dreams were not to be regarded; and the
voice really spoke, but we refused to hear, being
negligent of our own good.
(4.) In the same sense he answered the fourth, and
it was a mistake to say that sometimes dreams had
no import at all; he said it was only to be said, none
that we could perceive the reason of, which was owing
to our blindness and supine negligence, to be secure at one time, and our heads too much alarmed at another,
so that the spirit which we might be said to be con-
versing with in a dream was constantly and equally
kind and careful; but our powers not always in the
same state of action, nor equally attentive to or reten-
tive of the hints that were given, or things might be
rendered more or less intelligible to us, as the powers
of our soul were more or less dozed or somniated with
the oppression of vapours from the body, which occa-
sions sleep; for though the soul cannot be said to sleep
itself, yet how far its operations may be limited, and
the understanding prescribed by the sleepiness of the
body, says he, I will not undertake; let the anatomist
judge of it who can account for the contexture of
the parts, and for their operations, which I cannot
answer to.
(5.) As to the last question, why people are not
equally supplied with such warnings, he said, this
seemed to be no question at all in the case, for Provi-
dence itself might have some share in the direction of
it, and then that Providence might perhaps be limited
by some superior direction, the same that guides all the
solemn dispositions of Nature, and was a wind blowing
where it listeth; that as to the converse of spirits,
though he allowed the thing itself, yet he did not tie it
up to a stated course of conversing, that it should be
the same always, and to all people, and on all occa-
sions, but that it seemed to be spontaneous, and conse-
quently arbitrary, as if the spirits unembodied had it
left to them to converse as they thought fit, how,
where, and with whom they would; that all he an-
swered for in that discourse was for the thing itself,
that such a thing there was, but why there was so
much of it, or why no more, was none of his business,
and he believed a discovery was not yet made to man-
kind of that part. III. R
I thought it would be much to the purpose to remark
this opinion of another man, because it corresponded
so exactly with my own; but I have not done with my
friend, for he led me into another inquiry, which, in-
deed, I had not taken so much notice of before, and
this was introduced by the following question:—
"You seem," says he, "to be very inquisitive about
dreams, and to doubt — though I think you have no
reason for it — of the reality of the world of spirits,
which dreams are such an evidence of. Pray," says
he, "what think you of waking dreams, trances, visions,
noises, voices, hints, impulses, and all these waking
testimonies of an invisible world, and of the communi-
cation that there is between us and them, which are
generally entertained with our eyes open?"
This led me into many reflections upon past things,
which I had been witness to as well in myself as in
other people, and particularly in my former solitudes,
when I had many occasions to mark such things as
these, and I could not but entertain a free conversa-
tion with my friend upon this subject as often as I had
opportunity, of which I must give some account.
I had one day been conversing so long with him
upon the common received notions of the planets being
habitable, and of a diversity of worlds, that I think
verily I was for some days like a man transported into
these regions myself. Whether my imagination is more
addicted to realising the things I talk of, as if they
were in view, I know not, or whether by the power of
the converse of spirits I speak of I was at that ti.ne enabled to entertain clearer ideas of the invisible world,
I really cannot tell, but I certainly made a journey to
all those supposed habitable bodies in my imagination,
and I know not but it may be very useful to tell you
what I met with in my way, and what the wiser I
am for the discovery; whether you will be the wiser 
for the relation at second hand, I cannot answer for
that.
I could make a long discourse here of the power of
imagination, and how bright the ideas of distant things
may be found in the mind when the soul is more than
ordinarily agitated. It is certain the extraordinary
intelligence conveyed in this manner is not always re-
gular; sometimes it is exceeding confused, and the
brain being not able to digest it, turns round too fast;
this tends to lunacy and distraction, and the swiftness
of the motion these ideas come in with occasions a
commotion in Nature; the understanding is mobbed
with them, disturbed, runs from one thing to another,
and digests nothing; this is well expressed in our
common way of talking of a madman, namely, that his
head is turned. Indeed, I can liken it to nothing so
well as to the wheels of a windmill, which, if the sails
or wings are set, and the wind blow a storm, run round
so fast, that they will set all on fire if a skilful hand
be not ready to direct and manage it.
But not to enter upon this whimsical description of
lunacy, which, perhaps, may be nobody's opinion but
my own, I proceed thus, that when the head is strong,
and capable of the impressions, when the understanding
is empowered to digest the infinite variety of ideas
which present to it from the extended fancy, then, I
say, the soul of man is capable to act strangely upon
the invisibles in Nature, and upon futurity, realising
everything to itself in such a lively manner, that what
it thus thinks of it really sees, speaks to, hears, con-
verses with, &c., as lively as if the substance was really
before his face; and this is what I mean by those that
dream waking, by visions, trances, or what you please
to call them, for it is not necessary to this part that the
man should be asleep.
I return to my share of these things. It was after
ray conversing with my learned friend about the heavenly
bodies, the motion, the distances, and the bulk of the
planets, their situation, and the orbits they move in;
the share of light, heat, and moisture which they
enjoy; their respect to the sun; their influences upon
us; and, at last, the possibility of their being habitable,
with all the arcana of the skies; it was on this occasion,
I say, that my imagination, always given to wander,
took a flight of its own, and as I have told you that
I had an invincible inclination to travel, so I think I
travelled as sensibly, to my understanding, over all the
mazes and wastes of infinite space, in quest of those
things, as ever I did over the deserts of Karakathie,
and the uninhabited wastes of Tartary, and perhaps
may give as useful an account of my journey.
When first my fancy raised me up in the confines of
this vast abyss, and having now travelled through the
misty regions of the atmosphere could look down as
I mounted, and see the world below me, it is scarcely
possible to imagine how little, how mean, how despic-
able everything looked. Let any man but try this
experiment of himself, and he shall certainly find the
same thing; let him but fix his thoughts so intensely
upon what is and must necessarily be seen in a stage or
two higher than where we now live, removed from the
particular converse with the world, as to realise to his
imagination what he can suppose to be there, he shall
find all that is below him, as distant objects always do,
lessen in his mind as they do in his sight.
Could a man subsist without a supply of food, and
live but one mile in perpendicular height from the
surface, he would despise life and the world at such a
rate that he would hardly come down to have it be all
his own; the soul of man is capable of being continually
elevated above the very thoughts of human things — is
capable of travelling up to the highest and most distant regions of light, but when it does, as it rises above
the earthly globe, so the things of this globe sink to
him.
When I was at first lifted up in my imaginary travels,
this was the first thing of moment I remarked, namely,
how little the world and everything about it seemed to
me. I am not given to preach, or drawing long
corollaries, as the learned call them, but I recommend
it to my friends to observe that, could we always look
upon the things of life with the same eyes as we shall
do when we come to the edge of time, when one eye
can as it were look back on the world, and the other
look forward into eternity, we should save ourselves
the trouble of much repentance, and should scorn to
touch many of those things in which we now fancy
our chief felicity is laid up; believe me, we shall see
more with half an eye then, and judge better at first
glance, than we can now, with all our pretended wisdom
and penetration. In a word, all the passions and
affections suffer a general change upon such a view,
and what we desire before, we contemn them with
abhorrence.
Having begun to soar, the world was soon out of
sight, unless that as I rose higher, and could look at
her in a due position as to the sun, I could see her
turned into a moon, and shine by reflection. "Ay,
shine on," said I, "with thy borrowed rays, for thou
hast but very few of thy own."
When my fancy had mounted me thus beyond the
vestiges of the earth, and leaving the atmosphere behind
me, I had set my firm foot upon the verge of infinite,
when I drew no breath, but subsisted upon pure ether,
it is not possible to express fully the vision of the
place. First, you are to conceive of sight as unconfined,
and you see here at least the whole solar system at
one view. Nor is your sight bounded by the narrow '
circumference of one sun and its attendants of planets,
whose orbits are appropriated to its proper system, but
above and beyond, and on every side, you see innumer-
able suns, and, attending on them, planets, satellites,
and inferior lights, proper to their respective systems,
and all these moving in their subordinate circumstances,
without the least confusion, with glorious light and
splendour inconceivable.
In this first discovery 'tis most natural to observe
how plainly it is to be seen that the reason of the
creation of such immense bodies as the sun, stars,
planets, and moons, in the great circle of the lower
heaven, is far from being to be found in the study of
Nature on the surface of our earth, but he that will see
thoroughly why God has formed the heavens, the
work of His hands, and the moon and the stars which
He has made, must soar up higher, and then, as he will
see with other eyes than he did before, so he will see
the God of Nature has formed an infinite variety which
we know nothing of, and that all the creatures are a
reason to one another for their creation.
I could not forget myself, however, when I was got
up thus high; I say, I could not but look back upon
the state of man in this life, how confined from these
discoveries, how vilely employed in biting and devour-
ing, envying and maligning one another, and all for the
vilest trifles that can be conceived.
But I was above it all here, and all those things
which appeared so afflicting before gave me not the
least concern now; for the soul being gone of this
errand had quite different notices of the whole state of
life, and was neither influenced by passions or affections,
as it was before.
Here I saw into many things by the help of a sedate
inquiry, that we can entertain little or no notion of in a
state of common superficial life, and I desire to leave a few remarks of this imaginary journey, as I did of my
ordinary travels.
When I came, I say, to look into the solar system
as I have hinted, I saw perfectly the emptiness of our
modern notions that the planets were habitable worlds,
and shall give a brief description of the case, that others
may see it too, without the necessity of taking so long
a journey.
And first for the word habitable: I understand the
meaning of it to be, that the place it is spoken of is
qualified for the subsistence and existence of man and
beast, and to preserve the vegetative and sensitive life,
and you may depend upon it that none of the planets,
except the moon, are in this sense habitable; and the
moon, a poor, little, watery, damp thing, not above as
big as Yorkshire, neither worth being called a world,
nor capable of rendering life comfortable to mankind,
if indeed supportable; and if you will believe one's
mind capable of seeing at so great a distance, I assure
you I did not see man, woman, or child there in all my
contemplative voyage to it: my meaning is, I did not
see the least reason to believe there was or could be any
there. As to the rest of the planets, I will take them
in their order. Saturn (the remotest from the sun,
which is in the centre of the system) is a vast extended
globe, of a substance cold and moist; its greatest degree
of light is never so much as our greatest darkness may
be said to be in clear weather, and its cold insufferable;
and if it were a body composed of the same elements
as our earth, its sea would be all brass, and its earth all
iron; that is to say, both would be continually frozen,
as the north pole in the winter solstice. What man
or men, and of what nature, could inhabit this frigid
planet, unless the Creator must be supposed to have
created animal creatures for the climate, not the climate
for the creatures? All the notions of Saturn's being a r
habitable world are contrary to nature, and incongruous
with sense; for Saturn is at so infinite a distance from
the sun, that it has not above one-ninetieth part of the
light and heat that we enjoy on our earth; so that the
light there may be said to be much less than our star-
light, and the cold ninety times greater than the coldest
day in our winter.
Jupiter is in the same predicament; his constitution,
however, in its degree much milder than Saturn, yet
certainly is not qualified for human bodies to subsist,
having only one twenty-seventh part of the light and
heat that we enjoy here; consequently its light is at
best as dim as our twilight, and its heat so little in the
summer of its situation as to be as far from comfortable
as it is in its winter situation insupportable.
Mars, if you will believe our ancient philosophers, is
a fiery planet in the very disposition of its influence, as
well as by the course of its motion; and yet even here
the light is not above one-half, and its heat one-third
of ours. And on the other hand, as Saturn is cold
and moist, so this planet is hot and dry, and would
admit no habitation of man, through the manifest in-
temperance of the air, as well as want of light to make
it comfortable, and moisture to make it fruitful; for by
the nature of the planet, as well as by clear-sighted
observation, there is never any rain, vapour, fog, or
dew in that planet.
Venus and Mercury are in the extreme the other
way, and would destroy nature by their heat and dazzling
light, as the other would by their darkness and cold;
so that you may depend upon it I could see very
clearly that all these bodies were neither inhabited
or habitable; and the earth only, as we call it, being
seated between these intemperances, appeared habitable,
surrounded with an atmosphere to defend it from the
invasion of the inconsistent ether, in which perspiration 
could not be performed by the lungs, and by which the
needful vapour it sends forth is preserved from dissipat-
ing into the waste and abyss, and is condensed, and
timely returns in showers of rain to moisten, cool, and
nourish the exhausted earth.
It is true the way I went was no common road, yet
I found abundance of passengers going to and fro here,
and particularly innumerable armies of good and evil
spirits, who all seemed busily employed, and continu-
ally upon the wing, as if some expresses passed between
the earth, which in this part of my travels I place
below me, and some country infinitely beyond all that
I could reach the sight of; for, by the way, though
I take upon me in this sublime journey to see a great
deal of the invisible world, yet I was not arrived to
a length to see into any part of the world of light
beyond it all. That vision is beyond all, and I pretend
to say nothing of it here, except this only, that a
clear view of this part with optics unclouded is a
great step to prepare the mind for a look into the
other.
But to return to my station in the highest created
world; flatter not yourselves that those regions are
uninhabited because the planets appear to be so. No,
no; I assure you this is that world of spirits, or at
least is a world of spirits.
Here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being
the prince of the power of the air; 'tis in this bound-
less waste he is confined, whether it be his busy rest-
less inclination has posted him here, that he may
affront God in His government of the world, and do
injury to mankind in mere envy to his happiness, as
the famed Mr. Milton says it, or whether it is that
by the eternal decree of Providence he is appointed
to be man's continual disturber for Divine ends, to us
unknown; this I had not wandered far enough to be informed of, those secrets being lodged much higher
than imagination itself ever travelled. But here, I say, I found Satan keeping his court, or
camp we may call it, which we please. The innumer-
able legions that attended his immediate service were
such that it is not at all to be wondered that he
supplied every angle of this world, and had his work
going forward, not in every country only, but even in
every individual inhabitant of it, with all the dexterity
and application imaginable.
This sight gave me a just idea of the devil as a
tempter, but really let me into a secret which I did not
so well know before, or at least did not consider,
namely, that the devil is not capable of doing half the
mischief in the world that we lay to his charge. That
he works by engines and agents, stratagems and art, is
true, and a great deal is owing to his vigilance and
application, for he is a very diligent fellow in his calling.
But 'tis plain his power is not so great as we imagine;
he can only prompt to the crime — he cannot force us to
commit it; so that if we sin it is all our own, the
devil has only to be charged with the art of insinuation.
Just as he began with Eve, he goes on with us; in
short, he reasons us out of our resolutions to do well,
and wheedles us to an agreement to do ill, working us
up to an opinion, that what evil we are about to do is
no sin, or not so great a sin as we feared, and so draws
us by art into the crime we had resolved against. This,
indeed, the Scripture intimates when it speaks of Satan's
devices, the subtlety of the wicked one, his lying in
wait, &c. But to charge the devil with forcing us to
offend, is doing the devil a great deal of wrong; our
doing evil is from the native propensity of our wills:
humanum est peccare. I will not enter here into the
dispute about original corruption in nature, which I know
many good and learned men dispute; but that there is a secret aptness to offend, and a secret backwardness
to what is good, which, if it is not born with us, we
can give no account how we came by, this I think
every man will grant; and that this is the devil that
tempts us the Scripture plainly tells us, when it says,
"Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his
own lust and enticed."
There is a secret love of folly and vanity in the
mind, and mankind are hurried down the stream of
their own affections into crime; 'tis agreeable to them
to do this, and 'tis a force upon nature not to do it.
Vice is down hill, and when we do offend,
'Tis nature all, we act as we intend.
Virtue's up hill, and all against the grain,
Resolved reluctant, and pursued with pain.
But to return to the devil: his power not extending
to creation, and being not able to force the world into
an open rebellion against Heaven, as doubtless he would
do if he could, he is left to the exercise of his skill;
and, in a word, we may say of him, that he lives by his
wits, that is to say, maintains his kingdom by subtlety
and most exquisite cunning; and if my vision of his
politics is not a new discovery, I am very much
mistaken.
His innumerable legions, as I hinted above, like
aides-de-camp to a general, are continually employed to
carry his orders and execute his commissions in all
parts of the world, and in every individual to oppose
the authority of God and the felicity of man to the
utmost of his power.
The first and greatest part of his government is over
those savage nations where he has obtained to set him-
self up as God, and to be worshipped instead of God;
and I observed that though, having full possession of
these people, even by whole nations at a time, that is
the easiest part of his government; yet he is far from neglecting his interest there, but is exceeding vigilant to
keep up his authority among those people. This he
does by sending messengers into those parts to answer
the pawawings or conjurings even of the most ignorant
old wizard, raising storms and making noises, and
shrieks in the air, flashes of infernal fire, and anything
but to fright the people, that they may not forget him,
and that they may have no other gods but him.
He has his peculiar agents for this work, which he
makes detachments of, as his occasions require, some
to one part of the world, some to another, as to the
North America, even as far as to the frozen provinces
of Greenland; to the north of Europe, to the Lap-
landers, Samoiedes, and Mongol Tartars; also to the
Gog and Magog of Asia, and to the devil-makers of
China and Japan; again to the southern parts of Asia,
to the isles of the Indian and South Seas, and to the
south part of America and Africa.
Through all these parts he has an uncontrolled power,
and is either worshipped in person or by his representa-
tives, the idols and monsters which the poor people bow
down to, and Satan has very little trouble with them.
He employs, indeed, some millions of his missionaries
into those countries, who labour ad propagand. Jid., and
fail not to return and bring him an account of their
success, and I doubt not but some of them were at my
hand in my island when the savages appeared there;
for if the devil had not been in them, they would hardly
have come straggling over the sea so far to devour one
another.
In all these countries the brutality, the cruelty, and
ravenous bloody dispositions of the people, is to me a
certain testimony that the devil has full possession of
them.
But to return to my observations in the exalted state
of my fancy; I must tell you that though the devil carried on his schemes of government in those blinded
parts of the world with great ease and all things went to
his mind, I found he had more difficulty in the north-
ern parts of the temperate zone; I mean, our climate
and the rest of Christendom, and consequently he did
not act here by whole squadrons and by generals, but
was obliged to carry on his business among us by
particular solicitations, to act by particular agents upon
particular persons, attacking the personal conduct of
men in a manner peculiar to himself. But so far was
this difficulty from being any advantage to the world,
or disadvantage to the devil, that it only obliged him to
make use of the more engines; and as he had no want
of numbers, I observed that his whole clan seemed busy
on this side, the number of which consists of innumer-
able millions; so that, in short, there was not a devil
wanting, no, not to manage every individual man,
woman, and child in the world.
How, and in what manner, evil angels attend us,
what their business, how far their power extends, and
how far it is restrained, and by whom, were all made
plain to me at one view in this state of eclaircissement
that I stood in now, and I will describe it if I can in
a few heads of fact; you may enlarge upon them as
experience guides.
And first, the limitations of the devil's power are
necessary to be understood, and how directed. For
example, you must know, that though the numbers
of these evil spirits, which are thus diligently employed
in mischief, are so infinitely great, yet the numbers of
good angels or good spirits which are employed by a
superior authority, and from a place infinitely distant
and high above the devil's bounds, is not only equal,
I say equal at least, in number, but infinitely superior
in power, and it is this particular which makes it plain
that all the devil does, or that his agents can do, is by continual subtlety, extreme vigilance and application,
under infinite checks, rebukes, and callings off by the
attendant spirits, who have power to correct and re-
strain him upon all occasions, just as a man does a dog
or a thief when he is discovered.
On this account it is first plain, I say, that the devil
can do nothing by force; he cannot kill, maim, hurt,
or destroy; if he could, mankind would have but a
very precarious state of life in the world; nay the
devil cannot blast the fruits of the earth, cause dearth,
droughts, famine, or scarcity; neither can he spread
noxious fumes in the air to infect the world; if any
of those things were in his power, he would soon
unpeople God's creation, and put his Maker to the
necessity of a new fiat, or of having no more human
creatures to worship and honour Him.
You will ask me how I came to know all this? I
say, ask me no questions till the elevation of your fancy
carries you up to the outer edge of the atmosphere, as
I tell you mine did. There you will see the prince of
the air in his full state, managing his universal empire
with the most exquisite art; but if ever you can come
to a clear view of his person, do but look narrowly,
and you will see a great clog at his foot, in token of
his limited power; and though he himself is immense
in bulk, and moves like a fiery meteor in the air, yet
you always see a hand with a thunderbolt impending
just over his head; the arm coming out of a fiery
cloud, which is a token of the sentence he is under,
that at the end of his appointed time that cloud shall
break, and that hand strike him with the thunder
represented, down, down, for ever, into a place pre-
pared for him.
But all this does not hinder him, who is prompted
by infernal rage against the kingdom of God and the
welfare of man, from pushing mankind, as above, upon all the methods of their own ruin and destruction, by
alluring baits, cunning artifice, night whispers, infusing
wicked desires, and fanning the flames of men's lusts,
pride, avarice, ambition, revenge, and all the wicked
excursions of corrupt nature.
It would take up a long tract by itself to form a
system of the devil's politics, and to lay down a body
of his philosophy. I observed, however, that some of
his general rules are such as these:—
(1.) To infuse notions of liberty into the minds of
men; that it is hard they should be born into the
world with inclinations, and then be forbidden to
gratify them; that such and such pleasure should
be prepared in the nature of things, made suitable
and proper to the senses and faculties, which on the
other hand are prepared in mere constitution, and
placed in his soul, and that then he should be for-
bidden, under the penalty of a curse, to taste them;
that to place an appetite in the man, and a strong
powerful gust to these delights, and then declare them
fatal to him, would be laying a snare to mankind in
his very constitution, and making his brightest faculties
be the betrayers of his soul to misery, which would not
consist with justice, much less with the goodness of a
creator. (2.) To persuade from hence, that the notions of
future punishments are fables and amusements, that it
is not rational to think a just God would prepare in-
finite and eternal punishments for finite and trivial
offences; that God does not take notice of the minute
acts of life, and lay every slip to our charge, but that
the merciful dispositions of God, who so bountifully
directs the whole world to be assistant to the profit and
delight of mankind, has certainly given him leave to
enjoy it at will, and take the comfort of it without fear.
(3.) Of late, indeed, the devil has learned—for devils may improve as well as men in the arts of doing
ill — at last, I say, he has learned to infuse a wild
notion into the heads of some people, who are first
fitted for it by having reasoned themselves in favor of
their loose desires up to a pitch, that there is no such
thing as a God or a future state at all.
Now, as at first the devil was not fool enough to
attempt to put this jest upon man, his own antiquity
and eternity being a contradiction to it; so I found
among my new discoveries that the devil took this
absurdity from man himself, and that it went among
Satan's people for a new invention. I found also
that there was a black party employed upon this new
subtlety; these were a sort of devils, for Satan never
wants instruments, who were called insinuators, and
who were formerly employed to prompt men to crimes
by dreams; and here I shall observe, that I learned a
way how to make any man dream of what I please.
For example: suppose one to be sound asleep, or, as
we say, in a deep sleep or dead sleep, let another lay
his mouth close to his ear and whisper anything to
him so softly as not to awaken him, the sleeping man
shall certainly dream of what was so whispered to him.
Let no man despise this hint: nothing is more sure
than that many of our dreams are the whispers of the
devil, who, by his insinuators, whispers into our heads
what wicked things he would have our thoughts enter-
tain and work upon; and take this with you as you
go, those insinuating devils can do this as well when
we are awake as when we are asleep. And this will
bring me to what I call impulses upon the mind, which
are certainly whispers in the ear and no other, and
come either from good angels attending us, or from
the devil's insinuators, which are always at hand, and
may be judged of according as the subject our thoughts
are prompted to work upon is good or evil.
From whence but from these insinuators come our
causeless passions, our involuntary wickedness, sinning
in desire as effectually as by actual committing the
crime we desire to commit?
Whence comes imagination to work upon wicked
and vicious objects when the person is fast asleep, and
when he had not been under the preparation of wicked
discourse or wicked thoughts previous to those imagina-
tions? Who forms ideas in the mind of man? who
presents beautiful or terrible figures to his fancy, when
his eyes are closed with sleep? who but these insinuat-
ing devils, who invisibly approach the man, sleeping
or waking, and whisper all manner of lewd, abominable
things into his mind.
Mr. Milton, whose imagination was carried up to
a greater height than I am now, went farther into
the abyss of Satan's empire a great way, especially
when he formed Satan's palace of pandemonium; I
say, he was exactly of this opinion when he re-
presented the devil tempting our mother Eve in the
shape of a toad lying just at her ear, when she lay
fast asleep in her bower, where he whispered to her
ear all the wicked things which she entertained notions
of by night, and which prompted her the next day
to break the great command, which was the rule of
her life; and, accordingly, he brings in Eve, telling
Adam what an uneasy night's rest she had, and re-
lating her dream to him.
This thought, however laid down in a kind of jest,
is very seriously intended, and would, if well digested,
direct us very clearly in our judgment of dreams, viz.,
not to suggest them to be always things of mere chance;
but that sometimes they are to be heeded as useful
warnings of evil or good by the agency of good spirits,
as at other times they are the artful insinuations of the
devil to inject wicked thoughts and abhorred abominable III S
ideas into the mind; which we ought not only as much
as possible to guard against, but even to repent of so
far as the mind may have entertained and acted upon
them.
From this general vision of the devil's management
of his affairs, which I must own I have had with my
eyes wide open, I find a great many useful observations
to be made; and first, it can be no longer strange that,
while the commerce of evil spirits is so free and the
intercourse between this world and that is thus open,
I say, it can be no longer strange that there are so many
silent ways of spirits conversing; I mean, spirits of all
kinds.
For, as I have observed already, there is a residence
of good spirits, but they are placed infinitely higher,
out of the reach and out of the sight of this lower
orbit of Satan's kingdom; as those pass and repass
invisible, I confess I have yet had no ideas of them
but those which I have received from my first view of
the infernal region. If I should have any superior
elevations, and should be able to see the economy of
Heaven in His disposition of things on earth, I shall
be as careful to convey them to posterity as they
come in.
However, the transactions of good spirits with man
are certainly the same; for as God has, for a protec-
tion and safeguard to mankind, limited the devil from
affrighting him by visible appearances in his native and
hellish deformity, and the horrid shape he would neces-
sarily bear; so, for man's felicity, even the glorious
angels of heaven are very seldom allowed, at least not
lately, to appear in the glorious forms they formerly
took, or, indeed, in any form, or with a voice; the
restraint of our souls in the case of flesh and blood we
now wear not admitting it, and not being able to fami-
liarise those things to us; man being by no means, in his incorporated state, qualified for an open and easy
conversation with unembodied spirit.
Moreover, this would be breaking into the limits
which the wisdom and goodness of God has put to
our present state, I mean as to futurity, our ignorance
in which is the greatest felicity of human life; and
without which necessary blindness man could not sup-
port life, for nature is no way able to support a view
into futurity; I mean, not into that part of futurity
which concerns us in our state of life in this world.
I have often been myself among the number of those
fools that would be their own fortune-tellers; but when
I look thus beyond the atmosphere, and see a little
speculatively into invisibles, I could easily perceive that
it is our happiness that we are shortsighted creatures,
and can see but a very little before us. For example,
were we to have the eyes of our souls opened through
the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very imme-
diate region of air which we breathe in thronged with
spirits, to us, blessed be God, now invisible, and which
would otherwise be most frightful; we should see into
the secret transactions of those messengers who are
employed when the passing soul takes its leave of the
reluctant body, and perhaps see things nature would
shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaze-
ment. In a word, the curtain of Providence for the
disposition of things here, and the curtain of judgment
for the determination of the state of souls hereafter,
would be alike drawn back; and what heart could
support here its future state in life, much less that of
its future state after life, even good or bad?
It is, then, our felicity that the converse of spirits
and the visions of futurity are silent, emblematic, and
done by hints, dreams, and impulses, and not by clear
vision and open discovery. They that desire a fuller
and plainer sight of these things ask they know not 
what; and it was a good answer of a gipsy, when a
lady of my acquaintance asked her to tell her fortune,
"Do not ask me, lady," said the gipsy, "to tell you
what you dare not hear." The woman was a little
honester than her profession intimated, and freely con-
fessed it was all a cheat, and that they knew nothing
of fortunes, but had a course or round of doubtful ex-
pressions, to amuse ignorant people and get a little
money.
Even the devil's oracles—for such, no doubt, they
were at Delphos and at other places, though the devil
seemed at that time to have some liberties granted him
which it is evident have since been denied him — were
allowed to be given only in doubtful expressions, double
entendres, echoes of words, and such like. For ex-
ample: a man going to sea, and inquiring of the oracle
thus—
"Have I just cause the seas and storms to fear?"
Echo —" Fear."
Another.
"Shall we the Parthian boatmen fight, or fly?"
Echo—"Fly."
Such dark replies, and other words doubtful and
enigmatic, were frequently given and taken for answers,
by which the deluded world were kept in doubt of
that futurity they hunted after. But Satan, even then,
was not permitted to speak plain, or mankind to see
what awaited them behind the dark veil of futurity;
nor was it proper, on any account whatsoever, that it
should be otherwise.
But before I come to this let me put some limits to
the elevations and visions I have mentioned before; for
as I am far from enthusiastic in my notions of things,
so I would not lead any one to fancy themselves farther enlightened than is meet, or to see things invisible, as
St. Paul heard things unutterable.
And, therefore, let me add here, that the highest
raptures, trances, and elevations of the soul are bounded
by the eternal decree of Heaven, and let men pretend
to what visions they please, it is all romance; all
beyond what I have talked of above is fabulous and
absurd, and it will for ever be true, as the Scripture
says, not only those things are hid from the eye, but
even from the conception.
Upon this occasion, I must own that I think it is
criminal to attempt to form ideas either of hell or of
heaven in the mind, other than as the Scripture has
described them, by the state rather than the place.
We are told, in plain words, it hath not entered into
the heart of man to conceive either of what is prepared
for the future state of the happy or miserable; 'tis
enough for us to entertain the general notion — the
favour of God is heaven, and the loss of it the most
dreadful of all, hell.
A heaven of joy must in His presence dwell,
And in His absence every place is hell.
My meaning is this; all visions, or propounded
visions, either of heaven or hell, are mere delusions
of the mind, and generally are fictions of a waking
bewildered head; and you may see the folly of them
in the meanest of the descriptions, which generally end
in showing some glorious place, fine walks, noble
illustrious palaces, gardens of gold, and people of
shining forms and the like. Alas! these are all so
short that they are unworthy the thoughts of a mind
elevated two degrees above darkness and dirt. All
these things amount to no more than Mahomet's
Alcoran and the glorious state of things represented by
him to his believers. In short, all this makes only a r
heaven of sense, but comes so infinitely short of what
alone must or can be a heaven to an exalted glorified
spirit, that I as much want words to express how
contemptible the best of these descriptions are as to a
true description of heaven as I do to express a true idea
or description of heaven myself.
And how should this be done? We can form no
idea of anything that we know not and have not seen
but in the form of something that we have seen. How,
then, can we form an idea of God or heaven in any
form but of something which we have seen or known?
By what image in the mind can we judge of spirits?
By what idea conceive of eternal glory? Let us cease
to imagine concerning it; 'tis impossible to attain, it is
criminal to attempt it.
Let me, therefore, hint here, that supposing myself,
as before, in the orbit of the sun, take it in its immense
distance as our astronomers conceive of it, or on the
edge only of the atmosphere with a clear view of the
whole solar system, the region of Satan's empire all in
view, and the world of spirits laid open to me:
Yet let me give you this for a check to your imagina-
tion, that even here the space between finite and infinite
is as impenetrable as on earth, and will for ever be so
till our spirits, being uncased, shall take their flight to
the centre of glory, where everything shall be seen as it
is; and therefore you must not be surprised if I am
come down again from the verge of the world of spirits
the same short-sighted wretch as to futurity and things
belonging to heaven and hell as I went up; for eleva-
tions of this kind are meant only to give us a clearer
view of what we are, not of what we shall be, and 'tis
an advantage worth travelling for too. All this I
thought necessary to prevent the whimsical building of
erroneous structures on my foundation, and fancying
themselves carried farther than they are able to go.

I come, therefore, back to talk of things familiar,
and particularly to mention in the next place some of
those other ways by which we have notice given of this
converse of spirits which I have been speaking of; for the
whispers and insinuators I have mentioned go sometimes
farther than ordinary.
One of those other methods is, when, by strong
impulses of the mind, as we call them, we are directed
to do or not to do this or that particular thing that we
have before us to do, or are under a consultation about.
I am a witness to many of these things, as well in my
own life as in my observation of others.
I know a man, who being at some distance from
London, not above six or seven miles, a friend that
came to visit and dine with him urged him to go to
London. "What for?" says his friend; "is there
any business wants me?"—"Nay, nothing," says the
other,"but for your company; I do not know of any-
thing wants you;" and so gave over importuning him.
But as his friend had given it over a strong impulse of
mind seized him and followed him, like a voice, with
this—Go to London, go to London. He put it by
several times, but it went on still — Go to London, go
to London, and nothing else could come upon his
thoughts but Go to London. He came back to his
friend, "Hark ye," says he, "tell me sincerely, is all
well at London? Am I wanted there? Did you
ask me to go to London with you on any particular
account ?" —" Not I," says his friend, "in the least;
I saw all your family, and all is very well there; nor
did they say they had any particular occasion for you to
return; I only ask it, as I told you, for the sake of
your company." So he put off going again, but could
have no quiet, for it still followed him, and no doubt a
good spirit communicated it — Go to London; and at
length he resolved he would go, and did so; and when he came there he found a letter, and messengers had
been at his house to seek him and to tell him of a parti-
cular business, which was, first and last, worth above a
thousand pounds to him, and which, if he had not been
found that very night, would have been in danger of
being lost.
I seriously advise all sober-thinking persons not to
disregard those powerful impulses of the mind in things
otherwise indifferent or doubtful, but believe them to be
whispers from some kind spirit, which sees something
that we cannot see, and knows something that we can-
not know.
Besides, unless infinite Power should take off the
silence that is imposed upon the inhabitants of the
invisible world, and allow them to speak audibly,
nothing can be a plainer voice; they are words spoken
to the mind, though not to the ear, and they are a cer-
tain intelligence of things unseen, because they are given
by persons unseen, and the event confirms it beyond all
dispute.
I know a man who made it his rule always to obey
these silent hints, and he has often declared to me that
when he obeyed them he never miscarried; and if he
neglected them, or went on contrary to them, he never
succeeded; and gave me a particular case of his own,
among a great many others, wherein he was thus
directed. He had a particular case befallen him,
wherein he was under the displeasure of the Govern-
ment, and was prosecuted for a misdemeanour, and
brought to a trial in the King's Bench Court, where a
verdict was brought against him, and he was cast; and
times running very hard at that time against the party
he was of, he was afraid to stand the hazard of a
sentence, and absconded, taking care to make due
provision for his bail, and to pay them whatever they
might suffer. In this circumstance he was in very great distress, and no way presented unto him but to
fly out of the kingdom, which, being to leave his family,
children, and employment, was very bitter to him, and
he knew not what to do; all his friends advising him
not to put himself into the hands of the law, which,
though the offence was not capital, yet, in his circum-
stances, seemed to threaten his utter ruin. In this
extremity he felt one morning—just as he awaked, and
the thoughts of his misfortune began to return upon
him — I say, he felt a strong impulse darting into his
mind thus, Write a letter to them. It spoke so dis-
tinctly to him, and as it were forcibly, that, as he has
often said since, he can scarce persuade himself not to
believe but that he heard it; but he grants that he really
did not hear it too.
However, it repeated the words daily and hourly to
him, till at length, walking about in his chamber, where
he was hidden, very pensive and sad, it jogged him
again, and he answered aloud to it, as if it had been a
voice, Who shall I write to? It returned immediately,
Write to the judge. This pursued him again for
several days, till at length he took his pen, ink, and
paper, and sat down to write, but knew not one word
of what he should say; but, dabitur in hoc hora, he
wanted not words. It was immediately impressed on his
mind, and the words flowed upon his pen in a manner
that even charmed himself, and filled him with expecta-
tions of success.
The letter was so strenuous in argument, so pathetic
in its eloquence, and so moving and persuasive, that as
soon as the judge read it he sent him word he should
be easy, for he would endeavour to make that matter
light to him; and, in a word, never left till he obtained
to stop prosecution, and restore him to his liberty and
to his family.
These hints, I say, are of a nature too significant to be neglected; whence they come is the next inquiry.
I answer, they are the whispers of some subsisting spirit
communicated to the soul without the help of the organ,
without the assistance of a particular sound, and without
any other communication; but, take it as you go, not
without the merciful disposition of that Power that
governs that world, as well as this that we are sensible
of. How near those spirits are to us, who thus foresee
what concerns us, and how they convey these hints into
our minds as well waking as sleeping, or how they are
directed, that I could not discover, nor can yet resolve,
no, not in the highest of my imaginary elevation, any
more than in what manner they are limited and re-
strained.
I have been asked by some, to whom I have talked
freely of my frequent applications to these things, if I
knew anything by those observations of the manner
of the disposition of the human soul after its departure
out of the body, I mean, as to its middle state, and
whether, as some, it has a wandering existence in the
upper part of the waste or abyss near to, but not in, a
present state of felicity? Whether it is still confined
within the atmosphere of the earth, according to others,
as in a limbus, or purgatory; or in the circle of the sun,
as others say? Whether I knew or perceived anything
of our Saviour's being ascended into the body of the
sun only, and not into the highest heaven, receiving His
redeemed souls to Himself, and into an incorporation
with His glory there, till the restitution of all things?
Whether I perceived anything of Satan being pos-
sessed of the reprobate souls as they departed; and
of his substitutes, as executioners, being empowered and
employed to torment them according to the received
notions of the wise contemplators of such things?
I answered, as I do now, that not only nothing
of all this appears, but, on the contrary, such serious contemplations as mine give a great and abundant reason to
be satisfied that there is nothing in it all but mere dream
and enthusiastic conjecture. I own that the agents I men-
tioned make use of all those things to terrify and affright
poor ignorant people out of their senses, and to drive
them often into desperation, and after to restore them
by a cure that is worse than the distemper, namely, by
a hardness and coldness of temper, rejecting entirely all
the notions of eternity and futurity, and so fitting them
to go out of the world as they lived in it, viz., without
troubling themselves with what is to come after it.
But I return to the article of impulses of the mind,
for I lay a greater weight upon these than upon any of
the other discoveries of the invisible world, because
they have something in them relating to what we are
about, something directing, something to guide us in
avoiding the evils that attend us, and to accepting, or
rather embracing, opportunities of doing ourselves good
when they present, which many times, for want of the
knowledge of our way, we irrecoverably let slip. Voices, apparitions, noises, and all the other affright-
ing things which unavoidably follow the neighbourhood
of spirits in the air we breathe in, seem to have much
less signification, as to us, than these seasonable kind
whispers to our souls, which, it is plain, are directed for
the advantage of life.
It seems hard that mankind should be so open to the
secret insinuators, the whispering devils I have been
speaking of, who are night and day, sleeping and
waking, working upon his senses by the arts and
subtleties of hell, to fill his imagination with a thousand
devilish contrivances to gratify his vanity and lust; and
that our thoughts should be always ready to receive the
impressions they make, pressed to follow the infernal
counsel, be awake to listen to all his directions, but
should be deaf to the instructions of any kind spirits that would influence us for our advantage, and insensible to
those impressions which are made upon us for our
immediate good by an agent good in itself, and acting
from a principle, whatever it be, of good to us.
We have a foolish saying, though taken from some-
thing that is more significant than we imagine, when
any danger has surprised us — Well, my mind misgave
me when I was going about it; well, I knew some
mischief would come of it. Did you so? And why
then did you do it? Why did you go on? Why,
when your mind misgave you, did you not obey the
friendly caution? Whence do you think your mind
received the speaking, though silent impression? Why
did you not listen to it as to a voice? For such a one
it was, no doubt; and let all those unthinking people
who go on in anything they are upon, contrary to those
secret, silent impressions upon their minds, I say, let
them know and observe it, they will very seldom fail of
meeting some mischief in the way. They will very
seldom fail of miscarrying in the way. I say very
seldom, because I would not take upon me to prescribe
things positively, which the reader will take me up
short in, and say, how do I know it? But I will take
the liberty to say, I durst be positive in it, relating to
myself, and I durst be positive from the nature and
reason of the thing.
As to my own experience, I waive saying much of
it, but that in general I never slighted these impulses
but to my great misfortune; I never listened to and
obeyed them, but to my great advantage; but I choose
to argue from the reason of them, rather than from my
own experience.
As they are evident warnings of what is to come,
and are testified daily and hourly by the things coming
to pass afterwards, so they are undeniable testimonies
that they proceed from some being, intelligent of those things that are at hand, while they are yet to come. If,
then, I am satisfied that it is a notice given from a
something, be it what it will, which is fully informed
of what is attending me, though concealed from me,
why should I slight the hint given me from anything
that knows what I know not, and especially, for example,
for avoiding evils to come?
I know a person, who had so strong an impression
upon her mind that the house she was in would be
burnt that very night, that she could not go to sleep;
the impulse she had upon her mind pressed her not to
go to bed, which, however, she resisted and went to
bed, but was so terrified with the thought, which, as
she called it, run in her mind, that the house would be
burnt, that she could not go to sleep.
She had made so much discovery of her apprehen-
sions in the family, that they were all in a fright, and
applied themselves to search from the top of the house
to the bottom, and to see every fire and every candle
safe out, so that, as they all said, it was impossible
anything could happen in the house, and they sent to
the neighbours on both sides to do the like. Thus far
they did well, but had she obeyed the hint, which
pressed upon her strangely not to go to bed, she had
done much better, for the fire was actually kindled at
that very time, though not broken out.
In about an hour after the whole family was in bed,
the house just over the way, directly opposite, was all
in a flame, and the wind, which was very high, blowing
the flame upon the house this gentlewoman lived in, so
filled it with smoke and fire in a few moments, the
street being narrow, that they had not air to breathe,
or time to do anything but jump out of their beds and
save their lives. Had she obeyed the hint given, and
not gone to bed, she might have saved several things of
value which she lost; but as she neglected that, and r
would go to bed, the moments she had spared to her
were but just sufficient to get out of bed, get some
clothes on, and get downstairs, for the house was on
fire in half a quarter of an hour.
It might be asked here, why could not the same kind
spirit have intimated by the same whispers where the
danger lay, and from what quarter it was to be ex-
pected; in what manner the fire would attack them,
and that it would come from the other side of the
street, the wind blowing it directly upon them?
To this I answer, that it is our business the more
vigilantly to observe and listen to the hints which are
given, seeing the intimations are not so particular as we
might wish, without inquiring into the reasons why
they are given no plainer. We have a great deal of
reason to believe the kind spirit that gives these in-
timations and whispers thus to us, gives us all the light
it is permitted to give, and whispers as much, either as
it knows, or as it is allowed to communicate; other-
wise, why does it give any intimations at all? But, on
the other hand, it may be alleged that enough is in-
timated to suffice for our safety, if we will obey the
intimation; and it would be a much more reasonable
question to ask why we slight and disobey the impression
that we acknowledge to have received, rather than why
the intimation was no plainer.
A person of my acquaintance being to go to New
England by sea, two ships presented, and the masters
earnestly solicited to take him as a passenger; he
asked my advice, professing that as well the ships as
the captains were perfectly indifferent to him, both the
men being equally agreeable to him, and the vessels
equally good. I had my eye upon this notion of
impulses, and pressed upon him to observe strictly if he
had not some secret motion of his mind to one ship
rather than another, and he said he had not.
After some time he accidentally met one of the
captains, and falling into terms with him, agreed for
his passage, and accordingly prepared to go on board;
but from the very time that he made the agreement,
nay, even while he was making the bargain, he had a
strong impression on his mind that he should not go in
that ship.
It was some days after this that he told me of
these impressions, which increased on him every day;
upon which I pressed him earnestly not to go, but to
take passage with the other. After he had resolved
upon this, he came to me, and told me, that he had
with some difficulty and some loss put off the first
ship, but now he had the same, or rather stronger
aversion to going in the second ship, and had a strong
impression on his mind that if he went in the second
ship he should be drowned. I bid him consider it a
little, and tell me if he had any further intimations of
it; and he continued to tell me that he had no rest
about his going in either of those ships, and yet his
affairs lay so that he was under a necessity of going,
and there was no other ship put up upon the Exchange
for going.
I pressed him, however, not to venture by any means;
I convinced him that those impulses of his mind were
the whispers of some kind spirit, that saw things farther
than he could, and were certainly given him as cautions
to save him from some mischief which he might not
foresee; that it could be no evil spirit, because the
keeping him back could be no injury to him of such a
nature as would gratify the devil in any part of his usual
desires; it must therefore be something for his good,
and he ought to be very cautious how he slighted the
silent admonition. In a word, I prepossessed him so
much in aid of the secret impulses of his own mind,
that he resolved not to go that year, and he saw clearly f
afterwards that the secret intimation was from a good
hand, for both the ships miscarried; the first being
taken by the Turks, and the latter cast away and all
the men lost, the ship foundering at sea, as was sup-
posed, for she was never heard of.
I could fill this tract with accounts of this nature, but
the reason of the case is stronger than the example; for
as it is an intimation of something future, and that is to
come to pass, it is certain there is a state in which what
is future and must come to pass is known, and why
should we not believe the news, if it comes from the
place where the certainty of it is known?
Some give all this to a prescience peculiar to the soul
itself, and of kin to that we call the second sight; but
I see no ground for this but mere presumption. Others
call it an afflatus, which they think is a distemper of
the brain. Others call it a sympathetic power in the
soul, foreboding its own disasters. But all this is short
of the thing, for here is not a foreboding only, which
indeed is often felt, but is expressed another way; but
here is a direct intelligence, a plain intimation of the
evil, and warning to avoid it: this must be more than
an afflatus, more than a sympathy; this must be from a
certain knowledge of a thing that exists not, by a some-
thing that does exist; and must be communicated by a
converse of spirits unembodied, with the spirit embodied,
for its good; unless you will call it Divine revelation,
which I see no ground for.
All these reasonings make it abundantly our concern
to regard these things, as what we are greatly concerned
in; however, that is not the chief use I make of them
here, but (1.) they abundantly explain the nature of the
world of spirits, and the certainty of an existence after
death; (2.) they confirm that the disposition of Provi-
dence concerning man, and the event of things, are not
so much hidden from the inhabitants of that world as 
they are from us; as also (3.) that spirits unembodied
see with a sight differing from us, and are capable of
knowing what attends us, when we know nothing of it
ourselves.
This offered many useful reflections to my mind,
which, however, 'tis impossible for me to communicate
with the same vivacity, or to express with the same life,
that the impression they make on my own thoughts
came with.
The knowledge of there being a world of spirits,
may be many ways useful to us, and especially that of
their seeing into futurity, so as to be able to communi-
cate to us, by what means soever they do it, what we
shall or shall not do, or what shall or shall not befall
us; to communicate dangers before us so as they may
be avoided, and mischiefs awaiting us, so as they may
be prevented, and even death itself, so as we may pre-
pare for it; for we may certainly, if we would attend
to these things, increase our acquaintance with them,
and that very much to our advantage.
I would be far from prompting the crazy imagina-
tions of hypochondriac distempered heads, which run
men out to so many extravagancies, and which, in fixing
their thoughts upon the real world of spirits, make this
an imaginary world of spirits to them; who think they
are talked to from the invisible world by the howling of
every dog, or the screeching of every owl. I believe
it was much of this vapourish dreaming fancy by which
the augurs of the Romans determined events from the
flying of birds, and the entrails of beasts. It will be hard for me to be prevailed on to suppose
that even those intelligent spirits which I speak of, who
are able by such easy ways, as the impulses of our minds,
dreams, and the like, to convey the knowledge of things
to us, can be put to the necessity, or find reason to make
use of the agency of dogs and birds, to convey their f
III. T
notices by; this would be to suppose them to be much
more confined in their converse with us, than we
evidently find they are; and, on the other hand, would
suppose the inanimate world to have more knowledge
of the invisible than we have, whereas, on the other
hand, we know they have nothing at all to do with it. There is only this to be said for it, namely, that those
inanimate creatures do it involuntarily, and, as it were,
under the power of a possession.
I will not affirm but that the invisible inhabitants I
have been speaking of may have power to act upon the
brute creatures, so as to employ them, or make use of
their agency, in the warnings and notices which they
give to us of things to come; but that the brutes have
otherwise any farther sight of things than we have, I
can see nothing at all of that. It is true Balaam's ass
saw the angel with the flaming sword standing in the
road when the prophet did not, but the reason is plainly
expressed; the angel was really there, and actually pre-
senting terror to them with a flaming sword in his hand,
only the prophet's eyes were miraculously withheld that
he could not see him.
I shall unriddle this mystery of the agency of beasts
and birds as far as reason dictates; and it seems to be
easy upon the scheme of the nearness of the spirits I
am speaking of to us, and their concern to convey
intelligence to us. They may, I say, have power to
terrify the brutes by horrible apparitions to them, so as
to force those howlings and screechings we have been
told of, and to do this in such places, and at such
times, as shall suit with the circumstances of the family
or person concerned, and so far their said extraordinary
howlings and screechings may be significant; but that
the brutes can either, by sense or by extraordinary
sight, have any foreknowledge of things in futurity
relating to us, or to themselves, this has no foundation in reason or philosophy, any more than it has in religion.
Matter may act upon material objects, and so the
understanding or sense of a brute may act upon visible
objects, but matter cannot act upon immaterial things,
and so the eye of a beast cannot see a spirit, or the
mind of a brute act upon futurity, eternity, and the
sublime things of a state to come.
What use, then, the spirits we speak of, inhabiting
the invisible world, can make of the inanimate world to
direct them, as missionaries to us, I do not see, neither
did I in all my altitudes perceive they employed any
such agents.
It is from the misunderstanding of these things that
we place abundance of incidents, merely fortuitous,
to the devil's account, which he knows nothing of.
Many a storm blows that is none of his raising; many
a midnight noise happens that is none of his making.
If Satan or his instruments had one tenth part of the
power, either of the air, or in the air, or over the
elements, that we give them in our imaginations, we
should have our houses burnt every night, hurricanes
raised in the air, floods made in the country, and, in a
word, the world would not be habitable; but you re-
member I told you, as powerful as he is, he is chained,
he has a great clog at his foot, and he can do nothing
by violence, or without permission.
I might hint here at abundance of idle, ridiculous
devils, that we are daily told of, that come and only
make game among us, put out our candles, throw chairs
and stools about the house, break glasses, make a
smoke, a stink of brimstone, &c., whereas, after all, the
devil has no more sulphur about him than other folks,
and I can answer for it that Satan is not disposed for
mirth; all the frolics and gambols we ascribe to him, I
dare say, are antics of our own brain. I heard of a
house in Essex which they told me was haunted, and r
that every night the devil or a spirit, call it which you
will, came into such a room, and made a most terrible
knocking, as if it had a hammer or a mallet, and this
for two or three hours together. At length, upon
looking about in an empty closet in that room, there
was found an old mallet, and this was presently con-
cluded to be the mallet which the devil made such a
noise with, so it was taken away; but the next night
they said the devil made such a racket for want of the
mallet, that they were much more disturbed than
before, so they were obliged to leave the mallet there
again, and every night the devil would come and knock
in the window, for two or three hours together, with
that mallet. I have seen the room and the mallet, in
neither of which was anything extraordinary, but never
heard the noise, though I sat up to wait for it, nor after
causing the mallet to be taken away was there any
noise; belike the mannerly spirit would not disturb
us who were strangers.
This passed for a most eminent piece of walking or
haunting, and all the difficulty was to inquire to what
purpose all this disturbance was made, seeing there was
no end answered in it, and I always thought the devil
was too full of business to spend his time to no manner
of purpose.
At last all the cheat was discovered, viz., that a
monkey, kept in a house three or four houses from it,
had found the way into that room, and came every
night almost about midnight, and diverted himself with
the frolic, and then went home again.
If these things were not frequently detected, it would
be a great scandal upon the devil that he had nothing
to employ himself in more significant than rapping all
night with a hammer to fright and disturb the neigh-
bours, making noises, putting out candles, and the like.
When we come into the invisible state, of which we now know so little, we shall be easily convinced that
the devil is otherwise employed, and has business of
much more importance upon his hands.
It would be very insignificant to have us so fre-
quently warned against Satan's devices, to have us be
cautioned to be sober and vigilant, knowing that our
adversary, the devil, goes about like a roaring lion,
seeking, &c. All these things import that he is dili-
gent in attacking us, watching all advantages, hunting
us down, circumventing, waiting, and constantly plying
us with snares that he may trepan and devour us. This
admits not any of those simple, ludicrous, and sense-
less digressions which we set him to work upon in
our imaginations.
Perhaps it may be expected I should enter here
upon the subject of apparitions, and discourse with
equal certainty of that undecided question concerning
the reality of apparitions, and whether departed souls
can revisit the place of their former existence, take up
shapes, bodies, and visible and apparent beings, assume
voices, and concern themselves with the affairs of life,
of families, persons, and even of estates, and the like,
as many have affirmed they have been witnesses to.
I must be allowed to leave this where I find it.
There are some difficulties which I am not yet got
over in it, nor have I been elevated high enough to
determine that point, and shall not venture to decide it
without more certainty than I am yet arrived to.
I would warn all people not to suffer their imagina-
tion to form shapes and appearances where there are
none; and I may take upon me to say that the devil
himself does not appear half so often as some people
think they see him: fancy governs many people, and a
sick brain forms strange things to itself; but it does
not follow from thence that nothing can appear because
nothing does at that time.
f
However, as my design is to instruct, not amuse, so,
I say, I forbear to enter upon a subject which I must
leave as doubtful as I find it, and consequently talk of
to no purpose.
I have heard of a man that would allow the reality
of apparitions, but would have it be nothing but the
devil; that the souls of men departed or good spirits
never appeared. It happened that to this very man
something appeared, as he said, and insisted upon it to
the last. He said he saw the shape of an ancient man
pass by him in the dusk of the evening, who, holding
up his hand as it were in a threatening posture, said
aloud, "O wicked creature! repent, repent." He
was exceedingly terrified, and consulted several people
about it, who all advised him seriously to take the
advice, for his life made it well known, it seems, that
he stood in need of it; but being seriously debating
about it, one of his friends asked what he thought of
the apparition, and whether it was any of the devil's
business to bid him repent. This puzzled his thoughts,
and, in a word, he grew a very sober man; but, after
all, it was a real man, and no apparition, that spoke to
him, though his frighted fancy made him affirm that
he vanished out of his sight, which he did not; and
the person who did it, being a grave and pious gentleman, met him by mere accident, without any design,
and spoke as he did, from the knowledge he had of
his being indeed a most wretched wicked fellow. By
the way, the gentleman had the opportunity to hear the
use that was made of it, and to hear himself mistaken
for an apparition of the devil, but he was so prudent
as not to discover it to the man, lest the reformation,
which was the consequence of the fright, should wear
off, when he should know that there was nothing in the
thing but what was common.
If we would always make the like good use of Satan's real appearances, I do not know but it would go a
great way to banish him from the visible world; for I
am well assured he would very seldom visit us, if he
thought his coming would do us any good; at least, he
would never come but when he was sent, he would
never come willingly; for he is so absolutely at the
Divine disposal, that if Heaven commands he must go,
though it were to do the good he abhors. Not that I
believe Heaven ever thinks fit to employ him in doing
good; if ever he is let loose, 'tis to act in judgment as
an instrument of vengeance, and some are of opinion he
is often employed as a destroying angel, though I do
not grant that; I can hardly think the justice of God
would gratify Satan's gust of doing evil so far as to
suffer him to be even so much as an executioner; but
that is by the way.
I have another turn to give this part of my observa-
tions, which though, perhaps, some may not think so
much to the purpose as entering into a critical inquiry
after the devil's particular mission in these cases, yet I
think otherwise.
I have observed that some desperate people make a
very ill use of the general notion, that there are no
apparitions, nor spirits at all; and really, the use they
make of it is worse than the extreme of those who, as
I said, make visions and devils of everything they see
or hear. For these men persuade themselves there are
no spirits at all, either in the visible or invisible world,
and, carrying it on farther, they next annihilate the
devil, and believe nothing about him, either of one kind
or another.
This would not be of so much bad consequence if it
was not always followed by a worse, namely, that
when they have prevailed with themselves to believe
there is no devil, the next thing is, and they soon
come to it, that there is no God, and so atheism
takes its rise in the same sink, with a carelessness about
futurity.
I have no mind to enter upon an argument to prove
the being of our Maker, and to illustrate His power by
words, who has so many undeniable testimonies in the
breasts of every rational being to prove His existence.
But I have a mind to conclude this work with a short
history of some atheists, which I met with many years
ago, and whether the facts are testified or not, may be
equally useful in the application, if you do not think
them a little too religious for you.
Some years ago there was a young gentleman, a
scholar at the university, eminent for learning and virtue,
of prompt parts and great proficiency, insomuch that he
was taken great notice of by the masters and fellows,
and every one promised fair in their thoughts for him,
that he would be a great man. It happened, whether
from his earnest desire of more knowledge, or the
opinion of his own great capacity, I know not which,
that this gentleman, falling upon the study of divinity,
grew so opinionative, so very positive and dogmatic in
his notions in religious things, that by degrees it came
to this height, that his tutor saw plainly that he had
little more than notions in all his religious pretences to
knowledge, and concluded he would either grow en-
thusiastic or obstinately profane and atheistic.
He had three chums, or companions, in his studies,
and they all fell into the same error, as well by the
consequence of a great deal of wit and little grace, as
by the example and leading of this other young gentle-
man, who was, indeed, their oracle almost in every-
thing.
As his tutor, who was a very good man, feared for
him, so it came to pass with him and all the rest; for
they ran up their superficial notions in divinity to such
a height that, instead of reasoning themselves into good principles of religion, they really reasoned themselves
out of all religion whatsoever, running on to expunge
every right idea from their minds; pretending those
things really were not, of which they could not define
both how and what they were, they proceeded to deny
the existence of their Maker, the certainty of a future
state, a resurrection, a judgment, a heaven, or a hell.
They were not contented to satisfy themselves with
these impious foundations, but they set up to dispute in
private societies against all revealed religion, thereby
bringing on themselves the curse denounced in Scripture
against those that do evil and teach men so to do; in a
little time they grew so public that more company came
in, and, which was worse, many joined with them in
principle, or, as I should rather have said, in casting
off all principles, and they began to be famous in the
place, though to the offence of all good men, and were
called "The Atheistical Club."
They soon began to see sober, religious people shun
them, and in some time, upon information given, they
were obliged, by authority, to separate for fear of
punishment, so that they could not hold their public
disputations as they began to do, yet they abated
nothing of their wicked custom; and this dreadful
creature, who set up at the head of the rest, began to
be so open in his blasphemies that he was at length
obliged to fly from the university.
However, he went a great while before it came to
that; and though he had been often admonished, yet,
instead of reclaiming, he grew the more impious, making
the most sacred things his jest and the subject of his
ridicule. He gave out that he could frame a new
gospel, and a much better system of religion than that
which they called Christian; and that if he would
trouble himself to go about it, he would not fail to
draw in as great a part of the world to run after him as r
had been after any other. I care not to repeat any of
his blasphemous words; it is not to be supposed there
can be any blasphemous abominable thing that this set
of wicked wretched young men did not run into,
neither any wickedness of that kind within their reach
which they did not commit.
It would be too long to enter into the particular
history of these men, and how it pleased God to
dispose of them; they might be in number, before they
separated, about twenty-two in all; I shall tell you
of some of them, however, who did not run such
lengths as the rest. There was a young man who
frequented their society, though, as he afterwards said,
he was rather persuaded to be among them than to
be one of them; he had, however, too much yielded
to their delusions; and though they made him very
much their jest, because they found he still retained
some little sense of a God and of a future state in his
mind, yet he had yielded dreadfully to them, and
began to do so more and more every day.
It happened one day this young man was going to
their hellish society, and not minding the weather, the
clouds gathered over his head, and he was stopped by
a sudden shower of rain in the street. It rained so
very hard that it obliged him to stand up in the gate-
way of an inn for some time; while he was standing
here a great flash of lightning more than ordinarily
surprised him; it seems the fire came so directly in his
face that he felt the very warmth of it, and was ex-
ceedingly startled; in the same moment almost, as is
natural in the case, followed such a clap of thunder
that perfectly astonished him. The rain continuing
kept him in the gateway, as I said, for a good while, till
he had time for such reflections as these: "Where am
I going? What am I going about? Who is it has
stopped me thus? Why are these thunders, these rains, and this lightning thus terrible? and whence are
they?" And with the rest came in this thought, warm
and swift as the lightning which had terrified him
before, "What if there should be a God! what will
become of me then?" Terrified with these things he
starts out of the gateway into the street, notwithstand-
ing the wet, and runs back through the rain, saying to
himself as he went," I will go among them no more!"
When he came home to his chambers he fell into
dreadful agonies of mind,and at length broke out thus:
"What have I been doing! have I been denying the
Power that made me? despising that God whose fire
flashed just now in my face; and which, had not that
mercy I have abused interposed, might have burnt me
to death? What kind of creature am I?" While
he was thus giving vent to his reflections a near relation
of his — a pious, good man, who had often used to
speak very plainly to him of the horrid sin he was
guilty of—happened to come to visit him.
The young man had thrown himself upon his bed,
and had, with the deepest sense of his madness and
most serious reproaches of himself for his horrid life,
been expressing himself to his friend, and he had been
comforting him in the best manner he could, when,
after a while, he desired his friend to retire that he
might be a little alone and might give vent to his
thoughts with the more freedom; and his friend taking
a book in his hand stayed in the outer room.
In this interval came another scholar to the door,
who was one of the wicked company I mentioned just
now. He came not to visit this first gentleman, but to
call him to go with him to the usual meeting of their
dreadful society; and knocking at his chamber door,
this gentleman who was left in the chamber stepped
to the door, and, looking through a little grate, not
only knew the person, but knew him to be one of the wicked company I have been speaking of. Now, as
he was very loath his friend should have such an inter-
ruption to the good disposition he was then in, so,
above all, he was loath he should be persuaded to go
any more among that miserable gang; wherefore he
opened the door a little way, so as he was not very
distinctly seen, and spoke aloud in the person of his
friend thus: "O sir, beseech them all to repent;
for, depend upon it, there is a God; tell them I say
so;" and with that he shut the door upon him
violently, giving him no time to reply, and, going back
into his friend's room, took no notice of anybody
having been at the door at all.
The person who knocked at the door you may
suppose was one of the leaders of the company, a
young scholar of good parts and sense, but debauched
by that horrid crew, and one that had made himself
eminent for his declared opposition to all the common
notions of religion; a complete atheist, and publicly so,
without God or the desire of God in the world.
However, as he afterwards confessed, the repulse he
met with at the door, and which he thought came
from his friend, gave him a strange shock at first and
filled him with horror. He went down the college
stairs in the greatest confusion imaginable, and went
musing along a good way, not knowing where he was
or whither he went, and in that embarrassment of
thought went a whole street out of the way. The
words had made an unusual impression upon his mind,
but he had his other surprises too; for he thought his
friend, for he believed firmly that it was he that had
spoken to him, had treated him very rudely.
Sometimes he resented it, and reflected upon it as
an affront, and once or twice was upon the point of
going back again to him to know the reason of his
using him so, and to demand satisfaction; but still the words, "There is a God," dwelt upon his mind.
"And what if it should be so?" says he, "what
then?" Upon this question to himself, the answer
immediately occurred to his mind. "What then?
Why, then, I am undone! For, have not I declared
war against the very notion, defied all the pretenders
to it as mere enthusiasts and men of whimsey?"
However, after these thoughts his mind cooled a
little again, and it offered to him, no doubt injected by
an evil spirit, that he should not trouble himself with
inquiring into it one way or another, but be easy.
This pacified him for a little while, and he shook
off the surprise he was in; the hardened temper seemed
to return, and he kept on his way towards the hellish
society that he was going to before. But still the words
returned upon him, "There is a God," and began to
bring some terror with it upon his mind; and the last
words of his friend came into his mind often, "tell
them I say so." This filled him with a curiosity
which he could not withstand, viz., of going back to
his friend and inquiring of him what discoveries he
had made of this kind? How he came to have changed
his mind so suddenly? And, especially, how he was
arrived to a certainty of the thing?
I told you that there had been a great shower of
rain, which had stopped the first young gentleman in
his way out; it seems the day was still showery, and
a little rain happening to fall again as this gentleman
went by a bookseller's shop, he stops at the door to
stand up a little out of the wet.
There happened to be sitting in the shop reading a
book a gentleman of his acquaintance, though far differing
from him in his principles, being a very sober, studious,
religious young man, a student in divinity of the same
college, who, looking up, called him in, and after a few
common salutes he whispers in his ear.
Student. I was looking in an old book here just
now, and began the following short dialogue; and I
found four lines written on the back of the title-page
which put me in mind of you.
Atheist. Me! why did they put you in mind of me?
Stud. I'll tell you presently; come hither. [He
retires into a back room, and calls the other after him.]
Ath. Well, now tell me.
Stud. Because I think they are very fit for such an
atheistical wretch as you to read. Ath. You are very civil. Stud. You know you deserve it. Ath. Come, let me see them, however.
Stud. Let me look in your face all the while, then. Ath. No, you shan't.
Stud. Then you shan't see them. Ath. Well, let it alone, then.
Stud. Come, give me your hand; you shall see
them if you will promise to read them over three times.
Ath. There's my hand, I'll read them out to you.
Stud. I'll hold your hand all the while, because I'll
be sure of your performance.
Ath. I'D warrant you I'll read them. [He reads.]
"But if it should fall out, as who can tell,
That there may be a God, a heaven, and hell,*
Had I not best consider well, for fear
'T should be too late when my mistakes appear?"
[*He held him by the hand till that word, and then
let it go, pressing gently one of his fingers.~\
Stud. Well, what do you say to them?
Ath. I'll tell you my thoughts farther by-and-by,
but first tell me, what did you press my hand for when
you let it go?
Stud. Did you feel no motion within you when you
read those words, " there may be a God "?
Ath. What motion? What do you talk of?

Stud. Come, do not deny it, for I am a witness
against you.
Ath. Witness, for what? I have killed nobody, I
have robbed nobody; if you would turn informer, I
value not your evidence.
Stud. No, no, I shall not turn informer of that kind,
but I am a witness in your Maker's behalf.
Ath. What can you witness?
Stud. I'll tell you what I can witness; I can testify
that your own conscience is against you in your impious
denying the existence of that God that gave you life;
you could not conceal it; I tell you I felt it.
Ath. How do you pretend to know what my con-
science dictates to me, or what the result of secret
reflections may be in the mind? You may be mistaken;
have a care, you know you are not to bear false
witness.
Stud. 'Tis in vain to struggle with it —'tis not to be
concealed; you betrayed yourself, I tell you.
Ath. How betrayed myself? you are mighty dark in
your expressions.
Stud. Did I not tell you I would look in your face
all the while you read? Did I not see into the dis-
traction of your soul? Did you not turn pale at the
very words, when your tongue said, "there may be a
God"? Was there not a visible horror in your counte-
nance when you read the word heaven? a horror which
signified a sense of your having no share in it, or hope
about it? And did I not feel a trembling in your
very joints, as I held you by the hand, when you read
the word hell?
Ath. And was that it you held me by the hand for?
Stud. Indeed it was; I was persuaded I should find
it, for I could never believe that an atheist had always
a hell within him, even while he braved it out against a
hell without him.
Ath. You speak enough to fright one; how can you
say so positively a thing which you cannot be sure of?
Stud. Never add sin to sin; 'tis in vain to deny it.
Ath. Well, well, it's none of your business; who
made you my father confessor \ \He is a little angry.~]
Stud. Nay, do not be angry with your friend; and
though you are, do but take the hint, and be as angry
as you will.
Ath. What hint? What is it you aim at? Your
hints are all so general, I can make nothing of them.
Stud. I aim at nothing but your eternal felicity; I
thought those lines very apposite to your case, and
was wishing you had them before I happened to see
you. I thought that such a reflection in the case of
atheism, so natural, so plain, especially blessed from
Him whose secret voice can effectually reach the
mind, might be some means to open your eyes.
Ath. Open my eyes !—to what?
Stud. To something that I am persuaded you see
already in part, though I find you struggle hard against
your own convictions.
Ath. What is this something you speak of?
Stud. I mean in a few words what the lines you
have read mean, viz., that perhaps there may be a
God, a heaven, and hell.
Ath. I don't know but there may. \_He observes
tears stand in his eyes.~\
Stud. Well, I see it begins to touch you; if you
are uncertain, that is a step to conviction; and the
rest of the words you have read are a most natural
inference in your case.
"You'd best consider well, for fear
T should be too late when your mistakes appear.
Ath. What would you have me consider?
Stud. I am not able to enter into that part now; the first thing is to persuade you to look in; listen to
the voice of conscience; I am satisfied you stand con-
victed at that bar; you cannot plead not guilty there. Ath. Convicted of what?
Stud. Of having acted contrary to the light of
nature, of reason, and indeed of common-sense; most
impiously denied the God whose air you breathe in,
whose earth you tread on, whose food you eat, whose
clothes you wear, who is your life, and will be your
Judge.
Ath. I do not absolutely deny; I tell you I don't
know but there may be a God.
Stud. Don't you know but there may! O sir, I
beseech you, repent; for certainly there is a God,
depend upon it; I say so.
Ath. You fright me. [He starts and looks sur-
prised.]
Stud. Indeed I think it may well fright you.
Ath. But you fright me upon a quite different
account from what you imagine; I am indeed very
much surprised, and so would you too, if you knew
the circumstance.
Stud. What circumstance?
Ath. Pray did you hear those words spoken any-
where to-day before you spoke them?Stud. No, not I.
Ath. Was you at Mr. 's chamber about half-an-hour ago?
Stud. I have not been there this month past; I
have given over visiting him, and all such as he is,
long ago.
Ath. Have you seen him to-day, or when did you
last see him ?— did he speak those words to you, or
you to him?
Stud. I have not seen him since I saw him with
you about fourteen days ago, when your discourse r
III. u
(even both of you) was so blasphemous and so
atheistical as made my very heart tremble, and I re-
solved never to come into company with either of you
again, and it was that very discourse that made me
think of you when I found those lines in this book.
I should think it an evident discovery of God, and
what I might hope should best forward your con-
viction, if His providence should have sent you to this
door at that minute to receive the hint on this occasion.
Ath. There is something more than common in
everything that has happened to me to-day.
Stud. If you would explain yourself a little I might
say more; but you know very well I cannot make the
least guess at what you mean.
Ath. Ask me no more questions; there must be
a God or a devil in being. [He looks wildly and
amazed.]
Stud. Dear friend, there are both, depend upon it;
but I beseech you, compose your mind, and do not
receive the conviction with horror, but with comfort
and hope.
Ath. One or other of them has been concerned in
what has happened to me to-day; it has been a strange
day with me.
Stud. If it relates only to these things, perhaps it
may be of use to you to communicate the particulars,
at least it may give some vent to the oppression of
thought which you seem to be under; you cannot
open your mind to one that has more earnest desires
to do you good, though perhaps not sufficiently fur-
nished to advise you.
Ath. I must tell it or burst. [Here he gave him
the whole story of his going to his friend's chamber in
order to take him with him to the wicked club they had
kept, and how he had met him at the door, and said the
same words to him that the Student had repeated, and
tuhen he had done, says he to his friend^— And who
now do you think must dictate the same words to
him, and afterwards to you, to say to me on the same
occasion?
Stud. Who do I think? Nay, who do you think?Ath. Who? the devil, if there is a devil.
Stud. Why, do you think the devil preaches repent-
ance? [He stands stock still, and says not a ivord,
ivhich the other perceiving, goes on J— Pray think seri-
ously, for I see it does a little touch your reason. Is
it likely the devil should bid either of us, or both of
us, entreat you to repent? Is it the devil, think you,
that would pronounce the certainty of the great truth
I speak of? Is it his business to convince you that
there is a God?
Ath. That's very true.
Stud. One thing, however, I'll say in Satan's be-
half, and that is, that he never came up to your height
of sinning. The devil has frequently set up himself,
and persuaded poor deluded people to worship him
as a God; but, to do him justice, he never had the
impudence to deny the being of a God; that's a sin
purely human, and even among men very modern too,
the invention of witty men, as they call themselves—
a way they have lately found out to cherish superlative
wickedness, and flatter themselves that they shall have
no audit of their accounts in a future state; of whom it
may indeed be said in that particular, they have outsinned the devil.
Ath. Indeed I think we have.
Stud. I wish you would consider a little farther
of it.
Ath. What can men consider that have gone that
length I
Stud. Yes, yes; remember what St. Peter said to
Simon the sorcerer. Ath. What was that?
Stud. Read Acts viii. 22; "Repent, therefore, of
this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the
thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."
Ath. No, no; the last of your verses is against me
there most directly.
"It's all TOO late, now my mistakes appear."
Stud. No, no; remember what you said, that it
must be a God or a devil.
Ath. What is that to the purpose?
Stud. Why, you seemed satisfied that it could not
be from the devil.
Ath. But what the better am I for that, if the other
is my enemy?
Stud. Much the better if it was from God, if the
words you heard were from God, and that two un-
concerned persons so eminently concurred in speaking
to you; you cannot believe God would bid you repent
if it was too late, or if He were your irreconcilable
enemy; on the contrary, if you believe it to be the
voice of His providence, you ought to listen to and
obey it.
Ath. You have a strange power of persuasion, there is
no resisting your argument.
Stud. It is not in me to persuade, but Heaven may
make use of me to convince.
Ath. To convince is to persuade; I am convinced
that I have been a dreadful wretch.
Stud. I am persuaded you were convinced of that
before.
Ath. I cannot deny but my heart always struck me
—a kind of chill horror ran through my veins, when I
have uttered the blasphemous opinions that I have been
drawn into; my very blood stagnated at the thought of
it, and I look back on it with astonishment.
Stud. I tell you, I felt a tremor even in your flesh
when you read the words, a God, a heaven, a hell.
Ath. I confess to you my very heart sunk within
me at the words who can tell; my soul answered that I
could tell myself that it both is and must be so.
Stud. Conscience is a faithful and never-failing evi-
dence in his Maker's behalf.
Ath. It is a very terrible evidence against me, and
where will it end?
Stud. I hope it will end where it began, I mean in a
heavenly call to you to repentance.
Ath. That is not always the consequence of con-
viction.
Stud. You must therefore distinguish again of what
proceeds from heaven, what from hell, the voice of
God, and the voice of the devil; the first calls upon
you to repent, the last prompts you to despair.
Ath. Despair seems to be the natural consequence
of denying God, for it shuts out the power that can
alone restore the mind.
Stud. The greater is that love which refuses to be
shut out, that sends such a heavenly summons to you
to repent, and in so eminent a manner; it is not your
having been an enemy, a blasphemer, a denier of God;
Peter denied Christ three times, nay, the third time
he even abjured Him, and yet, mark the words — the
Lord looked on him, and immediately he repented.
Ath. My case is worse than Peter's.
Stud. And yet you see you are called on to repent.
Ath. I think you are called to make me repent;
there's no answering you.
Stud. Amen; may I have the blessing of being an
instrument to so good a work; there seems to be
something extraordinary in it all.
Ath. It's all a surprise to me how came I hither.
Stud. Nay, how came I hither ?— How came this book here ?—Who writ the lines in the frontispiece?
—How came I to read them i—'Tis all a dream to
me!
Ath. How came you to think of me upon the read-
ing them? And how came I here just at the moment,
and out of my way too?
\He lifts up his hands and cries out, "There is a
God, certainly there is; I am convinced of it; it must
be jo."]
Stud. Nothing more certain; nor is there any doubt
but all these things are of Him.
Ath. But there are yet greater things behind; I wish you would go with me to my friend Mr 's chamber;I am persuaded something yet more extraordinary must
have befallen him.
Stud. With all my heart.
[They both go to the first gentleman's chamber, and
find him at home, very much out of order, but willing
enough to discourse ivith them.\
Ath. Well, friend of mine, I hope you are better
disposed to your friends than when I saw you last. Gent. Truly, when I saw you last, I was disposed
of by the devil, and so, I doubt, were you; I hope I
shall never come into that horrid place again.
Ath. What horrid place?
Gent. You know where I mean; I tremble at the
very thoughts of the place, and much more of the
company; I wish I could prevail upon you to come
no more among them too; I assure you, if I know
myself, and if God would assist me to do it, I would
much rather go to a stake to be burnt.
Stud. I rejoice in such an alteration, sir, upon you,
and I hope our friend here is of the same mind; long
may it continue in you both.
Ath. Well, pray tell us something of the occasion of
this happy alteration, for it will seem still more strange how you came to be instrumental to my change, if I
know nothing of the means that brought about your own.
Gent. Mine! I assure you it was all from heaven;
not the light that shone about St. Paul was more
immediately from heaven than the stroke that touched
my soul; it is true I had no voice without, but a
voice has spoken (I hope) effectually to my under-
standing; I had voice enough to tell me how I was
in the hands of that Power, that Majesty, that God,
whom I had wickedly, and with a hardness not to be
expressed, disowned and denied.
Stud. Pray, sir, if you care to have it known, give
us some account of the particulars of this wonderful
thing.
Gent. Sir, I shall do it freely; I think I ought not
to conceal it.
[Here he gives an account of the surprise he was in
by the lightning, how he was stopped in his way to his
wicked company, and went back to his chamber.']
Ath. Well, now I will no more wonder at the
salutation you gave me when I came to call you, but
thank you for it.
Gent. What salutation?
Ath. Why, when I was at your chamber about two
hours ago.
Gent. You at my chamber!
Ath. Nay, you need not conceal it, for I have told
our friend here all the story.
Gent. I know nothing of what you talk of, much
less what you mean.
Ath. Nay, what need you go about to conceal it?
I tell you I do not take it ill; I hope I may have
reason to be thankful for what you said to me, and
look upon it as spoken from Heaven; for I assure you,
it has been an introduction to that light in my thoughts
which I hope shall never be extinguished.
Gent. Dear friend, as I believe you are serious, so
I hope you believe I am so; I profess I know nothing
of all you talk about.
Ath. Why, was I not at your door this afternoon a
little after the great shower of rain?
Gent. Not that I know of.
Ath. Why, did not I knock at your chamber-door,
and you come to the door yourself and speak to me?
Gent. Not to-day, I am very sure of it.
Ath. Am I awake i Are you Mr ?am I
sure we are all alive, and know what we are saying,
and to whom?
Gent. I beseech you unriddle yourself, for I am
surprised.
Ath. Why, about three o'clock this afternoon I
came to this chamber-door; I knocked; you came
and opened the door; I began to speak, you inter-
rupted me, and
[Here he repeats the passage at large, and his own thoughts and resentment, as before.]
Gent. Depend upon it, 'twas some voice from
heaven, it was nothing of mine; I have not been at
the door since two of the clock, when I came first in,
but have been on the bed, or in my study ever since,
wholly taken up with my own thoughts, and very much
indisposed.
[The young man turns pale, and falls into a s<woon.~\
There was a great deal more belonging to this story,
but it is too long for the present purpose; I have
related this part on several accounts, and it hits the
purpose I am upon many ways.
(i.) Here is a visible evidence of God, and of His
being and nature, fixed so in the mind, that not the
most hardened atheist can deny it; nature recoils at
every endeavour to suppress it, and the very pulsation
of his blood shall discover and acknowledge it.
(2.) Yet even in this we see how the power of
imagination may be worked up by the secret agency
of an unknown hand, how many things concurred to
make this man believe he had seen an apparition, and
heard a voice; and yet there was nothing in it but the
voice of a man unseen and mistaken. The young man
was so surprised at his friend's declaring that he knew
nothing of his coming there, that he concluded it had
been all a vision or apparition that opened the door,
and that it was a voice that had spoken to him, of
what kind he knew not; and the reflection upon this
surprised him so much as threw him into a swoon, and
yet here was neither vision or voice, but that of an
ordinary person, and one who meant well and said
well.
It is not to be doubted but that many an apparition
related with a great deal of certainty in the world, and
of which good ends have followed, has been no more
than such a serious mistake as this.
But before I leave it, let me observe that this should
not at all hinder us from making a very good use of
such things; for many a voice may be directed from
heaven that is not immediately spoken from thence; as
when the children cried Hosannah to our Saviour, they
fulfilled the Scripture, which said, "Out of the mouths
of babes and sucklings Thou hast ordained praise;" so
doubtless He that made all things and created all things,
may appoint instruction to be given by fortuitous
accidents, and may direct concurring circumstances to
touch and affect the mind as much and as effectually
as if they had been immediate and miraculous.
Thus was the two persons happening to say the
same words to the atheist, the strange reading of those
lines when the person came into the bookseller's shop,
the incident of his running into the shop for shelter,
and many the like things of the same nature, and ordered A VISION OF THE ANGELIC WORLD.
in the same manner as the cock crowing when Peter
denied Christ, which, though wonderfully concurrent
with what his blessed Master had foretold, yet was
no extraordinary thing in a cock, who naturally crows
at such a time of the morning.
In a word, all these things serve to convince us of
a great superintendency of divine Providence in the
minutest affairs of this world, of a manifest existence of
the invisible world, of the reality of spirits, and of the
intelligence between us and them. I hope I have
said nothing of it to misguide anybody, or to assist
them to delude themselves, having spoken of it with
the utmost seriousness in my design, and with a sincere
desire for a general good.

APPENDIX
Captain Woodes Rogers's Account of the Rescue of
Alexander Selkirk.
["A Cruising Voyage round the World," second edition (1718),
pp. 123-130.]
AT seven this morning [Jan. 31, 1709] we made
f^ the island of Juan Fernandez. ... In the
afternoon we hoisted our pinnace out; Captain
Dover, with the boat's crew, went in her to go ashore,
though we could not be less than four leagues off.
As soon as the pinnace was gone, I went on board the
"Duchess," who admired our boat attempting going
ashore at that distance from land. 'Twas against my
inclination, but to oblige Captain Dover I consented
to let her go. As soon as it was dark we saw a light
ashore. Our boat was then about a league from the
island, and bore away for the ships as soon as she saw
the lights. We put our lights abroad for the boat,
though some were of opinion the lights we saw were
our boat's lights; but as night came on, it appeared
too large for that. We fired our quarterdeck gun
and several muskets, showing lights in our mizen and
fore shrouds, that our boat might find us whilst we plied
in the lee of the island. About two in the morning
our boat came on board, having been two hours on
317
board the "Duchess," that took them up astern of us;
we were glad they got well off, because it began to
blow. We are all convinced the light is on the shore,
and design to make our ships ready to engage, believing
them to be French ships at anchor, and we must either
fight them or want water. We stood on the back
side along the south end of the island, in order to lay
in with the first southerly wind, which Captain Dampier
told us generally blows there all day long. In the
morning, being past the island, we tacked to lay it in
close aboard the land, and about ten o'clock opened
the south end of the island, and ran close aboard the
land that begins to make the north-east side.
The flaws came heavy off the shore, and we were
forced to reef our topsails when we opened the middle
bay, where we expected to find our enemy, but saw
all clear, and no ships in that nor the other bay next
the north-west end. These two bays are all that ships
ride in which recruit on this island; but the middle
bay is by much the best. We guessed there had been
ships there, but that they were gone on sight of us.
We sent our yawl ashore about noon, with Captain
Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men, all armed. Meanwhile
we and the "Duchess" kept turning to get in, and
such heavy flaws came off the land, that we were
forced to let go our topsail sheet, keeping all hands to
stand by our sails, for fear of the wind's carrying them
away; but when the flaws were gone we had little
or no wind. These flaws proceeded from the land,
which is very high in the middle of the island. Our
boat did not return; so we sent our pinnace, with the
men armed, to see what was the occasion of the yawl's
stay, for we were afraid that the Spaniards had a
garrison there, and might have seized them. We put
out a signal for our boat, and the "Duchess" showed
a French ensign. Immediately our pinnace returned from the shore, and brought abundance of cray-fish,
with a man clothed in goat's skins, who looked wilder
than the first owners of them. He had been on the
island four years and four months, being left there by
Captain Stradling in the " Cinque Ports ;" his name
was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who had been
master of the "Cinque Ports," a ship that came here
last with Captain Dampier, who told me that this was
the best man in her; so I immediately agreed with him
to be a mate on board our ship. 'Twas he that made
the fire last night when he saw our ships, which hejudged to be English. During his stay here he saw
several ships pass by, but only two came to anchor.
As he went to view them, he found them to be
Spaniards, and retired from them, upon which they
shot at him. Had they been French, he would have
submitted, but chose to risk his dying alone on the
island rather than fall into the hands of the Spaniards
in these parts; because he apprehended they would
murder him, or make a slave of him in the mines, for
he feared they would spare no stranger that might be
capable of discovering the South Seas.
The Spaniards had landed before he knew what
they were, and they came so near him that he had
much ado to escape; for they not only shot at him,
but pursued him to the woods, where he climbed to the
top of a tree, at the foot of which they made water,
and killed several goats just by, but went off without
discovering him. He told us that he was born at
Largo, in the county of Fife, in Scotland, and was bred
a sailor from his youth. The reason of his being left
here was a difference betwixt him and his captain;
which, together with the ship's being leaky, made him
willing rather to stay here than go along with him at
first; and when he was at last willing, the captain
would not receive him. He had been in the island -
before to wood and water, when two of the ship's
company were left upon it for six months till the ship
returned, being chased thence by two French South
Sea ships.
He had with him his clothes and bedding, with
a firelock, some powder, bullets, and tobacco, a hat-
chet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, some practical pieces,
and his mathematical instruments and books. He
diverted and provided for himself as well as he could,
but for the first eight months had much ado to bear up
against melancholy, and the terror of being left alone in
such a desolate place. He built two huts with pimento
trees, covered them with long grass, and lined them with
the skins of goats, which he killed with his gun as he
wanted, so long as his powder lasted, which was but a
pound; and that being almost spent, he got fire by
rubbing two sticks of pimento wood together upon his
knee. In the lesser hut, at some distance from the
other, he dressed his victuals; and in the larger he
slept and employed himself in reading, singing psalms,
and praying; so that he said he was a better Christian
while in this solitude than ever he was before, or than,
he was afraid, he should ever be again.
At first he never ate anything till hunger con-
strained him, partly for grief, and partly for want of
bread and salt. Nor did he go to bed till he could
watch no longer; the pimento wood, which burnt very
clear, served him both for firing and candle, and re-
freshed him with its fragrant smell. He might have
had fish enough, but could not eat them for want of
salt, because they occasioned a looseness; except cray-
fish, which are there as large as lobsters, and very good.
These he sometimes boiled, and at other times broiled,
as he did his goats' flesh, of which he made very good
broth, for they are not so rank as ours. He kept an
account of 500 that he killed while there, and caught 
as many more, which he marked on the ear, and let go.
When his powder failed, he took them by speed of
feet; for his way of living and continual exercise of
walking and running cleared him of all gross humours;
so that he ran with wonderful swiftness through the
woods, and up the rocks and hills, as we perceived
when we employed him to catch goats for us. We
had a bull-dog, which we sent, with several of our
nimblest runners, to help him in catching goats; but he
distanced and tired both the dog and the men, catched
the goats, and brought them to us on his back.
He told us that his agility in pursuing a goat had
once like to have cost him his life: he pursued it with
so much eagerness that he catched hold of it on the
brink of a precipice, of which he was not aware, the
bushes hiding it from him; so that he fell with the
goat down the said precipice, a great height, and was
so stunned and bruised with the fall that he narrowly
escaped with his life; and when he came to his senses,
found the goat dead under him. He lay there about
twenty-four hours, and was scarce able to crawl to his
hut, which was about a mile distant, or to stir abroad
again for ten days.
He came at last to relish his meat well enough
without salt or bread; and in the season had plenty of
good turnips, which had been sowed there by Captain
Dampier's men, and have now overspread some acres
of ground. He had enough of good cabbage from the
cabbage trees, and seasoned his meat with the fruit of
the pimento trees, which is the same as Jamaica pepper,
and smells deliciously. He found also a black pepper
called malageta, which was very good to expel wind,
and against griping in the guts.
He soon wore out all his shoes and clothes by
running through the woods; and at last, being forced
to shift without them, his feet became so hard that he '
III. X
ran everywhere without difficulty, and it was some
time before he could wear shoes after we found him;
for, not being used to any so long, his feet swelled when
he came first to wear them again.
After he had conquered his melancholy, he di-
verted himself sometimes by cutting his name on the
trees, and the time of his being left, and continuance
there. He was at first much pestered with cats and
rats, that bred in great numbers from some of each
species which had got ashore from ships that put in
there to wood and water. The rats gnawed his feet
and clothes whilst asleep, which obliged him to cherish
the cats with his goats' flesh, by which many of them
became so tame, that they would lie about him in
hundreds, and soon delivered him from the rats. He
likewise tamed some kids, and to divert himself
would, now and then, sing and dance with them and
his cats; so that, by the care of Providence, and
vigour of his youth, being now about thirty years old,
he came at last to conquer all the inconveniences of his
solitude, and to be very easy.
When his clothes wore out, he made himself a
coat and a cap of goat's skins, which he stitched
together with little thongs of the same, that he cut
with his knife. He had no other needle but a nail;
and when his knife was wore to the back, he made
others, as well as he could, of some iron hoops that
were left ashore, which he beat thin and ground upon
stones. Having some linen cloth by him, he sewed
himself shirts with a nail, and stitched them with the
worsted of his old stockings, which he pulled out on
purpose. He had his last shirt on when we found
him on the island.
At his first coming on board us, he had so much
forgot his language, for want of use, that we could scarce
understand him, for he seemed to speak his words by halves. We offered him a dram, but he would not
touch it, having drank nothing but water since his
being there; and 'twas some time before he could
relish our victuals.
He could give us an account of no other product
of the island than what we have mentioned, except
small black plums, which are very good, but hard
to come at, the trees which bear them growing on
high mountains and rocks. Pimento trees are plenty
here, and we saw some of sixty feet high, and about
two yards thick, and cotton trees higher, and more
than four fathom round in the stock.
The climate is so good that the trees and grass
are verdant all the year. The winter lasts no longer
than June and July, and is not then severe, there being
only a small frost and a little hail, but sometimes great
rains. The heat of the summer is equally moderate,
and there's not much thunder or tempestuous weather
of any sort. We saw no venomous or savage creature
on the island, nor any other sort of beast, but goats, &c.,
as above mentioned, the first of which had been put
ashore here on purpose for a breed by Juan Fernandez,
a Spaniard, who settled there with some families for a
time, till the continent of Chili began to submit to the
Spaniards; which, being more profitable, tempted them
to quit this island, which is capable of maintaining a
good number of people, and of being made so strong
that they could not be easily dislodged.
Rengrose, in his account of Captain Sharpe's voyage,
and other buccaneers, mentions one who had escaped
ashore here, out of a ship which was cast away with
all the rest of the company, and says he lived five years
alone, before he had the opportunity of another ship to
carry him off. Captain Dampier talks of a Mosquito
Indian that belonged to Captain Watlin, who, being
a-hunting in the woods when the captain left the r
island, lived there three years alone, and shifted much
in the same manner as Mr. Selkirk did, till Captain
Dampier came hither in 1684 and carried him off.
The first that went ashore was one of his countrymen,
and they saluted one another, first, by prostrating them-
selves by turns on the ground, and then embracing.
But whatever there is in these stories, this of Mr. Selkirk I know to be true; and his behaviour after-
wards gives me reason to believe the account he gave
me how he spent his time, and bore up under such an
affliction, in which nothing but the Divine Providence
could have supported any man.
II.
Steele's Account of Selkirk.
\Tht Englishman, December 1-3, 1713.]
Under the title of this paper, I do not think it
foreign to my design to speak of a man born in
her Majesty's dominions, and relate an adventure
in his life so uncommon, that it is doubtful whether
the like has happened to any other of the human
race. The person I speak of is Alexander Selkirk,
whose name is familiar to men of curiosity, from the
fame of his having lived four years and four months
alone in the island of Juan Fernandez. I had the
pleasure, frequently, to converse with the man soon
after his arrival in England in the year 1711. It was
matter of great curiosity to hear him, as he is a man of
good sense, give an account of the different revolutions
in his own mind in that long solitude. When we con-
sider how painful absence from company, for the space
of but one evening, is to the generality of mankind, we
may have a sense how painful this necessary and con-

stant solitude was to a man bred a sailor, and ever
accustomed to enjoy and suffer, eat, drink, and sleep,
and perform all offices of life, in fellowship and com-
pany. He was put ashore from a leaky vessel, with
the captain of which he had had an irreconcilable dif-
ference; and he chose rather to take his fate in this
place than in a crazy vessel, under a disagreeable com-
mander. His portion was a sea-chest, his wearing
clothes and bedding, a firelock, a pound of gunpowder,
a large quantity of bullets, a flint and steel, a few pounds
of tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, and
other books of devotion; together with pieces that con-
cerned navigation, and his mathematical instruments.
Resentment against his officer, who had ill-used him,
made him look forward on this change of life as the
more eligible one, till the instant in which he saw the
vessel put off; at which moment his heart yearned
within him, and melted at the parting with his com-
rades and all human society at once. He had in pro-
visions for the sustenance of life but the quantity of
two meals, the island abounding only with wild goats,
cats, and rats. He judged it most probable that he
should find more immediate and easy relief by finding
shell-fish on the shore than seeking game with his gun.
He accordingly found great quantities of turtles, whose
flesh is extremely delicious, and of which he frequently
ate very plentifully on his first arrival, till it grew dis-
agreeable to his stomach, except in jellies. The neces-
sities of hunger and thirst were his greatest diversion
from the reflections on his lonely condition. When
those appetites were satisfied, the desire of society was
as strong a call upon him, and he appeared to himself
least necessitous when he wanted everything; for the
supports of his body were easily attained, but the eager
longings for seeing again the face of man, during the
interval of craving bodily appetites, were hardly sup-
portable. He grew dejected, languid, and melancholy,
scarce able to refrain from doing himself violence, till by degrees, by the force of reason and frequent reading
the Scriptures, and turning his thoughts upon the study
of navigation, after the space of eighteen months he
grew thoroughly reconciled to his condition. When
he had made this conquest, the vigour of his health,
disengagement from the world, a constant cheerful,
serene sky and a temperate air, made his life one con-
tinual feast, and his being much more joyful than it had
before been irksome. He now, taking delight in every-
thing, made the hut in which he lay, by ornaments
which he cut down from a spacious wood on the side
of which it was situated, the most delicious bower,
fanned with continual breezes and gentle aspirations of
wind, that made his repose after the chase equal to the
most sensual pleasures.
I forgot to observe, that during the time of his dis-
satisfaction monsters of the deep, which frequently lay
on the shore, added to the terrors of his solitude; the
dreadful howlings and voices seemed too terrible to
be made for human ears; but upon the recovery of his
temper he could with pleasure not only hear their voices,
but approach the monsters themselves with great intre-
pidity. He speaks of sea-lions, whose jaws and tails
were capable of seizing or breaking the limbs of a man
if he approached them. But at that time his spirits and
life were so high, that he could act so regularly and
unconcerned, that merely from being unruffled in him-
self he killed them with the greatest ease imaginable;
for observing that though their jaws and tails were so
terrible, yet the animals being mighty slow in working
themselves round, he had nothing to do but place him-
self exactly opposite to their middle, and as close to
them as possible, and he despatched them with his
hatchet at will.

THE END.

The precautions which he took against want, in
case of sickness, was to lame kids when very young,
so as that they might recover their health, but never be
capable of speed. These he had in great numbers
about his hut; and as he was himself in full vigour, he
could take at full speed the swiftest goat running on a
promontory, and never failed of catching them, but on
a descent.
His habitation was extremely pestered with rats,
which gnawed his clothes and feet when sleeping. To
defend himself against them he fed and tamed numbers
of young kitlings, who lay about his bed and preserved
him from the enemy. When his clothes were quite
worn out he dried and tacked together the skins of
goats, with which he clothed himself, and was inured
to pass through woods, bushes, and brambles with as
much carelessness and precipitance as any other animal.
It happened once to him that running on the summit of
a hill he made a stretch to seize a goat, with which
under him he fell down a precipice and lay senseless for
the space of three days, the length of which he measured
by the moon's growth since his last observation. This
manner of life grew so exquisitely pleasant, that he never
had a moment heavy upon his hands; his nights were
untroubled and his days joyous, from the practice of
temperance and exercise. It was his manner to use
stated hours and places for exercises of devotion, which
he performed aloud, in order to keep up the faculties of
speech, and to utter himself with greater energy.
When I first saw him I thought if I had not been
let into his character and story I could have discerned
that he had been much separated from company from
his aspect and gesture; there was a strong but cheerful
seriousness in his look, and a certain disregard to the
ordinary things about him, as if he had been sunk in
thought. When the ship which brought him off the
