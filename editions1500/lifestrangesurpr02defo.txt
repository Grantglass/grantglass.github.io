THE 

PREFACE, 




H E Succefs the former Tart of this 
Work has met with in the Worlds 
has yet been no other, than is ac- 
kncwiegd to be due to the furprifing 
Variety of the Subjeft, and to the a- 
greeable Manner of the Performance. 

All the Endeavours of envious People to re- 
proach it with being a Romance, to fearch it for 
Errors in Geography, Inconfiflency in the Relation, 
and Contradictions in the Faff, have proved a~ 
bortive, and as impotent as malicious. 

The juft Application of every Incident, the reli- 
gious and ufeful Inferences drawn from every 
Part, are fo man) Tefti?nonies to the good Dcjign 
of making it publick, and mufi legitimate all the 
Part that may be caWd Invention, or Parable in 
the Story. 

The Second Party if the Editors Opinion may 

pafs, is (contrary to the Ufage of Second Parts,)

The Preface. 

every Way as entertaining as the Firft, contains 
as flrange and furprifing Incidents, and as great 
a Variety of them ; nor is the Application lefs fe~ 
rious, or fait able > and doubt lefs will, to the fob er^ 
as well as ingenious Reader, be every way as pro- 
fitable and diverting ,• and this makes the abridge 
ing this Work, as fcandalous, as it is knavijh 
and ridiculous ,• feeing, while tojhorten the Book, 
that they may jeem to reduce the Value, they 
flrip it of all thoje Reflections, as well religious as 
moral, which are not only the great eft Beautys of 
the Work, but are calculated for the infinite Ad- 
vantage of the Reader. 

By this they leave the Work naked of its brigh- 
teft Ornaments ; and if they zsoould, at the fame 
Time pretend, that the Author has fupplyd the 
Story out of his Invention, they take from it the 
Improvement, which alone recommends that In- 
vention to wife and good Men. 

Tfoe Injury thefe Men do the Proprietor of this 
Work, is a Practice all honeft Men abhor; and 
he believes he may challenge them to jhew the 
Difference between that and Robbing on the High* 
way, or Breaking open a Houfe, 

If they can't Jhew any Difference in the Crime, 
they will find it hard to fhew why there jhould be 
any Difference in the Punifhment : And he will 
anfwerfor it, that nothing Jhall be wanting on 
his Party to do them Juftice.

Robinson Crusoe, &c. 




|jj H A T homely Proverb ufed on fo 
many Occafions in England, viz,* 
'that ivhat is bred in the B ne will net 
go out of the Flejh, was never more 
verify 'd, than in the Scory of my 
Life^ Any one would chink, that 
after thirty-five Years AfRidion, and 
a Variety of unhappy Circumftances, which few- 
Men, if any ever, went thro* before, ; ftd after near 
feven Years of Peace and Enjoyment in the Fulnefs 
of ail Things ; grown old, and when, if ever, it 
might be allowed me to have had Experience of e- 
very State of middle Life*, and to know which was 
moft adapted to make a Man ccmpleatly happy: I 
fay, after all this> any one would have thoupht that 
the native Propenfity to rambling, which I gave an 
Account of in my firft Setting out into the World, 
to have been fo predominate in my Thoughts, 
fhould be worn out, the volatile Part be fully evacu- 
ated, or at leaft conbens'd, $nd I might atdi Years 
ot Age have been a little incin'd to flay at Home, 
and have done venturing Life and Fortune any more. 

A 3 Nay 



[<*] 



Nay farther, the common Motive of foreign Ad- 
ventures was taken away in me ; for I had no For- 
tune to make, I had nothing to feek : If I had gain'd 
ten thoufand Pound, I had been no richer; for I had 
already fufficient for me, and for thofe I had to 
leave it to ; and that I had was vifibly encreafing ; 
for having no great Family, I could not fpend the 
Income of what I had, unlefs I would fet up for 
an expenfive Way of Living, fuch as a great Family, 
Servants, Equipage, Gayety, and the like, which 
were Things I had no Notion of, or Inclination 
to ; fo that I had nothing indeed to do, but to fit 
ftill, and fulJy enjoy what I had got, and fee it in- 
creafe daily upon my Hands. 

Yet ail thefe Things had no Effeft upon me, or 
at leaft, not enough to refift the flrong Inclination I 
had to go abroad again, which hung about me like 
a chronical Diftemper ,• particularly the Defire of 
feeing my new Plantation in the Wand, and the Co- 
lony I left there, run in my Head continually. I 
dream'd of it all Night, and my Imagination run 
upon it all Day,- it was uppermoft in all my 
Thoughts, and my Fancy work'd fo fteadily and 
ftrongly upon it, that I talked of it in my Sleep ; 
in fhort, nothing could remove it out of my Mind; 
it even broke fo violently into all my Difcourfes, 
that it made my Conversation tirefome > for I could 
talk of nothing elfe, all my Difcourfe run into' it,- e- 
ven to Impertinence, and I faw it my felf. 

I have often heard Perfons of good Judgment fay. 
That all the Stir People make in the World about 
Ghofts and Apparitions, is owing to the Strength 
of Imagination, and the powerful Operation of Fan- 
cy in their Minds ; that there is no fuch Thing as a 
Spirit appearing, or a Ghoft walking, and the like ? 
That Peoples poring affectionately upon the paft 
Converfation of their deceased Friends, fo realizes 
it to them, that they are capable of fancying upon 
fome extraordinary Circumftances, that they fee 

them ; 



[71 



them; talk to them, and are arifwered by them, 
when, in Truth, there is nothing but Shadow and 
Vapour in the Thing ; and they really know nothing 
of the Matter; 

For my Part, I know not to this Hour, whether 
there are any fuch Things as real Apparitions, Spe- 
ctres, or walking of People after they are dead, or 
whether there is any Thing in the Stories they tell 
us of that kind, more than the Produft of Vapours, 
fick Minds, and wandring Fancies i But this I know, 
that my Imagination work'd up to fuch a Height, 
and brought me into fuch Excefs of Vapours, or 
what elfe I may call it, that I a&ually fupposclmy 
felf, oftentimes upon the Spot; at my old Caflle be- 
hind the Trees ; faw my old Spaniard, Friday's Fa- 
ther 3 and the reprobate Sailors I left upon the I- 
fland ; nay, I fancy 'd I talk'd with them, and look'd 
at them fo fteadily* tho' I was broad awake, as at 
Perfons juft before me j and this I did till I ofert 
frighted my felf with the Images my Fancy reprefen- 
ted to me : One Time in my Sleep I had the Villa- 
ny of the three Pyrate Sailors, fo lively related to 
me by the firfb Spaniard and Friday's father, that it 
was furpriling ; they told me how they barbaroufly 
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that 
they let Fire to the Provisions they had laid up, 
on Purpofe to diftrefs and ftarve them ,• Things that 
I had never heard of, and that yet were all of them 
true in Fad : And it was fo warm in my Imagination, 
and fo realiz'd to me, that to the Hour I faw them, 
1 could not be perfuaded,' but that it was or would 
be true ; alfohow I refented it, when the Spaniard 
complained to me, and how I brought them to Ju- 
ftice, try-M them before me, and ordered them all 
three to be hang'd : What there was really in this, 
fhall be feen in its Place : For however, I came to 
form fuch Things in my Dream, and what fecrec 
Converfe of Spirits injefted ir, yet there was, ljay i 
very much of it tine. 1 own, that this Dream had 

A 4 $e: 



nothing in it literally and fpecifically true; but the 
general Part was fo true, the bafe viJIanious Beha- 
viour of thefe three harden'd Rogues wasfuch,and 
had been fo much worfe than all I can defcribe, that 
the Dream had too much Similitude of the Fa<3, and 
as I would afterwards have punifhed them feverely j 
fo if I had hang d them all, I had been much in the 
Kight, and fhould ha' been juftified both by the 
Laws of God and Man. 

But to return to my Story j in this Kind of Tem- 
per I had hv d fome Years, I had no Enjoyment of 
my Life, no pleafant Hours, no agreeable Diverfion, 
but what had fome Thing or other of this in it; fo 
that my Wife, who faw my Mind fo wholly bent 
upon it, told me very ferioufly one Night, That (he 
believ d there was fome fecret powerful Impulfe of 
Providence upon me, which had determir/d me to 
thither again; and that fhe found nothing hindred 

?£,? 01ng ' J? Ut my bein S en S a S' d to a Wife and 
Children. She told me, that it was true, fhe could 
not think of parting with me ; but as fhe was af- 
Jur d, that if fhe was dead, it would be the firft 
Thing I would do : So as it feem'd to her, that 
the Thing was determined above, fhe would not be 
the only Obftruaion: For if I thought fit, and re- 

J. iTr t0 i e ° ~~~" here fte found me vei 7 intent l, P° n 
her Words, and that I Jook'd very earneftly at her; 

,ot J atlt a «'"le diforder'd her, and fhe ftopp'd. I 
ask d her, Why fhe did not go on, and fay out what 
toe was going to fay ? But I pereeiv'd her Heart 
was to full, and fome Tears flood in her Eyes ; Speak 
out my Dear, faid I, Are you willing I fhould go > 
No, Jays fie, very affeEiicnately, I am far from willing : 
But if you are refolv'd to go, fays fhe, and rather 
than I will be the only Hindrance, I will go with 
you ; for tho I think k a moft prepofterous Thing 
for one of your Years, and in your Condition, yet if 
it muft, be, faid fhe again weeping, I won't leave 
you i for if it be of Heaven, you muft do it. There 

is 



C 9 ] 

is no refitting it ; and if Keavcn makes it your t)uty 
to go, he will alfo make it mine to go with you, or 
otherwife difpofe of me, that I may not obftruft ic. 

This affe&ionate Behaviour of my Wife's brought 
me a little out of the Vapours, and I began to con- 
fider what I was a doing; I corrected my wandring 
Fancy, and began to argue with my felf fedately* 
what Bufinefs I had after threefcore Years, and afc 
ter fuch a Life of tedious Sufferings and Difafters* 
and clofed in (o happy and eafy a Manner, I fay* 
what Bufinefs I had to rufh into new Hazards, and 
put my felf upon Adventures, fie only for Youth and 
Poverty to run into. 

With thofe Thoughts, I confidered my new En- 
gagement, that I had a Wife, one Child born, and 
my Wife then great with Child of another ; that I 
had all the World could give me, and had no Need 
to feek Hazards for Gain ; that I was declining in 
Years, and ought to think rather of Jeaving what I 
had gained, than of feeking to increafe it ; that as to 
what my Wife had faid, of its being an Impulfe 
from Heaven, and that it fhould be my Duty to po, 
I had no Notion of that ; To after many of thefe Co- 
gitations, I ftruggled with the Power of my Ima- 
gination, reafon'd my felf out of it, as I believe Peo- 
ple may always do in like Cafes, if they will ; and, in a 
Word, I conquered it ,• composed my felf wich fuch 
Arguments as occur'd to my Thoughts, and which 
my prefent Condition furnim d me plentifully with, 
and particularly, as the moft effectual Method, I re- 
folv'd to divert my felf with other Things, and to 
engage in feme Bufinefs that might effectually tye me 
up from any more Excurfions of this Kind; for I 
found that Thing returned upon me chiefly when I 
was idle, had nothing to do, or any Thing of Mo- 
ment immediately before me. 

To this Purpofe I bought a little Farm in the 
County of Bedford, and refolv'd to remove my felf 
thither. I had a little convenient Houfe upon it, 

and 



r 10 ] 

and the Land about k I found was capable of great 
Improvement, and that it was many Ways fuited 
to my Inclination, which delighted in Cultivating, 
Managing, Planting and Improving of Land ; and 
particularly, being an Inland Country, I was remov'd 
from converfing among Ships, Sailors, and Things 
relating to the remote Part of the World. 

In a Word, I went down to my Farm, fettled my 
Family, bought me Ploughs, Harrows, a Cart, Wa- 
gon, Horfes, Cows, Sheep; and fetting ferioufly to 
Work, became in one half Year, a meer Country 
Gentleman; my Thoughts were intirely taken up in 
managing my Servants, cultivating the Ground, En- 
clofing, Planting, pc. and I liv'd, as I thought, the 
moft agreeable Lite that Nature was capable of di- 
re&ing, or that a Man always bred to Misfortunes 
was capable of being retreated to. 

I farmed upon my own Land, I had no Rent to 
pay, was limited by no Articles ,• I could pull up or 
cut down as I pleafed : What I planted, was for my 
feif, and what I improved, was for my Family ; and 
having thus left of the Thoughts of Wandring, I 
had not the leaft Difcomfort in any Part of Life, as 
to this World. Now I thought indeed, that I en- 
joy 'd that middle State of Life, which my Father 
fo earneftly recommended to me: A kind of heavenly 
Life, fomething like what is defcribed by the Poet 
upon the Subje& of a Country Life. 

Free from Vices, free from Care, 

Age ha5 no Pain> and Touth no Snare. 

But in the Middle of all this Felicity, one Blow 
from unfeen Providence unhing'd me at once; and 
not only made a Breach upon me inevitable, and in- 
curable ; but drove me, by its Confequence, upon a 
deep Rclapfe into the wandring Difpofition, which, 
as I may fay, being born in my very Blood foon re- 
cover'dis hold ot me, and like the Returns of a vio- 
lent 



[II] 



lent Diftemper, came on with an irrefiftible Force 
upon me i fo that nothing could make any more 
Impreffion upon me. This Blow was the Lofs of my 
Wife. 

It is not my Bufinefs here to write an Elegy upoti 
my Wife, give a Character of her particular Virtues* 
and make my Court to the Sex by the Flattery of a 
Funeral Sermon. She was, in a few Words, the 
Stay of all my Affair, the Center of all my Enter- 
prizes ; the Engine, that by her Prudence reduc'd me 
to that happy Compafs I was in, from the moft ex- 
travagant and ruinous Project that fluttered in my 
Head, as above ; and did more to guide my ram- 
bling Genius, than a Mother's Tears, a Father's In- 
ftru&ions, a Friend's Counfel, or all my own reafon- 
ing Powers could do, I was happy in liftening to 
her Tears, and in being moved by her Entreaties, 
and to the laft Degree defolate and diflocated in the 
World by the Lofs of her. 

When (he was gone, the World looked aukwardly 
round me ; I was as much a Stranger in it, in my 
Thoughts, as I was in the Brafels> when I went firft 
on Shore there i and as much alone, except as to the 
Aififtance of Servants, as I was in my Ifland. I knew 
neither what to do, or what not to do. I faw the 
World bufy round me, one Part labouring for Bread, 
and the other Part fquandring it, in vile Exceffes or 
empty Pleafures, equally miserable, becaufe the End 
they proposed Xt ill fled from them ; for the Men of 
Pleafure every Day furfeited of their Vice, and 
heaped up Work for Sorrow and Repentance ; and 
the Men of Labour fpent their Strength in daily 
Stragglings for Bread to maintain the vital Strength 
they laboured with; fo living in a daily Circulation 
of Sorrow, living but to work, and working but to 
live, as if daily Bread where the only End of wea- 
rifome Life, and a wearifome Life the only Occafion 
of daily Bread. 

This 



t « ] 

Tfhis put me in Mind of the Life I lived in my 
Kingdom, the Ifland ; where I fuffer'd no more 
Corn to grow, becaufe I did not want it ; and bred 
no more Goats, becaufe I had no more Ufe for 
them : Where the Money lay in the Drawer 'till it 
grew ill dew'd, and had fcaree the Favour to be 
look'd upon in 20 Years. 

Ail thefe Things, had I improved them as I ought 
to have done, and as Reafon and Religion had dicta- 
ted to me, would have taught me to fearch farther 
than human Enjoyments for a full Felicity, and that 
there was fomething which certainly was the Reafotl 
and End of Life, fuperiour to all thefe Things, and 
which was either to be poffefs'd, or at leaft hop'd 
for on this Side the Grave. 

But my Sage Counfellor was gone ; I was like a 
Ship without a Pilot, that could only run afore the 
Wind : My Thoughts run all away again into the 
old Affair ; my Head was quite turned with the 
Whimfies of foreign Adventures, and all the plea- 
fant innocent Amufements of my Farm, and my 
Garden, my Cattle, and my Family, which before 
entirely poffeft me, were nothing to me ,• had no 
Relifii, and were like Mufick to one that has no Ear, 
or Food to one that has no Tafte : In a Word, I 
refolv'dto leave off Houfe- keeping, lett my Farm, 
and return to London^ and in a few Months after, I 
didfo. 

When I came to London, I was ftill as uneafy as I 
was before ,• I had no Relifh to the Place, no Employ- 
ment in it, nothing to do but to faunter about like 
an idle Perfon, of whom it may be faid, he is per- 
fectly ufelefs in God's Creation, and it is not one 
Farthing Matter to the reft of his Kind, whether 
he be dead or alive. This alfo was the Thing, which 
of all Circumftances of Life was the moft my Aver- 
fiotu who had been all my Days ufed to an adtive 
Life ; and I would often fay to my felf, A State of 
Idlenefs is the very Dregs of Life j and indeed I thought 

I was 



in} 

I was much more fuitably employed, when I was 
26 Days a making me a Deal Board. 

It was now the Beginning of the Year 1693, when 
my Nephew, who as I have obfervd before, I had 
brought up to the Sea, and had made him Comman- 
der of a Ship, was come Home from a fhort Voyage 
to Bilboa, being the firft he had made : He came to 
me, and told me, that feme Merchants of his Ac- 
quaintance had been propofing to him to go a Voy- 
age for them to the Eaft- Indies and to China,as private 
Traders : And now Uncle, fays he, if you will go to 
Sea with me, VU engage to land you upon your old Habi- 
tation in the Jfland, for we are to touch at the Brajils. 

Nothing can be a greater Demonftration of a fu- 
ture State, and of the Exiftence of an invifible World, 
than the Concurrence of fecond Caufes, with the 
Ideas of Things, which we form in our Minds, per- 
fectly referv'd, and not communicated to any in the 
World. 

My Nephew knew nothing how far my Diflem- 
per of wandring was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his Thoughts to fay, 
when that very Morning before he came to me, I 
had in a great deal of Confufion of Thought, and 
revolving every Part of my Circumftances in my 
Mind, come to this Refolution, viz,. That I would 
go to Lisbon, and confult with my old Sea-Captain ; 
and fo if it was rational and practicable, I would 
go and fee the Ifland again, and fee what was be- 
come of my People there, I had pleased my felt 
with the Thoughts of peopling the Place, and car- 
rying Inhabitants from hence, getting a Patent for 
the Poflfeffion, and I know not what * when in the 
Middle of all this, in comes my Nephew, as I have 
faid, with his Projeft of carrying me thither, in his 
Way to the Eaft-Indies. 

Ipaus'da while at his Words, and looking fteadi- 
]y at him, What Devil y faid I, fent you of this unlucky 
jErrand ? My Nephew ftartl'd as if he had been 

frighted 



[ 14 ] 

frighted at firfl: ; but perceiving I was not much 
difpleafed with the Propofal, he recovered himfelf* 
I hope it may not be an unlucky Propofal, Sir, fays 
he, I dare fay ypu would be pleas'd to fee your new 
Colony there, where you once reigned with more 
Felicity, than moil of your Brother Monarchs in the 
World. 

In a Word, the Scheme hit fo exa£Hy with my 
Temper, that is to fay, with the Prepofleflion I was 
under- and of which I have faid fo much, that I tol4 
him in few Words, ii he agreed. with the Merchants, 
I would go with him : But I told him, I would not 
promife to go any farther than my own Ifland. Why 
Sir, fays he, you donh want to be left there again, I hope ? 
Why, faid I, can you not take me up again in your Re- 
turn ? He told me, it could not be poflible to do fo, 
that the Merchants would never allow him to come 
that Way with a loaden Ship of fuch Value, it being 
a Month's Sail out of his Way, and might be three 
or four : Bejides, Sir, if I fhould mi/carry, faid he, 
and not return at all, then you would be juft reduced to 
the Condition you were in before. 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a 
Remedy for it, which was to carry a framed Sloop on 
board the Ship, which being taken in Pieces, and 
fhipp'd on board the Ship, might by the Help of fome 
Carpenters, who we agreed to carry with us, be fet 
up again in the Ifland, and finifh'd, fit to go to Sea in 
a few Days. 

I was not long refolving; for indeed the Importu- 
nities of my Nephew join'd in, fo efte&ually with my 
Inclination, that nothing could oppofe me: On the 
other hand, my Wife beingdead, 1 had no Body con- 
cenui themfelves fo much forme, as toperfuademe 
one way or other, except my ancient good Friend the 
Widow, who earneftly ftruggled with me to confi- 
der my Years, my eafy Circumltances, and the need- 
lefs Hazards of a long Voyage ; and above all my 
young Children : But it was all to no Purpofe, I had 

an 



[15] 

„a irrefiftible Defire to the Voyage ; and I told her, 
I thought there was fomething fo uncommon in the 
Impreffions I had upon my Mind for the Voyage, 
that it would be a kind of refitting Providence, it I 
(hould attempt to flay at Home ,• after which, (he 
ceas ? d her Expoftulations, and joitvd with me, not 
only in making Provifion for my Voyage, but alfo 
in fettling my Family Affairs for my Abfence, and 
providing fpr the Education of my Children. 

In Order to this, I made my Will, and fettled the 
Eftatelhad, in fuch a Manner for my Children, and 
placed in fuch Hands, that I was perfe&ly eafy and 
fatisfyxl they would have Juftice done them, what- 
ever might befal jne ; and for their Education, I 
left it wholly to my Widow, with a fufficient Main- 
tenance to her felf for her Care : All which fhe richly 
deferv'd ; for no Mother could have taken more Care 
in their Education, or underftood it better ; and as 
(he liv 'd 'till I came Home, I alfo liv'd to thank her 
for it. 

My Nephew was ready to fail about the Beginning 
pf January 1694*5, and I with my Man Friday went 
on board in the Downs the 8th, having befides that 
Sloop which I mentioned above, a very confiderable 
Cargo of all Kinds of neceffary Things for my Co- 
lony, which if I did not find in good Condition, I 
refolv'd to leave fo. 

Firft, I carry M with me fome Servants, who I pur- 
posed to place there, as Inhabitants, or at leaft to 
fet on Work there upon my own Account while I 
ftay'd, and either to leave them there, or carry them 
forward as they fhould appear willing: ; particularly, 
Icarry'd two Carpenters, a Smith, and a very handy 
ingenious Fellow, who was a Cooper by Trade but 
was alfo a general Mechanick ; for he was dextrous 
at making Wheels, and Hand-Mills to grind Corn, 
was a good Turner, and a good Pot-Maker ; he 
alfo made any Thing that was proper to make of 
Earth, or of Wood j in a Word, we caiTd him Our 
Jack oj all Trades* With 



c Id ] 

With thefe I carry 'd a Taylor, who had offer'd 
himfelf to go Paflenger to the Eaftr Indies with my 
Nephew, but afterwards confented to flay on our 
New Plantation, and prov'd a mofi neceflary handy 
Fellow, as could be defir'd, in many other Bufineffes, 
befides, befides that of this Trade ,• for as I obferv\i 
formerly, Neceflky arms us for all Employments. 

My Cargo, as near as I can colled, for I have not 
kepc an Account of Particulars, confifted of a fuffi- 
cient Quantity of Linnen, andfome thin English Stuffs 
for cloa thing the Spaniards that I expefted to find 
there, and enough of them, as by my Calculation 
might comfortably fupply them for feven Years ; if 
I remember right, the Materials which I carry \i 
forcloathing them, with Gloves, Hats, Shoes, Stock- 
ings, and all fuch Things as they could want for 
wearing, amounted to above 200 Pounds, including 
fome Beds, Bedding, and Houfhold-Stuff, particu- 
larly Kitchen-Utenfils, with Pots, Kettles, Peuter, 
Brafs, &c* befides , near a hundred Pounds more in 
Iron- Work, Nails, Tools of every Kind, Staples, 
Hooks Hinges, and every neceffary Thing I coul4 
think of/ 

I carry'd alfo an hundred fpare Arms Muskets, and 
Fuzees, befides fome Piftols , a considerable Quan- 
tity of Shot of all Size~, three or four Ton of Lead, 
and two Pieces of Brafs Cannon ; and becaufe I knew 
not what Time, and what Extremities 1 was provi- 
ding for, I carry'd an hundred Barrels of Powder* 
befides Swords, and Cutlafles, and the Iron Part of 
feme Pikes, and Haiberts, fo that in (hort, we had 
a large Magazine of all Sorts of Stores ; and I made 
my Nephew carry two fmall Quarter- Deck Guns 
more than he wanted for his Ship, to leave behind, 
if their was Occafion ,• that when we came there, 
we might build a Fort, and man it againft all Sorts of 
Enemies : And indeed, I at firft thought there wculd 
be Need enough for it all, and much more, if we 
hop'd to maintain our Poffeffion of the Ifland, as (hall be 
be fecn in the Courfe of that Story. I had

I had not fuch bad Luck in this Voyage, as I had 
been ufed to meet with ; and therefore fhall have the 
lefs Occafion to interrupt the Reader, who perhaps 
may be impatient to hear how Matters went with 
my Colony ; yet fome odd Accidents, crofs Winds, 
&nd bad Weather happened, on this firft fetting out, 
which made the Voyage longer than I expe&ed it at 
firft ; and I who had never made but one Voyage, 
(viz.) my firft Voyage to Guinea, in which I might be 
faid to come back again, as the Voyage was at firft 
defign'd, began to think the fame ill Fate /till attend- 
ed me ; and that I was born to be never contented 
with my own Shore, and yet to be always unfortu- 
nate at Sea. 

Contrary Winds firft put us to the Northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where 
we lay Wind-bound two and twenty Days ; but we 
had this Satisfaction with the Difafter, that Provi- 
fions where here exceeding cheap, and in the utmoft 
Plenty ', fo chat while we Jay here, we never touchM 
the Ship's Scores, but rather added to them; here 
alfo I took feveral Uvq Hogs, and two Cows with 
their Calves, which I refolv'd, if I had a good Paf- 
fage, to put on Shore in my Ifland, but we found 
Occafion to difpofe otherwise of them. 

We fet out the 5 th of February from Ireland and 
had a very fair Gale of Wind for fome Days ; as I 
remember, is might be about the 20th ot February in 
the Evening late, when the Mate having the Watch, 
came into the Round-houfe, and told us, he faw a 
Flafh of Fire, and heard a Gunfir'd, and while he 
was telling us of it, a Boy came in, and told us the 
Boatfwain heard another. This made us all run out 
upon the Quarter- Deck, where for a while we heard 
nothing, but in a few Minuces we faw a very great 
Light, $nd found that there was fome very terrible 
Fire at a Diftance ; immediately we had recourfe to 
our Reckonings, in which we all agreed, that there 
could be no Land that Way, in which the Fire

flbew'd it felf, no not for 500 Leagues, for it appeared 
at YV. N. W. Upon this we concluded, it muft be 
fome Ship on Fire at Sea ,• and as by our hearing the 
Noife of Guns jud before, we concluded it could not 
be far off: We flood direftly towards it, and were 
prefently fatisfy'd we fliould difcover it, becaufe the 
farther we fail'd, rhe greater the Light appeared tho* 
the Weather being haizy, we could not perceive any 
Thing but the Light for a while ; in about half an 
Hour's Sailing, rhe Wind being fair for us, tho'not 
much of it, and the Weather clearing up a little, we 
could plainly difcern that it was a great Ship on fire 
in the Middle of the Sea. 

I was moft fenfibly touched with this Difafter tho* 
not at all acquainted with the Perfons engag'd in it ,* 
I prefently recolle&ed my former Circumftances, in 
what Condition I was in, when taken up by the 
Portugal Captain ; and how much more deplorable the 
Circumftances of the poor Creatures belonging to this 
Ship muft be, if they had no other Ship in Company 
with them : Upon this, I immediately ordered, that 
five Guns fliould be fir'd, one foon after another, 
that, if poflible, we might give Notice to them, that 
there was Help for them at hand, and that they 
mght endeavour to fave themfelves in their Boat ; 
for tho' we could fee the Flame of rhe Ship, yet they, 
it being Night, could fee nothing of us. 

We lay by fome Time upon tin's, only driving as 
the burning Ship drove, waiting for Day light; 
when on a fudden, to our great Terror, though we 
had Reafon to expert it, the Ship blew up in the 
Air; and immediately, that is to (ay, in a few Mi- 
nutes, all the Fire was out, that is to fay, the reft 
of the Ship funk: This was a Terrible; and indeed 
an affli&ing Sight, for the Sake of the poor Men, 
who, I concluded, muft be either all deftroy'd in the 
Ship, or be in the utmoft Diftrefs in their Boat in the 
Middle of the Ocean, which at prefcnt, by Reafon 
it was dark, I could not ice However, to direft 

them

them as well as I could, Icaufed Lights to be hung 
Out it ail the Pares of the Ship where we could, and 
which we had Lanthorns for, and kept firing Guns 
all the Night long, letting them know by this, that 
there was a Ship not far off. 

About 8 Clock in the Morning we difcover'd the 
Ship's Boats by the Help of our Perfpe&ive Glaffes* 
found there were two of them, both throng'd with 
People, and deep in the Water : We perceived they 
row'd, the Wind being againft them, that they faw 
our Ship, and did the utmoft to make us fee them. 

We immediately fpread our Antient to let them 
know we faw them, and hung a Waft out as a Signal 
for them to come on Board, $nd then made more 
Sail, ftanding dire&ly to them. In little more than 
half an Hour we came up with them, and in a word, 
took them all in, being no lefs than fixty four Men, 
Women, and Children ; for there were a great many 
Paffengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a French Mer- 
chant Ship of 300 Tun, homeward bound from Que* 
beck, in the River of Canada. The Mailer gave us 
a long Account of the Diftrefs of his Ship, how the 
Fire began in the Steerage by the Negligence of the 
Steerfman \ but on his crying out for Help, was, as 
every Body thought, entirely put out: But they 
foon found, that fome Sparks of the firfl: Fire had 
gotten into fome Part of the Ship, fo difficult to 
come at, that they could not effectually quench it; 
and afterward getting in between the Timbers, and 
within the Ceiling of the Ship, it proceeded into the 
Hold, and mattered all the Skill, and all the Appli- 
cation they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into 
their Boats, which to their great Comfort were pret- 
ty large, being their Long-Boat, and a great Shal- 
loup, befides a fmall Skiff which was of no great 
Service to them, other than to get Tome frefli Water 
and Provifions into her, after they had fecur'd their 

B % Liv§§ 



fio] 



Lives from the Fire. They had indeed fmall Hope 
of their Lives by getting into to theie Boacs at 
that Diftance from any Land, only as they faid well, 
that they were efcap'd from the Fire, and had aPof- 
fibility that fome Ship might happen to be at Sea, 
and might take them in. They had Sails, Oars, 
and a Compafs, and were preparing to make the beft 
of their Way back to Newfound-land, the Wind 
blowing pretty fair, for it blew aneafy Gale at S. E. 
by E. They had as much Provisions and Water, as 
with fparing it fo as to be next door to flarving, 
might fupport them about 12 Days; in which, if 
they had no bad Weather, and no contrary Windsi 
theCaptair faid, he hopM he might get the Banks of 
Newfound- land , and might perhaps take fome Fifti to 
fuftain them till they might go on Shore. But there 
were fo many Chances againft them in all thefe Cafes ; 
fuch as Storms to overfet and founder them ,• Rains 
and Cold to benumb and perifli their Limbs 5 contra* 
ry Winds to keep them out and ftarve them ; that it 
muft have been next to miraculous if they had efcap'd. 

In the midfl of their Confutations, every one being 
hopelefs, and ready to defpair, the Captain with 
Tears in his Eyes told me, they were on a fudden 
furpriz'd with the Joy of hearing a Gun fire, and 
after that four more; thefe were the five Guns, which 
Icaufedto be fired at firft feeing the Light : this 
revived their Hearts, and gave them the Notice, 
which, as above, I defir'd it ihould, (viz,.) that there 
was a Ship at hand for their Help. 

It was upon the hearing thefe Guns, that they 
took down their Maftsand Sails ; the Sound coming 
from the Windward, they refolv'd to lie by till Morn- 
ing. Some Time after this, hearing no more Guns, 
they fir'd three Muskets, one a considerable While 
after another ; but thefe, the Wind being contrary, 
we never heard. 

Some Time after that again, they were ftill more 
agreeably furpriz'd with feeing our Lights, and hear- 
ing 



["] 



ing the Guns, which as I have fa/d, I caus'd to be 
fir'd all the reft of the Night , this fet them to work 
with rheir Oars to keep their Boats a-head, at leaft, 
that we might the fooner come up with them ; and 
at laft, to their inexprefTible Joy, they found we 
faw them. 

It is impoffible for me to exprefs the feveral Ge- 
flures, the ftrange Extafies, the Variety of Poftures 
which thefe poor deliver'd People run into, to ex- 
prefs the Joy of their Souls at fo unexpe&ed a Deli- 
verance ; Grief and Fear are ealily described ,• Sighs, 
Tears, Groans, and a very few Motions of the 
Head and Hands made up the Sum of its Variety : 
But an Excefs of Joy, a Surpize of Joy has a Thou- 
sand Extravagancies in it -, there were fome in Tears; 
fome raging and tearing themfelves, as if they had 
been in the greatsflr Agonies of Sorrow ; fome ftark- 
raving and down-right Lunatick ; fome ran about 
the Ship ftamping with their Feet, others wringing 
their Hands ,* fome were dancing, fome finging, 
fome laughing, more crying ; many quite dumb, not 
able to fpeak a Word ; others lick and vomiting, fe- 
veral fwooning, and ready to faint ; and a few, were 
Crofling themfelves, and giving God Thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ,* there might be 
many that were thankful afterward, but the Paffion 
was too ftrong for them at firft, and they were not 
able to mafter it, they were thrown into Extafies and 
a kind of Frenzy, and fo, it was but a very few that 
were composed and ferious in their Joy. 

Perhaps alfo the Cafe may have fdme Addition to 
it, from the particular Circumftanc£ of that Nation 
they belong'd to, I mean the French ; whofe Temper 
is allow 'd to be more volatile, more paffionate, and 
more fprightly, and their Spirits more fluid than in 
other Nations. I am not a Philofopher enough to 
determine the Caufe, but nothing I had ever feen be- 
fore came up to it : The Extafies poor Friday, my 
trufy Savage, was in when he found his Father in the 

$ 3 Boa& 



Boat, came the neareft to it, and the Surprize of the 
Matter and his two Companions, who I delivered 
from the Villains that fet them on Shore in the Ifland, 
came a little Way towards it, but nothing was to 
compare to this, either that I faw in Friday , or any 
where elfe in my Life. 

It is further obfervable, that thefe Extravagan- 
cies did not fhew themfelves in that different Manner 
I have mentioned, in different Perfons only ; But ail 
the Variety would appear in a fhort Succeffion of 
Moments in one and the fame Perfon. A Man that 
we faw this Minute dumb, and as it were ftupid 
and confounded fhould the next Minute be dancing 
and hallowing like an Antick ; and the next Moment 
be tearing his Hair, or pulling his Clothes to Pieces, 
and ftamping them under his Feet, like a mad Man ; 
a few Moments after that, we fhould have him all it* 
Tears, then fick, then fwooning ,• and had not imme- 
diate Help been had, would, in a few Moments more 
have been dead > and thus it was not with one or 
two, or ten or twenty, but with the greateft Part of 
them ; and if I remember right, our Surgeon was ob- 
liged to let above thirty of them Blood. 

There were two Priefts among them, one an old 
Man, and the other a young Man ; and that which 
was ftrangeft was, that the oldeft Man was the worft. 

As foon as he fet his Foot on board our Ship, and 
faw himfelf fafe, he dropt down ftone-dead, to all Ap- 
pearance, not the leaft Sign of Life could be per- 
ceived in him ; our Surgeon immediatly apply'd proper 
Remedies to recover him, and was the only Man in 
the Ship that believ'd he was not dead ; at length he 
open'd a Vein in his Arm, having firft chaffd and 
rubb'd the Part fo as to warm it as much as poflible : 
Upon this the Blood which only dropped at firft, 
flowed fomething freely > in three Minutes after, the 
Man openM his Eyes, and about a quarter of an Hour 
#fter fhat he fpoke, grew better, and in a little 

fifflS 



[*J] 



Time quite well ; after the Blood was ftopp'd he 
walk'd about, told us he was perfe&ly well, took a 
Dram ot Cordial which the Surgeon gave him, and 
was wiiat we call'd, Come to him/elf; about a quarter 
of an Hour after this, they came running into the 
Cabin to the Surgeon, who was bleeding a French 
Woman, that had fainted ; and told him, the Prieft 
was gone ftark-mad ; it feems he had begun to re- 
volve the Change of his Circumftance in his Mind, 
and this put him into an Extafy of Joy, his Spirits 
whirl'd about fafter than the Veflels could convey 
them * the Blood grew hot and feverjfli, and the 
Man was as fit for Bedlam, as any Creature that e- 
ver was in it : The Surgeon would not bleed him 
again in that Condition, but gave him fomething to 
dole and put him to fleep, which after fome Time 
operated upon him, and he wak'd the next Morning 
perfe&ly compos'd, and well 

The younger Prieft behav'd with great Command 
of his Paffion, and was really an Example of a fe- 
rious well-govern'd Mind; at his firft coming on 
board the Ship, he threw himfelf flat on his Face, 
proftrating himfelf in Thankfulnefs for his Deliver- 
ance -,in which I unhappily and unfeafonably difturb'd 
him, really thinking he had been in a Swoon; but he 
fpake calmly, thanked me ; told me, he was giving 
God Thanks for his Deliverance; begg'd me to leave 
him a few Moments, and that, next to his Maker, he 
would give me Thanks alfo. 

I was heartily forry, that I difturb'd him, and not 
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
alfo; he continued in that Pofture about three Mi- 
nutes, or little more, after I Jeft him, then came to 
me, as he had faid he would, and with a great deal of 
Serioufnefs and Affe&ion, but with Tears in his Eyes 
thank'd me that had under God, given him and fo 
many miferable Creatures their Lives : I told him, I 
had no Room to move him to thank God for it, rather 
than me : For I had feea that he had done that already : 

B 4 But 



[ H ] 

But 1 added. That it Was nothing but what Reafon 
and Humanity di&ated to all Men, and that we had 
as much Reafon as be to give Thanks to God, who 
had blefs'd us fo far as ro make us the Inftruments of 
hib Mercy to fo many of his Creatures. 

After this, the young Prieft apply'd himfelf to his 
Country- Folks, labour'd to compofe them ; perfwad- 
ed, cntreated,argued, reafonM with them, and did his 
utmoft to keep them within the Exercife of their Rea- 
fon ,• and with fpme he had Succefs, tho* others were 
for a Time out of all Government of themfelves. 

I cannot help committing this to Writing,as perhaps 
it may be ufeful tothpfe into whofe Hands it may fall, 
in the guiding themfelves in all the Extravagances of 
;heir Paffions ; for if an Excefs of Joy can carry Men 
out to fuch a Length beyond the Reach of their Rea* 
fon, what will not the Extravagances of Anger, Rage, 
and a provok'd Mind carry us to ? and indeed here I 
faw Reafon for keeping an exceeding Watch over our 
Paffions of every JCind, as well thofe of Joy and Satis- 
faction, 4s thofe of Sorrow and Anger. 

We were Something difordered by thefe Extravagan- 
ces among our new Guefts for the firft Day ; but when 
they had been retir'd, Lodgings provided for them as 
well as our Ship would allow, and they had flept hear- 
tily, as raoft of them did, being fateagu'd and frighted 
they were quite another J>ort of People the next Day. 

Nothing of good partners pr civil Acknowledg- 
ments for the Kindnefs (hewn them was wanting ; the 
French, his known> are naturally apt enough to exceed 
that Way : The Captain and one of the Prieft came to 
me the next Day, and defiring tofpeak with me and my 
Nephew, the Commander, began to confult with us 
what fliould be done with them ; and firft they told us, 
that as we had laved their Lives, fo all they had was 
little enough for a Return to us for that JCindnefs re- 
ceived. The Captain faid, they had laved fome Mo- 
ney and fome Things of Value in their Boats, catch'4 
foftjly put pf the Flames, and it we wpuld accept it* 

tfey 



[ *5 ] 

they were ordered to make an Offer it all to us ; they 
only defired to be fet on Shore fome where in our 
Way,where if poflible they might get Paflage to France. 

My Nephew was for accepting their Mony at firft 
Word, and to confider what to do with them after- 
wards ; but I over-rul'd him in that Part, for 1 knew 
what it was to be fet on Shore in a ftrange Country ; 
and if the Portugal Captain, that took me up at Sea 
had ferv'd me fo, and took ail I had for my Deliver- 
ance, I rauft have ftarv'd, or have been as much a 
Slave at the Brajih as I had been in Barbary, the be- 
ing fold to a Mahometan only excepted ; and perhaps 
a Portuguefe is not much a better Matter than a T?urk t 
if not in fome Cafes a much worfe, 

I therefore told the French Captain that we had ta* 
ken them up in their Diftrefs, it was true ,• but that 
it was our Duty to do fo as we were Fellow-Crea- 
tures, and as we would defire to be fo delivered if 
we were in the like or any other Extremity ; that we 
had done nothing for them but what we believed they 
would have done for us, if we had been in their 
Cafe, and they in ours ; but that we took them up 
to fave them, not to plunder them ; and it would 
be a moft barbarous Thing to take that little from 
them which they had faved out of the Fire, and then 
fet them on Shore and leave them ; that this would 
be firft to fave them from Death, and then kill them 
our felves ; fave them from drowning, and abandon 
them toftarving; and therefore I would not let the 
leaft thing be taken from them : As to letting them 
on Shore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding 
Difficulty to us, for that the Ship was bound to the 
Eaft- Indies ; and tho* we were driven out of our 
Courfe to the Weft ward a very great Way, and per- 
haps was dire&ed by Heaven on purpofe for their De- 
liverance, yet it was impoffible for us wilfully to 
change our Voyage on this particular Account ; nor 
could my Nephew, the Captain, anfwer it to the 
freighters, wich whom he was under Charter-Party 



to ptirfue his Voyage by the Way of Brafil, and all I 
knew we could do for them, was to put our felves 
in the Way of meeting with other Ships homeward 
bound from the IVefi Indies y and get them Paffage, if 
poffible, to England or France. 

The firfi Part of the Propofal was fo fo generous 
and kind, they could not but be very thankful for 
it? but they were in a very great Conflernation, es- 
pecially the Paflengers, at the Notion of being car- 
ry 3 d away to the Eafl Indies ; they then intreated me, 
that feeing I was driven fo far to the Weftward, be- 
fore I met with them, I would at lea(t keep on the 
fame Courfe to the Banks of Newfound- Land , 
where it was probable I might meet with fome Ship 
or Sloop that they might hire to carry them back 
to Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable Requeft on 
their Part, and therefore 1 inclined to agree to it ; 
for indeed I confider'd, that to carry this whole Com- 
pany to the Eatt- Indies, would not only be an into* 
krable Severity upon the poor People, but would be 
ruining our whole Voyage by devouring all our Pro- 
vifions; fo I thought it no Breach of Charter-Party, 
but what an unforefeen Accident made absolutely 
peceflary to us, and in which no one could fay we 
were to blame ; for the Laws of God and Nature 
would have forbid that we fhould refufe to take up 
two Boats full of People in fuch a diftrefsM Condi- 
tion, and the Nature of the Thing as well refpcft- 
ing our felves as the poor People, obliged us to fee 
them on Shore fome where or other, for their Deli- 
verance ; fo I confented that we would carry them 
to Newfound-Land, if Wind and Weather would per- 
mit, and if not, that I would carry them to Marti- 
nko in the JVefi- Indies. 

The Wind continued frefh Eafterly, but the Wea- 
ther pretty good, and as it had blowed continually 
in the Points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, 
we miffed feveral Opportunities of fending them to 
j France j 



C *7 1 

France ; for we met feveral Ships bound to Europe, 
whereof two were French from St, Chriflopher's, but 
they had been fo long beating up againft the Wind, 
that they durft take in no Paffengers for fear of 
wanting Provifions for the Voyage, as well for 
themfelves as for thofe they fhould take in > fo we 
were obliged to go on. It was about a Week after 
this that we made the Banks of Newfound- Land, 
where, to fhorten my Story, we put ail our French 
People on Board a Bark, which they hir'd at Sea 
there, to put them on Shore, and afterwards to car- 
ry them to France, if they could get Provifion to vi- 
ctual themfelves with : When, I fay, all the French 
went on Shore, I fhould remember that the young 
Prieft I fpoke of, hearing we were bound to the Raft- 
Indies, defired to go the Voyage with us, and to be 
fet on Shore on the Coaft of Coromandel : I readily 
agreed to that, for I wonderfully lik'd the Man, and 
had very good Reafon, as will appear afterwards; 
alfo four of the Seamen entered themfelves on our 
Ship, and proved very ufeful Fellows. 

From hence, we dire&ed our Courfe for the Weft- 
Indies, fleering away S. and S.byE. for about 20 
Days together, fometimes Jirtle or no Wind at all, 
when we met with another Subjed for our Humanity 
to work upon, almoft as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the Latitude of 27 Degrees 5 Minutes 
N. and the 19th Day of March 1694-$, when we 
'fpy'd a Sail, our Courfe S. E. and by S. We foon 
perceiv'd it was a large Veflel, and that (he bote up 
to us, but could not at firft know what to make of 
her, till after coming a little nearer, we found fhe 
had loft her Main top-maft, Fore-maft and Boltfprit, 
and prefently fhe fired a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs ; 
the Weather was preccy good, Wind at K.N. W. a 
frefhGale, and we foon came to fpeak with her. 

We found her a Ship of Briflol, bound home from 
fiarbadoes, but had been blown out of the Road at 
Barbados a few Days before fhe was ready to fail, by 

a ter- 



[z8] 



a terrible Hurricane, while the Captain and Chief- 
Mate were both gone on Shore i fo that, befide the 
Terror of the Storm, they were but in an indifferent 
Cafe for good Artifts to bring the Ship home : They 
had been already nine Weeks at Sea, and had met 
with another terrible Storm after the Hurricane was 
over, which had blow them quite out of their 
Knowledge to the Weftward, and in which they loft 
their Malls, at above ; they told us they expe&ed to 
have feen the Bahama Iflands, but were then driven 
away again to the South-Eaft by a ftrong Gale of 
Wind at N N. W. the fame that blew now, and ha- 
ving no Sails to work the Ship with but a Main- 
Courfe, and a kind of fquare Sail upon a Jury-Fore- 
Maft, whi^h they had fet up, they couid not lye 
near the Wind, but were endeavouring to ftand away 
for the Canaries, 

But that which was worft of all, was, that they 
werealmoft ftarv'd for want of Prvifions, befides the 
Fatigues they had undergone ; their Bread and Flefh 
was quite gone, they had not one Ounce left in the 
Ship, and had none for n Days; the only Relief 
they had, was, their Water was not all fpent, and 
they had about half a Barrel of Flower left ; they had 
Sugar enough ; fome Succades or Sweet-meats they 
had at firft, but they were devoured, and they had 
jfeven Casks of Rum. 

There was a Youth and his Mother and a Maid- 
Servant on Board, who were going Paflengers, and 
thinking the Ship was ready to fail, unhappily came 
on Board the Evening before the Hurricane began, 
and having no Provisions of their own left, they 
were in a more deplorable Condition than the reft y 
for the Seamen being reduced to fuch an extreme 
Neceffity themfelves, had no Companion, we may be 
fure,for the poor Paflengers, and they were indeed in 
a Condition that their Mifery is very hard to defcribe. 

I had, perhaps, not known this Part, if my Curio- 
fity had npt led me, the Weather being fair and the 

Wind 



[19 3 



Wind abated, to go on Board the Ship : The Second 
Mate who upon this Occafion commanded the Ship/ 
had been on Board our Ship, and he told me indeed, 
that they had three Paflengers in the great Cabin, 
that they were in a deplorable Condition ; nay* 
fays he, I believe they are dead, for I have heard 
nothing of them for above two Days; and I was a- 
fraid to enquire after them, faid he, for I had no- 
thing to relieve them with. 

We immediately apply'd our felves to give them 
what Relief he could (pare ; and indeed I had fo 
far over-ruled Things with my Nephew, that I 
would have vi&uaird them, tho' we had gone away 
to Virginia, or any Part of the Coaft of America, to 
have Tupply'd our felves ; but there was no Nece- 
flity for that. 

But now they were in a new Danger; for they 
were afraid of eating to much, even of that little 
we gave them ; the Mate or Commander brought 
fix Men with him in his Boat, but thefe poor 
Wretches look'd like Skeletons, and were fo weak, 
they could hardly fit to their Oars : The Mate 
himfelf was very ill, and half ftarved ; for he declared 
he had referv*d nothing from theMen, and went Share 
and Share alike with them, in every Bit they eat. 

I caution'd him ta eat f^aringly, but fet Meat be- 
fore him immediately, and he had not eaten three 
Mouthfuls before he began to be Sick, and out of 
Order; foheflopM awhile, and our Surgeon mix'd 
him up fomething with fome Broath, which he faid 
would be to him both Food and Phyfick ; and after 
he had taken it, he grew better : In the mean Time, 
I forgot not the Men ; I order'd Vi&uals to be gi- 
ven them, and the poor Creatures rather devoured 
than eat it ; they were fo exceeding hungry, that 
they were in a kind ravenous and had no Com- 
mand of themfelves ; and two of them eat with fo 
much greedinefs, that they were in Danger of their 
Lives the next Morning.

The Sight of thefe Peoples Diftrefs was very friov* 
ing to me, and brought to Mind what I had a ter- 
rible ProfpeQ: of at my firft coming on Shore in my 
Ifland, where I had never the lean Mouthful of Food* 
or any Profpeft of procuring any ; betides the hourly 
Appreheniion I had of being made the Food of other 
Creatures: But all the while the Mate was thus re- 
lating to me the miferable Condition of the Ship's 
Company, I could not put out of my Thought the 
Story he had told me of the three poor Creatures in 
the Great Cabin, (viz..) the Mother, her Son, and 
the Maid-fervant, who he had heard nothing of for 
two or three Days ; and who he feem'd to eonfefs they 
had wholly negiefted, their own Extremities being 
fo great ; by which I understood, that they had real- 
ly given them no Food at all, and that therefore they 
miift be perifh'd, and be all lying dead perhaps on 
the Floor, or Deck of the Cabin. 

As I therefore kept the Mate, who we then called 
Captain, on board with his Men to refrefh them i 
fo I aifo forgot not the ftarving Crew that were left 
on board, but ordered my own Boat to go on board 
the Ship, and with my Mate and twelve Men to car- 
ry them a Sack of Bread, and four or five Pieces of 
Beef to boil. Our Surgeon charg'd the Men to 
caufe the Meat to be boil'd while they ftay'd, and 
to keep Guard in the Cook-Room, to prevent the 
Men taking it, to eat raw, or taking it out of the 
Pot before it was well boil'd, and then to give every 
Man but a very little at a Time ; and by this Cauti*- 
on he preierv'd the Men, who would other wife ha* 
killed themfelves, with that very Food that was gi* 
ven them on purpofe to fave their Lives. 

At the fame Time, I ordered the Mate to go into 
the Great Cabin, and fee what ; Condition the poor 
Paflengers were in, and if they were alive, to com- 
fort them, and give them what Refrefhment was pro- 
per ; and the Surgeon gave him a large Pitcher with 
fome of the prepaid Broth which he had given the 

iMatq 



[ 3i ] 

Mate that was on Board, and which he did not 
Queftion would reftore them gradually. 

I was not fatisfy'd with this, but as Ifaid above, 
having a great Mind to fee the the Scene of Mifery* 
which I knew the Ship itfelf would prefent me with, 
in a more lively Manner than I could have it by Re- 
port, I took the Captain of the Ship, as we now cal* 
I'd him, with me, and went myfelf a little after in 
their Boat* 

I found the poor-Men on board almoft in a Tumult 
to get the Vi&uals out of the Boyler before it was 
ready : But my Mate obferv'd his Order, and kept 
a good Guard at the Cook-Room Door, and the 
Man he plac'd there, after ufmg all poflible Per(wa- 
fion to have Patience, kept them off by Force 2 
However, he caufed fome Bisket Cakes to be dip- 
ped in the Pot, and.foften'd with the Lipuor of the 
Meat, which they call Brews, and gave them eve- 
ry one, One, to ftay their Stomachs, and told them 
it was for their own Safety that he was oblig'd to 
give them but a little at a Time : But it was all in 
vain, and had I not come on board, and their own 
Commander and Officers with me, and with good 
Words, and fome Threats alfo of giving them no 
more, I believe they would have broke into the 
Cook-Room by Force 3 and tore the Meat out of the 
Furnace : For Words are indeed of very fmall Force 
to a hungry Belly : However we pacify 'd -them, and 
fed them gradually and cautioufly for the. firft Time* 
and the next Time gave them more, and at laft 
fiird their Bellies, and the Men did well enough. 

But the Mifery of the poor Paflfengers in the Ca- 
bin, was of another Nature, and far beyond the reft j 
for as Jirfiy the Ship's Company had fo little for 
themfelves, it was but too true that they had at firft 
kept them very low, and at laft totally neg- 
lefted them h fo that for fix or feven Days, it might 
be faid, they had really had no Food at ah, an4 
forfeveral Days before, very little. The poor Mo- 
ther, 



[JO 



thfer, who as the firft Men reported, was a Woman of 
good Sence and good Breeding, had fpar'd all (he 
could get, fo affe&ionately for her Son, that at laft 
fhe entirely funk under it: And when the Mate of 
our Ship went in, fhe fat upon the Floor or Deck, 
with her Back up againft the Sides, between two 
Chairs, which were lafh'd faft, and her Head funk 
in between her Shoulders, like a Corpfe, tho' not 
quite dead. My Mate faid all he could to revive 
and encourage her, and with a Spoon put fome Broth 
into her Mouth ', fhe open'd her Lips, and lifted up 
one Hand* but could not fpeak ; yet (he underftood 
what he faid, and made Signs to him, intimating, 
that ic was too late for her, but pointed to her Child, 
as if (he would have faid, they fhould take Care of 
him. 

However the Mate, who was exceedingly mov'd 
with the Sight, endeavour'd to get fome of the Broth 
into her Mouth h and as he faid, got two or three 
Spoonfuls down, tho' I queftion whether he could 
be fure of it or not 2 But it was to late, and (he dy'd 
the fame Night, 

The Youth who was preferved at the Price of his 
ttioft affe&ionate Mother's Lite, was not fo far gone, 
yet he lay in a Cabin- bed as one ftretch'd out, with 
hardly any Life left in him, he had a Piece of an 
old Glove in ins Mouth, having eaten up the reft of 
it; however, being young* and having more Strength 
than his Mother, the Mate got fomething down 
his Throaty and he began fenfibly to revive, tho* 
by giving him fome Time after but two or three 
Spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very lick, and brought 
it up again. 

But the next Care was the poor Maid, fhe lay 
all along upon the Deck hard by her Miftrefs, and 
juft like one that had fallen down with an Apoplexy 
and ftruggled for Life: Her Limbs were diftorted, 
one of her Hands was clafp'd round the Frame of a 
Chair, and fhe grip'd it fo hard, that we could not 



C33] 



eafily itoake her let go ; her other Arm lay over hef 
Head, and her Feet lay both together fet faft againft 
the Frame of the Cabin Table ; in fhorr, fhe lay juft 
like one in the laft Agonies of Death ; and yet fhe 
was alive too^ 

The poor Creature was not only ftarv'd with Hun- 
ger, and terrify 'd with the Thoughts of Death, but 
as the Men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted 
for her Mifttefs, who fhe (aw dying for two or three 
Days before, and who fhe lovM moft tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor Girl, for 
when our Surgeon* who was a Man of very great 
Knowledge and Experience, had with great Appli- 
cation recover'd her as to Life ; he had her upon his 
Hand as to her Senies, for fhe was little lefs than di- 
ftra&ed for a confiderable Time after, as fhall appear 
prefently. 

Whoever fhall read thefe Memorandums mufl be de- 
fied toconfider, that Vifits at Sea are not like a Jour- 
ney into the Country, where fometimes People itay a 
Week or a Fortnight at a P ace. Our Bufinefs was 
to relieve this diftrefled Ship's Crew, but not to lie 
by for them ; and tho* they were willing to fleer the 
fame Courfe with us for fome Days yet we could 
carry no Sail to keep Pace with a Ship that had no 
Mafts ; however, as their Captain begg'd of us to 
help him to fet up a Main- Top- Maft, and a kind of 
a Top Maft to his Jury Forc-Maft. We did, as it 
were lie by him for tnree or four Days, and then ha- 
ving given him five Barrels of Beef, a Barrel of Pork* 
two Hogfheads ofBisket, and a Proportion ot Peas* 
Flour, and what other Things we could fpare ', and 
taking three Casks of Sugar, fome Rum, and fome 
Pieces of Eight of them for Sansta&ion, we left 
them,taking on board with us, at their own earneftRe- 
queft, theYouth, and the Maid, and all their Goods*; 
The young Lad was about feventeen Years of Age^ 
a pretty, well-bred modeft, and fenlible Youth ; 
greatly deje&ed with the Lofs of his Mother, and 
as it feems had loft his Father but a few Months be* 

C for* 



[34] 

fore at Berbadoes* He begg'd of the Surgeon ta 
fpeak to me, to take him out of the Ship, for he 
faid the cruel Fellows had murther'd his Mother ; 
and indeed fo they had y that is to fay pajjively ; for 
they might ha' fpar'd a fmall Suftenance to the poor 
helplefs Widow, that might have preferv'd her Life, 
though it had been but juft to keep her alive. But 
Hunger knows no Friend, no Relation, no Juftice, 
no Right, and therefore is remorfelefs, and capable 
of no Companion. 

The Surgeon told him how far we were going, 
and how it would carry him away from all his Friends, 
and put him perhaps in as bad Circumftances almoft 
as thole we found him in ,• that is to fay, ftarving in 
the World. He faid hematter'd not whether he went, 
if he was but deliver'd from the terrible Crew, that 
he was among : That the Captain ( by which he 
meant me, for he could know nothing of my Ne- 
phew) had fav'd his Life, and he was fure would not 
hurt him ; and as for the Maid, he was fure if (he 
came to heifelf, fhe would be very thankful for it 3 let 
us carry them where we would. The Surgeon repre- 
fented the Cafe fo affe&ionately to me, that I yielded, 
and we took them both on board with all their 
Goods, except eleven Hogfheads of Sugar, which 
could not be removed or come at, and as the Youth 
had a Bill of Lad ng for them, I made his Com- 
mander fign a Writing, obliging himfelf to go as 
foon as he came to Briftol, to one Mr. Rogers a Mer- 
chant there, to whom the Youth faid he was related, 
and to deliver a Letter which 1 wrote to him, and 
all the Goods he had belonging to the deceafed Wi- 
dow ; which Ifuppofe was not done, for I could ne- 
ver learn that the Ship came to Briftol, but was, as 
is moft probable, loft at Sea, being in fo difabled a 
Condition, and fo far from any Land, that I am of 
Opinion, the firft Storm fhe met with afterwards, 
(he might founder in the Sea, for fhe was leaky, and 
|iad Damage in her Hold when we met with her. 

I was 



[??] 



t was now in the Latitude of 19 Deg* 32 Min.and 
had hitherto had a tolerable Voyage as to Weather, 
though at firft the Winds had been contrary. I fhail 
trouble no Body with the little Incidents of Wind, 
Weather, Currents, &c. on the reft of our Voyage ; 
but fhortning my Story for the fake of what is to 
follow, lhall obferve that I came to my old Habita- 
tion, the lfland, on the iothof April 1695. It was 
with no fmall Difficulty that I found the Place ; for 
as I came to ir, and went from it before, on the 
South and Eaft Side of the lfland, as coming from the 
Brajils, fo now coming in between the Main and the 
lfland, and having no Chart for the Coaft, nor any 
Land Mark, I did not know k when I faw it, or 
know whether I faw it or no. 

We beat about a great while, and went on Shore 
on feveral Iflands in the Mouth or the great River Oro- 
nooque, but none for my Purpole. Only this I learn'd 
by my Coafling the Shore, that I was under one 
great Miftake before, viz,, that the Continent which 
I thought I faw, from the lfland Ihv'd in, was real- 
ly no Continent, but a long liland, or rather a R <lge 
of Iflands, reaching from one o the other Side of 
the extended Mouth of that great River, and thac 
the Savages who came to my lfland, were not pro- 
perly thofe which we call Caribbees y bur Iflanuers 
and other Barbarians of the fame K.nd, who inhabi- 
ted fomething nearer to our Side than the reft. 

In fliort, I viiited feveral of thefe Iflands to no 
Purpofe ; fome I found were inha bi ed, and (ome 
were not. On one of them I found fome Spaniards^ 
and thought they had liv'd there, but fpeaking with 
them, found they had a Sloop lay in a fmall Creek 
hard by, and they came thither to make Salt, and to 
catch fome Pearl Mufsles if they could, but that they 
belongM" to the Ifle de T'yinidadj which lay farther 
North in the Latitude of 10 and 1 1 Degrees. 

Thus coafting from one lfland to another, fome- 
times with the Ship, fome times with the French Man's 

C 2 Shal- 



C 3<J] 

Shalloup, (which we had found a convenient Boat, 
and therefore kept her with their very good Will ,) at 
length I came fair on the South fide of my Ifland, and 
I prefently knew the very Countenance ot the Place ; 
fo I brought the Ship fafe to an Anchor, Broadfide 
with the little Creek where was my old Habitation. 

As foonas Ifawthe Place, I called for Friday, and 
ask'd him if he knew where he was ? He looked about 
a little, and prefently clapping his Hands, cry'd i O 
yes, there, yes, there,, pointing to our old Ha- 
bitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad 
Fellow, and I had much ado to keep him from jump- 
ing into the Sea, to fwim afhore, to the Place, 

Well, Friday, fays I, do you think we fhall find any 
Body here or no ; And what do you think, fliall we 
fee your Father? The Fellow flood mute as a Stock 
a good while, but when I nam'd his Father, the poor 
afte&ionate Creature look'd deje&ed, and I could fee 
the Tears run down his Face very plentifully. What 
is the Matter, Friday, fays I ? Are you troubled be- 
caufe you may fee your Father ? No, no, fays he, 
fhaking his Head, no fee him more, no ever more fee 
again ; why fo, faid I, Friday, how do you know that ? 
O no, O no, fays Friday, he long ago die, long ago; 
he much old Man. Well, well* fays I, Friday, you 
don't know; but fhall we fee any one elfethen ? The 
Fellow, it feems, had better Eyes than I, and he 
points juft to the Hill above my old Houfe ; and 
tho* we lay half a League off, he cries out, we fee I 
we feel yes, yes, we fee much Man there, and there, 
and there. I look'd, but I could fee no Body, no 
not with a Perfpedive Glafs ; which was, I fuppofe, 
becaufel could not hit the Place, for the Fellow was 
right, as I found upon Enquiry the next Day, and 
there was five or fix Men altogether, flood to look 
at the Ship, not knowing what to think of us. 

As foon as Friday had told me he faw People, I 
caus'd the Englifo Antient to be fpread, and fir'd 
three Guns, tQ give them Notice we were Friends, 

and 



C 37 3 

and in about half a Quarter of an Hour after, we 
perceiVd a Smoke rife from the fide of the Creek, (o 
I immediately order'da Boat out, taking Friday with 
me, and hanging out a white Flag, or Flag of Truce, 
I went dire&ly on Shore, taking with me the young 
Fryer I mentioned, to whom I had told the whole 
Story of my living there, and the Manner of it, and 
every Particular both of my felf, and thofe that I left 
there ; and who was on that Account extremely de- 
firous to go with me. We had befides about iixteen 
JVfen very well arra'd, if we had found any new 
Guefts there which we did not know of j but we had 
no J^feed of Weapons. 

As we went on Shore upon the Tide of Flood," 
near high Water, we row ci dire&ly into the Creek, 
and the firft Man I fix'd my Eye upon, was the Spa- 
niard whofe Life I had fav'd, and who I knew by his 
Face perfe&ly well ; as to his Habit I (hall defcribe 
it afterwards. I orderM no body to go on Shore at 
firft but my felf, but there was no keeping Friday in 
the Boat; for the affectionate Creature had fpy'd 
his Father at a Diftance, a good Way off of the Spa- 
niard*, where indeed I faw nothing of him ; and if 
they had not let him go on Shore, he would have 
jump'd into the Sea. He was no fooner on Shore, 
but he flew away to his Father like an Arrow- 
out of a Bow. It would have made any Man have 
(hed Tears in Spight of the firmeft Refolution, to 
have feen the firft Tranfports of this poor Fellow's 
Joy when he came to his Father ; how he embraced 
him, kifs'd him, ftrok'd his Face, took him up in his 
Arms, fet him down upon a Tree, and lay down by 
him ; then flood and look'd at him, as any one would 
look at a ftrange Pi&ure for a Quarter of an Hour 
together; then lye down on the Ground, and ftroke 
his Legs, and kifs them, and then get up again* and 
ftare at him ; one would ha* thought the Fellow be- 
witch'd : But it would have made a Dog laugh to 
fee how the next Day his Paffion run out another 

C 3 Way; 



[?8] 



Way : In the Morning he walk M along the Shore, 
to and again, with his Father feveral Hours, always 
leading him by the Hand, as if he had been a La- 
dy ; and every now and then he would comedo fetch 
fomething or other for him to the Boat, either. a 
Lump of Sugar, or a Dram, a Biskec Cake, or fome- 
thing or other that was good In the Afternoon his 
Frolicks run another Way ; for then he would fet the 
old Man down upon the Ground, and dance about 
him, and made a Thoufand an tick Poftures and Ge- 
fhires; and all the while he did this, he would be 
talking to him, and teil.ng him one Story or another 
of his Travels, and of what had happened to him 
Abroad, to divert him. In fhort, if the fame filial 
Affection was to be found in Chriftians to their Pa^ 
rents, in our Part of the World, one would be 
tempted to fay, there would hardly ha' been any 
Need of the fifth Commandment. 

But this is a Digreffion ; I return to my Landing, 
It would be endlefs to take Notice of all the Cere- 
monies and Civilities that the Spaniards receiv'd me 
with. The firft Spaniard, who, as 1 faid, I knew 
very well, was he whofe Life I had fav'd ; he came 
towards the Boat, attended by one more, carrying 
a Flag of Truce alfo ; and he did not only not 
know me at firft, but he had no Thoughts, no No- 
tion of its being me that was come, till I fpoke to 
him : Seignior, faid I in Portug?*efe y Do you not 
know me ? At which he fpoke not a Word j but gi- 
ving his Musket to the Man that was with him, 
threw his Arms abroad, and faying fomething in 
Spanijhy that I did not perfectly hear, come forward, 
and embrae'd me, telling me he was inexcufaole, not 
to know that Face again, that he had once feen, as 
of an Angel from Heaven fent to fave his Life : He 
faid Abundance of very handfome Things, as a well 
bred Spaniard always knows how ; ard then beckon- 
ing to the Perfori that attended him,, bad him go and 
call out his Comerades. He then ask'd me, if I 

woulcj 



C39] 

would walk to my old Habitation, where he would 
give me Poflfeffion of my own Houfe again, and 
where I (hould fee there had been but mean Improve- 
ments ; fo I walk'd along with him ; but alas I could 
no more find the Place again, than if I had never 
been there ; for they had planted fo many Trees, and 
plac'd them in fuch a Pofture, fo thick and clofe to 
one another ; and in ten Years Time they were grown 
fo big, that in fbort the Place was inacceflible, ex^ 
£ept by fuch Windings and blind Ways, as they them- 
f<? Ives only, who made them, could find. 

I ask'd them what put them upon all thefe Forti- 
fications? He told me, I would fay there was need 
enough of it, when they had given me an Account 
how they had pafs'd their Time fince their Arriving 
in the Ifland, efpecially after they had the Misfor- 
tune to find that I was gone : He told me, he could 
not but have fome Satisfa&ion in my good Fortune, 
when he heard that I was gone in a good Ship, and 
to my Satisfa&ion ,• and that he had often-times a 
ftrong Perfwafion, that one Time or other he ftiould 
fee me again : But nothing that ever befel him in his 
Life, he faid^ was fo furprizing and aflli&ing to 
him ^.t firft, as the Disappointment he was under 
when hq came back to the Ifland, and found I was 
not there. 

As to the three Barbarians (fo he called them) that 
were left behind ? and of whom he faid he had a long 
Story to tell me ; the Spaniards all thought them- 
felves much better among the Savages, only that 
their Number was fo (mall. And, fays he, had 
they been ftrong enough, we had been all long ago in 
Purgatory ; and with that he crofs'd himfelf on 
the Breaft : But Sir, fays he, I hope you will not be 
difpleafed, when 1 (hall tell you how forc'd by Ne- 
ceffity we were oblig'd, for our own Prefervation to 
difarm them, and making them our Subje&s, who 
would not be content with being moderately our 
Matters, but would be our Murtherers. I anfwer'd, 

C 4 I was 



C4o] 

I was heartily afraid of it when I left them there ; 
and nothing troubled me at my parting from the 
Ifland, but that they were not come back, that J 
might have put thepa in Poflfeffion of every Thing 
firft, and left the other in a State of Subjection, as 
they deferv'd : But if they had reduced them to it, 
I was very gladi and fhould be very far from finding 
^ny Fault with it $ for I knew they w$re a Parcel of 
refractory, ungovern'd Villains, and were fit for any 
Manner of Mifchief. 

While I was faying this, came the Man whom he 
had fent back, and with him eleven Men more : In 
the Drefs they were in, it was impoffible to guef$ 
what Nation they were of : But he made all clear 
both to them and to me. Firft he turn'd'to me, and 
pointing to them, faid, Thefe, Sir, are fome of the 
Gentlemen who owe their Lives to you ; and then 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them 
know who I was ; upon which they all came up one 
by one, not as if they had been Sailors and ordinary 
Fellows, and I the like, but really, as if they had 
been Ambafladors of Noblemen, and I a Monarch or 
a great Conqueror ; their Behaviour was to the laft 
Degree obliging and courteous, and yet miVd with 
a Manly, Majeftick Gravity, which very well be- 
came them ; and in fliort, they had fo much more Man- 
ners than I, that I fcarce knew how to receive their 
Civilities, muchlefs how to return them in Kind* 

The Hiftory of their coming co, and Condud in 
the Ifland, after my going away, is fo very remarka- 
ble, and has fo many Ire dents, which the former 
Part of my Relation will help to underftand, and 
which will in molt of the Particulars, refer to that 
Account I have already given, that I cannot but 
commit them with great Delight to the reading of 
thofe that come after me, 

I fhall no longer trouble the S.ory with a Relation 
in the firft Fenon, which will put me to the Expence 
of ten Ihoufand jfo*V J\ and faid he's, and he told mes 

and 



[41] 

and I told bim-s, and the like, but I fhall colled the 
Fa&s Hiftoncaily, as near as I can gather themouc 
of ipy Memory from what they related to me, and 
from what I ma with in my converting with them 
and with the Place. 

In order to do this fuccin&ly, and as intelligibly 
as I can, I muft go back to the Circumftance in which 
I left the Ifland and in which the Perfons were of 
whom lam to fpeak. And firft it is neceflary to 
repeat, that I had fent away Fridays Father and the 
Spaniard, the two whofe Lives I had refcued from the 
Savages, I fay, I had fent tl,em away in a large Ca- 
noe to the Main, as I then thought it, to fetch over 
the Spaniard's Companions who he had left behind 
him in order to fave them from the like Calamity that 
he had been in ; and in order to fuccour them for the 
prefent, and that if poffible, we might together find: 
fome Way for our Deliverance afterward. 

When I fent them away, I had no vifible Appear- 
ance of, or the leaft Room to hope for my own De- 
liverance any more than I had twenty Year before, 
much lefs had I any Fore-knowledge of what after- 
ward happened, I mean of an Englifh Ship coming 
on Shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but 
be a very great Surprize to them when they came 
back, not only to find that I was gone but to 
to find three Straingers left on the Spot, poffefs'd of 
all that I had left behind me, wnich would other- 
wife have been their own. 

The firft Thing, however, which I enquired into, 
that I might begin where I left off, was of their own 
Part ,• and I defir'd he would give me a particular 
Account of his Voyage back to his Countrymen with 
the Boat, when I fent him to fetch them over. He 
told me there was little Variety in that Part, for no- 
thing remarkable happened to them on the Way, they 
having very calm Weather, and a fmooth Sea ; for 
his Countrymen it could not be doubted, he faid, 
but that they were overjoy 'd to fee him : It feems he 

was 



C 41 ] 

was the principle Man among thern^ the Captain of 
the Veflfel they had been fhipwreck'd in, having been 
dead (ome Time) they were, he faid> the more fur- 
prized to fee him, becaufe they knew that he was fal- 
len into the Hands of the Savages, who, they were 
fatisfy'd, would devour him as they did all the reft 
of the Prifoners, that when they told them the 
Story of his Deliverance, and in what Manner he 
was furnifh'd for carrying them away, it was like 
a Dream to them ; and their Aftonifhment, they faid, 
was fomething like that of Jofeph's Brethren, when 
he told them who he was, and told them the Story 
of his Exaltation in Pharoatfs Court: But when he 
dewed them the Arms, the Powder, the Ball, and 
the Provifions that he brought them for their Jour- 
ney or Voyage, they were reftor'd to themfelves, 
took a juft Share of the Joy of their Deliverance, 
and immediately prepared to come away with him. 

Their firftBufinefswasto get Canoes ; and in this 
they were obliged not to ftick fo much upon the ho- 
reft Part of it, but to trefpafs upon their friendly 
Savages, and to borrow two large Canoes or Peria- 
gua's, on pretence of going out a Fifhing, or for 
Pleafure. 

In thefe they came away the next Morning » it 
feems they wanted no Time to get themfelves ready $> 
for they had no Baggage, neither Clothes orProviii- 
ons, or any Thing in the World, but what they had 
on them, and a few Roots to eat, of which theyufed 
to make their Bread. 

They were in all three Weeks abfent, and in that 
Time, unluckily for them, I had the Occafion offer'd 
for my Efcape, as I mention *d in my other Part, and 
to get oft from the Ifland, leaving three of the moft 
impudent, hardened, ungover'd, difagreeable Vil- 
lains behind me, that any Man could defire to meet 
with, to the poor Spaniards great Grief and Difap- 
pointmenr, you may be fure. 

The 



The only jufl: Thing the Rogues dM, was, That 
when the Spaniards came on Shore, they gave my Let- 
ter to them, and gave them Provifions and other Re- 
lief, as I had ordered rhem to do ; alfo they gave 
them the long Paper of Dire&ions which I had left 
with them, containing the Particular Methods which 
I took for managing every Part of my Life there, the 
Way how 1 baked my Bread, bred up tame Goats, 
and planted my Corn, how I curd my Gripes, made 
my Pots, and, in a Word, every Thing I did, ail this 
being written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two 
of whom underftand Englifh well enough; nor did 
they refufe to accommodate the Spaniards with any 
Thing elfe, for they agreed very well for fome Time > 
they gave them an equal Admiflion into the Houfe, 
or Cave, and they began to live very fociable, and 
the Head Spaniard, who had fcen pretty much of my 
Method, and Friday's Father together, managed all 
their Affairs ; for, as for the Englijh Men, they did 
nothing but ramble about thellland, (hoot Parrots, 
and catch Tortoifes, and when they came Home 
at Night, the Spaniards provided their Suppers for 
them. 

The Spaniards would have been fatisfy'd with this, 
would the other but have let them alone, which, 
however, they could not find in their Hearts to do 
long; but, like the Dog in the Manger, they would 
noteatthemfelves, and would not let others eat nei- 
ther : The Differences, neverthelefs, were at iirft 
but trivial, and fuch as are not worth relating ,• but 
at laft it broke out into an open War, and it begun 
with all the Rudenefs and infolence that can be ima- 
ging, without Reafon, without Provocation, con- 
trary to Nature, and indeed, to common Senfe ; and 
tho* it is true the firft Relation of it came from the 
Spaniards themielves, who I may call the Accufers, 
yet when I came to examine the Fellows, they could 
not deny a Word of it. 

But 



C 44 ] 

But before I come to the Particulars of this Part^ 
J muft fupply a Defedt in my former Relation, and 
this was, that I forgot to fet down among the reft, 
thatjuft as we were weighing the Anchor to fet Sail> 
there happened a little Quarrel on board our Ship, 
which I was afraid once would have turned to a fe- 
cond Mutiny ? nor was it appeas'd, till the Captain 
jrouzing up his Courage, and taking us all to his Af- 
fiftance, parted them by Force, and making two of 
the moft refadory Fellows Pdfoners, he laid them in 
Irons, and as they had been a&ive in the former Difr 
orders, and let fall fome ugly dangerous Words the 
fecond Time, he threatn'd to carry them in Irons to 
England, and have them hang'd there for Mutiny, 
and running away with the Ship. 

This, it feems, tho' the Captain did not intend to 
do it, frighted fome other Men in the Ship, and fome 
of them had put it into the Heads of the reft, that 
the Captain only gave them good Words for the pre- 
fers, till they would come to fome Englijb Port, and 
that then they ftiould be all put into Jayl, and try'd 
for their Lives. 

The Mate got Intelligence of this, and acquainted 
us with it , upon which it was dedr'd, that I, who 
ftill pafs'd for a great Man among them, fhould go 
down wich the Mate, and fatisfy the Men, and tell 
them, that they might be aflur'd, if they behav'd well 
the reft of the Voyage, ail they had done for the Time 
paft (hould be pardon'd. Sol went, and after paffing 
my Honour 's Word to them, they appear 'd eafy ,• and 
the morefo, when Icaufed the two Men, who were 
in Irons, to be releafedand forgiven. 

But this Mutiny had brought us to an Anchor for 
that Night, the Wind a»f o falling calm, next Morning 
we found, that our two Men who had been laid in 
Irons, had ftole each of them a Musket, and fome o- 
ther Weapons, what Powder or Shot they had, we 
know not; and had taken the Ship's Pinnace, which 

was 



[ 4? 3 

was not yet hal'd up, and ran away with her to their 
Companions in Rogury op Shore- 

As foon as we found this, I order'd the Long-Boat 
on Shore, with twelve Men and the Mate, and a- 
way they went to feek the Rogues, but they could nei- 
ther find them* or any of the reft ; for they all fled in- 
to the Woods when they faw the Boat coming on 
Shore. The Mate was once refolv'd in Juftice to 
their Rogery, to have deftroy'd their Plantations, 
burnt all their Houfhold-Stuffand Furniture, and left 
them to fhift without it ; but having no Order, he 
let it ail alone, left every Thing as they found it, and 
bringing the Pinnace away, came on Board with- 
out them. 

Thefe two Men made their Number five, but the 
other three Villains were fo much wickeder than thefe, 
that after they had been 2 or 3 Days together, they 
turned their two New-Comers out of Doors to Ihifc 
for themfelves, and would have nothing to do with 
them, nor could they for a good while be perfuaded 
to give them any Food ; as for the Spaniards they 
were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came firft on Shore, theBufi- 
nefs began to go forward ; the Spaniards would have 
perfuaded the three Engh(b Brutes to have taken in 
their two Country-men again, that, as they faid, they 
might be all one Famiiy ; but they would not hear of 
it : So the two poor Fellows liv'd by themfelves, and 
finding nothing but Induftery and Application would 
make them live comfortably, they pitchM their 
Tents on the North Shore of the Ifland, but a little 
more to the Weft, to be out of the Danger of the Sa- 
vages, who always landed on the Eafi Parts of the 
Ifland. 

Here they built them two Huts, one to lodge in, 
and the other to lay up. their Magazines and Stores 
in, and the Spaniards having given them fome Corn 
for Seed, and efpecially fome of the Peas which I 
had left them, they dug and planted, and enclofed, 

after 



[4*5 



after the Pattern I had fet for them all, and begin td 
live pretty well ; their firft Crop of Corn was on the 
Ground, and tho* it was but a little Bit of Land 
which they had dug up at firft, having had but a 
little Time, yet it was enought to relieve them, and 
find them with Bread and other Eatables ,• and one 
of the Fellows being the Cook's Mate of the Ship, 
was very ready at making Soup, Puddings, and fueh 
other Preparations, as the Rice, and the Milk, and 
fuch little Flefh as they got, furnifti'd him to do. 

They were going on in a little thriving Pofture, 
when the three uttattiral Rogues, their own Country 
men too, in meer Humour, andtoinfult them, came 
and bully'd them, and told them, the Ifland was 
theirs, that the Governour, meaning me, had given 
them Pcfleffion of it, and no Body elfe had any right 
to it, and damn 'em, they (hould build no Houfes 
upon their Ground, unlefs they would pay them Rent 
for them. 

The two Men thought they had jefted at firft, 
ask'd them to come in and fit down, and fee what 
fine Houfes they were that they had built, and tell 
them what Rent they demanded, and one of them 
merrily told them, if they were Ground-Landlords, 
he hoped, if they built Tenements upon their Land, 
and made Improvements, they would, according to 
theCuftom of Landlords, grant them alongLeafe, 
and bid them go fetch a Scrivener to draw the Wri- 
tings. One of the three damning and raging, told 
them, they fhould fee they were not in Jeft, and go- 
ing to a little Place at a Diftance, where the honeft 
Men had made a Fire to drefs their Viduals, he takes 
a Fire-brand, and claps it to the Out-fide of their 
Hut, and very fairly fet it on Fire, and it would 
have been all burnt down in a few Minutes, if one 
of the two had not run to the Fellow, thruft him a- 
way, and trod the Fire out with his Feet, and that 
not without fome difficulty too. 

The 



t 47 3 

The Fellow was in fuch a Rage at the honed Man's 
thrufting him away, that he turned upon him with a 
Pole he had in his Hand, and had not the Man avoid- 
ed the Blow very nimbly, and run into the Hut, he 
had ended his Days at once; his Comrade feeing 
the Danger they were both in, run in after him, and 
immediately they came both out with their Muskets, 
and the Man that was firft ftruck at with the Pole, 
knock 'd the Fellow down that begun the Quarrel, 
with the Stock of his Musket, and that before the 
other two could come to heip him, and then feeing 
the reft come at them, they flood together, and pre- 
ferring the other Ends of their Pieces to them, bad 
them ftand off. 

The other had Fire- Arms with them too, out 
one of the two honeft Men, bolder than his Come- 
rade, and made defperate by his Danger, toid them, 
if they offered to move Hand or Foot they were dead 
Men, and boldly commanded them to lay down u^it 
Arms. They did not indeed lay down their Arms* 
but feeing him forefolute, it brought them to a Par- 
ley, and they confented to take their wounded Man 
with them, and be gone; and indeed it feems the 
Fellow was wounded fufficiently with the Blow ; 
however, they were much in the wrong, fince they 
had the Advantage, that they did not difarm them 
effe&ually, as they might have done, and have gone 
immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an Ac- 
count how the Rogues had treated them ; for the 
three Villains ftudied nothing but Revenge, and 
every Day gave them fomc intimation that they 
did fo. 

But not to crow'd this Part with an Account of 
the leflfer Part of their Rogueries, fuch as treading 
down their Corn, {hooting three young Kids, and a 
She-Goat, which the poor Men had got to breed up 
Tame for their Store ; and, in a Word, plaguing 
them Night and Day in this Manner, it forced the 
two Men to fuch a Defperation, that they refolv'd 

to 



t 48 3 

to fight them all three the firft Time they had a fait 
Opportunity; in order to this thty refoiv'd to go to' 
theCaftle, as they called it y chat was my old Dwel- 
ling where the three Rogues and the Spaniards all 
liv'd together, at that Time ; intending to have a 
fair Battle, and the Spaniards fhould (land by to 
fee fair Piay , fo they got up in the Morning before 
Day, and came to the Place, and caii'd the Englijh 
Men by their Names, telling a Spaniard that zniwcv'd, 
that they wanted to fpeak with them. 

It happened that the Day before two of the Spa- 
niards having been in the Woods, had feen one of the 
two EngliJIo Men, who, for" Diftin&ion,- I call the 
Honefi Men ; and he had made a fad Complaint to 
the Spaniards ^ of the Barbarous Ufage they had met 
with from their three Countrymen, and how they 
hadruin'd their Plantation, and deftroy'd their Corn* 
that they had labour'd fo hard to bring forward^ and 
kill'd the Miltch-Goat, and their three Kids, which 
was all they had provided for their Suftenance, and 
that if he and his Friends meaning the Spaniards^ did 
notaffift them again, they fhould be ftarved. When 
the Spaniards came Home at Night, and they were 
all at Supper, he took the Freedom to reprove the 
three EngliJIo Men, tho* in very gentle and mannerly 
Terms, and as'd them, How they could be fo cruel, 
they being harmlefs inoflfenfi-ve Fellows, and that 
they were pucting the'mfelves in a Way to fubfift by 
their Labour, and that it had coft them a great deal 
of Pains to bring Things to fuch Perfe&ion as they 
had? 

One of the Englijh Men returned very briskly, 
what had they to do there ? That they came on Shorer 
without Leave, and they fhould not Plant or Build 
upon the Ifland, it was none of their Ground. Why,; 
fays the Spaniard very calmly, Seignior Inglefe, they 
muft notflarve ? The Englijh Man reply'd like a true 
rough hewn Tarpaulin^ they might Starve and be 
Damtuk they fhould not Plant nor Build in that 

Place.

Place. Bat what muft they do then, Seignor, fays 
the Spaniard} Another of the Brutes returned, do! 
D ... • m 'em, they fhould be Servants and work for 
them. But how can you expert that of them, fays 
the Spaniard^ they are not tought with your Mo- 
ney; you have no Right to make them Servants? 
The Englijh Men anfwer'd, thelfland was theirs, die 
Governour had given it to them, and no Man nad a- 
hy thing to do there but themfelves ,• and with that 
fwore by his Maker, that they would go and burn ail 
their new Huts, they fhould build none upon their 
Land. 

Why; Seignior, fays the Spaniard, by the fame 
Rule we muft be your Servants too ? Ay, fays the 
bold Dog, and fo you fliall too, before we have done 
with you, mixing two or three G-d BammeYin the 
proper Intervales or his Speech ; the Spaniard only 
fmil'd at that, and made him no Anfwer : However* 
this little Difcourfe had heated them, and flatting up, 
one fays to the other, I think it was he they calTd 
Will. Atkins, Come Jack, let us go and have the t'o- 
ther Brufh with them ; we'll demolifh their Caftle t 
Til warrant you; they fhall plant no Colony in our 
Dominions. 

Upon this, they went all Trooping away, with 
every Man a Gun, a Piftol, and a Sword and 
friuttcr'd fome infolent Things among themfelves of 
what they would do to the Spaniards too, when Op- 
portunity offer'd ; but the Spaniards it feems did not 
fo perfectly underftand them, as to know all the Parti- 
culars, only, that in general, they threatned them 
hard for taking the two Englijh Mens Part. 

Whether they went or now they beftow'd their time 
that Evening, the Spaniards faid, they did not know ; 
but it feems they wander'd about the Country, Part 
of the Night, and then lyingdown in the Place which 
lufed to call my Bower, they were weary, and over- 
flept themfelves. The Cafe was this, they had re- 
jfolv'd to Hay till Mid- Night, and fo to take the poor 

D Men

Men when they were afleep, and a$ they acknow- 
ledged it afterwards, intended to fet Fire to theit 
Huts while they were in them, and either burn them 
in them, or murder them as they came out : and as 
Malice feldom fleeps very (bund, it was very ftrange 
they Ihould not have been kept waking. 

However, as the two Men had alfo a Defign upon 
them, as I have faid, tho' a much fairer one than 
that of Burning and Murthering, it happen'd, and 
very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone 
abroad, before the bloody-minded Rogqes came to 
their Huts. 

When they came there and found the Men gone, 
'Atkins, who it feems was the forwarded Man, call'd 
out to his Comerades, ha' Jack, here's the Neft, but 
D....n*em the Birds are flown: They mufed a 
while to think what (hould be the Occafion of their 
being gone abroad fo foon, and fuggefled prefeutly 
that the Spaniards had given them Notice of it, and 
with that they fhook Hands, and fwore to one ano- 
ther that they would bereveng'd of the Spaniards. As 
foon as they had made this bloody Bargain they fell 
to work with the poor Mens Habitation, they did 
not fet Fire indeed to any Thing, but they pull'd 
down both their Houfes, and pull'd them fo Limb 
from Limb, that they left not the leaft Stick ftanding* 
orfcarce any Sign on the Ground where they flood ; 
they tore all their little colle&ed Houfhold fluff in 
Pieces, and threw every Thing about in fuch a Man- 
ner, that the poor Men found afterwards fome of 
their Things a Mile off from their Habitation. 

When they had done this they pull'd up all the 
the young Trees which rhe poor Men had planted s 
pull'd up the Enclofure they had made to fecure then: 
Cattle and their Corn ; and in a Word, fack'd and 
plunder'd every thing, as compleatly as a Hoord of 
Tartars would have done. 

The two Men were at this Jun&ure gone to find 
them out, and had refolv'd to fight them whereever 

they 



[ 51 ] 

they had been, tho' they were but two to three : Sd 
that had they met, there certainly would have been 
Blood died among thern, for they were all very ftout 
refolute Fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more Care to keep them af- 
funder 3 then they themfelves could do to meet ; for, 
as if they had dogg'd one another when the three 
were gone thither, che two were here ; and afterwards 
when the two went back to find them, and three were 
come to the old Habitation again ; we fhall fee their 
differing Conduft prefently. When the three came 
back, like furious Creatures flufh'd with the Rage 
which the Work they had been about put them into,' 
they came up to the Spaniards, and told them what 
they had done, byway of Scoff and Bravado; and 
one df them ftepping up to one of the Spaniards, as 
if they had been a Couple of Boys at Play, takes hold 
bf his Hat, as it was upon his Head, and giving it a 
Twirl about, fleering in his Face, fays he to him, 
And you, Seignior, Jack Spaniard, (hall have the fame 
Sauce, if you do not mend your Manners : The Spaniard, 
who tho' a quiet civil Man, was as brave, as a Man 
could be de.fi red to be, and withal a ftfong well-made 
Man, look'd fteadily at him for a good while, and 
then, having no Weapon in his Hand, ftept gravely 
up to him, and with one Blow of his Fift knock'd 
himdown^ as an Ox is fell'd with a Pole-Axe ; at 
which one of the Rogues, infolent at the firft, fir'd 
hisPiftoI at the Spaniard immediately ; he mifs'd his 
Body indeed, for the Bullets went thro' his Hair, but 
6ne ofthetft touch' d the tip of his Ear, and he bled 
pretty much. The Blood made the Spaniard believe, 
he was more hurt then he really was, and that put 
him into fome Heat, for before, he a&ed all in a 
perfed Calm ; but now refolving to go thro' with his 
Work, he ftoop'd and took the Fellow's Musket who 
he had knock'd down, and was juft going to (hoot the 
Man who had fir'd at him, when the reft of the Spa- 
niards being in the Cave came out, and calling to 

D % him 



C5i] 



him not to (hoot, they ftept in, fecur'd the other 
two, and took their Arms from them. 

When they were thus difarm'd, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their Enemies, as well 
as their own Countrymen, they began to cool, and 
giving the Spaniards better Words, would have had 
their Arms again ; but the Spaniards confidering the 
Feud that was between them and the other two Eng- 
lish Men, and that it would be the beft Method they 
could take, to keep them from one another, told 
them, they would do them no harm, and if would 
live peacibly, they would be very willing to affift 
and fociate with them, as they did before ; but that 
they could not think of giving them their Arms 
again, while they appear'd fo refolv'd ro do Mifchief 
with them to their own Countrymen, and had even 
threatned them all, to make them their Servants. 

The Rogues were now more capable to hear 
Reafon, than to aft Reafon, but being refused their 
Arms, they went raving away, and raging like mad 
Men, threatning what they would do, tho' they had 
no Fire- Arms: But the Spaniards defpifing their 
Threatning, told them they fhould take Care how 
they offer ci any Injury to their Plantation or Cattle^ 
for if they did, they would (hoot them as they would 
do ravenous Beafts, wherever they found them ; and 
if they fell into their Hands alive, they (hould certain- 
ly be hang'd* However, this was far from cooling 
them, but away they went raging and fwearing like 
Furies of Hell. As foon as they were gone, came 
back the two Men in Paffion and rage enough alfo, 
tho 9 of another Kind ; for having been at their Plan- 
tation, and finding it all demolished and deftroy'd as- 
above, it will eafily be fuppos'd they had Provocation 
enough,' they could fcarcehave Room to tell their 
Tale, the Spaniards were fo eager to tell them theirs ? 
and it was ftrange enough to find that three Men 
fliould thus bully nineteen, and receive no Punifli- 
tnent at all. 

jhe 



[5*] 

The Spaniards indeed defpifed them, and efpeciak- 
ly having thus difarm'd them, made light of all their 
Threatnings ; but the two Englifh Men refolv'd to 
have their Remedy againft them, what Pains foe- 
verit coft to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told 
them, that as they were already difarm'd, they could 
not confent that they (the Two) fliould purfue them 
with Fire-Arms and perhaps kill them ; but faid 
the grave Spaniard, who was their Governour, we 
will endeavour to make them do you Juftice, if you 
will leave it to us ; for as there is no doubt but they 
will come to us again when their Paflion is over, being 
notable to fubfift without our Affiftance ,• we promife 
you to make no Peace with them, without having $ 
full Satisfaction tor you ,• and upon this Condition we 
hope you will promife, to ufe no Violence with 
them, other than in your own Defence. 

The two Eqglijb Men yielded to this very awkard^- 
ly, and with great Reluctance, but the Spaniards 
protefted, they did it only to keep them from Blood- 
lhed, and to make all eafy at laft ; for faid they, we 
are not fo many of us, here is Room enough for us 
all, and it is great pity we fhould not be all good 
Friends ; at length they did confent, and waited foe 
thelflue of the Thing, living forfome Days with the 
Spaniards, for their own Habitation was deftroyed. 

In about live Days Time the three Vagrants, tir'd 
with Wandring, and almoft ftarv'd with Hunger, 
having chiefly hVd on Turtles Eggs all that while, 
came back to the Grove ; and finding my Spaniard, 
who, as I have faid, was the Governour, and two 
more with him walking by the Side of the Creek; 
they came up in a very fubmiffive humble Manner, 
and begg'd to be received again into the Family,, 
The Spaniards ufed them civilly, but told them, they 
had a&ed fo unnaturally by their Countrymen, and 
fo very grofsly by them (the Spaniards) that they 

D 5 could 



[54] 

cpuld not come to any Concluilon, without con- 
fulting the two Englifo Men and the reft; but how- 
ever, they would go to them and difcourfe about it ? 
and they fliould know in half an Hour. It may be 
guefs'd, chat they were very hard put to it, for it 
feems, as they were to wait this half Hour for an 
Anfwer, they begg'd he would fend them out fome 
Bread in the mean Time, which he did, and fent 
them at the fame Time a large Piece of Goats Flefh, 
and a boil'd Parrot, which they eat very heartily, 
for they were hungry enough. 

After half an Hour's Confutation they were called 
in, and a long Debate had among them, their two 
Countrymen charging them with the Ruin of all their 
. Labour, and a Defign to murther them; all which 
they own'd before, and therefore could not deny 
now ; upon the whole, the Spaniard a£ted the Mode- 
rator between them, and as they had obliged the twq 
Englifh Men not to hurt the three while they were 
naked and unarard, fo they now oblige! the three 
to go and rebuild their Fellows twp Huts 3 one to 
be of the fame Dimenfions, and the other larger 
than they were before ; alfo to fence their Ground 
again where they had pull'd up the Fences, plant Trees 
in the Room of thofe pull'd up, dig up the Land again 
for planting Corn, where they had fpoil'd it ; and 
in a Word, to reftore every Thing in the fame State 
as they found it, as nearas they could, for entirely it 
could not be, the Seafon for the Corn, and the 
Growth of the Trees, and Hedges, not being pofli- 
ble to be recovered. 

Well, they fubmitted to ail this; and as they 
had Plenty of Provifions given them all the while, 
they grew very prderly, and the whole Society be - 
gan to live pleafantly and agreeably together again ; 
only that thefe three Fellows could never be perfwad- 
ed to work, I mean not for themfelves, except now 
and then a little, juft as they pleafed ; however, the 
Spaniards told them plainly, that if they would but 

Jive 



[55] 

five fociablyand friendly together, and ftudy in the 
whole the Good of the Plantation, they would be 
content to work for them, and let them walk about 
and be as idle as they pleased ; and thus having liv'd 
pretty well together for a Month or two, the Spa- 
niards gave them Arms again, and give them Liberty 
to go abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a Week after they had thefe 
Arms, and went abroad, but the ungrateful Crea^ 
tures began to be as infolent and troublefom as be- 
fore ,• but however, an Accident happening prefent- 
ly upon this, which endangered the Safety of them 
all, they were oblig'd to lay by all private Refent- 
meats, and look to the Prefervation of their Lives. 

It happened one Night, that the Spaniard Go- 
vernour, as I call him, that is to fay, the Spaniard 
whofe Life I had fav'd, who was now the Captain, 
or Leader, or Governour of the reft, found himfelf 
very uneafy in the Night, and could by no Means 
get any Sleep : He was perfe&ly well in Body, as 
he told me the Story, only found his Thoughts tu- 
multuous ; his Mind run upon Men fighting, and 
killing of one another, but was broad awake, and 
could not by any Means get any Sleep ; in (hort, 
he lay a great while, but growing more and more 
uneafy, he refolv'd to rife .• As they lay, (being fo 
many of them, upon Goat-skins, laid thick upon 
fuch Couches, and Pads, as they made for them- 
felves ; and not in Hammocks and Ship-Beds, as I 
did, who was but one, fo they had little to do, 
when they were willing to rife, but to get up upoa 
their Feet, and perhaps put on a Coat, fuch as it 
was, and their Pumps, and they were ready for going 
any Way that their Thoughts guided them. 

Being thus gotten up, he look'd out, but being 
dark, he could fee little or nothing, and befides, the 
Trees which I had planted, as in my former Ac- 
count is defcribed, and which were now grown tall 
intercepted his Sight, fo that he could only look up, 

D 4 an4 



[3f1 

and fee that it was a clear Star-light Night, and hear* 
ing no Noife, he, retur'd and laid him down again ; 
but it was all one, he could not fleep, nor could hq 
compofe himfelf to any Thing like Reft, but his 
Thoughts were to phe laft Degree uneafy, and yet he 
knew not for what. 

Having made fome Noife with rifjng and walking 
about, going out and coming in, another of them 
wak'd, and calling, ask*d, who it was that was up ? 
The Governour told him, how it had been with 
him : Say you fo, fays the other Spaniard, fuch Things 
are not to be flighted, I aflure you ,• there is certain- 
ly fome Mifchief working, fays he, near us, andpre- 
fently he asked him, where are the Englijh Men ? 
They are all in their Huts, fays he, fafe enough. It 
feems, the Spaniards had kept Poffeffion of the main 
Apartment, and had made a Place, where the, three 
EngUfh Men, fince their laft Mutiny, always quar- 
tered by themfelves and could not come at the reft. 
Well, fays the Spaniard, there is fomething in it, I 
am perfuaded from my own Experience ; I am 
Satisfy 'd our Spirits embodied have a Convene with, 
and receive Intelligence from the Spirits unem- 
bodied, and inhabiting the invifible World, and this 
friendly Notice is given for our Advantage, if w? 
know how to make ufe of it. Come, fays he, let 
us go out and look abroad, and if we find nothing 
at all in it to juftify the Trouble, Til tell you a Story 
to the Purpofe,that (hall convince you of the Juftice 
of my propofing it. 

In a Word, they went out to go to the Top of the 
Hill, where I us'd to go, but they being ftrong and 
in good Company, not alone, as I was, us'd none of 
my Cautions, to go up by the Ladder, and then pul- 
ling ic up after them, to go up a fecond Stage to the 
Top, but were going round through the Grove un- 
concerned and un weary, when they were furpnVd 
with feeing a Light, as of Fire, a very little Way 

off 



[57] 

p(f from them, and hearing the Voices of Men, not 
of one, or two, but of a greater Number. 

In all the Difcoveries 1 had made of the Savage? 
landing on the Ifland, it was my conftant Care to 
prevent them making the leaft Difcovery of there 
being any Inhabitant upon the Place ; and when by 
any Neceflity they came to know it, they felt it fo 
efte&ually, that they that got away, were fcare able 
to give any Account of it, for we disappeared as foon 
as poflible, nor did ever any that had feen me, efcape 
to tell any one elfe, except it was the three Savage? 
in our laft Encounter, who jumped into the Boat, of 
whom I mentioned, that I was afraid they fhould go 
Home and bring more Help. 

Whether it was the Confequence of the Efcape of 
thofe Men, that fo great a Number cartie now toge-* 
ther ; or whether they came ignorantly and by Acer 
dent on their ufual bloody Errand, the Spaniards 
could not it feems underftand ,* but whatever it was, 
it had been their Bufinefs, either to have conceal^ 
themfelves, or not to have feen them at all ,* much 
\tk to have let the Savages have feen that there were 
any Inhabitants in the Place : But to have fallen up- 
on them fo eflk&ually, as that not a Man of them 
(hould have efcap'd, which could only have been 
by getting in between them and their Boats ; but 
this Prefence of Mind was wanting to them, which 
was the Ruin of their Tranquility for a great while. 

We need not doubt, but that the Governour and 
the Man with him, furpriz'd with this Sight, run 
back immediately, and rais'd their Fellows, giving 
them an Account of the imminent Danger they were 
all in ; and they again as readily took the Alarm, but 
it was impoffible to perfwade them to ftay clofe with- 
in where they were, but that they muft run all out to 
fee how Things flood. 

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, 
and they had Opportunity enough for fome Hours to 
view them by the Light of three Fires they had 

made, 



[58] 



made at a Diftance from one another; what they 
were doing they knew not, and what to do them- 
felves they knew not. For, firft, the Enemy were 
too many ; and fecondly, they did not keep together, 
but were divided into leveral Parties, and where on 
Shore in feveral Places. 

The Spaniards were in no fmall Condemnation at 
this Sight ; and as they found that the Fellows ran 
ftraggling all over the Shore, they made no Doubt, 
but firft or laft, fome of them would chop in upon 
their Habitation, or upon fome other Piace^ where 
they would fee the Token of Inhabitants, and they 
were in great Perplexity alfo for fear of their 
Flock of Goats, which would have been little lefs 
than ftarving them, if they would have been de- 
flroy'd ; fo the firft Thing they refolv'd upon, was to 
dif patch three Men away before it was light, viz.. two 
Spaniards and one Englif]oman> to drive all the Goats 
away to the great Valley where the Cave was, and 
if Need were, to drive them into the very Cave itfelf. 

Could they have feen the Savages all together in 
one Body, and at any Diftance from their Canoes, 
they refolv'd, if they had been an hundred of them, 
to have attacked them ; but that could not be ob- 
tained, for they were fome of them two Miles off 
from the other, and as it appear'd afterwards, were 
of two different Nations. 

After having mufed a great while on the Courfe 
they fhould take, and beaten their Brains in consider- 
ing their prefent Circumftances ; they refolv'd at 
}aft, while it was dark, to fend the old Savage, Ftp- 
'day's ; Father, out as a Spy, to learn, if poffible, fome- 
thing concerning them, as what they came for, and 
what they intended to do, and the like ; the old Man 
readily undertook it, and ftripping himfelf quite 
naked, as moft of the Savages were, away he went: 
After he had been gone an Hour or two, he brings 
Word, that he had been among them undifcover*d, 

that 



[59] 

fhat he found they were two Parties*, and of two Fe- 
yeral Nations who had War with one another, and 
had had a great Battle in their own Country, and 
that both Sides having had feveral Prifoners taken in 
the Fight, they were by meer Chance landed 
all in the fame Ifland, for the devouring their Prifo- 
ners, and making merry ; but their coming fo by 
Chance to the fame Place had fpoil'd all their 
Mirth ; that they were in a great Rage at one 
another, and that fo near, that he belie v'd 
they would fight again, as foon as Day-light began 
to appear ,• but he did not perceive that they had 
any Notion of any Body's being on the Ifland but 
themfelves. He had hardly made an End of telling 
his Story, when they could perceive, by the unufual 
Noife they made, that the two little Armies were 
engaged in a bloody Fight. 

Friday's Father ufed all the Arguments he could 
to perfuade our People to lie clofe, and not be feen ; 
he told them their Safety confifted in ir, and that they 
had nothing to do but lie ftill, and the Savages 
would kill one another to their Hands, and the reft 
would go away ; and it was fo to a Tittle. But it 
was impoflible to prevail, efpecially upon the En- 
glifimen ; their Curiofity was fo importunate upon 
their Prudentials, that they muft run out and fee the 
the Battle : However, they ufed fome Caution too. 
(viz,.) they did not go openly, juft by their own 
Dwelling, but went farther into the Woods, and 
plac'd themfelves to Advantage, where they might 
fecurely fee them manage the Fight, and, as they 
thought, not to be feen by them ; but it feems the 
Savages did fee them, as we fhall find hereafter. 

The Battle was very fierce, and if I might believe 
the Englifomen, one of them faid, he could perceive, 
that fome of them were Men of great Bravery, of 
invincible Spirits, and of great Policy in guiding the 
Fight. The Battle, they faid, held two Hours, be- 
fore they could guefs which Party would be beaten ; 

but 



[<S ] 

but then that Party which was neareft our Peopled 
Habitation began to appear weakeft, and after fome 
Time more, fome of them began to fly; and this 
put our Men again into a great Confirmation, leafi 
any of thofe that fled fhould run into the Grove, be- 
fore their Dwelling, for Shelter, and thereby invo- 
luntarily difcover the Place,- and that by Confe- 
rence the Purfuers fhould do the like in Search for 
them. Upon this they refolv'd that they would 
ftand arm'd within the Wall, and whoever came into 
the Grove, they fhould fally out over the Wall and 
kill them; fo that, if poffible, not one fhould return 
to give an Account of it ,• they ordered alfo, that it 
fhould be done with their Swords, or by knocking 
them down with the Stock of the Musket, but not 
by fhooting them, for fear of raifingan Alarm by the 
Noife. 

As they expefted, it fell out ; three of the routed 
Army fled for Life, and, croiling the Creek, ran di- 
redly into the Place, not in the leaft knowing whe- 
ther they went, but running as into a thick Wood 
for Shelter; the Scout they kept to look Abroad, 
gave Notice of this within, with this Addition, to 
our Mens great Satisfaction, ( viz.. ) That the 
Conquerors had not purfued them, or feen which 
Way they were gone ; upon this, the Spaniard Go- 
vernour a Man of Humanity , would not fuffer them 
to kill the three Fugitives, but fending three Men 
out by the Top of the Hill, order'd them to go 
round and come in behind them, furprize and take 
Prifoners, which was done ,• the Refidue of the con- 
quered People fled to their Canoes and got off to Sea ; 
the Viftors retired, and made no Purfuit or very lit- 
tle, but drawing themfelves into a Body together, 
gave two great skreaming Shouts, which they fup- 
pos'd was by way of Triumph, and fo the Fight 
ended : And the fame Day, about three a Clock in 
the Afternoon, they alfo marched to their Canoes. 
And thus the Spaniards had their Ifland again tree to 

them- 



[ ■ <Si ] 

themfelves, their Fright was over, and they faw no 
Savages in feveral Years after. 

Atter they were all gone, the Spaniards came out 

of their Den, and viewing the Field of Battle, they 

found about two and thirty dead Men upon the Spot ; 

fome were killed with great long Arrows, lbme of 

which were found flicking in their Bodies ; but moft 

of them were killed with their great wooden Swords, 

fixteen or feventccn of which they found in the Field 

of Battle, and as many Bows, with a great many 

Arrows : Thefe Swords were ftrange great unwealdy 

Things, and they muft be very ftrong Men that ufed 

them : Moft of thofe Men that were kill'd with 

them, had their Heads mafh'd to Pieces, as we may 

fay, or as we call it in EngHfh, their Brains knocked 

out, and feveral their Arms and Legs broken ; (o 

that 'tis evident they fight with inexpreffible Rage 

and Fury. We found not one wounded Man that 

was not ftone dead ,* for either they flay by their E- 

nemy til) they have quite kill'd him, or they carry alt 

the wounded Men, that are not quite dead, away 

with them* 

This Deliverance tam'd our Englishmen for a great 
while ; the Sight had filfd them with Horror, and 
the Confequences appeared terrible to the laft Degree, 
efpecially upon fuppoling that fome Time or other 
they fhould fall into the Hands of thofe Creatures, 
who would not only kill them as Enemies, but kill 
them for Food, as we kill our Cattle. And they 
profefs'd to me, that the Thoughts of being eaten 
up like Beef or Mutton, though it was fuppos'd 
it was not to be till they were dead, had fomething 
in it fo horrible, that it naufeated their very Sto- 
machs, made them fick when they thought of it, 
and filled their Minds with fuch unufual Terror, that 
they were not themfelves for fome Weeks after. 

This as I laid, tam\i even the three Enghjh Brutes, 
I have been fpeaking of; and for a great while after, 
they were very tractable, and went about their com- 
mon* 



[ 6% ] 

tnon Bufinefs of their whole Society Well enough ; 
planted, fow'd, reaped, and began to be all naturaliz'd 
to the Country, But fomerime after this, they fell all 
into fuch fimple Meafures again as brought thetii 
into a great deal of Trouble. 

They had taken three Prifoners, as I had obferv'd, 
and thefe three being lufty flout young Fellows, they 
made them Servants, and taught them to work for 
them^ and, as Slaves, they did well enough; but 
they did not take their Meafures with them as I did 
by my Mm Friday, viz, to begin with them upon the 
Principle of having fav'd their Lives, and then iri- 
flruft them in the rational Principles of Life, much 
lefs of Religion, civilizing and reducing them by 
kind Ufage and aflfe&ionate Arguings ; but as they 
gave them their Food every Day, fo they gave therri 
their Work too, and kept them fully employed in 
Drudgery enough; but they failed in this, by it* 
that they never had them to affift them and fight for 
them, as I had my Man Friday,, who was as true to 
ine as the very Flefli upon my Bones. 

But to come to the Family Part, being all now 
good Friends; for common Danger, as I faid above, 
had effe&ually reconciled them, they began to confi- 
der their general Circumftances ; and the firft Thing 
that came under their Confiderat;ion was, Whether,, 
feeing the Savages particularly haunted that Side of 
the Ifland, and that there were more remote and 
retired Parts of it equally adapted to their Way of 
Living, and manifestly to their Advantage, they 
fhould not rather remove their Habitation, and plant 
in fome more proper Place for their Safety, and ef- 
pecially for the Security of their Cattle and Corn ? 

Upon this, after long Debate, it was concluded 
That they would not remove their Habitation ; be- 
caufe that fome Time or other, they thought they 
might hear from their Governour again, meaning me» 
and iflfhould fend any one to feek them, I fhould 
be fure to direft them to that S*de, where if they 

fiiould 



[^] 



ftiould find the Place demolifh'd, they would con- 
clude the Savages had kill'd us all, and we were 
gone, and fo our fupply would go too. 

But as to their Corn and Cattle, they agreed to 
remove them into the Valley where my Cave was, 
Where the Land was as proper for both, and where 
indeed there was Land enough : However, upon 
fecond Thoughts, they alter'd one Part of their Re- 
folution too, and refolv'd only to remove Part of 
their Cattel thither, and plant Part of their Corn 
there ; and fo if one Part was deftroy'd the other 
might be fav'd : and one Part of Prudence they ufed* 
which it was very well they did, viz.. That they ne- 
ver trufted thofe three Savages, which thev had Pri- 
ioners, with knowing any thing of the Plantation 
they had made in that Valley, or of any Cattle they 
had there ; much lefs of the Cave there, which they 
kept, in Cafe of Neceffity, as a fafe Retreat, and 
thither they carried alfo the two Barrels of Pow- 
der, which I had fent them at my comming away. 
But however they refolv'd not to change their Ha- 
bitation, yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co- 
vered it firft with a Wall or Fortification, and then 
with a Grove of Trees ; fo, feeing their Safety con- 
fided entirely in their being concealed, of which they 
were now fully convinc'd J they fet to Work to co- 
ver and conceal the Place yet more effe&ually thrai 
before: To this Purpofe, as I had planted Trees,* 
(or rather thruft in Stakes, which in Time all grew 
up to be Trees) for fome good Diftance before the 
Entrance into my Apartment, they went on in the 
fame Manner, and fill'd up the reft of that whole 
Space of Ground, from the Trees I had fet, quite 
down to the Side of the Creek, where aslfaid, I 
landed my Floats, and even into the very Ouze where 
the Tide flow'd, not fo much as leaving any Place 
to land, or any Sign that there had been any Land- 
ing thereabout : Thefe Stakes alfo, being of a Wood 
very forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, they 

cook 



t<%] 



took Care to have generally very much larger and 
taller than thofe which I had planted them fo 
very thick and clofe together, that when they had 
been three or four Years grown, there was no pierc- 
ing with the Eye any confiderable Way into the 
Plantation* And as for that Part which I had plan- 
ted, the Trees were grown as thick as a Man'si 
Thigh ,• and among them they placed fo many other 
fhort ones, and fo thick, that, in a Word, it flood 
like a Pallifado, a quarter of a Mile thick, and it 
was next to impoflible to penetrate it, but with a 
little Army to cut it all down ; for a little Dog could 
hardly get between the Trees, they ftood fo clofe. 
But this was not all ? for they did the fame by 
all the Ground to the right Hand, and to the Lefr^ 
and round even to Top of the Hill ; leaving no Way, 
hot fo much as for themfelves to come out, but by 
the Ladder placed up to the Side of the Hill, and 
then lifted up, and placed again from the firft Stage 
up to the Top ; which Ladder^ when it was taken 
down, nothing but what had Wings or Witchcraft 
toaflift it, could come at them. 

This was excellently well contriv'd : Nor was it 
lefs than what they afterwards found Occafion for; 
which ferv'd to convince me, that as human 
Prudence has Authority of Providence to juftify it, 
fo it has, doubtlefs, the Dire&ion of Providence td 
fet it to Work ,• and would we Iiften carefully to the 
Voice of it, I am fully perfuaded we might prevent 
many of the Difafters which our Lives are now, by 
our own Negligence, fubjedted to. But this by the 
Way. 

I return to the Story. They liv'd two Years after 
this in perfe6t Retirement, and had no more Vifits 
from the Savages ; They had, indeed, an Alarm gi- 
ven them one Morning which put them into a great 
Confternation ; forfomeofthe Spaniards being out 
early one Morning on the Weft Side, or rather the 
End of the Ifland, which, by the Way, was that End 

wer€ 



[<*] 



where I never went, for fear of being difcover'd, they 
were furpriz'd with feeing above twenty Canoes of 
Indians, juft coming on Shore. 

They made the beft of their Way Home, in Hur- 
ry enough •> and giving the Alarm to their Comrades, 
they kept clofe all that Day and the next, going ouc 
only at Night> to make obfervation : But they had 
the good Luck to be miftaken; for, wherever the 
Savages went, they did not Land at that Time on 
the Iiland, but purfued fome other Defign* 

And now thfcy had another Broil with the three 
EngUfhmen ; one of which, a raoft turbulent Fellow; 
being in a Rage at one of the three Slaves, which 
1 mentioned they had taken, beCaufe the Fel- 
low had not donefomething right which he bid him 
do, and feem'd a little untraceable in his fliowing 
him, drew a Hatchet out of a Frog Belt, in which 
he wore it by his Side, and fell upon the poor Savage, 
not to correft him, but to kill him. One of the 
Spaniards, who was by, feeing him give the Fellow a 
barbarous Cut with the Hatchet, which he aim'd at 
his Head, but ftruck into his Shoulder, fo that he 
thought he had cut the poor Creature's Arm off, ran 
to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor 
Man, clapt in between him and the Savage, to pre- 
vent the Mifchieh 

The Fellow being enrag'd the more at this, ftruck 
at the Spaniard with his Hatchet, and fwore he 
would ferve him as he intended to ferve the Savage ; 
which the Spaniard perceiving; avoided the Blow; 
and with a Shovel which he had in his Hand, (foe 
they were all working in the Field about their Corn- 
Land) knocked the Brute down : Another of the Eng* 
hfomen running at the fame Time to help his Com- 
rade, knock'd the Spaniard down ; and then two 
Spaniards* more came in to help their Man, and a 
third EngUfhman fell in upon them. They had none 
of them any Fire- Arms, or any other Weapons but 
Hatchets and other Tools> except this third Englijh- 

E men 1

man ; he had one of my old rufty Cutlafihes, with 
which he made at the two lafl Spaniard*, and wound* 
ed them both. This Fray fet the whole Family in 
an Uproar, and more Help coming in, they took the 
three EnglifimtnPrihncYS* The next Queftion was, 
What (hould be done with them, they had been fo 
often mutinous, and were fo furious, fo defperate, 
and fo idle withal, that they knew not what Courfe 
to take with therm for they were mifchievous to 
the heighefl Degree, and valued not what Hurt they 
did any Man ; fo that, in fhort 3 it was not fafe to 
live with them. 

The Spaniard, who was Governour, told them m 
fo many Words, That if they had been of his own 
Country he would have hang'd them ; for all Laws 
and all Governours were to preferve Society ', and 
thofe who were dangerous to the Society, ought to 
be expelled out of it ; but as they were Englifimen y 
and that it was to the generous Kind nefs of znEnghftr- 
man that they all ow'd their Prefervation an Deliver- 
ance, he would ufe them with all poffible Lenity, and 
would leave them to the Judgment of the other two 
Englijhmen, who were their Countrymen. 

One of the two honeft Englijhmen flood up, and 
{aid, they defied it might not be left to them ; for, 
fays he, I am furewe ought to fentence them to the 
Gallows y and with that gives an Account how Will. 
Atkim, one of the three, had propofed to have all the 
fiv e Englijhmen join together, and murder all the Spa-, 
niards when they were in their Sleep. 

When the Spanijh Governour this, he calls to 
William Atkins , How, Seignior Atkins, fays he, 
would you murder us all? What have you to fay 
* to that ? That hardened Villain was fo far 
from denying it, that he faid it was true 3 and 
G-d d — m him they would do it ftill before they 
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkim y 
fays the Spaniard, What have we done to you, 

that 



[ <*7 ] 

that you will kill us ? And what would you get 
by killing us? And what mult we do to prevent your 
killing us? Muft we kill you, or you will kill us? 
Why will you put us to the Neceffity of- this, Seig- 
nior Atkins ? fays the Spaniard very calmly and 
fmiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in fuch a Rage at the Spa- 
niard's making a Jeft of it, that had he not been 
held by three Men, and withal had no Weapons 
with him, it was thought he would have attempt- 
ed to have kill'd the Spaniard in the Middle of all 
the Company; 

This hair-brain'd Carriage obliged them to confi- 
der ferioufly what was to be done. The two Eng- 
lijhmen and the Spaniard who fav'd the poor Savage, 
was of the Opinion, that they fhould hang one of 
the three for an Example to the reft, and that, par- 
ticularly, it fhould be he that had twice attemp- 
ted to commit Murder with his Hatchet ; and in- 
deed there was fome Reafon to believe he had done it, 
for the poor Savage was in fuch a miferable Condi- 
tion with the Wound he had received, that it was 
thought he could not live. 

But the Governor Spaniard ftill faid No, it was 
an Englijhman that had fav'd all their. Lives, and he 
would never confent to put a Englifloman to Death, 
tho' he had murder'd half of them ; nay, he faid, 
if he had been kiifd himfelf by an Englijhman, and 
had Time left to fpeak, it fhould be, that they 
fiiould pardon him. 

This was fo pofitively infilled on by the Gover- 
nor Spaniard, that there was no gainfaying it ? and 
as merciful Councils are moft apt to prevail where 
they are fo earneftly prefs'd, fo they ah came into it •, 
but then it was to be confider'd, what fhould be 
done to keep them from doing the Mifchief they de- 
fign'd -, for all agreed, Governor and all, that Means 
were to be ufed for prefer ving the Soc.ety from Dan- 
ger ; after a long Debate it was agreed, Firft, That 

E % they 



[68] 

they fhould be difarm'd, and not permitted to haVe 
either Gun, or Powder, or Shot, or Sword, or any 
Weapon, and fliould be turn'd out of the Society, 
and left to live where they would, and how they 
would by themfelves ; but that none of the reft, ei- 
ther Spaniards or Englijh, fhould converge with them, 
fpeak with them, or have any Thing to do with 
them ,* that they fhould be forbid to come within 
a certain Diftance of the Place where the reft dwelt ; 
and that if they offered to commit any Diforder, fo 
as to fpoil, burn, kill, or deftroy any of the Corn, 
Plantings, Buildings, Fences, or Cattle belonging 
to the Society, that they fliould dye without Mercy, 
and they would fhoot them where-ever they could find 
them. 

The Governour, a Man of great Humanity, mu- 
fing upon the Sentence, confider'd a little upon it, 
and turning to the two honeft Englifomenfcid, Hold ; 
you muft refk<3, that it will be long e'er they can 
raife Corn and Cattle of their own, and they muft 
not ftarve ,• We muft therefore allow them Provi- 
fions, fo he caused to be added, That they fliould 
have a Proportion of Corn given them to laft them 
eight Months, and for Seed to fow, by which 
Time they might be fuppos'd to raifed fome of their 
own ; that they fliould have fix Miich-Goats, four 
He-Goats, and fix Kids given them, as well for 
prefent Subfiftence, as for a Store ; and that they 
fhould have Tools given them for their Work in the 
Fields h fuch as, fix Hatchets, an Ax, a Saw, and 
the like : But they fliould have none of thefe 
Tools or Provifions, unlefs they would fwear folemn- 
ly, that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or of their Fellow Engliflomen* 

Thus they difmis'd them the Society, and turr/d 
them out to fliift for themfelves. They went away 
fullen and refradory, as neither contented to go away, 
or to ftay ,• but, as there was no Remedy, they 
went, pretending to go and choofe a Place where 

they 



C<H>] 



they would fettle themfelves to plant and live by 
themfelves ; and fome Provifion were given them, but 
no Weapons, 

About four or five Days after, they came again for 
fome Vi&uals, and gave the Governour an Account 
where they had pitch'd their Tents, and marked 
themfelves out an Habitation and Plantation ,• and it 
was a very convenient Place indeed, on the remoteft 
Part of the Ifland, N. E. much about the Place 
where I providentially landed in my firft Voyage, 
when I was driven out to Sea, the Lord alone knows 
whether, in my foolifh Attempt to furround the 
Jdand. 

Here they built themfelves two handfome Huts, 
and contrived them, in a Manner, like my firft Ha- 
bitation, being clofe under the Side of a Hill, ha- 
ving fome Trees growing already on the three Sides 
of it, fo that by planting others, it would be very 
eafily covered from the Sight, unlefs narrowly fearch'd 
for ; they defied fome dry'd Goats-skins for Beds and 
Covering, which were given them ; and upon giving 
their Words, that they would not difturb the reft, 
or injure any of their Plantations, they gave them 
Hatchets and what other Tools they could fpare ; 
fome Peas, Barley, and Rice, for fowing, and, in a 
Word, any Thing they wanted, but Arms and Am- 
munition. 

They liv'd in this feparate Condition about fix 
"Months, and had gotten in their firft Harveft, tho ? 
the Quantity was but fmall, the Parcel of Land they 
had planted being but little ; for indeed, having all 
their Plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
Work upon their Hands ; and when they came to 
make Boards, and Pots, and fuch Things, they 
were quite out of their Element, and could make 
nothing of it ; and when the rainy Seafon came on, 
for want of a Cave in the Earth, they could not 
keep their Grain dry, and it was in great Danger of 
ipoiling : And this humbled them much ; fo they 

E 3 came

came and begg'd the Spaniards to help them, which 
they very readily did, and in four Days work'd a 
great Hole in the Side of the Hill for them, big 
enough to fecure their Corn, and other Things from 
the Rain ; but it was but a poor Place, at beft, com- 
par'd to mine ; and efpecially as mine was then, for 
the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made feve- 
ral new Apartments in it. 

About three Quarters of a Year after this Separa- 
tion, a new Frolick took thefe Rogues, which, to- 
gether with the former Villany they had committed, 
brought Mifchief enough upon them, and had very 
near been the Ruin of # the whole Colony : The three 
new Sociates began, it feems to be weary of the 
laborious Life they led, and that without Hope of; 
bettering their Circumftances; and a Whim took 
them, that they would make a Voyage to the Coh- 
tinent from whence the Savages came, and would 
try if they could not feize upon fome Prifoners a- 
mong the Natives there, and bring them Home, fo 
to make them do the laborious Part of their Work for 
them* 

The Projeel was not fo prepofterous, if they had 
gone no farther ; but they did nothing, and proposM 
nothing, but had either Mifchief in the Defign, or 
Mifchief in the Event : And if I may give my Opi- 
nion, they feem'd to be under a Blaft from Heaven ; 
for if we will not allow a vifible Curfe to purfue via- 
ble Crimes, how fhail we reconcile the Events of 
Things with the Divine Juftice ; It was certainly an 
apparent Vengeance on their Crime of Mutiny and 
Piracy, that brought them to the State they were 
in; and as they fhew <T not the leaft Remorfe for 
the Crime, but added new Villanies to it, iuch as, 
particularly, the Piece of monftrous Cruelty of 
Wounding a poor Slave, becaufe he did not, or per- 
haps could not, underftand to do what he was di- 
dire&ed ; and to wound him in fuch a Manner, as, 
fcoQueftiotVmade him a Cripple all his Life ; and in 



[7i] 

a Place where no Surgeon or Medicine could be had 
fpr his Cure; and what was ftill worfe, the murde- 
rous Intent, or, to do Juftice to the Crime, the in- 
tentional Murder, for fuch, to be fure it was, as 
was afterwards the form'd Defign they all laid, to 
murder the Spaniards in cold Blood, and in their 
Sleep. 

But I leave obferving, and return to the Story ; 
The three Fellows comes down to the Spaniards one 
M° r ning, and in very humble Terms defied 'to be 
admitted to fpeak with them : The Spaniards very 
jreadily heard what they had'to fay, which was this, 
That they were tir'd of living in the Manner they 
did ; that they were not handy enough to make the 
Neceffaries they wanted ; and that having no Help, 
they found they fliould be ftarvM : But if the Spa- 
niards would give them Leave to take one of the Ca- 
noes which they came over in, and give them Arms 
and Ammunition, proportioned for their Defence^ 
they would go over to the Main, and feek their For- 
tune, and fo deliver them from the Trouble of fupply- 
ing them with any other Provisions? 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them, 
but yet very honeftly reprefented to them the certain 
Deftru&ion they Were running into > told them, they 
had fuffer'd fuch Hardfhips upon that very Spot, that 
they could, without any Spirit of Prophefy/tell them, 
that they would be ftgrv'd, or be murder 'd> and bad 
them confider of it. 

The Men reply'd audacioufly, they fliould be 
flarv'd it they ftay'd here, for they could not work, 
and would not work ; and they could but be ftarv'd 
Abroad, and if they were murder'd, there'was an 
End of them, they had no Wives or Children to 
cry after them ; and in fhort, infifted importu- 
nately upon their Demand, declaring, that they 
would go, whether they would give them any Arm? 
or no. 

E 4 The 



c 71 ] 

The Spaniards told them, with great Kindne/I, 
that if they were refolv'd to go, they fhould net go 
like naked Men, and be in no Condition to defend 
themfelves ; and that though they could ill fpare 
their Fire- Arms, having not enough tor them- 
felves, yet they would let -them have two Muf- 
kets, a Piftol, and a Cutlafh, and each Man a Hatchet, 
which they thought was fufficient for them. 

In a Word, they accepted the Offer, and having 
baked them Bread enough to ferve them a Month, 
and given them as much Goats-Flefh as they could 
cat while it was fweet, and a great Basket full of 
dry'd Grapes, a Pot full of frefh Water, and a 
young Kid alive to kill, they boldly fet out in a Ca- 
noe for a Voyage over the Sea,, where it was at 
leaft 40 Miles broad. 

The Boat was indeed a large one, and would have 
very well carry'd fifteen or twenty Men ; and, there- 
fore, was rather too big for them to manage: But 
as they had a fair Breeze, and the Flood-Tide with 
them, they did well enough : They had made a 
Maft of a long Pole, and a Sail of four large Goat- 
Skins dry'd, which they had fow'dorlac'd together ; 
and away they went merily enough ; the Spaniards 
call'd after them, Bon Veyajo; and no Man ever 
thought of feeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often fay to one another, and 
the tvyo honeft Englijh Men who remained behind, 
how quietly and comfortably they liv'd now thofe 
three turbulent Fellows were gone ; as for their ever 
coming again, that was the remoteft Thing from 
their Thoughts that could be imagined ; when be- 
hold, after two and twenty Days Abfence, one of 
the Englifa Men being abroad upon his Planting- 
AVbrk, fees three ftrange Men coming toward him at 
a Diflance, with Guns upon their Shoulders. 

Away runs the Englijh Man, as if he was be- 
witch'd, comes frighted and amaz'd to the Go- 
vernour Spaniard^ and tells him they were all un- 
done^ 



C7?] 



done, for there were Strangers landed upon the I- 
fland, he could not tell who : The Spaniard, pau- 
fing a while, fays to him. How do you mean, you 
cannot tell who ? They are the Savages to be fure, 
No, no, fays the Englijhmqn, they are Men in Cloaths 
with Arms : Nay, then, fays the Spaniard, why are 
you concerned ? If they are not Savages they muft be 
Friends, for there is no Chriftian Nation upon Earth 
but will do us Good rather than Harm. 

While they were debating thus, comes the three 
fLngli[hmen, and {landing without the Wood, which 
was new planted, hallo'd to them ,• they prefently 
knew their Voices, and fo all the Wonder of that 
kind ceas'd. But now the Admiration was turn'd 
upon another Queftion, (viz..) what could be the 
Matter, and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the Men in, 
and enquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing, they gave them a full Account of 
their Voyage i{i a few Words, (viz,.) That they 
reach'd the Land in two Days, or fomething lefs, 
but finding the People alarm'd at their coming, and 
preparing with Bows and Arrows to fight them, 
they durft not go on Shore, but failed on to the 
Northward fix or feven Hours, till they came to a 
great Opening, by which they perceiv'dj that the 
Land they faw from our Ifland was not the Main, 
but an Ifland ; that entring that Opening of the Sea; 
they faw another Ifland on the Righthand North, and 
feveral more Weft ; and being refolv'd to land fome- 
where, they put over to one of the Iflands which 
lay Weft, and went boldly on Shore ; that they 
found the People very courteous and friendly to 
them, and that they gave them feveral Roots and 
fome dry'd Fifh, and appear'd very fociable; and 
the Women, as well as the Men, were very forward 
to fupply them with any thing they could get for 
them to ear, and brought it to them a great Way 
ppon their Heads. 

They 



[74] 



They continued here four Days, and enquired, as 
well as they could of them, by Signs, what Nations 
were, this Way, an4 that Way ,• and were told of 
feveral fierce and terrible People that liv'd almoft eve- 
ry Way ; who, as they made known by Signs ro 
them, ufed to eat Men ; but as for themfelves, they 
iaid, that they never eat Men or Women, except on r 
Jy fuch as they took in the Wars, and then they own'd 
that they made a great Feaft, and eat their Prifo- 
ners. 

The Englijh Met) enquired when they had a Feaft 
of that Kind, and they told them two Moons ago, 
pointing to the Moon, and then to two Fingers ; 
and that their great King had two hundred Prifoners 
now, which he had taken in his War ,• and they 
were feeding them to make them fat, for the next 
Feaft. The QngHJh Men feem'd mighty defirous to 
fee thofe Prifoners, but the other miftaking them, 
thought they were defirous to have fome of them, to 
carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned 
to them, pointing to the Setting of the Sun, and 
then to the rifing, which was to fignify, that the 
next Morning at Sun-rifing they would bring fome 
for them ; and accordingly the next Morning they 
brought down five Women and eleven Men, and gave 
them to the Englifh Men, to carry with them on 
their Voyage, juft as we would bring fo many Cows 
and Oxen down to a Sea- Port Town, to vi&ual a 
Ship. 

As brutifh and barbarous as thefe Fellows were 
at home, their Stomachs turn'd at this Sight, and 
they did not know what to do ', to refufe the Prifo- 
ners, would have been the higheft Affront to the fa- 
vage Gentry that offered them ; and what to do with 
them, they knew not; however^ upon fome Debates, 
they refolved co accept 6i them, and in Return, they 
gave the Savages 1 that brought them one of their 
Hatchets, an old Key, a Knife, and fix or feven of 
their Bullets, which though they did not underftand, 

they 



[75] 



they feemM extreamly pleased with : And then tyr 
ing the poor Creatutes Hands behind them,they (the 
People) dragg'd the Prifoners into the Boat for our 
Men. 

The EngUJb Men were oblig ? d to come away as 
foon as they had them, or elfe they that gave them 
this noble Preferft, would certainly have expe&ed 
fhat they fhould have gone to work with them, have 
kill'd two or three of them the next Morning, and 
perhaps have invited the JDonors to Dinner. 

But having taken their Leave with all the Rer 
fpe&s, and Thanks that could well pafs between 
People, where on either Side they underftoodnot 
one Word they could fay, they put off with their 
Boat, and came back towards the firft Ifland ; where 
when they arrived, they fet eight of their Prifoners 
at Liberty, there being too many of them for theit 
pccafibn. ' 

In their Voyage, they endeavoured to have fome 
Communication with their Prifoners, but it was im- 
poffible to make them underftand any Thing ; No- 
thing they could fay to them, or give them, or do 
for them, but was look'd upon as going about to 
jnurder them. They firft of all unbound them, but 
the poor Creatures skream'd at that, efpecially the 
Women, as if they had juft felt the Kife at their 
Throats ; for they immediately concluded, they 
were unbound on purpofe to be kill'd- 

If they gave them any Thing to eat, it was the 
fame Thing ; then they concluded it was for Fear 
they fhould fink in Flefh, and fo not be fat enough 
to kill. If they look'd at one of them more particu- 
larly, the Party prefently concluded, it was to fee 
whether he or fhe was fatteft, and fitteft to kill firft. 
Kay, after they had brought them quite over, and 
began to ufe them kindly, and treat them well, itill 
they expefted every Day> to make a Dinner or a 
Supper for their new Mafters. 

When 



[7«] 



When the three Wanderers had given this unac- 
countable Hiftory, or Journal of their Voyage, the 
Spaniard ask'd them, Where their new Family was ? 
and being told that they had brought them on Shore, 
and put them into one of their Huts, and were 
come up to beg fome Vi&uals for them ; they (the 
Spaniards) and the other two Englilhmen, that is to 
fay, the whole Colony, refolv'd to go all down to the 
Place and fee them, and did fo, and Friday's Father 
•with them. 

When they came into the Hut, there they fate all 
bound ; for when they had brought them on Shore, 
they bound their Hands that they might not take 
the Boat and make their efcape. There, I fay, they 
fate, all pf them ftark naked : Fir ft, There were three 
3Vfen, lufty comely Fellows, well fhaped, ftraitand 
fair Limbs, about thirty to thirty five Years of Age ; 
and five Women* whereof two might be from thirty 
to forty, two more not above four or five and twenty, 
and the fifth, a tall comely Maiden about fixteen or fe- 
venteen : The Women were well favoured agreeable 
Perfons both in Shape and Features, only tawny, and 
two of them, had they been perfeft White, would have 
pafs'dfor very handfome Women,even in London it'felf* 
having pleafant agreeable Countenances and of a very 
modeft Behaviour, efpecially when they came af- 
terwards to be cloath'd, and drefs'd, as they calfd 
jt> tho' that Drefs was very-indifferent it muftbe con* 
fefs'd ; of which hereafter. 

The Sight, you may be fure, was fomething un- 
couth to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a 
juft Chara&er) Men of the beft Behaviour ; of the 
moft calm, fedate Tempers, and perfect Good-hu- 
mour that ever I met with ; and in particular, of 
the moft Modefty, as will prefently appear : I fay, 
the Sight was very uncouth, to fee two naked Men 
and five naked Women, ail together bound, and in 
a moft miferable Circumftances that Human Nature 
could be fuppos'd to be, vi%> to be expe&ing every 

Momeue 



mi 

Moment to be dragg'd out, and have their Brains 
knock'd out, and then to be eaten up like a Calf 
that is kill'd for a Dainty. 

The firft Thing they did, was to caufe the old 
Indian, Friday's Father, to go in and fee firft if he 
knew any of them, and then if he underftood any of 
their Speech : As foon as the old Man came in, he 
look'd ferioufly at them, but knew none of them ; 
neither could any of them underftand a Word lie 
faid, or a Sign he could make, except one of the 
Women. 

However, this was enough to anfwer the End, 
which wastofatisfy them, that the Men into whole 
Hands they were fallen, were Chriftians; that they 
abhorr'd eating of Men or Women, and that they 
might be Cure they would not be kill'd : As foon as 
they were aflur'd of this, they difcover'd fuch a Joy, 
and by fuch aukward, and feveral Ways, as is hard to 
defcribe ; for it feems they were of feveral Nations* 

The Woman, who was their Interpreter, was 
bid in the next Place to ask them, if they were wil- 
ling to be Servants, and to Work for the Men who 
had brought them away, to fave their Lives ; at 
which they all fell a Dancing* and prefenrly one 
fell to taking up this, and another that, any Thing 
that lay next, to carry on their Shoulders, to inti- 
mate that they were willing to Work. 

The Governour, who found, that the having Wo- 
men among them would prefently be attended with 
fome Inconvenience) and might Occafionfome Strife, 
and perhaps Blood ; ask'd the three Men, what they 
intended to do with thefe Women, and how they 
intended to ufe them ; whether as Servants, or as 
Women ? One of the Englishmen anfwer'd very bold- 
ly and readily, That they would ufe them as both. 
To which the Governour faid, I am not a going to 
reftrain you from it, you are your own Matters as 
to that : But this I think is but juft, for avoiding Dis- 
orders and Quarrels among you \ and I defire it of 

you, 



[78] 



you, fet* that Reafon only, Wc That you will all 
engage, that if any of you take any of thefe Women, 
as a Woman or Wife, that he fliall take but one ; and 
that having taken one, none eife fhould touch her ; 
for tho' we cannot marry any of you, yet 'tis but rea- 
sonable, that while you flay here, the Women any 
of you takes, fhould be maintained by the Man that 
takes her, and fhould be his Wife ; I mean, fays 
he, while he continues here, and that none elfe (hall 
have any Thing to do with her: AH this appeared 
io Juft, that every one agreed to it without any Di- 
fficulty. 

Then the Englijhmen ask'd the Spaniards^ if they 
defign'd to take any of them ? But every one anfwer- 
ed N O : Some of them faid,they had Wives in Spain> 
and the others did not like Women that were not 
Chriftians,- and all together declar'd, that they 
would not touch one of them ,' which was an 
Inftance of fuch Virtue, as I have not met with 
in all my Travils. On the other Hand, to be 
fhort, the five Englijhmen took them every one a Wife* 
that is to fay, a temporary Wife $ and fo they 
fet up a new Form of Living ; for the Spaniards and 
Friday's Father liv'd in my old Habitation, which 
they had enlarg'd exceedingly within. The three Ser- 
vants which we taken in the late Battle of the Sa- 
vages, liv'd with them ; and thefe carry M on the 
main Part of the Colony, fupplying all the reft with 
Food, and alfifting them in any Thing as they could, 
or as they found Neceffity required. 

But the Wonder ot this Story was, how five fuch 
refra&ory ill match 'd Fellows fhould agree about 
thefe Women* and that two of them (hould not pitch 
upon the fame Woman, efpecially feeing two or three 
of them were, without Comparifon, more agreea- 
ble than the other : But they took a good Way enough 
to prevent quarreling among themfelves ; for they fet 
the five Women by themfelves in one of their Huts, 
and they went all into the other Hut, and drew Lots 
among them, who ftould ehufe firfi Hs 



C79 ] 



He that drew to chufe firft, went away by him- 
felt to the Hut where the poor naked Creatures were, 
and fetched out her he chofe } and it was worth ob- 
ferving,that he that chofe firft took her that was reck- 
on'd the homelieft, and the oldeft of the five, which 
made mirth enough among the reft ; and even the 
Spaniards laughed at it : but the Fellow confider'd 
better than any of them, that was Application and 
Bufinefs that they were to expert Aftiftance in, as 
much as any Thing elfe ; and (lie proved the beft Wife 
of all the Parcel. 

When the poor Women faw themfelves fet in a Row 
thus, and fetched out one by one, the Terrors of their 
Condition returned upon them again, and they firmly 
believ'd that they were now a going to be devoured ; 
accordingly, when the£>g///2>Sailor came in andfetchM 
out one of them ; the reft fet up a moft lamentable 
Cry, and hung about her, and took their Leave of 
her with fuch Agonies and fuch AfFeftion, as would 
have griev'd the hardeft Heart in the World ; nor 
was it poffible for the Englijhmen to fatisfy them, that 
were not to be immediately murder'd, 'till they 
fetch'd the old Man, Friday's Father, who imme- 
diately let them know that the five Men, who had 
fetch'd them out one by one, had chofen them for 
their Wives. 

When they had done, and the Fright the Women 
were in was a little over, the Men went to Work, and 
the Spaniards came and help'd them; and in a few 
Hours they had built them every one anew Hut or 
Tent (or their Lodging apart ; for thofe they had al- 
ready, were crowded with their Tools, Houflrold- 
Stutf, and Provifion. The three wicked Ones had 
pitched fartheft off, and the two honeft Ones nearer, 
but both on the North Shore of the Ifland, fo that 
they continu'd feparate as before : And thus my 
Ifland was peopled in three Places ; and as I might 
fay, three Towns were begun to be planted. 

And 



1 80 .]' 



And here 'tis very well worth obferving, That 
as it often happens in the World (what the wife Ends 
of God's Providence are in fuch a Difpofition of 
Things, I cannot fay) the two hbneft Fellows had the 
two worft Wives, and the three Reprobates, that 
was fcarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, 
and neither feem'd born to do themfelves Good, or 
any one elfe, had three clever, diligent, careful, and 
ingenious Wives ; not that the two firft were ill 
Wives, as to their Temper or Humour $ for all the 
five were moil willing, quiet, paffive, and fubjeded 
Creatures, rather like Slaves than Wives ,• but my 
Meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, 
Or induftrious, or alike cleanly and neat.' 

Another Obfervation I muft make, to the Ho- 
nour of a diligent Application on one Hand, and to 
the Difgrace of a flothful, negligent, idle Temper, 
on the others that When I came to the Place, and 
viewed the feveral Improvements, Plantings, and 
Management of the feveral little Colonies ; the tw6 
Men had fo far out-gone the three, that there was 
no Comparifon ; they had indeed both of them as 
much Ground laid out for Corn as they wanted ; 
and the Reafon was, becaufcr, according to my Rule, 
Nature dictated, that it was to no Purpofe to fow 
more Corn than they w r anted, but the Difference of 
the Cultivation, of the Planting, of the Fences, and 
indeed of every Thing elfe was eafy to be feen at 
firft View. 

The two Men had innumerable young Tree! 
planted about their Huts, that when you came to 
the Place, nothing was to be feen but a Wood, and 
tho' they had twice had their Plantation demolifh'd, 
once by their own Countrymen, and once by the 
Enemy, as fliall be fliewn in its Place ; yet they had 
reftor'd all again, and every Thing was thriving and 
flourifhing about them ; they had Grapes planted in . 
Order and manag'd like a Vineyard, tho 5 they had 
themfelves never feen any Thing of that Rind ; and 

by 



[8i ] 



by their good ordering their Vines, their Grapes 
were as good again as any of the others; They had 
alfo found themfelves out a Retreat in the thickeft 
Part of the Woods, where, though there was not a 
natural Cave, as I had found, yet they made one 
with inceflant Labour of their Hands, and where 
when the Mifchief which followed happened, they 
fecur'd their Wives and Children, fo as they could 
never be found; they having by flicking innumerable 
Stakes and Poles of the Wood, which as I faid* 
grew fo eafily, made the Grove unpaffable, except 
in fome Places, where they climb'd up to get over 
the outfide Parti and then went on by Ways of their 
own leaving. 

As to the three Reprobates, as I juftly call them* 
tho' they were mucn civilized by their new Settle- 
ment, compar'd to what they were before, and were 
not fo quarrelfom, having not the fame Opportu- 
nity ; yet one of the certain Companions of a pro^ 
fligate Mind never left them, and that was theic 
Idlenefs. It is true, they planted Corn, and made 
Fences ; but Solomon s Words were never better ve- 
rified than in them : I went by the Vineyard of the Sloth- 
ful, and it was all over-grown with thorns; for when 
the Spaniards came to view their Crop, they could 
not fee it in fome Places for Weeds ; the Hedge had 
feveral Gaps in it, where the wild Goats had got- 
ten in, and eaten up the Corn ; perhaps, here and 
there, a dead Bufh was cramm'd in, to flop them 
out for the Prefent, but it was only (hutting the Sta- 
ble-door after the Steed was ftoln* Whereas, when 
they lookM on the Colony of the other two, there 
was the very Face of Induftry and Suecefs upon all 
they did y there was not a Weed to be feen in all 
their Corn, or a Gap in any of their Hedges : And 
they on the other Hand verify y d Solomons Words in 
another Place, That the diligent Hand makes rich ; for. 
every Thing grew and thriv'd, and they had Plenty 
within and without ; they had no more tame Cattle 

F thart 



[8i] 

than the other, more Utenfils and Neceflfaries with- 
in Doors, and yet more Pleafure and Diverfion coo. 

It is true, the Wives of the three, were very han- 
dy and cleanly within Doors, and having learn'd the 
Englijh Ways of Dreffing and Cooking from one of 
the other Englifh Men, who, as I faid, was CookV 
mate on board the Ship, they drefs'd their Husbands 
Victuals very nicely and well ; whereas the other 
could not be brought to underftand it ; but then rhe 
Husband, who, as I faid, had been CookVmate, did 
it himfelf ; but as for the Husbands of three Wives, 
they loyter'd about, fetch'd Turtles Eggs, and caught 
Fifli and Birds ; in a Word any Thing but Labour, 
and they far'd accordingly. The Diligent liv'd well 
and comfortably, and the Slothful liv'd hard and 
beggarly ; and fo I believe, generally fpeaking, it is 
all over the World. 

But now I come to a Scene, different from all that 
had happened before, either to them, or to me ; and 
the Original of the Story was this : 

Early one Morning there came on Shore five or fix 
Canots of Indians, or Savages^ call them which you 
pleafe ? and there is no room to doubt that they 
came upon the old Errand of feeding upon their 
Slaves : But that Part was now fo familiar to the 
Spaniards , and to our Men too, that they did not 
concern themfelves about it, as I did ; but having 
been made fenfible by their Experience, that their 
only Bufinefs was to lie concealed, and that if they 
were not feen by any of the Savages, they would go 
off again quietly when their Bufinefs was done, ha- 
ving as yet not the leaft Notion of there being any 
Inhabitants in the Ifland ,• I fay, having been made 
fenfible of this, they had nothing to do but to give 
Notice to all the three Plantations, to keep within 
Doors, and not fliew themfelves, only placing a Scout 
in a proper Place, to give Notice when the Boats 
went to Sea again*- 

This 



ni] 



This was without doubt very right; but a Difafter 
fpoil'd all thefe Meafures, and made it known 
among the Savages, that there were Inhabitants 
there, which was in the End the Deflation of al- 
raoft the whole Colony ; after the Canoes with the 
Savages were gone ofr 3 the Spaniards peep'd abroad 
again, and fome of them had the Curiofity to go to 
the Place where they had been, to fee what they 
had been doing : Here, to their great Surprize, 
they found three Savages left behind, and lying faft 
afleep upon the Ground ; it wasfuppos'd, they had 
either been fo gorg'd with their inhuman Feaft, 
that, like Beafts, they were afleep^ and would not 
ftir when the others went, or they were wandered 
into the Woods, and did not come back in time to 
be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly furpriz'd at this Sight*' 
and perfectly at a Lofs what to do ; the Spa- 
niard Governour, as it happen 'd, was with them> 
and his Advice was ask'd, but he profefs'd he knew* 
not what to do ; as for Slaves, they had enough al- 
ready, and as, to killing them* they were none 
of them inclined to that,* the Spaniard Governouc 
told me, they could not think of (hedding innocent 
Blood, for as to them, the poor Creatures had done 
them no Wrong, invaded none of their Property, and 
they thought they had no juft Quarrel againfl them* 
to take away their Lives. 

And here I muft, in Juflice to thefe Spaniards^ 
obferve, that let the Accouncs of Spanijh Cruelty 
in Mexico and Peru, be what they will, I never met 
with feventeen Men of any Nation whatsoever, m 
any foreign Country, who were (o univerfaily Mo- 
deft, Temperate, Virtuous, fo very Good-hu- 
mour'd, and fo Courteous as thefe Spaniards ; and 
as to Cruelty they had nothing of it in their very 
Nature ; no Inhumanity, no Barbarity, no oura- 
gious Paffions, and yet all of them Men of great 
Courage and Spirit. 

F % Their 



[84] 

Their Temper and Calmnefs had appeared, in 
their bearing the unfufFerable Ufage of the three 
Engliflomen ; and their Juftice and Humanity ap- 
pear'd now in the Cafe of the Savages, as above. 
After fome Confutation, they refolv'd upon this, 
that they would lie ftill a while longer, 'till, if pof- 
fible, thefe three Men might be gone ; but then the 
Governour Spaniard recolledted, that the three Sa- 
vages had no Boar, and that if they were left to 
rove about the lfland, they would certainly difcover 
that there were Inhabitants in it, and fo they fhould 
be undone that Way. 

Upon this, they went back again, and there lay 
the Fellows faft afleep ftill, fo they refolv'd to wa- 
ken them, and take them Prifoners, and they did 
fo ; the poor Fellows were ftrangcly frighted 
when they were feiz'd upon and bound, and a- 
fraid, like the Women, that they fhould be mur- 
der'd and eaten ; for it feems thofe People think atl 
the World does as they do, eating Mens Flefh ; but 
they were fooa madeeafy as to that, and away they 
carry 'd them. 

It was very happy to them that they did not carry 
them Home to their Caftle. I mean to my Palace un- 
der the Hill ; but they carry 'd them firft to the 
Bower, where was the chief of their Country- work, 
fuch as the keeping the Goats, the planting the Corn, 
&c. and afterwards, they carried them to the Habi- 
tation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they werefet to work, tho'it was not much 
they had for them to do ; and whether it was by 
Negligence in guarding them, or that they thought 
the Fellows could not meftd themfelves, I know not, 
but one of rhem run away, and taking into the 
Woods, they could never hear of him more. 

They had good Reafon to believe he got Home 
again foon after, in fome other Boats or Canoes 
6i Savages, who came on Shore three or four 
♦Weeks afterwards, and who, carry ing on their Re- 
vels 



[ 85 ] 

vels as ufual, went off again in two Days time : 
This Thought terrify 'd them exceedingly ,• for they 
concluded, and that not without good Caufe indeecl, 
that is if this Fellow came fafe Home among his 
Comrades, he would certainly give them an Account 
that there were People in the Ifland, as alfo how 
few and weak they were ; for this Savage, as I ob- 
ferv'd before, had never been told, and it was very 
happy he had not, how many they were, or where 
they liv'd; nor had he evet feen or heard the 
Fire of any of their Guns, much lefs had they 
ftiewn him any of their other retiYd Places fuch as the 
Cave in the Valley, or the new Retreat which the 
two Englifkmen had made, and the like. 

The firft Teftimony they had that this Fellow 
had given Intelligence of them, was, that about 
two Months after this, fix Canoes of Savages, with 
about feven, or eight, or ten Men in a Canoe, 
came rowing along the North-Side of the Ifland, 
where they never ufe* to come before, and landed 
about an Hour after Sun-rife, at a convenient Place 
about a Mile from the Habitation of the two Eng- 
liftmen, where this efcap'd Man had been kept: 
As the Spaniard Governour faid, had they been 
all there, the Damage would not have been fo 
much, for not a Man of them would have efcaped; 
but the Cafe differd now very much, for two Men 
to fifty was too much odds : The two Men had 
the Happinefs to difcover them about a League 
off, fo that it was above an Hour before they 
landed, and as they landed a Mile from their 
Huts, it was fome time before they could come 
at them: Now having great Reafon to believe 
that they were betray 'd, the firft Thing they did, 
was to bind the two Slaves which were left^ and 
Caufe two of the three Men, who they brought 
with the Women, who it feems prov'd very faitlv* 
ful to them, to lead them with their two Wives, 
F 3 and 



[85] 



and what ever they could carry away with them, ta 
their retir'd Place in the Woods, which I have fpo- 
ken of above, and there to bind the two Fellows 
Hand and Foot 'till they heard farther. 

In the next Place, feeing the Savages were all come 
pn Shore, and that they bent their Courfe dire&ly 
that Way, they open'd the Fences where their Milch- 
Goats were kept, and drove them all out, leaving 
their Goats to ftraggle into the Wood, whither they 
pleas M, that the Savages might think they were all 
bred wild; but the Rogue who came with them 
was too cunning for that, and gave them an Account 
of it all; for they went diretfiy to the Place. 

When the two poor frighted Men had fecur'd their 
Wives and Goods, they fent the other Slave they had 
of the three, who came with the Women, and who 
was at their Place by Accident, away to the Spani- 
ards, with all Speed, to give them the Alarm, and 
defire fpeedy Help ; and in thjj mean Time they took 
their Arms, and what Ammunition they had, and re- 
treated towards the Place in the Wood, where their 
Wives were fent, yeepingat a Diftance, yet fo that 
they might fee if po!T;ble, which way the Savages 
took. 

They had not gone far, but that, from a rifing 
Ground, they could fee the little Army of their Ene- 
mies come on dire<5t!y to their Habitation, and in a 
Moment more, could fee all their Huts and Houfhold- 
Stuff flaming up together, to their great Grief and 
Mortification $ for they had a very great Lofs, to 
them irretrievable, at leaft for fome Time. They 
kept their Station for a while, 'till they found the 
Savages, like wild Beafts, fpread themfelves all over 
tie Place,, rumaging every Way, and every Place 
they could think of, in fearch for Prey, and in par- 
ticular for the People, of whom it now plainly ap- 
peared they had Intelligence* 

The 



[8<S] 



The two Englijhmen feeing this, thinking them- 
felves not fecure where they flood, becaufe as it 
was likely fome of the wild People might come that 
Way, fo they might come too many together,, thought 
it proper to make another Retreat about half a 
Mile farther, believing, as it afterwards happened, 
that the farther they flroll'd, the fewer would be 
together. 

The next Halt was at the Entrance into a very 
thick grown Part of the Woods, and where an old 
Trunk of a Tree flood, which was hollow and vaflly 
large ; and in this Tree they both took their Hand- 
ing, refolving to fee there what might offer. 

I hey had not flood there long, but two of the 
Savages appear'd running dire&ly that Way, as if 
they had already had Notice where they flood, and 
were coming up to attack them ; and a little Way 
farther, they fpy'd three more coming after them, 
and five more beyond them, all coming the fame 
Way ; bcfides which, they faw feven or eight 
more at a Diftance, running another Way ; for in a 
Word, they ran every Way like Sportfmen beating 
for their Game. 

The poor Men were now in great Perplexity, whe- 
ther they fhould Hand and keep their Poflure, or fly: 
But after a very fhort Debate with themfelves, they 
confider'd, that if the Savages rang'd the Country 
thus before Help came, they might perhaps find out 
their Retreat in the Woods, and then all would be 
loft I fo they refolv'd to fland them there ; and if 
they were too many to deal with, then they would 
get up to the Top of the Tree, from whence they 
doubted not to defend themfelves, Fire excepted, as 
long as their Ammunition lafled, though all the Sa- 
vages that were landed, which was near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having refolv'd upon this, they next confider'd* 

whether they fhould fire at the firft two, or wait 

for the three, and fo take the middle Party, by 

F 4 which 



[88] 

which the two and the five that follow'd would be 
feparated ,* at length they refolv'd to let the two 
firft pafs by, unlefs they fhould (by them in the 
Tree, and come to attack them. The two firft Sa- 
vages alfo confirm'd them in this Regulation, by 
turning a little from them towards another Part of 
the Wood ; but the three, and the five after them, 
came forwards direftly to the Tree, as if they had 
known the Englijhmen were there. 

Seeing them come fo ftrait towards them, they re^ 
folv'd to take them in a Line, as they came ; and as 
they refolv'd to fire but one at a Time, perhaps the 
firft Shot might hit them all three ; to which pur- 
pofe, the Man who was to fire, put three or four 
Bullets into his Piece, and having a fair Loop-hole, 
as it were, from a broken Hole in the Tree, he took 
a fure Aim, without being feen, waiting till they 
were within about thirty Yards of the Tree, fo that 
he could not mifs. 

While they were thus waiting, and the Savages 
came on, they plainly faw, that one of the three 
was the Run-away Savage that had efcap'd from 
them, and they both knew him diftin&ly, and re*- 
folv'd, that if poffible, he fhould not efcape, tho' 
they fhould both fire ; fo the other flood ready with 
his Piece, that if he did not drop at the firft Shot, 
he fhould be fure to have a fecond. 

But the firft was too good a Markfman to mifs his 
Aim 5 for as the Savages kept near one another, a 
little behind in a Line ; in a Word, he fir'd, and hie 
two of them dire&ly : The foremoft was kiliM 
outright, being fhot in the Head : The fecond, which 
was the run-away Indian, was fhot through the Bo- 
dy, and fell, but was not quite dead : And the 
third had a little Scratch in the Shoulder, perhaps by 
the fame Ball that went through the Body of the 
fecond, and being dreadfully frighted, though not 
much hurt, fat down upon the Ground, skreaming 
and yelling in a hideous manner. 

Th? 



[89 ] 



The five that were behind,more frighted with the 
Noife than fenfible of the Danger, flood ftill at firft,- 
for the Woods made the Sound a thoufand Times 
bigger than it really was ; the Echo's rattling from 
one Side to another, and the Fowls rifing from all 
Parts, skreaming and making, every Sort, a feve- 
ralKind of Noife, according to their Kind, juft as 
it was when I fir'd the firft Gun that perhaps was e- 
ver (hot off in that Place fince it was an Ifland. 

However, all being filent again, and they not 
knowing what the Matter was, came on uncon- 
cern'd, 'till they came to the Place where their Com- 
panions lay in a Condition miferable enough : And 
here the poor ignorant Creatures, not fenfible that 
they were within Reach of the fame Mifchief, flood 
all of a Huddle over the wounded Man, talking, 
and, as may be fuppos'd, enquiring of him, how he 
came to be hurt ; and who, 'tis very rational to be- 
lieve, told them, that a Flafh of Fire firft, and imme- 
diately after that, Thunder from their Gods, had kil- 
led thofe two, and wounded him : This 1 (ay, is ra- 
tional ; for nothing is more certain than that, as they 
fawno Man near them, fo they had never heard a 
Gun in all their Lives, or fo much as heard of a Gun ; 
neither knew they any Thing of killing or wounding, 
at a Diftance, with Fire and Bullets ; if they had, 
one might reafonably believe, they would not have 
flood fo unconcern 'd, in viewing the Fate of the.r 
Fellows, without fome Apprehenfion of their own. 

Our two Men, tho* as they confefs'd to me, it 
grieved them to be obliged to kill fo many poor Crea- 
tures, who, at the fame Time, had no Notion of 
their Danger ; yet having them all thus in the Power, 
and the firft having loaded his Piece again •, refolv'd 
to let fly both together among them; and fingling 
out, by Agreement, which to aim at, they (hot toge- 
ther, and kill'd or very much wounded four ofthem ; 
;he fifth, frighted even to Death, tho* not hurt, fell 

/ wlch 



[89] 

with the reft ; fo that our Men feeing them all fall to- 
gether, thought they had kilTd themall. 

The Belief that the Savages were all kilJ'd, made 
our two Men come boldly out from the Tree before 
they had charg'd their Guns again, which was a 
wrong Step ; and they were under fome Surprize 
when they came to the Place, and found no lefs than 
{our of the Men alive, and of them two very little 
hurt, and one not at all : This oblig'd them to fall 
upon them with the ^tocks of their Muskets ,* and 
iirft they made fure ot the run away Savage, that 
had been the Caufe of all the Mifchie^ and of ano? 
ther that was hurt in his Knee, and put them out of 
their Pain ,• then the Man that was not hurt at all, 
came and kneel'd down to them, with his two Hands 
held up, and made piteous Moans to them by Ges- 
tures and Signs, for his Life ; but could not fay one 
Word to them that they could underftand. 

However, they fign 'd to him to fit down at the 
Foot of a Tree thereby,- and one of the Englijlrnen, 
with a Piece of Rope Twine which he had, by 
great Chance, in his Pocket, ty\l his two Feet faft 
together, and his two Hands behind him, and there 
they left him ; and, with what Speed they 
could, made after the other two, which were gone 
before ; fearing they, or any more of them, fhould 
iind the Way to their cover'd Place in the Woods, 
where their Wives, and the few Goods they had left 
lay. They came once in Sight of the two Men, but 
it was at a great Diftance ; however, they had the 
Satisfaftion to fee them crofs over a Valley towards 
the Sea, the quite contrary Way from that which 
led to their Retreat, which they were'afraid of; and 
being fatisfy'd with that, they went back to the Tree, 
where they left their Prifoner, who, as they fuppos'd, 
was delivered by his Comrades ; for he was gone, 
and the two Pieces of Rope Yarne, with which they 
had bound him, lay juft at the Foot of the Tree. 

They 



[90] 

They were now in as great a Concern as before, 
not knowing what Courfe to take, or how near the 
Enemy might be, or in what Numbers ,* fo they 
refolv'd to go away to the Place where their Wives 
were, to fee if all was well there, and to m:' ? 
them eafy, who were in Fright enough to be fure ; 
for tho' the Savages were their own Country Folk, 
ypt they were mod terribly afraid of them, and per- 
haps the more, for the Knowledge they had of 
them. 

When they come there, they found the Savages 
had been in the Wood, and very near that Place, 
but had not found it ; for it was indeed inacceffible, 
by the Trees (landing fo thick, as before, unlefs the 
Perfons feeking it had been dire&ed by thofe that 
knew it 5 which thefe did not; they found there- 
fpie every Thing very fafe, only the Women in a ter- 
rible fright : VVhile they were here, they had the 
Comfort of feven of the Spaniards come to their Affi- 
ftance ; the other ten, with their Servants, and old 
Friday, I meaaJ^/^> ? s Father were gone in a Body 
to defend their Bower, and the Com, and Cattle 
that was kept there, in Cafe the Savages (hould have 
rov'd over to that Side of the Country ; but they did 
not fpread fo far. With the feven Spaniards came 
one of the three Savages, who, as I faid, were their 
Prifoners formerly J and with them alfo came the Sa- 
vage, who the Englishmen had left bound Hand and 
Foot at the Tree ; for it feems they came that Way, 
faw the Slaughter of the feven Men, and unbound 
the eighth, and brought him along with them ; where 
however, they were obliged to bind him again, 
as they had the two others, who were left when the 
third run away, 

The Prifoners began now to be a Burden to them ; 
and they were fo afraid of their efcaping* that they 
were under an abfolute Neceflity to do fo, for their 
own Prefervation : However, the Spaniard Gover- 
npur would not confeut to it, but ordef 'd for the 

Pre- 



[9*1 

prefent, that they fhouldbefent out of the Way, to my 
old Cave in the Valley, and be kept there with two 
Spaniards to guard them, and give them Food for 
their Subfiftence, which was done; and they were 
bound there Hand and Foot for that Night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englijh Men 
were fo encourag'd, that they could not fatisfy them- 
felves to flay any longer there ; but taking five of the 
Spaniards, and themfelves, with four Muskets and a 
Piftol among them, and two flout Qnarter-Staves, 
away they went in Queft of the Savages. Andhrft 
they came to the Tree where the Men lay that had 
been kill'd ; but it was eafy to fee, that fome more 
of the Savages had been there; for they had attempt- 
ed to carry their dead Men away, and had dragg'd 
two of them a good Way, but had given it over* 
From thence they advanced to the firft riling Ground, 
where they had flood, and feen their Camp deftroy- 
ed, and where they had the Mortification flill to 
fee fome of the Smoak ; but neither could here fee 
any ofthe Savages : They then refolv'd, tho* with all 
poffible Caution, to go forward towards their ruin'd 
Plantation : But a little before they came thither, 
coming in Sight of the Sea Shore, they faw plainly 
the Savages all embarking again in their Canoes, in 
order to be gone, 

They feem'd forry at firft that there was no Way 
to come at them, to give them a parting Blow : But 
upon the whole, were very well fatisfy 'd to be rid 
of them. 

The poor Englijh Men being now twice ruin'd, 
and all their Improvements deftroy'd, the reft all a- 
greed to come and help them rebuild, and to aflift 
them with needful Supplies. Their three Country- 
men, who were not yet noted for having the leaft In- 
clination to do any Good, yet as foon as they heard 
of it (for they living remote Eaflward, knew nothing 
of the Matter 'till all was over) came and offer'd 
their Help and Afl&ftance, and did very friendly 

work 



[93 3 



work for feveral Days, to reftore their Habitation, 
and make Neceflaries for them: and thus, in a little 
Time, they were fetupon their Legs again* 

About two Days afrter this, they had the farther 
Satisfa&ion of feeing three of the Savages Canoes 
come driving on Shore, and at fome Diftance from 
them, two drown'd Men ; by which they had Rea- 
fon to believe, that they had met with a Storm at 
Sea, and had overfet fome ok them ; for it had blown 
very hard the very Night after they went off. 

However* as fome might mifcarry, fo on the 
other Hand enough of them efcap'd to inform the 
reft, as well of what they had done, as of what had 
happen'd to them ; and to whet them on to another 
Enterprise of the fame Nature^ which they, it feems, 
refolv'd to attempt, with fufficient Force to carry all 
before them, for except what thefirftMan had told 
them of Inhabitants, they' could fay .little to it of 
their own Knowledge; for they never fawone Man, 
and the Fellow being killed that had affirmed it, 
they had no other Witnefs to confirm it to them. 

It was five or fix Months after this, before they 
heard any more of the Savages; in which Time 
our Men were in Hopes they had either forgot their 
former bad Luck, or given over the Hopes of better ; 
when on a fudden they were invaded with a moft 
formidable Fleet, of no lefs than eight and twenty 
Canoes full of Savages, arm'd with Bows and Ar- 
rows, great Clubs, wooden Swords, and fuch like 
Engines of War ; and they brought fuch Numbers; 
with them, that, in fhort, it put all our People into 
the utmoft Confternation. 

As they came on Shore in the Evening, and at 
the Eafter-moft Side of thelfland, our Men had that 
Night to confult and confider what to do ,• and, in 
the firft Place, knowing that their being entirely con- 
cealed, was their only Safety before and would much 
more be fo now, while the Number of their Enemies 
was fo great, they therefore refolv'd firft pf all to take 

down 



[93] 



the Huts which were built for the two Englijh Men* 
and drive away their Goats to the old Cave ; becaufe 
they fuppofed the Savages would go direftly thither, 
as foon as it was Day, to play the old Game over a- 
gain, tho' they did not nowland within two Leagues 
of it. 

In the next Place, they drove away all the Flock of 
Goats they had at the old Bower, as I calfd it,which 
belong'd to the Spaniards ; and, in fhort, left as little 
Appearance of Inhabitants any where as was poffible ; 
and the nextMorning early they pofted themfd ves with 
all their Force at the Plantation of the two Men, wait- 
ing for their Coming : As they guefs'd, fo it happened ; 
thefe new Invaders leaving their Canoes at the Eaft 
End of thelfland, came ranging along the Shore direft- 
ly towards the Place, to the Number of two hundred 
and fifty, as near as our Men could judge- Our Army 
was but fmall indeed; but that which was worfe, they 
had not Arms for all their Number neither : The 
■ whole Account, it feems, flood thus : Firft,as to Men; 
17 Spaniards. 
5 Engliflo Men. 

1 old Friday, or Fridays Father. 
3 the three Slaves taken with the Women, who 

prov T d very faithful. 
3 other Slaves who liv'd with the Spaniards* 
To Arm, thefe they had, 
11 Muskets. 
5 Piftols. 

3 Fowling- Pieces. 

5 Muskets or Fowling- Pieces, which were ta- 
ken by me from the mutinous Seamen, who 
I reduc'd. 
2 Swords, 3 old Halberds. 
To their Slaves they did not give either Musket 
or Fuzee, but they had every one a Halberd, or a 
long Staff, like a Quarter-Staff, with a great Spike of 
Iron fattened into each End of it, and by his Side a 
Hatchet; alfo every one of our Men had Hatchets: 

Two 



[ 94 ] 

Two of the Women could not be prevail^ upon but 
they would come into the Fight, and they had Bows 
and Arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the 
Savages, when the firft A&ion happened, which I have 
fp<?ken of, where the Indians fought with one another, 
and the Women Hatchets too. 

'Ihz^Spamard Governour, who I have defcrib'd fo 
often, commanded the whole ; and William Atkins^ 
who, tho' a dreadful Fellow for Wickednefs, was a 
moft daring bold Fellow* commanded under him. The 
Savages came forward like Lyons, and our Men, 
which was the worft of their Fate, had no Advan- 
tage in their Situation; only that Will. Atkins^ who 
now prov'd amofiufeful Fellow, with fix Men, was 
planted juft behind a fmail Thicket of Bufhes, as an 
advanced Guard, with Orders to let the firft of them 
pafs by, and then fire into the Middle of them; and, 
as foon as he had fir'd, to make his Retreat as nim- 
ble as he could round a Part of the Wood, and fo 
come in behind the Spaniards where they ftood, hav- 
ing a Thicket of Trees all before them. 

When the Savages came on, they run ftragling a- 
bout every way in Heaps, out of all manner of Or- 
* der, and W Atkins let about fifty of them pafs by 
him, then feeing the reft come in a very thick Throng, 
he orders three of his Men to fire, having loaded their 
Mufquets with fix or feven Bullets apiece, about as 
big as large Piftol Bullets. How many they kill'd or 
wounded, they knew not, but the Confternation and 
Surprize was inexpreffible among the Savages ; they 
were frighted to the laft Degree, to hear fuch a dread- 
ful Noife, and fee their Men kill'd, and others hurt, 
but fee no Body that did it; when in the Middle of 
their Fright, W Atkins, and his other three, let fly 
again among the thickeft of them ; and in lefs than a 
Minute the firft three, being loaded again, gave them 
a third Volley. 

Had W>. Atkins and his Men retiYd immediately, as 
foon as they had fir'd, as they were Qsctac'd to do ; or 

had 



had the reft of the Body been at Hand to have pour'd 
in their Shot continually, the Savages had been effec- 
tually routed ,• for the Terror that was among them, 
came principally from this, (viz,*) That they were 
killed by the Gods with Thunder and Lightning, and 
could fee no Body that hurt them ; but W. Atkins 
flaying to load again, difcover'd the Cheat. Some of 
the Savages who were at a Diftance, fpying them, 
came upon them behind, and tho' Atkins and his Men 
fir'd at them alfo> two or three Times, and kill'd a- 
bove twenty, retiring as faft as they could, yet they 
wounded Atkins himfelf, and kill'd one of his Fellow 
Englijhmen with their Arrows, as they did afterwards 
one Spaniard, and one of the Indian Slaves who came 
with the Women; this Slave was a raoft gallant Fel- 
low, and fought moft defperately, killing five of them 
with his own Hand, having no Weapon, but one of 
the arm'd Staves and a Hatchet* 

Our Men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded* 
and two other Men killed, retreated to a rifing Ground 
in the Wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing three 
Vollies upon them retreated alfo ; for their Number 
was fo great, and they were fo defperate, that tho* 
above fifty of them were killed, and more than fo 
many wounded, yet they came on in the Teeth of 
our Men, fear Ids of Danger, and (hot their Arrows 
like a Cloudy and it was obferv'd, that their wounded 
Men, who were not quite difabled, were made out- 
rageous by their Wounds, and fought like Mad-men- 

When our Men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englijhmen that was kill'd behind them ; and 
the Savages, when they came up to them, kill'd them 
over again in a wretched Manner, breaking the Arms* 
Legs, and Heads, with their Clubs and wooden 
Swords, like true Savages : But finding our Men were 
gone, they did not feem to perfue them, but drevtf 
themfelves up in a kind of a Ring, which is, it feems, 
their Cuftom, and fhouted twice in Token of their 
Yi&ory t After which, they had the Mortification to 



[97] 



fee feveral of their wounded Men fall, dying with the 
rneer Lofs of Blood. 

The Spaniard Governor having drawn his little 
Body up together upon a rifing Ground, Atkins, tho* 
he was wounded, would ha' had him march'd and 
charg'd them again altogether at once: But the Spa- 
niards reply VI, Seignior Atkins > you fee how their 
wounded Men fighr, let them alone till Morning; all 
thefc wounded Men will be ftiff and fore with theic 
Wounds, and faint with the Lofs of Blood ; and fo we. 
(hall have the fewer to engage. 

The Advice was good: £ u t Will. Atkins reply 3 d 
merrily, That's true, Seignior, and fo fhalll toojand 
that's the Reafon I would go on while I am warm* 
Well, Seignior Atkins y fays the Spaniards, you hava 
behav'd gallantly, and done your Part ; we will fight 
for you, if you cannot come on, but I think it beft to 
flay 'till Morning ; fo they waited. 

But as it was a clear Moon-light Night, and they 
found the Savages in great Diforder about their dead 
and wounded Men, and a great Hurry and Noife a- 
mong them where they lay, they afterwards refolv'd 
to fall upon them in the Night, efpecially if they could 
come to give them but one Volley before they were 
difcover'd, which they had a fair Opportunity to do; 
for one of the two Enghjhmen, in whofe Quarter it was: 
where the Fight began, led them round between the 
Woods, and Sea-iide Weft ward, and then turning (horc 
South> they came fo near where the thickeft of them 
lay, thai before they were feen or heard, eight of them 
fir'd in among them, and did dreadful Execution up-; 
on them, in half a Minute more, eight others fir'd af- 
ter them, pouring in their fmall Shot in fuch a Quan-' 
tity, that abundance were kilfd and wounded i and 
all this while they were not able to fee who hurt 
them, or which Way to fly. 

The Spaniards charg'd again with the utmoft Expe J 
dition,and then divided themfelvesinto three Bodies, 
and refolv'd to fall in among them altogether : They 

G had 



[98] 



had in each Body eight Perfons, that is to fay, 24, 
whereof were 22 Men, and the 2 Women, who by 
the Way fought defperately. 

They divided the Fire-Arms equally in each Party, 
and fo of the Halberds and Staves : They would have 
had the Women keep back, but they faid they were 
refolv'd to die with their Husbands. Having thus 
form'd their little Army, they march'd out from a- 
mong the Trees, and they came up to the Teeth of 
the Enemy, fhouting and hollowing as loud as they 
could,' the Savages flood all together, but were in the 
utmoft Confufion, hearing the Noife of our Men 
fliouting from three Quarters together ; they would 
have fought if they had ieen us : And as foon as we 
came near enough to be feen, fome Arrows were 
fhot, and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not 
dangeroufly : But our Men gave them no Time ; but 
running up to them, fir'd among them three Ways, and 
then fell in with the But-ends of their Muskets, their 
Swords, arm'd Staves, and Hatchets, and laid about 
them fo well, that, in a Word, they fet up a difmai 
Skreaming and Howling, flying to fave their Lives 
which way foever they could. 

Our Men were tir a with the Execution ;and kilTd 
or mortally wounded, in the two Fights, about 180 
of them 1 the reft, being frighted out of their Wits, 
fcour'd through the Woods, and over the Hills, with 
all the Speed and Fear that nimble Feet could help 
them to do; and as we did not trouble ourfelves 
much to purfue them, they got altogether to the Sea- 
fide, where they landed, and where their Canoes lay. 
But their Difafter was not at an End yet ; for it blew 
a terrible Storm of Wind that Evening from the Sea- 
ward, fo that it was impoflible for them to go off; 
nay, the Storm continuing all Night, when the Tide 
came up, their Canoes were moft of them driven by 
the Surge of the Sea fo high upon the Shore, that it 
required infinite Toil to get theru off; and fome of 

them 



[ 99 ] 

thetn were even dafh'd to Pieces againft the Beach^ 
or againfl one another. 

Our Men, tho' glad of their Vi&ory, yet got lit- 
tle Reft that Night ; but having refreft'd themfelves 
as well as they could, they refolv'd to march to that 
Part of the Ifland where the Savages were fled, and 
fee what Poflurc they were in. This neceffarily led 
them over the Place where the Fight had been, and 
where they round fevera! of the poor Creatures not 
quite dead, and yet paft recovering Life; a Sight dif- 
frgreeable enough to generous Minds; for a truly 
great Man, tho* obliged by the Law of Battle to dc- 
itroy his Enemy, takes no Delight in his Mifery. 

However, there v/as no Need to give any Orders 
in this Cafe ; for their own Savages, who were their 
Servants* difpatch'd thofe poor Creatures with their 
Hatchets. 

At length they came in View of the Place where 
the more miferable Remains of the Savages Army 
lay, where there appeared about an hundred ftiUj 
their Pofture was generally fitting upon the Ground, 
with their Knees up towards their Mouth, and the 
Head put between the two Hands, leaning down up- 
on the Knees. 

When our Men came within two Musket Shot o£ 
them, the Spaniard Governor ordered two Muskets to 
be fir'd without Ball, to alarm them ; this he did, that 
by their Countenance he might know what to expeft, 
*/&. Whether they were dill in Heart to fight, or were 
fo heartily beaten, as to be defpirited and difcourag'd* 
and fo he might manage accordingly. 

This Stratagem took ,• for, as foon as the Savages 
heard the firfl: Gun, and faw the Flafh of the Second, 
they flarted up upon their Feet in the greateft Con- 
fternation imaginable ; and as our Men advane'd 
fwittly towards them, they all ran skreaming and 
yawlingaway, wicha Kind of a howling Noife, which 
our Men did not underftand, and had never heard be- 
fore; and thus they ran up the Hills into the Country.' 

G 2 At 



[ 100 ] 

Atfirft, our Men had much rather the Weather 
had been calm, and they had all gone away to Sea r 
But they did not then eonfider that this might pro- 
bably have been the Occafion of their coming again 
in iuch Multitudes, as not. to be refitted, or, at leaft, 
to come fo many, and fo often, as would quite defo- 
late the Ifland, and ftarve them: Will. Atkins there- 
fore, who, notwithftanding his Wound, kept always 
with them, prov'd the beft Counfellor in this Cafe : 
His Advice was, to take the Advantage that oifer'd, 
and clap in between them and thvir Boats, and fo de- 
prive them of the Capacity of ever returning any more 
to plague the Illand. 

They confulted long about this, and fome were a- 
gainftit, for fear of making the Wretches fly to the 
Woods, and live there defperate; and fo ti;ey fhould 
have them to hunt like wild Beafts, be afraid to ftir 
out about their Bufinefs, and have their Plantations 
continually rifled, all their tame Goats deftroy \i, and, 
in fhort, be reduced to a Life of continual Diftrcfs. 

Will. Atkins told them, they hau be- rer have to do 
with a hundred Men, than with a hundred Nations : 
That as they muft deftroy their Boais, !o they muft 
deftroy the Men 5 or be al r of them deftroy'd themr 
felves. In a Word, he (hewM them the Necefliiy of 
it fo plainly, that they ail came into it ; fo they went 
to work immediately with the Boats, and getting 
fome dry Wood together from a dead Tree, they 
try'd to fet fome of them on Fire, but they were fo 
wet, that they would not burn ; however, the Fire 
foburn'dthe upper Part, that it foon made them 
unfit for fwimming in the §ea as Boats. When the 
Indians faw what they were about, fome of them 
caTme running out of the Wood^, and coming as 
near as they could to our Men, kneefd down and 
cry'd, Oa y Oa^ Waramokca* and fome other 
Words o; their Language, which none of the others 
underilood any thing of; but as they made pitiful 
k Geflures, anditrange Noifes, is was eafy to under- 

ftand 



[ ioi ] 

ftand, they begg'd to have their Boats fpar'd, and 
that they world be gone, and never come there again. 

Bat ovir Men were now fatisfied, that they had no 
Way to preferve themfelves, or to fave their Colony, 
but Effectually to prevent niy of thefe People from 
ever going Home again ; depended upon this, that 
if ever (o much as one of them got back into their 
Country to tell the Story, the Colony was undone ; 
fothat lett'ng them know that theyfliould not have 
any Mercy, they fell to work with their Canoes, 
and deftroyed them every one, that the Storm had 
not deftoyed before ; at the Sight of which, the Sa- 
vages rais'd a hideous Cry in the Woods, which out 
People heard plain enough ; after which they ran a- 
bout the Ifland like diftra&ed Men > (o that, in a 
Word, our Men did not really know at firft what to 
do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, 
confider, that while they made thofe People thus de- 
fperate, they ought to have kept good Guard at the 
fame Time upon their Plantations ; for tho' it is 
true, they had driven away their Cattle, and the 
Indians did not find out their main Retreat, I mean 
my old Caftle at the Hill, nor the Cave in the Val- 
ley, yet they found out my Plantation at the Bower, 
and pulled it all to Pieces, and all the Fences and 
Planting about it; trode all the Corn under Foot; 
tore up the Vines and Grapes, being juft then al- 
moft ripe, and did to our Men in eftimable Damage, 
though to thetnfelves not one Farthingworth of Ser- 
vice. 

Tho' our Men were able to fight them upon all 
Occafions, yet they were in no Condition to purfue 
them, or hurt them up and down ; for as they were 
too nimble of Foot for our Men, when they found 
them fingle, fo our Men durft not go about fingle, for 
fear of being furrounded with theirNumbers. The beft 
was, they had no Weapons, for tho ' they had Bows 
they had no Arrows left, nor any Materials to make 

G i any, 



C ici ] 



any, nor had they any edg'd Tool or Weapon a- 
mong them- 

The Extremity and Diftrefs they were reduced to 
was great, and indeed deplorable ; but at the fame 
tTime, our Men were alfo brought to very bad Cir- 
cumftances by them •> for tho' their Retreats were 
preferved, yet their Provifion was deftroyed, and 
their Harveft fpoiled, and what to do, or which 
Way to turn themfeives, they knew not : The only 
Refage they had now, was the Stock of Cattle they 
had in the Valley by the Cave, and fome little Corn 
which grew there ; and the three En^iifomen^ William 
Atkins arid his Comrades, who were now reduced to 
two, one of them being kilTd by an Arrow which 
flruck him on the Side of his Head, juft under the 
Temple, fo that he never fpoke more ; and it was 
very remarkable, that this was the fame barbarous 
Fellow who cut the poor Savage Slave with his 
Hatchet, and who afterwards intended to havemur- 
der'd the Spaniards. 

I look'd upon their Cafe to have been Worfe at 
this Time, than mine was at any Time, after I fii ft 
difcover'd the Grains of Barley and Rice, and got into 
the Method of planting and railing my Corn, and 
my tame Cattle ; for now they had, as I may fay, a 
hundred Wolves upon the Ifland, which would de- 
vour every Thing they could come at, yet could 
very hardly be come at themfeives. 

The firft Thing they concluded, when they faw 
what their Circumftances were, was,that they would, 
if poffible, drive them up to the farther Part of the 
Ifland, South-weft, that if any more Savages came on 
Shore, they might not find one another. Then, that 
they would daily hunt and harafs them, and kill as 
many of them as they could come at, till they had 
reduced their Number ; and if they could at laft 
tame them and bring them to any Thing, they would 
give them Corn, and teach them how to plant and 
live upon their daily Labour. 

In 



C ioj. ] 

In order to this, they fo follow'd them, aud fo terri- 
fy 'd them with their Guns, that in a few Days, if 
any of them fired a Gun at an Indian, if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for Fear ; and lb 
dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out 
of Sight farther and farther, till at laft our Men fol- 
lowing them, and every Day almoft killing and woun- 
ding fome of them, they kept up in the Woods and 
hollow Places fo much, that it reduced them to the 
utmoft Mifery for want of Food ^ and many were 
afterwards found dead in the Woods, without any 
Hurt, but meerly ftarved to Death, 

When our Men found this, it made their Hearts 
relent, and Pity mov'd them ; efpecially the Spaniard 
Governour, who was the moft gentlemanly generous- 
minded Man that ever I met with in my Life , and 
he proposed, if poffible, to take one of them alive, and 
bring him to underftand what they meant, fofaras 
to be able to ad as Interpreter, and to go among 
them, and fee if they might be brought to fome Con- 
ditions, that might be depended upon, to fave their 
Lives, and to do us no Spoil. 

It was fome while before any of them could be 
taken ; but being weak and half ftarv'd, one of them 
was at laft furpriz'd and made a Prifoner h he was 
fullen at firft, and would neither eat or drink, but 
finding himfelf kindly ufed, and Vi&uals given him, 
and no Violence offered him, he at laft grew tracta- 
ble, and came to himfelf. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often 
with him, and told him how kind the other would 
be to them all , that they would not only fave their 
Lives, but would give them a Part of the Ifland to 
live in, provided they would give Satisfa&ion that 
they would keep in their own Bounds, and not come 
beyond it, to injure or prejudice others, and that 
they fhould have Corn given them, to plant and 
make it grow for their Bread, and fome Bread given 
them for their prefent Subfiftence j and old Friday bad 

G 4 the 



[ 104 ] 



the Fellpw go and talk with the reft of his Countrymen' 
and fee what they faid to it, afluring them, that if they 
did not agree immediately,they fhould be all deftroy'd. 

The poor Wretches, throughly humbled, and re- 
duced in Number to about thirty feven, clos'd with 
the Propofal at the firft Offer, and begg'd to have 
fome Food given them ; upon which, twelve Spa* 
wards, and two Englishmen well armed, and three 
Indian Slaves, and old Friday, marched to the Place 
where they were ; three Indian Slaves carried them a 
large Quantity of Bread ; and fome Rice boiled up 
to Cakes, and dry'd in the Sun, and three live Goats ; 
and they were ordered to go to the Side of a Hill, 
where they fat down, eat the Provisions, very thank? 
fully, and were the moft faithful Fellows to their 
.Words that could be thought of; for except when 
they came to beg Viftuals and Directions, they ne- 
ver came out of their Bounds; and there they livtd 
when I came to the lfland, and I went to fee them. 

They had taught them both to plant Corn, make 
Bread, breed tame Coats, and milk them; they wanted 
nothing but Wives, and they foon would have been 
a Nation. They were confined to a Neck of Land, 
furrounded with high Rocks behind them, and lying 
plain towards the Sea before them, on theSouth-Eaft 
Corner of the Xlland : They had Land enough, and it 
was very good and fruitful ; they had a Piece of Land 
about a Mile and half broad, three or four Mile in 
Length. 

Our Men taught them to make wooden Spades, 
fuch as I made tor my felf, and gave them among 
them twelve Hatchets and three or four Knives ; 
and there they liv'd the moft fubje&ed innocent 
Creatures,* that ever were heard of. 

After this, the Colony enjoyed a perfeft Tranqui- 
lity with Refpe£t to the Savages, till I came to re- 
vifit them, which was above two Years : Not, but 
that now and then r fome Canoes of Savages came 
on Shore for their triumphal unnatural Feafls, but 
' - ■" r' .-. • • - as 



[ i05 ] 

as they were of feveral Nations, and perhaps had 
never heard of thofe that came before, or the Rea- 
fon of it, they did not make any Search or Enquiry 
after their Countrymen ; and if they had, it would 
have been very hard to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full Account of all 
that happened to them, to my Return, at leaft that 
was worth Notice. The Indians or Savages were 
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
went among them, but forbid, on Pain of Death, 
any one of the Indians coming to them, becaufe they 
would not have their Settlement betray'd again. 

One Thing was very remarkable, viz,, that they 
taught the Savages to make Wicker-work, or Baskets ; 
but they foon out did their Matters ; for they made 
abundance of iroft ingenious Things in Wicker- 
work i particularly, all Sorts of Baskets ; Sieves, 
Bird-Cages, Cup- boards, &c. as alfo Chairs to fit 
on, Stools^ Beds, Couches, and abundance of other 
Things, being very ingenious at fuch Work, when 
they were once put in the Way of it. 

My coming was a particular Relief to thefe Peo- 
ple, becaufe we furnifh'd them with Knives, Scif- 
fars, Spades, Shovels, Pick- axes, and all Things of 
that Kind which they could want. 

With the Help of thefe Tools they were fo very 
handy, that they came at laft to build up their 
Huts, or Houfes, very handfomely ,• raddling or 
working it up like Basket-work all the Way round, 
which was a very extraordinary Piece of Ingenuity, 
and look'd very odd, but was an exceeding good 
Fence, as well againfc Heat, as againft all Sorts of 
Vermine ; and our Men were fo taken with it, that 
they got the wild Savages to come and do the like 
for them ; fo that when I came to fee the two Eng- 
lifhmens Colonies, they look'd, at a Diftance, as if 
they liv'd all like Bees, in a Hive ,• and as for Will. 
Atkins, who was now become a very induftrious ne- 
jreffary and fober Fellow, he had made himfelf fuch 

a Tent 



[ io<S] 



a Tent of Basket-work, as I believe was never feen ; 
it was 1 20 Paces round in the Out-lide, as I mea- 
fur'd by my Seeps ; the Walls were as clofe work'd 
as a Basket in Pannels, or Squares of 3 2 in Number, 
and very firong, fianding about feven Foot high ; 
in the middle was another not above 22 Paces round, 
but built ftronger, being Eight- fquare in its Form, 
and in the eight Corners flood eight very firong 
Pofts, round the Top of which he laid firong Pieces 
pinr/d together with wooden Pins, from which 
he raifed a Piramid tor the Roof of: eight Rafters, 
very handfome, I aflare you, and jbin'd together ve- 
ry well, tho' he had no Nails, and only a few iron 
Spikes, which he made hfmfelf too, out of the old 
Iron that I had left there i and indeed this Fellow 
fhev/d abundance of Ingenuity in feveral Things, 
which he had no Knowledge of; he made him a 
Forge, with a Pair of wooden Bellows to blow the 
Fire ; he made himfelf Charcoal for his Work, and 
he formed out of one of the Iron- Crows, a mid- 
dling good Anvil to hammer upon ; in this Manner 
he made many Things, but efpecially Hooks, Sta- 
ples and Spikes, Bolts and Hinges : But to return to 
the Houfe ; after he had pitch a the Roof of his in- 
nermoft Tent, he work'd it up between the Rafters 
with Basket-work, fo firm, and thatch'd that over 
again fo ingenioufly with Rice-ftraw, and over that 
a large Leaf of a Tree, which cover'd the Top, 
that his Houfe was as dry as if it had been tiTd or 
Hated. Indeed he own'd that the Savages made the 
Basket-work for him. 

The outer Circuit was covered, as a Lean-too, 
all round this inner Apartment, and long Rafters lay 
from the two and thiry Angles to the top Pofts of the 
inner Houfe, being about twenty Foot Diftant ; fo 
that there was a Space like a Walk, within the outer 
Wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty 
Foot wide. 

The 



[ icy] 



The inner Place he partitioned off with the fame 
Wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided it into 
fix Apartments, fo that he had fix Rooms on a 
Floor ; and out of every one of thefe there was a 
a Door, firft into the Entry or Coming into the main 
Tent, and another Door into the Space or Walk that 
was round it ; fo that Walk was alio divided into 
fix equal Parts, which ferv'd not only for Retreat, 
but to ftore up any Neceffaries which the Family had 
Occafion for, Thefe fix Spaces not taking up the 
whole Circumference, what other Apartments the 
outer Circle had, were thus ordered : As foon as 
you were in at the Door of the outer Circle, you 
had a (hort Pafiage ftraic before you to the Door of 
the inner Houfe, but on either Side was a wicker Par- 
tition, and a Door in it, by which you went, firft, 
into a large Room or Store-houfe, twenty Foot wide, 
and about thirty Foot long, and thro* that into ano- 
ther not quite fo long '•> fo that in the outer Circle 
was tenhandfome Rooms, fix of which were only 
to become at thro' the Apartments of the inner Tent, 
and ferv'd as Qofets or retiring Rooms to the ref- 
peftive Chambers of the inner Circle ; and four large 
Ware-houfes or Barns, or what you pleafe to call 
them, which went in thro 5 one another, two on ei- 
ther Hand of the Paffage, that led thro' the outer 
Door to the inner Tent. 

Such a Piece of Basket-work, I believe, was ne- 
ver feen in the World ; nor a Houfe, or Tent, fo 
neatly contrived, much lefs, fo built. In this great 
Bee-hive livM the three Families, that is to fay, 
Will. Atkins and his Companion ; the third was 
killed, but his Wife remain'd with three Children ; 
for (he was, it feems, big with Child when he dy'd, 
and the other two were not at all backward to give 
the Widow her full Share of every Thing, I mean, 
as to their Corn, Milk, Grapes, &c. and when they 
kill'd a Kid, or found a Turtle on the Shore ; fo 
that they all liv'd well enough, tho' it was true, 

they 



[ io8 ] 



they were not fo induftrious as the other two, as 
has been obferv'd already. 

One Thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz* 
That as for Religion, I don't know that there was 
any Thing of that Kind among them 5 they pretty 
often indeed put one another in Mind that there was 
a God, by the very common Method of Seamen, 
viz,* Swearing by his Name : Nor were their poor 
ignorant Savage Wives much the better for having 
been marry 'd to Chriftians, as we muft call them ; 
for as they knew very little of God themfelves, fo 
they were utterly uncapable of entring into any 
Difcourfcwith their Wives about a God., or to talk any 
thing to them concerning Religion. 

The utmoft of all the Improvement which lean fay 
the Wives had made from them, was., that they had 
taught them tofpeak Englifh pretty weli, and all the 
Children they had, which was near 20 in all, were 
taught to fpeak Englifh too, from their firft learning 
to fpeak, tho'they at firft fpoke it in a very broken 
Manner, like their Mothers. There were none of 
thefe Children above Gx Years old when I came thi- 
ther, forit was not much above feven Years that they 
had fetched thefe five Savage Ladies over, but 
they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had 
all Children, moreorlefs ; I think the Cook's Mate's 
Wife was big of her Sixth Child ; and the Mothers 
were all a good Sort of well-govern'd, quite, labo- 
rious Women, modeft and decent, helpful to one 
another, mighty obfervant and fubjeft to their Ma- 
ilers, I cannot call them Husbands ; and wanted 
nothing but to be well inftru&ed in the Chriftian Re- 
ligion, and to be legally marry 'd ,* both which were 
happily brought about afterwards by my Means, or, 
atleaft, in Confequence of my coming among them. 
Having thus given an Account of the Colony in 
general, and pretty much of my five Runagate Eng- 
lifh) I muft fay fomething o£ the Spaniards, who were 
the m^in Body of the Family j and m whofe Story 

there 



I i09 ] 

there are fome Incidents aifo remarkable enough. 

I had a great many Difcourfes with them about 
their Circumftances, when they were among the Sa- 
vages: They rold me readily, that they had no In- 
ftances to give of their Application or Ingenuity in 
that Country; that they were a poor miserable de- 
jefted Handful of People ; that if Means had been put 
into their Hands; they had yet fo abondon'd them- 
felves to Defpare, and fo funk under the Weight of 
their Misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but 
Starving : One of them, a grave and very fenfiblc 
Man, told me, he was cotivinc'd they were in the 
wrong -j that it was not the Part of Wife Men to give 
up themfelves to their Mifery but always to take 
Hold of the Helps which Reafon offer'd, as well for 
prefent Support, as for future Deliverance. He told 
me that Grief was the mod fenfelefs infignificant 
Paffion in the World J'forthatit regarded only Things 
paft, which were generally impoffible to be recalled 
or to be remedy'd, but had no View to Things to 
come, and had no Share in any Thing that lookM 
like Deliverance, but rather added to the Affli&ion, 
than propofed a Remedy : And upon this, he repeat- 
ed a Spanijh Proverb ; which tho' I cannot repeat in 
juft the fame Words that he fpoke it, jet I remember 
I made it into an Englijh Proverb of my own, thus : 

In Trouble to be troubPd, 

h to have your "Trouble doubl'd. 

He ran on then, in Remarks upon all the little 
Improvements I had made in my Solitude ; my un- 
weary'd Application, as he called it, and howl had 
made a Condition, which in its Circumftances, was, 
at firft much worfe than theirs, a thoufand Times 
more happy than theirs was, even now, when they 
were all together: Fie told me, it was remarkable, 
that Englifbmen had a greater Prefence of Mind in 
their Diftrefs, than any People that ever he met with ; 
that their unhappy Nation, and the Portuguefe, were 

the 



[ "0] 

the worft Men In the World to ftruggle with Mif- 
fortunes ; for that their firft Step in Dangers, after 
the common Efforts are over, was always to defpair, 
lie down under it, and die 5 without roufing their 
Thoughts up to proper Remedies for Efcape. 

I told him, their Cafe and mine differed exceeding- 
ly, that they were caft upon the Shore without Ne- 
ceflaries, without Supply of Food, or of prefent Su- 
ftenance, 'till they could provide : That it is true, 
I had this Difadvantage and Difcomfort, that I was 
alone ; but then the Supplies I had providentally 
thrown into my Hands, by the unexpected driving of 
the Ship on Shore, was fuch a Help as would have en- 
couraged any Creature in the World to have apply'd 
himfelfasl have done, Seignior, fays the Spaniard, 
had we poor Spaniards been in your Cafe, we fhouid 
never have gotten half thofe Things out of the Ship 
as you did : Nay fays he* we fhouid never have found 
Means to have gotten a Raft to carry them, or to 
have gotten a Raft on Shore without Boat or Sail ; 
and how much lefs fhouid we have done, faid he, if 
any of us had been alone ? Well, I defir'd him to a- 
bate his Compliment, and go on with the Hiftory of 
their coming on Shore, where they landed ; he told 
me, they unhappily landed at a Place where there 
were People without Provifions ; whereas had they 
had the common Senfe to have put off to Sea again, 
and gone to another Ifland a little farther, they had 
found Provifions, tho' without People ; there being 
an Ifland that Way, as they have been told, where 
there was Provifions, tho* no People; that is to fay, 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been 
there, and had fill' d the Ifland with Goats and Hogs 
at feveral Times : where they have bred in fuch Mul- 
titudes, and where Turtle and Sea- Fowls were in 
fuch Plenty, that they could ha* been in no Want of 
Flefli, tho' they had found no Bread ; whereas here, 
they were only fuftain'd with a few Roots and Herbs, 
which they underitood not, and which had no Sub- 

ftance 



[ III ] 



fiance in them, and which the Inhabitants gave them 
fparingly enough, and who could treat them no bet- 
ter, unlefs they would turn Canibals, and eat Mens 
Flefli, which was the great Dainty of their Country. 
They gave me an Account how many Ways they 
ftrove to civilize the Savages they were with, and to 
teach them rational Cuftoms in the ordinary Way of 
Living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it upon 
them, as unjuft, that they who came there for Affi- 
flance and Support, fhculd attempt to fet up for In- 
flru&ors of thofe that gave them Bread; intimating, 
it feems^ that none fhot Id fet up for the Inftru&ors 
of other;, but thofe who could live without them. 

They gave me difmal Accounts of the Extremities 
they were driven to ; how (ometimes they were ma- 
ny Days without any Food at all ; the Ifland they 
were upon being inhabited by a Sort of Savages 
that lived more indolent, and for that Reafon were 
lefs fupplied with the Neceffaries of Life, than 
they had Reafon to believe others were, in the fame 
Part of the World ; and yet they found, that thefe 
Savages were lefs ravenous and voracious, than thofe 
who had better Supplies of Food. 

Alfo they added, That they could not but fee with 
what Demonftrations of Wifdom and Goodnefs the 
governing Providence of God dire&s the Event of 
Things in the World ; which, they faid, appear'd 
in their Circumftance ; for if preficd by the Hard- 
fhips they were under, and the Barrennefs of the 
Country where they were, they had fcarchM after & 
better Place to live in ; they had then been out of 
the Way of the Relief that happened to them by my 
Means. 

Then they gave me . an Account, how the Savages, 
who they liv'd among, expected them to go out with 
them into their Wars : And it was true, that, as they 
had Fire-Arms with theov-had they not had the Di- 
fafter to lofe their Ammunition, they fliould not 
have been ferviceable only to their Friends, but>have 

made 



C "* ] 

made themfelves terrible both to Friends and Ene- 
mies ; but being without Pawder and Shot, and yec 
in a Condition, that they could not in Reafon deny 
to go out with their Landlords to their Wars ; when 
they came into the Field of Battle, they were in a 
worfe Condition than the Savages themfelves ; for 
they neither had Bows nor Arrows, nor could they 
ufe thofe the Savages gave them ; fo that they 
could do nothing but ftand ftill, and be wounded 
with Arrows, till they came up to the Teeth of 
their Enemy ; and then indeed the three Halbards 
they had, were of Ufe to them i and they would of- 
ten drive a whole little Army before them, with thofe 
Halbards and fharpned Sticks put into the Muzzles 
of their Muskets : But that for all this they were 
fometimes furrounded with Multitudes, and in great 
Danger from their Arrows ,• till at laft they found the 
Way to make themfelves large Targets of Wood, 
which they covered with Skins of wild Beads, whofe 
Names they knew not •, and thefe covered them txom 
the Arrows of the Savages; that notwithftanding thefe, 
they were fometimes in great Danger, ana were ence 
five of them knocked down together with the Clubs of 
the Savages, which was the Time when one of them 
was taken Prifoner ,* that is to hy y the Spaniard, 
whom I had relieved, that at firft they thought had 
been killed : But when afterwards they heard he was 
taken Prifoner, they were under the greateii Grief 
imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured 
their Lives to have refcued him. 

They told me, That when they were fo knock'd 
down, the reft of their Company refcu'd them, and 
flood over them, fighting till they were come to them- 
felves, all but him who they thought had been dead; 
and then they made their Way with their Halbards 
and Pieces, (landing clofe together in a Line, thro' a 
Body of above a thoufand Savages, beating down all 
that came in their Way,got the Vi&ory over their E- 
nemies, but to their great Sorrow, becaufe it was with 

the 



r»j] 



the lofs of their Friend ,- who, the other party find- 
ing him alive, carry'd off with fome others, as I 
gave an Account in my former* 

They defcrib'd moll afte&ionately, how they were 
furpriz'd with Joy at the Return of their Friend and 
Companion in Mifcry, who they thought had been 
devoured by wild Beads of the worft Kind, (viz.) 
by wild Men ,• and yet how more and more they 
were farpriz'd with the Account he gave them of 
his Errand, and that there was a Chriftian in any 
Place near, much more one that was able, and had 
Humanity enough to contribute to their Delive- 
ranee. 

They defcribed how they were aflonifh'd at the 
Sight of the Relief I fent them, and at the Appea- 
rance of Loves of Bread, Things they had not feen 
fince there coming to that miferable Place; how of- 
ten they crofled it, and bleffed it as Bread fent from 
Heaven ; and what a reviving Cordial it was to 
their Spirits to tafte it; asalfo of the other Things 
I had fent for their Supply, and after all, they 
would have told me fomething of the Jpy they were 
in, at the Sight of a Boat and Pilots to carry them 
away to the Perfon and Place from wh^ice all thefe 
new Comforts came ; but they told 1$ was im- 
poflible to exprefs it by Words, for their exceflive Joy, 
naturally driving them to unbecoming Extravagan- 
cies, they had no way to defcribe them, but by til- 
ling me that they bordered upon Lunacy, having nfy 
Way to give Vent to their Paflion, fuitable to the 
Senfe that was upon them ; that in fome it worked 
one Way, and in fome another , - and that fome of 
them, thro" a Surprize of Joy, would burft out into 
Tears ; others be ftark mad, and others immediately 
faint. This Difcourfe extreamly affected me, and 
call'd to my mind Friday s Extacy, when he met his 
Father, and the poor People's Extacy, when I took 
them up at Sea, after their Ship was on Fire : The 
Mate of the Ship's Joy, when he found himfelf de* 

H livered 



[ "4 ] 

livered in the Place where he expe&ed to perifh ; 
and my own Joy when after 28 Years Captivity, I 
found a good Ship ready to carry me to my own 
Country. All thefe Things made me more fenfible 
of the Relation of thofe poor Men, and more affe- 
cted with it. 

Having thus given a View of the State of Things, 
as I found them, I muft relate the Heads of what I 
did for thefe People, and the Condition in which I 
left them. It was their Opinion and mine too, that 
they would be troubled no more with the Savages; 
or that if they were, they would be able to cut 
them off, if they were twice as many as before j 
fo they had no Concern about that. Then I en- 
tred into a ferious Dilcourfe with the Spaniard 
whom I call Governor, about their Stay in the 
Ifland •, for as I was not come to carry any of 
them off, fo it would not be juft to carry off 
fome, and leave others, who perhaps would 
be unwilling to flay, if their Strength was dimi- 
niflied. 

On the other Hand, I told them, I came to efta- 
blifh them there, not to remove them ; and then I 
let them know, that I had brought with me Relief 
of fundry Kinds for them ,* That I had been at a 
great Charge to fupply them with all Things necef- 
fary, as well for their Convenience, as their Defence ; 
and that I had fuch and fuch particular Perfons with 
me, as well to encreafe and recruit their Number, as 
by the particular neceflfary Employments which they 
were bred to, being Artificers^ to affift them in thofe 
Things, in which, at prefent, they were to feek. 

They were altogether when I talked thus to them ; 
and before I delivered to them the Stores I had 
brought, I askM them one by one, If they had en- 
tirely forgot, and burry'd the firft Animolities that 
had been among them, and fhould fhake Hands with 
one another, and engage in a firid; Friendfhip and 

Union 



[ii 5 ] 

Union of Intereft, that fo there might be no more 
Mifunderftanding or Jwaloufies. 

Will* Atkim, with abundance of Franknefs and 
good Humour, Jaid, They had met with Afflic- 
tions enough to make them all fober, and Enemies 
enough to make them ail Friends ; that for his Part 
he would livcfand die with them ; and was fo tar 
from defigning any Thing againft the Spaniards, that 
he own'd they had done nothing to him, but what 
his own mad Humour made neceffary, and what he 
would have done, and perhaps much worfe in their 
Cafe ; and that he would ask them Pardon, if I de- 
fired it, for the foolifli and brutift Things he had 
done to them; and was very willing and defirous of 
living in Terms of entire Friendfhip and Union with 
them i and would do any Thing that lay in his Pow- 
er to convince them of it ,• and as for going to Eng* 
land, he car'd not if he did not go thither thefe twen- 
ty Years. 

The Spaniards faid, They had indeed at firft dif- 
arm'd and excluded Witt. Atkins and his two 
Countrymen for their ill Condufi, as they had let 
me know -, and they appealed to me, for the Nece- 
ffity they were under to do fo : But that fPitt. Atkins 
had behav'd himfelf fo bravely in the great Fight 
they had with the Savages, and on feveral Occafiors 
fince ; and had fliew'd himfelf fo faithful to, and con- 
cern d for, the general Intereft of them all, that they 
had forgotten all that was paft, and thought he 
merited as much to be trufled with Arms, and fup- 
ply'd wirh^NeceiTaries as any of them ; and that they 
hadteftify'd their Satisfaction in him, by commit- 1 
ting the Command to him, next to the Cover. iouc 
himfelf. And as they had an entire Confidence in 
him and all his Countrymenj fo they acknowledge! 
they had merited that Confidence by all the Methods 
that honefl Men could merit to be valued, and trufted ; 
and they moll heartily embraced the Occaiion of 
H 2 giving 



[ii<5] 

giving me this Aflfurance, that they would never 
have anylncereft feparatefrom one another. 

Upon thefe frank and open Declarations of Friend- 
fhip, we appointed the next Day to dine all together; 
and indeed we made a fplendid Feaft: I caufed the 
Ships Cook and his Mate to come on Shore, and 
drefs our Dinner ; and the old Cook's Mate we had 
on Shore, affifted. We brought on Shore fix Pieces 
of good Beef, and four Pieces of Pork out of the Ship's 
Provifion, with our Punch-Bowl, and Materials to 
fill it ; and in particular, I gave them ten Bottles of 
French Claret, and ten Bottles of Englifh Beer ; Things 
that neither the Spaniards, or the Englijh Men had 
tailed for many Years; and which, it may be fuppo- 
fed, they were exceeding glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our Feaft five whole Kids, 
which the Cooks roafted ; and three of them were 
fent covered up clofe on Board the Ship f to the 
Seamen, that they might Feaft on frefli Meat from 
on Shore, as we did with their Salt Meat from on 
Board. 

After this Feaft, at which we were very inno- 
cently merry, I brought out my Cargo of Goods, 
wherein, that there might be on Difpute about di- 
viding, I fhew'd them there was fufficient for them 
all; and defir'd that they might a>l take an equal 
Quantity of the Goods that were for wearing ; that 
is to fay, equal when made up; as firft, I diftribu- 
ted Linnen fufficient to make every one of them four 
Shirts ; and at the Spaniards Requeft afterwards, made 
up fix ; thefe were exceeding comfortable to them, 
having been what, as I may fay, they had long fmce 
forgoc the Ufe of or what it was to wear them. 

I allotted the thin £#g//^ StufFs, 4 which I mentioned 
before, to make every one a light Coat, like a Frock, 
which I judged fitteft for the Heat of the Seafon j 
cool and loole, and order'd, that whenever they de- 
cayed, they flaould make more, as they thought fit : 

The 



[ "7 3 



The like for Pumps, Shoes, Stockings and Hats, 

I cannot exprefs what Pleafure, what Satisfa&ion , 
fat upon the Countenances of all thefe poor Men, 
when they faw the Care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furniflrd them; they told me, I 
was a Father to them, and that having fuch a Cor- 
refpondent as I was, in fo remote a Part of the 
World, it would make them forget that they were 
left in a defolate Place ; and they all voluntarily en- 
gaged to me not to leave the Place without my 
Confent. 

Then I prefented to them the People I had brought 
with me, particularly the Taylor, the Smith, and 
the two Carpenters, all of them moft neceflary Peo- 
ple ; but above all, my general Artificer, than whom 
they could not Name any Thing that was more ufe- 
ful to them. And the Taylor, to fliew his Concern 
for them, went to work immediately, and, with my 
Leave, made them every one a Shirt the firft Thing 
he did ; and which was ftill more, he taught the Wo- 
men, not only how to fow and fttch, and ufe the 
Needle, but made them affift to make the Shirts for 
their Husbands, and for all the reft. 

As to the Carpenters, I fcarce need mention, how 
ufeful they were, for they took in Pieces all my clumfy 
unhandy Things, and made them clever convenient 
Tables* Stools, Bed-fteads, Cup-boards, Lockers* 
Shelves, and every thing they wanted of that Kind* 

But to let them fee how Nature made Artificers 
at firft, I carried the Carpenters to fee Will Atkins's 
Basket-houfe, as I call'd it, and they both ownM 
they never faw an Inftance of fuch natural Ingenuity 
before ; nor any Thing fo regular, and fo handily 
built, at leaft of its Kind : And one of them, when 
he faw it, after mufing a good while, turning about 
tome, I am fure, fays he, that Man has no need of 
us, you need do nothing but give him Tools. 

H 3 The* 



[ n8] 



Then I brought them out all my Store of Tools, 
and gave every Man a Digging* Spade, a Shovel, and 
a Rake, for we had no Harrows or Plows ; and to 
every feparare Place, a Pick-ax, a Crow, a broad 
Ax, and a Saw ; always appointing, that as often 
as any were broken, or worn oat, they fhould be 
fupply'd without grudging, out of the general Stores 
that I left behind. 

Nails, Scaples, Hinges, Hammers, Ch.'ffels, Knives, 
Scifiars, and ail forts of Tools, and Iron- work, 
they had without Tale, as they required, for no Man 
would care to take more than they wanted, and he 
muft be a Fool that would waft or fpoil them, en 
any Account whatever ; and for the Ufe of a Smith, 
I leit two Ton of unwrought Iron for a Supply. 

My Magazine of Powder and Arms, which I 
brought them, was fuch, even to Profufion, that 
they could not but rejoice at them, for now they 
could march as I ufed to do, with a Musket upon 
each Shoulder, if there was Occafion, and were able 
to fight a Thoufand Savages, if they had but fome 
little Advantages of Situation, which alfo they 
could notmifsof if they had Occafion. 

I carry'd on Shore with me the young Man, whofe 
Mother was ftarv'd to Death, and the Maid alfo ; 
fhe was a fober well educated religious young Wo- 
man, and behaved fo inoffenfively, that every one 
gave her a good Word} (he had indeed an unhappy 
Life with us, there being no Woman in the Ship but 
herfelf ; but (he bore it with Patience. After a while 
feeing Things fo well order'd, and in fo fine a Way of 
thriving upon my Ifland, and confidering that they 
had neither Bufinefsor Acquaintance in the Eaft-In- 
dies, or Pveafon for taking fo long a Voyage : I fay, 
confidering all this, both of them came to me, and 
defir'd I would give them leave to remain on the Ifland, 
and be entered among my Family, as they calfd it. 

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little 
Plat of Ground allotted to them, where they had 

three 



C "9] 



three Tents or Houfes fet up, furrounded with a 
Basket-work, Pallifado'd like Atkins's, adjoining to 
his Plantation: Their Tents were contrived, fo that 
they had each of them a Room apart to lodge in, 
and a middle lent like a great Store-houfe to lay 
all their Goods in, and to eat and drink in ; and now 
the other two EngUJhmen remov'd their Habitation 
to the fame Place, and fo the Ifland was divided in- 
to three Colonies and no more, viz.. the Spaniards 
with old Friday, and the firfl Servants, at my old 
Habitation under the Hill ; which was, in a Word, 
the capital City ; and where they had fo enlarged 
and extended their Works, as well under as on the 
outfide of the Hill, that they liv'd, tho* perfe&ly 
concealed, yet full at large. - Never was there fuch 
a little City in a Wood, and fo hid, I believe, in a- 
ny Part of the World ; for I verily believe, a thou- 
(and Men might have rang'd the Ifland a Month, 
and if they had not known there was fuch a Thing, 
and looked on purpofe for it, they would not have 
found it ; for the Trees flood fo thick and foclofe, 
and grew fo faft mattered into one another, that 
nothing but cutting them down firft could difcover 
the Place ; except the only two narrow Entrances, 
where they went in and out, could be found, which 
was not veryeafy; one of them was juft down at 
the Waters Edge on the Side of the Creek, and 
it was afterwards above two hundred Yards to the 
Place ; and the other was up the Ladder at twice, 
as I have already formerly defcrib'd it ,• and they 
had a large Wood thick planted, alfo, on the 
Top of the Hill, which contain'd above an Acre, 
which grew apace, and cover'd the Piace from all 
Difcovery there, with only one narrow Place be- 
tween two Trees, noteafy to bedifcoverM to enter 
on that Side. 

The other Colony was that of Will. Atkins's, 
where there were four Families of Englijb Men, 

H 4 I mean 



[ 120] 



I mean thofe I had left there, with their Wives 
and Children ; three Savages that were Slaves ; the 
Widow and Children of the Englijh Man that was 
kill'd ; the young Man and the Maid ; and by the 
Way, we made a Wik of her alfo, before we went 
away : There were alfo the two Carpenters and the 
Taylor, who I brought with me for them; alfo the 
Smith, who was a very neceflfary Man to them, efpe- 
cially as a Gunfmith, to take care of their Arms ; 
and my other Man, who I call'd, Jack of all Trades ; 
who was in himfelf as good, almoft as 20 Men, for 
he was not only a very ingenious Fellow, but a ve- 
ry merry Fellow, and before I went away, we mar- 
ried him to the honeft Maid that came with the 
Youth in the Ship, I mention'd before. 

And now I fpeak of Marrying, it brings me na- 
turally to fay fomething of the French Ecclefiaftic 
that I had brought with me out of the Ship's Crew, 
who I took up at Sea. It is true, this Man was a 
Roman y and perhaps it may give Offence to fome here- 
after, if I leave any Thing extraordinary upon Record, 
of a Man, who, before I begin, I mult, (to fet him 
Out in juft Colours) reprefent in Terms very much to 
his Difad vantage, in the Account of Proteftants ; as 
firft y that he was a Papift ; fecmdly, a popifli Prieft ; 
and thirdly, a French popifh Prieft. 

But Juftice demands of me to give him a due Cha- 
racter ; and I muftfay, he was a grave, fober, pious, 
and moft religious Perfon ,• exaft in his Life, extenfive 
in his Charity, and exemplar in almoft every Thing he 
did ; what then can any one fay, againft my being ve- 
ry fenfible of the Value of fuch a Man, notwithftand- 
ing hisProfeffion? Tho' it may be my Opinion, per- 
haps, as well as the Opinion of others, who fhali read 
this, that he was miftaken. 

The firft Hour that I began to converfe with 
him, after he had agreed to go with me to the 
Eaft Indies y I found Reafon to delight exceedingly 

in 



[ III ] 

in his Converfation; and he firft began with me about 
Religion in the mod obliging Manner imaginable. 

Sir, fays he, you have not only, under God, (and 
at that he crofs'd his Bread) fav'd my Life, but 
you have admitted me to go this Voyage in your 
Ship, and by your obliging Civility have taken me 
into your Family, giving me an Opportunity of 
free Converfation. Now Sir, fays he, you fee by 
my Habit, what my Profeffion is, and I guefs by 
your Nation what yours is : I may think it is my 
Duty, and doubtlefs it is fo, to ufe my utmoft En- 
deavours, on all Occalions, to bring all the Souls I 
can to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to em- 
brace the Catholick Do&rine ; but as I am here 
under your Permiflion, and in your Family, I am 
bound in Juftice to your Kindnefs* as well as in 
Decency and good Manners, to be under your Go- 
vernment ; and therefore I fhall not, without your 
Leave, enter into any Debates on the Point of Re- 
ligion, in which we may not agree, farther than you 
fhall give me Leave. 

1 told him, his Carriage was fo modeft, that I 
could not but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we 
were fuch People as they call'd Hereticks ; but that 
he was not the firft Catholick that I had convers'd 
with, without falling into any Inconveniencies, or 
carrying the Queftions to any height in Debate : 
That he fliould not find himfelf the worfe us'd for 
being of a different Opinion from us, and if we did 
not converfe without any Diflike on either Side up- 
on that Score, it would be his Fault, not ours. 

He reply 'd, that he thought all our Converfation 
might be eafily feparated from Difputes : That it 
was not his Bufinefs to cap Principles with every 
Man he difcours'd with ,• and that he rather defir a 
me to converfe with him as a Gentleman, than as 
a Religieufe ', that if I would give him/leave at any 
time to difcourfe upon religious Subje&s, he would 
readily comply with it j and that then, he did not 

doubt 



C i" ] 

doubt but I would allow him alfo to defend his own 
Opinions, as well as he could ', but that without roy 
Leave, he would not break in upon me with any 
fuch thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not ceafeto 
do all that became him in his Office, as a Prieft, as 
well as a private Chriftian, to procure the Good of 
the Ship, and the Safety of all that was in her ; 
and tho* perhaps we would not join with him, aid 
he could not pray with us, he hop'd he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all Occafions. In 
this Manner we conversed, and as he was of a mod 
obliging Gentleman-like Behaviour; fo he was, if I 
may be allowed to fay fo, a Man of good Senfe, and 
as I believe, of great Learning. 

He gave me a moft diverting Account of his 
Life, and of the many extraordinary Events of it; of 
many Adventures which had befallen him in the 
few Years that he had been abroad in the World, 
and particularly this was very remarkable, (viz*) 
That during the Voyage he was now engag'd in, 
he had the Misfortune to be five times fhip'd 
and unfhip'd, and never to go to the Place whither 
any of the Ships, he was in, were at firffc defign'd : 
That his firffc Intent was to have gone to Martmico, 
and that he went on board a Ship bound thither, at 
St. Malo; but being fore'd into Lisbon, by bad Wea- 
ther, the Ship receiv'd fome Damage, by running 
a-ground in the Mouth of the River Tagus, and was 
obliged to unload her Cargo there ; that finding a 
Portuguefe Ship there bound to the Maderas, and 
ready to fail, and fuppofing he fhould cafily meet 
with a Vefiel there bound to Maninico ; he went on 
board,in order to fail to the Maderas \ but the Mafter 
of the Portuguefe Ship being but an indifferent Mari- 
ner, had been out in his Reckoning, and they drove 
to Fial ; where, however he happen'd to find a very 
good Market for his Cargo, which was Corn, and 
therefore refolv'd not to go to the Maderas, but to 

load 



c m ] 

load Salt at the Ifle of May, and to go away to New- 
foundland; He had no Remedy iii this Exigence, but 
to go with the Ship, and had a pretty goou Voy- 
age as far as the Banks, fo they call the Piace 
where they catch the Fifh, where meeting wich a 
French Shi\>, bound from France to Que beck, in the Ri- 
ver ot Canada, and from thence to Mart'mico, to carry 
Provilions, he thought he fhould have an Opportunity 
to compleat his firft Ddign : But when he came to 
Quebeck, the Matter of the Ship dy'd, and the Ship 
proceeded no farther ; fo the next Voyage he (hip a 
himfelf for France, in the Ship that was burnt, when 
we took them up at Sea, and then fhip'd them wich us 
for the Eaft-Iadies, as I have already faid : Thus he 
had been difappointed in five Voyages, all, as I 
may call it, in one Voyage, befides what I (hall 
have Occaiion to mention farther of the fame Per- 
fon. 

But, I fhall not make Digreffions into other Mens 
Stories, which have no Rdacion to my own. Ire- 
turn to what concerns our Affair in the Ifland : He 
came to me one Morning, for he lodged among us* 
all the while we were upon the Ifland ; and it hap- 
pen'd to be juft when I was going to vifit the 
Englifh Men's Colony 1 , at the fartheft Part of 
the Ifland ; I fay , he came to me and told 
me, with a very grave Countenance, that he had 
for two or three Days defir'd an Opportunity of 
fome Difcourfe with me, which he hop'd fhould 
not be difpleafing to me, becaufe he thought it 
might in fome Meafure correfpond with my gene- 
ral Defign, which was the Profperity of my new 
Colony, and perhaps might put it, at leaft more 
than he yet thought it was, in the Way of God's 
Bleffing. 

I lookM a little furpnYd at the laft Part of his 
Difcourfe, and turning a little fhort. How Sir! faid 
I, can it be faid, that we arc not in the Way of God's 
Bleffing, after fuch vijible Aj]tfiames y and wonderful 

De~ 



C X M ] 

Deliverances as we have feen here, and of which 1 
have given you a large Account ? 

If you had pleas'd &V, /aid he with a World of Mo- 
defty, and yet with great Readinefs, to have heard me, 
you would have found no room to have been dif- 
pleas'd, much lefs to think fo hard of me, that I 
fhould fuggeft, that you have not had wonderful 
Afliftances and Deliverances ; and I hope, on your 
Behalf, that you are in the Way of GodV> BleiFmg, 
and your Defign is exceeding good, and will prof* 
per : But Sir, /aid he y tho' it were more fo, than is 
even poffible to you, yet there may be fome among 
you that are not equally right in their A&ions : And 
you know, that in the Story of the Children of If 
raely one Achan in the Camp remov'd God's Bleffing 
from them, and turned his Hand fo againft them* 
that fix and thirty of them, tho* not concerned in the 
Crime, were the Objeft of Divine Vengeance, and 
bore the Weight of that Punifhment. 

I was fenfibly touched with his Difcourfe, and 
told him his Inference was fo juft, and the whole 
Defign feem'd fo fincere, and was really fo religious 
in its own Nature, that I was very forry I had in- 
terrupted him, and beg'd him to go on ; and in the 
mean Time, becaufe it feem'd, that what we had 
both to fay, might take up fome Time, I told him, 
I was going to the Engli(h Mens Plantations, and 
ask'd him to go with me, and we might difcourfe 
of it by the Way : He told me, he would more wil- 
lingly wait on me thither, becaufe there partly, the 
Thing was a&ed, which he defir'd to fpeak to me 
about ,• fo we walk'd on ; and I prefs'd him to be 
free and plain with me, in what he had to fay, 

Why then Sir, fays he, be pleafed to give me 
Leave to lay down a few Proportions, as the Foun- 
dation of what 1 have to fay, that we may not 
differ in the general Principles, tho' we may be of 
fome differing Opinions in the Practice of Particu- 
lars. Firft, Sir, tho* we differ in fome of the Do- 
ctrinal 



[ «* ] 

ftrinal Articles of Religion ; and it is very pnhappy 
that it is fo, efpecially in the Cafe before us, as I 
(hall (hew afterwards : Yet there are fome general 
Principles in which we both agree 5 (viz..) firft, That 
there is a God ; and that this God having given 
us fome ftated general Rules for our Service and O- 
bedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to 
offend him ; either by negleding to do what he has 
commanded, or by doing what he has exprefly for- 
bidden : And let our different Religions be what 
they will, this general Principle is readily ownM by 
us all, That the Bieffing of God does not ordinarily 
follow a prefumptuous finning againft his Command; 
and every good Chriftian will be affe&ionately con- 
cerned to prevent any that are under his Care, li- 
ving in a total Negle6t of God and his Commands. 
It is not your Men being Proteftants, whatever my 
Opinion may be of fuch, that difcharges me from 
being concern'd for their Souls, and from endeavour- 
ing, if it lies before me, that they (hould live in as 
little Diftance from and Enmity with their Maker, 
as poffible ,• efpecially if you give me Leave to med- 
dle fo far in your Circuit. 

I could not yet imagine what he aim'd at, and 
told him, I granted all he had faid, and thank'd 
him, that he would fo far concern himfelf for us ; 
and beg'd he would explain the Particulars of what 
he had obferv'd, that like Joflma, to take his own 
ParableJ might put away the accurfed Thing from us. 
Why then, Sir, fays he, I will take the Liberty 
you give me ; and there are three Things, which, 
if I am right, muft Hand in the Way of God's Bief- 
fing upon your Endeavours here, and which I fliould 
rejoice for your Sake, and their own, to feeremov'd. 
And, Sir, fays he y I promife myfelf, that you will 
fully agree with me in them all, as (oon as I name 
them ; efpecially becaufe I fhall convince you, thac 
every one of them may, with great Eafe, and very 
much to your Satisfaction, be remedy 'd. 

He 



[ 12(5 ] 

He gave me no Leave to put in any more Civili- 
ties, but went o % Firfl y Sir, fays he, you have 
here four Englijh Men, who have fetch ci Women 
from among the Savages, and have taken them as 
their Wives, and have had many Chi dren by them 
all, and yet are not marry 'd to rhem after any da- 
ted legal Manner, as the Laws of God and Man 
require; aid therefore are yet, in theSenfe of both, 
no lefs than Adultere, s, and living in Adultery. To 
this, Sir, fays he> I know you will objeft; that there 
was no Clergyman or Prieft of any Kind, or of any 
Protefllon, to perform the Ceremony ; nor any Pen 
and Ink, or Paper, to write down a Contract of 
Marriage, and have it fign'd between them. And 
I know alfo. Sir, what the Spaniard Governour has 
told you ; I mean of the Agreement that he oblig'd 
them to make, when they took thefe Women, (viz,*) 
That they fhould chufe them out by Confent, and 
keep fep. rate] y to them; which, by the way> is no- 
thing of a Marriage, no Agreement with the Wo- 
men, as Wives, but only an Agreement among them- 
felves, to keep them from quarrelling. 

But, Sir, theEffenceof the Sacrament of Matri- 
mony (fo he called it, being a Roman) confifts not 
only in the mutual Confent of the Parties to take 
one another, m Man and Wife, but in the formal and 
legal Obligation, that there is in the Contract, to 
compel the Man and Woman at all Times, to own 
and acknowledge each other i obliging the Man to 
abftain from all other Women, to engage in no o- 
ther Contract while thefe fubfift; and on all Occa- 
fions, as Ability allows, to provide honeflly for 
them and their Children ; and to oblige the Woman 
to the fame, or like Conditions, mutatis mutandis, on 
their Side. 

Now, Sir, fays he> thefe Men may, when they 
pleafe, or when Occafion prefents, abandon thefe 
Women, difown their Children, leave them to perifh, 
and take other Women, and marry them whilft thefe 

are 



[ W ] 

are living. And here he added, with fome Warmth, 
How, Sir, is God honour'd in this unlawful Liber- 
ty ? And how (hall a Bleffing fucceed your Endea- 
vours in this Place, However good in themfelves, and 
however fincere in your Defign, while thefe Men, who 
at prefent are your Subjects, under your abfolute 
Government and Dominion, are allowed by you to 
live in open Adultery ? 

I confefs, I was (truck at the Thing itfelf, but 
much more with the convincing Arguments he fup- 
ported it with ; for it was certainly true, that tho* 
they had no Clergyman upon the Spot, yet a formal 
Central: on both Sides, made before WitnefTes, and 
confirmed by any Token, which they had all agreed 
to be bound by, tho' it had been but the breaking a 
Stick between them, engaging the Men to own thefe 
Women for their Wives, upon all Occafions; and 
never to abandon them or their Children, and the 
Women to the fame with their Husbands, and had 
been an effectual lawful Marriage in the Sight of 
God ; and it was a great Negledt that it was not 
done. 

But I thought to have gotten off with my young 
Prieft, by telling him, that all that Part was done 
when I was not here, and they had liv'd fo many 
Years with them now, that if it was an Adultery, it 
was pad Remedy, they could do nothing in it now. 

Sir, fays he> asking your Pardon for fuch Freedom,' 
you are right in this, that it being done in your 
Abfence, you could not be charg'd with that Part 
of the Crime : But I befeech you, flatter not your 
felf, that you are not therefore under an Obligation 
to do your utmoft now, to put an End to it. How 
can you think, but that, let the Time paft lie on 
who it wi 1, all the Guilt, for the future, will lie 
entirely upon you? Becaufe it is certainly in your 
Power now to put an End to it, and m no Body's 
Power but your's* 

I was 



[ "8 ] 

I was fo dull ftill, that I did not take him right ; 
but I imagined, that by putting an End to it, he 
meant that I fhould part them, and not fuffer them 
to live together any longer ; And I faid to him, I 
could not do that by any Means, for that it would 
put the whole Ifland into Confufion : He feem'd fur- 
priz'd, that I fhould fo far miftake him. No, Sir, 
fays he, I do not mean, that you fhould now feperate 
them, but legally and effectually marry them now ; 
and as, Sir, my Way ot marrying them may not be 
fo eafy to reconcile them to, tho' it will be as effec- 
tual, even by your own Laws, fo your Way may be 
as well before God, and as valid among Men ; I 
mean, by a written Contract, (ign'd by both Man 
and Woman, and by all the Witnefles prefent, which 
all the Laws of Europe would decree to be valid. 

I was amaz'd to fee fo much true Piety, and fo 
much Sincerity of Zeal, befides the unufual Imparr 
tially in his Di(courfe,as to his own Party or Church, 
and fuch a true Warmth for the preferving People 
that he had no Knowledge of, or Relation to; I 
fay, for preferving them from tranfgreffing the Laws 
ot God ; the like of which, I had indeed not met 
•with any where : But recolle&ing what he had faid, 
of marrying them by a written Contraft, which I 
knew would ftand too ; I returned it back upon him, 
and told him, I granted all that he had faid to be 
juft, and on his Part very kind, that I would dif- 
courfe with the Men upon the Point now, when I 
came to them : And I knew no Reafon why they 
fhou'd fcruple to let him marry them all, which I 
knew well enough would be granted to be as authen- 
tick and valid in England, as if they were marry 'd 
by one of our own Clergymen. What was af- 
terwards done in this Matter, I fhall fpeak of it by 
itfelf. 

I then prefs'd him to tell me what was the Jecond 
Complaint which he had to make, acknowledging, 
that I was very much his Debtor for the firfi, and 

thank'd 



[ «9 ] 



thank'd him heartily for it. He told me, he would 
ufe the fame Freedom and Plainnefs in the fecond, 
and hop'd I would take it as well : And this was, 
that notwithftanding thefe Englifh Subje&s of mine, 
as he call'd them* had lived with thofe Women for 
almoft feven Years, and had taught them to fpeak 
Englifh, and even to read it ; and chat they were, as he 
perceived, Women of tollerable Underftanding, and 
capable of Inftru&ion ; yet they had not to this 
Hour taught them any thing of the Chriftian Reli- 
gion j no, not fo much as to know that there was a 
God, or a Worlhip, or in what Manner God was 
to be ferved, or that their own Idolatry, and wor- 
shipping they knew not who, was falfe and abfurd. 

This he faid, was an unaccountable Negle6t, and 
what God would certainly call them to Account 
for, and perhaps at laft take the Work out of their 
Hands. He fpoke this very aflfe&ionately and warm- 
ly. I am perfwaded, fays he, had thofe Men lived 
in the favage Country, whence their Wives came ; 
the Savages would have taken more Pains to have 
brought them to be Idolaters 5 and to worfliip the 
Devil, than any of thefe Men, fo far as he could fee, 
had taken with them to teach them the Knowledge 
of the true God, Now, Sir, faid he, tho* I do not 
acknowledge your Religion, or you mine, yet we 
fhould be giad to fee the Devil's Servants, and the 
Subjects of his Kingdom, taught to know the ge- 
neral Principles of the Chriftian Religion ,* that they 
might, at leaft, hear of God* and ot a Redeemer, 
and of the Refurre&ion, and of a future State 5 
Things which we all believe ; they had at leaft been 
fo much nearer coming into the Bofom of the true 
Church, than they are now in the publick Profeflion 
of Idolatry and Devil- Worfliip. 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my Arms, 
and embrae'd him with an Excefs of Paffion : How 
jar, faid I to him, have I been from underftanding 

I the 



[ I?°] 



the moft effential Part of a Chrifiian, (viz.) to love 
thelntereftof the Chrifiian Church, and the good 
of other Mens Souls ? I fcarcehave known what be- 
longs to being a Chrifiian. O, Sir, do not fay fo, re- 
plydhe, this Thing is not your Fault, No, fays 1, 
but why did I never lay it to Heart as well as you ? 
'Tis not too late yet, faid he, be not too forward to 
condemn yourfelf : But what can be done now, faid 
/, you fee I am going away ? Will you give me leave, 
/aid he j to talk with thofe poor Men about it ? Yes, 
with all my Heart 5 faid I> and will oblige them to 
give heed to what you fay too: As to that, faid he, 
we mufl leave them to the Mercy of Chrift ; but 
*ris our Bufinefs to affift them, encourage them, and 
inftrud them ; and if you will give me Leave, and 
God his Bleffing, I do not doubt but the poor igno- 
rant Souls fliall be brought home into the great Cir- 
cle of Chriflianity, if not into the particular Faith 
that we all embrace, and that even while you flay 
here: Upon this, I faid, I (hall not only give you 
Leave, but give you a thoufand Thanks for it. 
What follow ci on this Account, I fhall mention alfo 
again in its Place. 

I now prefs'd him for the third Article, in which 
wewereto'blame. Why really, fays he, it is of the 
fame Nature, and I will proceed, asking your Leave, 
with the fame Plainnefs as before; it is about your 
poor Savages yonder, who are, as I may fay, your 
conquer'd Subje&s It is a Maxim, Sir, that is, 
or ought to be received among all Chriflians of 
what Church, or pretended Church foever, (viz,.) 
That Chrifiian Knowledge ought to be propagated by all 
poffible Means, and on all poffible Occafions : *Tis on 
this Principle that our Church fends Miffionaries into 
Perfia, India, and China, and that our Clergy, even 
of the fupcrior Sort, willingly engage in the moft 
hazardous Voyages, and the moft dangerous Refi- 
dence among Murderers and Barbarians, to teach 

them 



[ lf« ] 

thenvthe Knowledge of the true God, and to bring 
them over to embrace the Chriftian Faith. Now, 
Sir, you have fuch an Opportunity here, to have fix 
or feven and Thirty poor Savages brought over 
from Idolatry to the Knowledge of God, their Ma- 
ker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pafs 
fuch an Occafion of doing Good, which is really 
worth the Expence of a Man's whole Life. 

I was now ftruck dumb indeed, and had not one 
Word to fay. I had here a Spirit of true Chriftian 
Zeal for God and Religion before me, let his par- 
ticular Principles be of what kind foever ; as for 
me, I had not fo much as entertain'd a Thought , 
of this in my Heart before, and I believe fhould not 
have thought of it ; for I look'd upon thefe Sava* 
ges as Slaves, and People, who, had we any Work 
tor them to do, we would ha* ufed as fuch, oc 
would have been glad to have tranfported them to 
any other Par: of the World; for our Bufinefs was 
to get rid of them, and we would all have been fa* 
tisfy'd, if they had been fent to any Country, fo they 
had never feen their own : But to the Cafe, I fay, t 
was confounded at his Difcourfe, and knew, noc 
what Anfwer to make him. He look'd earneftly at 
me, feeing me in fome Diforder; Sir, fays he, I ftiall 
be very forry, if what I have faid gives you any Of- 
fence : No, No, fays /, I am offended with no Body 
but myfelf ; but I am perfe&ly confounded, not on- 
ly to think that I fhould never take any Notice of 
this before, but with refle&ing what Notice I am a* 
ble to take of it now. You know, Sir, faid I, what 
Circumftances 1 am in, I am bound to the Eaft-Indies, 
ina-Ship freighted by Merchants, and to whom ic 
would be an unfufferabie Piece of Injuftice to detain 
their Ship here, the Men lying all this while at Vi- 
ctuals and Wages upon the Owners Account. It is 
true, I agreed to be allow'd twelve Days here, and 
if I ftay more, I ranft pay 3 /. Sterling per Dtem 



[ IJ1] 



Demorage, nor can I ftay upon Demorage above eight 
Days more, and I have been here thirteen Days al- 
ready, fo that I am perfe&ly unable to engage in this 
Work, unlefs I would fufter myfelf to be left behind 
here again, in which Cafe, if this (ingle Ship ftiould 
mifcarry in any Part of her Voyage, I ftiould be 
juft in the fame Condition chat I was left in here at 
firft, and from which I have been fo wonderfully de- 
livered. 

He own'd the Cafe was very hard upon me, as to 
my Voyage ; but laid it home upon my Conscience, 
whether the Bleffingof favingfeven and thirty Souls, 
was not worth my venturing all I had in the World 
for? I was not fo fenfible of that as he was, and I 
return'd upon him thus ; why, Sir, it is a valuable 
Thing, indeed, to be an Inftrument in God's Hand 
to convert feven and thirty Heathens to the Know- 
ledge of Ch rift, but as you are an Ecclefiaftic, and 
are giving over to that Work, fo that it feems na- 
turally to fall into the Way of your Profeffion ; how 
is it then, that you do not rather offer yourfe^fto 
undertake ir, than prels me to it ? 

Upon this he fac'd about, juft before me, as we 
walked along, and putting me to a full Stop, made 
me a very low Bow ; I moft heartily thank God and 
you, Sir, fay* he y for giving me fo evident a Call to 
fo blefled a Work; and if you think your felf dif- 
charg'd fiomit, and deiireme to undertake it, I will 
moft readily do it, and think it a happy Reward 
for ail the Hazards and Difficulties of fuch a bro- 
ken difappointed Voyage as I have met with, that 
I may dropt at laft into fo glorious a Work. 

I difcover'd a kind of Rapture in his Face while 
he fpoke this to me ; his Eyes fparkl'd [like Fire, his 
Face glow'd, and his Colour came and went, as if 
he had been falling into Fits; in a Word, he was 
fir'd with the Joy of being embarked in fuch a Work. 
Ipaus'da confiderable while before I could tell what 

to 



£■»»■] 

to fay to him, for I was really furpriz'd to find a 
Man of fuch Sincerity and Zeal, and carry 'd out in 
his Zeal beyond the ordinary Rate of Men, not 
of his Profeffion only, but even of any Profeffion what- 
soever. But after I had confider'd it a while, I ask'd 
himferioufly if he was in earned:, and that he would 
venture on the (ingle Confiderationof an Attempt on 
thole poor People, to beloc'd up in an implanted I- 
fland for, perhaps, his Life ; and at laft might not 
know whether he fhould be able to do them any 
Good, or not ? 

He turn'd fliort upon me, and ask'd me what I cal- 
led a Venture? Pray, Sir, faid he, what do think I 
confented to go in your Ship to the Eaft- Indies tor ? 
Nay,/W/, that I know not, unlefs it was to preach 
to the Indians: Doubtlefs it was faid he; and do 
you think, if I can convert thefe feven and thirty 
Men to the Faith of Chrift, it is not worth my 
time, tho' I fhould never be fetched off the Ifland 
again ? nay, is it not infinitely of more worth 
tofavefomany Souls, than my Life is, or the Life 
of twenty more of the fame Profeffion ? Yes, Sir, 
fays he, I would give Chrift and the Bleffed Virgin 
Thanks all my Days, if I could be made the leaft 
htippy Inftrument of faving the Souls of thefe poor 
Men, tho' I was never to fet my Foot off of this 
Ifland, or fee my native Country any more. But 
fince you will honour me, fays he, with putting 
me into this Work, for which 1 will pray for you all 
the Days of my Life h I have one humble Petition to 
you, faid he, befides. What is that, faid B Why, 
fays he, it is, that you will leave your Man Friday 
with me, to be my Interpreter to them, aud to affift 
me ; for without fome Help I cannot fpeaktothem, 
or they to me. 

I was fenfibly troubled at his requefting Friday, 
becaufe I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many Reafons ; he had been the Companion 

I 3 of 



[ 134] 



of my Travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
fincerely affectionate to the laft Degree; and I had 
refolv'd to do fomething confiderabie for him, if he 
out liv'd me, as is was probable he would. Then 
I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be a Prote- 
flant, it would quite confound him to bring him to 
embrace another Profeffion ; and he would never, 
while his Eyes were open, believe that his old Ma- 
tter was an Heretick and would be damn'd ; and 
this might in the End ruin the poor Fellow's Princi- 
ples, and fo turn him back again to his firft Idola- 
try. 

However, a fudden Though: reliev'd me in this 
Strait, and it was this; I told him, I could not 
fay that I was willing to part with Friday on any 
Account whatever; tho' a Work that to him was 
of more Value than his Life, ought to be to me of 
much more Value than the keeping or parting with, 
a Servant ,• But on the othej: hand, I was perfuad- 
cd that Friday would by no Means content to part 
with me, and I could not force him to it without 
hisConfent, would manifeft Injuflice j becaufe I had 
promifed I would never put him away, and he had 
promised and engag'dto me what he would never leave 
ine, un^efs I put him away. 

He feem'd very much concerned at it, for he had 
no rational Accefs to thefe poor People, feeing he 
did not underfland one Word of their Language, nor 
they one Word of his : To remove this Difficulty, I 
told him, Friday's Father had learn'd Spanifh, which 
I found he alfo underflood, and he fliould ferve him 
for an Interpreter ,• fo he was much better (ati fied, 
and nothing could perfuade him but he would fiay 
to endeavour to convert them ; but Providence gave 
another, and very happy. Turn to all this. 

I come back now to the firft Part of his Objecti- 
ons. When we come to the EngHjh Men, I fent 
for them all together, and after fome Account gi- 
ven 



[ 135 J 

ven them of what I had done for them, «fc. what 
neceflary Things I had provided for them and how 
they were diftfibuted, which they were ^fenfete or, 
and very thankful for j I began to talk to them ok 
the fcandalous Life they led, and gave the ma full 
Account of the Notice the Clergyman had already 
taken of it, and arguing -how *■*■**» ** ^ e re 
lieious a Life it was. 1 firft ask'd them if they were 
Sed Men or Batchelors > The, , foog ^explain d 
their Condition to me, and mew d me that two ot 
them were Widowers, and the other three were fin- 
Lie Men or Batchelors. I ask'd them with what 
Confciences they could take thefc^ Women and he 
with them, as they had done, call them their Wives, 
and have fo many Children by them, and not be 
marry'd lawfully to them. , . 

They all gave me the Anfwer that I «P^^' 
that there was no Body to marry them; that they 
agreed before the Governor to keep them as the 
Wives s and to keep them and own them as that 
Wives ; and they thought as Things .food ""J 
them, they were as legally married w u they had 
been married by a Parfon, and with all the torma 
lines in the World. .% • 

11 I told them, that no doubt they were mam dm 
the Sight of God, and were bound in Confcience 
o keep them as their Wives, but that the : Liwjof 
Men being otherwife, they might pretend they ^wcre 
not married, and fo de/ert the poor V^omen and 
Children hereafter; and that their Wives bung 
poor defolate Women, f«endlefs and »«W£ 
would have no way to help themfelves Jthewto* 
told them, that unlefs I was aflur'd of their houeft 
Intent. I could do nothing for them ; but ( would 
take Care that what I did mould be fo. the Wo 
men and their Children without them ; and that ^n 
kfs they would give fome Atfurances that they wcwW 
marry the Women, I could not think it was conve

nient they fhould coutinue together as Man and 
Wife,^ for that it was both fcandalous to Men, and 
cffenfive to God, who they could think would blefs 
them, if they went on thus. 

All this went on as I expe&ed, and they told me, 
efpecially Will. Atkins, who feem'd now to fpeak for 
the reft, that they lov'd their Wives as well, as if 
they had been born in their own Native Country, 
and would not leave them upon any Account whac- 
ever ; and they did verily believe their Wives were 
as virtuous and as modeft, and did, to the utmoft 
of their Skill, as much for them, and for their Chil- 
dren, as any Women could poffibly do, and they 
would not part with them on any Account : And 
Will Atkins for his own particular added, if any Man 
would take him away, and offer to carry him home 
to England, and make him Captain of the beft Man 
of War in the Navy, he would not go with him, if 
he might not carry his Wife and Children with 
him ,• and if there was a Clergyman in the Ship, he 
would be married to her now, with all his Heart. 

This was juft as I would have it \ the Prieft was 
not with me at that Moment, but was not far off: 
So to try him farther, I told him I had a Clergyman 
with me, and it he was fincere, I would have him 
married the next Morning, and bid him consider of 
it, and talk with the reft; he faid, as for himfelf, 
he need not confider of it at all, for he was very 
ready to do it, and was glad I had a Minifterwith 
me, and he believ'd they would be all willing alio. 
I then told him, that my Friend the Minifter was 
a French Man, and could not fpeak Englifb, but that 
1 would aft the Clerk between them : He never fo 
much as ask'd me whether he was a Papift or Pro- 
teftant, which was indeed what I was afraid of: 
But, I fay, they never enquired about it. So we 
parted, I went back to my Clergyman, and Will 
Atkins went in to talk with h;'s Companion*. J de- 
fied 



[ i37 ] 

fir'd the French Gentleman not to fay any thing 
to them, till the Bufinefs was thorough ripe, and 
I told him what Anfwer the Men had given me. 

Before I went from their Quarter, they all came 
to me, and told me, they had been confidering what 
I had faid •, that they were very glad to hear I had 
a Clergyman in my Company, and they were ve- 
ry willing to give me the Satisfaction I defir'd, 
and to be formally married as foon as I pleas'd, 
for they were far from defiring to part with their 
Wives, and that they meant nothing but what 
was very honeft when they chofe them •, fo I ap- 
pointed them to meet me the next Morning, and 
that in the mean time they {hould let their Wives 
knew the meaning cf the Marriage-Law 5 and that 
it was not only to prevent any Scandal, but alfo 
to oblige them, that they {hould not forfake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The Women were ealily made fenfible cf the 
Meaning of the Thing, and were very well Fatisfied 
with it, as, indeed, they had Reafon to be •, fo they 
fail'd not to attend all together at my Apartment 
the next Morning, where I brought out my Clergy- 
man •, and tho : he had not on a Minifter's Gown, 
after the Manner of England, or the Habit of a 
Pneft, after the Manner of France-, yet having a 
black Veft femething like a Caflbck, with a Safti 
round it, he did not look very unlike a Minifter-, 
and as for his Language, I was his Interpreter. 

But the Serioufnefs of his Behaviour to them, 
and the Scruples he made of marrying the Women, 
becaufe they were not baptiz VI, and profefs'd Qm- 
ftiam, gave them an exceeding Reverence for his 
Perfon 5 and there was no need after that, to en- 
quire whether he was a Clergyman or no. 

Indeed, I was afraid his Scruple would have 
been carry'd fo far, as that he would not have 
marry'd them at all ^ nay, notwithftanding all I 
Was able to fay to him, he refilled me, though 

modeftly, 



modeftly, j^et very fteadily, and at laft refufed ab- 
folutcly to marry them, unlefs he had firft talk'd 
with the Men, and the Women too 5 and though 
at firft I was a little backward to it, yet at laft I 
agreed to it with a good Will, perceiving the Sin- 
cerity ofhisDefign. 

When he came to them, he let them know, that 
I had acquainted him with their CIrcumftances, and 
with the prefent Pefigiv. That he was very willing 
to perform that Part of his Function, and marry 
them as I had defir'd •, but that before he could do 
it, he muft take the Liberty to talk witli them. 
He told them, That in the Sight of all indifferent 
Men, and in the Senfe of the Laws of Society, 
they had liv'd all this while in an open Adulte- 
ij 1 and that it was true, that nothing but the 
Confenting to many, or effectually feparating them 
from one another now, could put an End to it -, but, 
there was a Difficulty in it too, with refpedt to the 
Laws of Chrijlian Matrimony, which he was not 
fully fatisfy'd about, viz. That of marrying one 
that is a profefs'd Chriflicm, to a Savage, an Ido- 
later, and a Heathen, one that is not baptiz'd 5 and 
yet that he did not fee that there was Time left for 
it to endeavour to perfuade the Women to be bap- 
tized, or to profefs the Name of Chrift, whom they 
had., he doubted, heard nothing of, and without 
which they could not be baptized. 

He told them, He doubted they were but indif- 
ferent Chiiftians themfelves * that they had but lit- 
tle Knowledge of God, or of his Ways •, and there- 
fore he could not expeft that they had faid much 
to their Wives on that Head yet* but that unlefs 
they would promife him to ufe their Endeavours 
with their Wives, to perfuade them to become Chri- 
stians, and would as well as they could inftrud 
them in the Knowledge and Belief of God that 
made them, and to woi'fhip Jefus Chrift that re- 
deem^ them, he could not marry them-, for he 

would 



would have no Hand in joyning Chriftians with 
Savages 5 nor was it confident with the Principles 
of the Chriftian Religion 5 and was indeed expref* 
ly forbidden in God's Law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I deli- 
vered it very faithfully to them, from his Mouth, as 
near his own Words as I could, only fometimes ad- 
ding fomethihg of my own to convince them how 
311ft it was, and how I was of his Mind 5 and I al- 
ways very faithfully diftinguilh'd between what 
I faid from my felf,and what were the Clergyman's 
Words. They told me, it was very true, what the 
Gentleman had faid, that they, were but very in- 
different Cbriftiatis themfelves, and that they had 
never talk'd to their Wives about Religion. Lord, 
Sir ! fays Will. Atkitis, How ftiould we teach them 
Religion^ Why we know nothing our felves-, and 
befides, Sir, faid he, fhould we go to talk to them 
of Go d, and Jefus Chrijl, and Heaven and He//, 'twould 
be to make them laugh at us, and ask us, What 
we believe our felves > And if we fhould tell them 
we believe all the Things that we fpeak of to them, 
fuch as of good People going to Heaven, and wick- 
ed People to the Devil, they would ask us, Where 
we intended to go our felves, that believe all this, 
and are fuch wicked Fellows, as we indeed are > 
Why, Sir, faid Will, 'tis enough to give them a 
Surfeit of Religion at firft Hearing : Folks muft 
have fome Religion themfelves, before they pre- 
tend to teach other People : Will Atkins, faid I to 
Vim 1 though I am afraid what you fay has too 
much Truth in it, yet can you not tell your Wife 
that ftie's in the wrong ? That there is a God and 
a Religion better than her own 5 that her Gods 
are Idols, that they can neither hear nor fpeak ^ 
that there is a great Being that made all Things, 
and that can deftroyall that he had made-, that 
he rewards the Good, and pumfhes the Bad h and 
that we are to be judged by him at laftfor all we 

do 



r ho ] 

do here : You are not fo ignorant, but even Na- 
ture it felf will teach you that all this is true, and 
I amfatisfy'dyouknowit all to be true, and be- 
lieve it yourfelf. 

That's true, Sir, faid Atkins ; but with what Face 
can I fay any thing to my Wife of all this, when 
Ihe will tell me immediately it cannot be true> 

Not true ! faid I, What do )^ou mean by that ? 
Why Sir, faid he, She will tell me it cannot be 
true, that this God I fhall tell her of can be juft, 
or can punifh, or reward, flnce I am not puniih'd, 
and fent to the Devil, that have been fitch', a 
wicked Creature as ihe knows I have been, even 
to her, and to every Body e'ife • and that I fhould 
be fuffer'd to live, that have been always aftirg fo 
contrary to what I mnft tell her is Good, and to 
what I ought to have done, 

Why, truly, Atkim, faid J, I am afraid thou 
fpeak'ft too much Truth 5 and with that I let the 
Clergyman know what Atkins had faid, for he was 
impatient to know: 0! faid the Briefly tell him 
there is one Thing will make him the beft Minifter 
in the World to his Wife, and that is, Repentance • 
for none teach Repentance like true Penitents : He 
wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be 
fo much the better qualifv'd to inftruct his Wife : 
He will be then able to tell her, that there is not 
only a God, and that he is the 311ft Rewarder of 
Good and Evil, but that he is a merciful Being, 
and with infinite Goodnefs and Long-fuffering for- 
bears to punilh thofe that offend •, waiting to be 
gracious, and willing not the Death of a Sinner, 
but rather that he fhould return and live •, that 
oftentimes fuffers wicked Men to go on a long 
Time, and even referves Damnation to the gene- 
ral Day of Retribution -, that it is a clear Evi- 
dence of God, and of a future State, that righteous 
Men receive not their Reward, or wicked Men 
their Punifhment, till they come into another 

World 5 



[ Hi 1 



World; and this will lead him to teach his Wife 
the Do&rine of the Refurrection, and of the laft 
Judgment ; let him but repeat for himfelf, he will 
be an excellent Preacher of Repentance to his 
Wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who look'd veryfe- 
rious all the while, and who, we could eafily perceive, 
was more than ordinarily afte&ed with it : When be- 
ing eager, and hardly fuffeting me to make an End, 
I know all this, Mafter, fays he, and a great deal more > 
but I har/t the Impudence to talk thus to my Wife i 
when God, and my own Confcience knows, and my 
Wife will be an undeniable Evidence againft me, 
that I haveliv'd, as if I had never heard of a God, 
or future State, or any Thing about it ; and to talk 
of mvrepenring, ALAS! And with that he fetctid a 
deep Sigh ; and I could fee, that Tears flood in his 
Eyes; 'Tis paft ail that with me. Paft it ! AT- 
K I N S, /aid 7, What do'ft thou mean by that ? I 
kno'vv well enough what I mean, Sir, fays he, I mean 
'tis too late, and that is too true. 

I told my Clergyman Word for Word what he 
faid ; the poor zealous Prieft (I muft call him fo m y for, 
be his Opinion what it will, he had certainly amoft 
Angular Affedion for the Good of other Mens Souls > 
and it would be hard to think he had not the like 
for his own) I fay, this zealous affe&ionate Man, 
could not refrain Tears alfo : But, recovering him- 
felf, he faid to me, ask him but one Queftion, Is he 
eafy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wifhes 
it were not fo ? I put the Queftion fairly to Atkins, 
and he anfwered with a great deal of Paflion, How 
could any Man be eafy in a Condition that certainly 
muft end in eternal Deftru&ion? that he was farfrom 
being eafy, but that on the contrary, he believ'd it 
would one Time or other ruin him. 

What do you mean by that? faid I, Why, he faid 
he belie v'd he fhould, one Time or other, cut his 
Throat to put an End to the Terror of it- 

" " . The 



[ 142. ] 

The Clergyman Ciook his Head with a great Con- 
cern in his Face* when I told him ail this : but turn- 
ing quick to me upon it, fays he, If that be his Cafe, 
you may aflfure him it is not too late ; Chrift will 
give him Repentance : But pray, fays he, explain 
this to him. That as no Man is fav'd but by Chrift 
and the Merit of his Paffion, procuring divine Mercy 
for him, how can it be too late for any Man to re- 
ceive Mercy ? Does he think he is able to lin beyond 
the Power or Reach of Divine Mercy ? Pray tell 
him, there may be a Time when provok'd Mercy 
will no longer ftrive, and when God may refufe to 
hear,*but that 'tis never too late for Men to ask Mer- 
cy i and we that are Chrift's Servants are commanded 
to preach Mercy at all times, in the Name of Jefus 
Chrift, to allthofe thatfincerely repent ; fo that 'tis ne- 
ver too late co repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
Earneftnefs ; but it feem'd as if he turned off the Dif- 
courfe to the reft ; for he faid to me, he would go 
and have feme Talk with his Wife 5 fo he went out 
awhile, and we talked to the reft. I perceived they 
were all ftupidly ignorant as to Matters of Religion; 
much as I was when I went rambling away frcm m y 
Father ; and yet that there were none of them back- 
ward to hear what had been faid ; and all of them fe- 
rioufly promiVd that they would talk with their Wives 
about it, and do their Endeavour to perfuade them to 
turn Chriftians. 

The Clergyman fmird upon me, when I reported 
what Anfwer they gave, but faid nothing a good 
while ; but, at laft y fhaking his Head, We that are 
Chrift's Servants, fays he, can go on further than to 
exhort and inftruft 5 and when Men comply, fubmit 
to the Reproof, and promife what w r e ask 'tis all we 
can do ; we are bound to accept their good Words ; 
But believe me, Sir, faid he, whatever you may have 
known of the Life of that Man you cail WiU. Atkins, 

I be- 



[ 143 ] 

I believe he is the only fincere Convert among them ; 
I take that Man to be a true Penitent ; I wont defpaic 
of the reft ; but that Man is patiently ftruck with 
the Senfe of his paft Lite ; and I doubt not, but when 
he comes to talk religion to his Wife, he will talk 
himlelf effeftualiy into it ; for attempting to teach o- 
thers, is fometimes the beft way of teaching ourfelves I 
knew a Man, added he, who having nothing but a Num- 
mary Notion of Religion himfelf, and being wicked 
and profligate to the laft Degree in his Life, made a 
thorough Reformation in himfelf, by labouring to 
convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins but once 
to talk feriouflv of Jefus Chrift to his Wife, my Life 
for it, he talks himfelf into a thorough Convert, 
makes himfelf a Penitent : And who knows what may 
follow ? 

Upon this Difcourfe however, and their promifing, 
as above, ro endeavour to perfuade their Wives to 
embrace Chriftianity, he marry 5 d the other three 
Couple ; but Will Atkins and his Wife were not yet 
come in. After this, my Clergyman, waiting a while, 
was curious to know were Atkins was gone ; and, 
turning to me, fays be, I entreat you, Sir, let us walk 
out of your Labyrinth here, and look ; I dare fay, 
we (ball find this poor Man fomewhere or other talk- 
ing ferioufly to his Wife, and teaching her already 
fomething of Religion. I began to be of the fame 
Mind j fo we went out together, and I carry u him 
a Way which none knew but my felf, and where the 
Trees were fo thick fet, as that it was not eafy to 
fee thro' the Thicket of Leaves, and far harder to 
fee in, than to fee out ; when, coming to the Edge of 
the Wood, I faw Atkins and his tawny Savage 
Wife fitting under the Shade of a Bufti, very eager 
in Difcourfe ; I ftop'd fhort tillrny Clergymen came 
up to me; and then having fhow'd him where they 
were, we flood and look'd very fteadily at them a 
good while. 



[ H4 ] 



We obferv'd him very earneft with her, pointing 
up to the Sun, and to every Quarter of the Heavens ; 
then down to the Earth, then out to the Sea, then 
to himfeH, then to her, to the Woods, to the Trees. 
Now, fays my Clergyman, you fee my Words are 
made good ; the Man preaches to her ; mark him, 
now he is telling her, that our God has made him, 
and her, and the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, the 
Woods, the Trees, &c. I believe he is, faid I ; im- 
mediately we percetVd Will Atkins flart up upon his 
Feet, fall down on his Knees, and lift up both his 
Hands : We fuppofe he faid fomething, but we 
could not hear him, it was too far for that; he di^l 
not continue kneeling half a Minute, but comes tfnd 
fits down again by his Wife, and talks to her again. 
We perceived then the Women very attentive, but 
whether fhe faid any thing or no we could not tell, 
while the poor Fellow was upon his Knees, I could 
fee the Tears run plentifully down my Clergyman's 
Cheeks, and I could hardly forbear my felt ; but it 
was a great AfRi&ion to us both, that we were not 
near enough to hear any Thing that pafs'd between 
them. 

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear 
ofdifturbing them, fo we refolv'd to fee an End of 
this Piece of fliU Converfauon, and it fpoke loud 
enough to us, without the Help of Vo ce. He 
fat down again, as I have faid, clofe by her, and 
talked again earneftly to her; and two or three 
Times we could fee him embrace her moft paffio- 
nately ; another timewefaw him takeout his Hand- 
kerchief and wipe her Eyes, and then kifs her again, 
with a kind of Tranfport very unufual ; and after fe- 
veral of thefe Things we fee him, on afudden, jump 
up again and lend her his Hand to help her up, 
when immediatly, leading her by the Hand a Step 
or two, they both kneefd down together, and conti- 
nual fo about two Minutes. 

My 



C 145 3 



My Friend could bear ic no longer, but cries out 
aloud, St. P A UL St. PAUL! behold he prayeth ; 
I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I en- 
treated him to withhold himfelf awhile, that we 
might fee an End of the Scene, which to me, I 
rauft confefsj was the mod affefcing, and yet the 
moft agreeable that ever 1 faw in my Life ; Well, 
he drove with himfelf and contained himfelf for a 
while, bur was in fuch Raptures of Joy, to think that 
the poor Heathen Woman was become a Chriftian, 
that he was not able to contain himfelf; he wept fe- 
veral Times, then throwing up his Hands and croffing 
his Breaft, faid over feveral Things Ejaculatory and 
by way of giving God Thanks for fo miraculous a 
Teflimony of theSuccefs of our Endeavours ; fomc 
he fpoke foftly, and I could not well hear ; others 
audibly, fome in Latin, fome in French ; then two ot 
three Times the Tears of Joy would interrupt him, 
that he could not fpeak at all : But I beg'd that he 
would compofe himfelf, and let us more narrowly and 
fully obferve what was before us, which he did 
for a Time, and the Scene was not ended there 
yet ; for after the poor Man and his Wife were tir 
fen again from their Knees, we obferv'd he flood 
talking ftiil eagerly to her; and we obferv'd by her 
Motion, that (he was greatly affe&ed with what 
he faid, by her frequent lifting up her Hands, lay- 
ing her Hand to her Breaft, and fuch other Pof- 
tures, as ufually exprefs the greateft Serioufnefs 
and Attention. This continued about half a Quar- 
ter of an Hour, and then they walked away too ; 
fo that we could iee no more of them in that Si- 
tuation. 

I took this interval to talk with my Clergyman i 
And firft, I told him, I was glad to fee the Parti- 
culars we had both been Witnelfes to ; that tho* I 
was hard enough of Belief in fuch Cafes, y6t 
that I began to think it was all very fincere here, 

R both 



[ 14* ] 

both in the Man and his Wife, however ignorant 
they might both be •, and I hop'dfuch a Beginning 
would have a yet more happy End-, and who 
knows, faid I, but thefe two may in Time, by In- 
ftru&ion and Example, work upon fome of the 
others > Some of them ! faid he, turning quick upon 
me, ay, upon all of them h depend upon it, if thofe 
two Savages, for he has been but little better, as 
you relate it, fhould embrace Jefus Chrift, they 
will never leave 'till they work upon all the reft ^ 
for true Religion is naturally communicative, and 
he that is once made a Chriftian, will never leave 
a Pagan behind him, if he can help it. I own'd 
it was a moft Chriftian Principle to think fo, and 
a Teftimony of a true Zeal, as well as a generous 
Heart in him; But, my Friend, faid I, will you 
give me Leave to ftart one Difficulty here ? I can- 
not tell how to object the leaft Thing againft that 
affe&ionate Concern, which you (hew for the turn- 
ing the poor People from their Paganifm to the 
Chriftian Religion : But how does this comfort 
you, while thefe People are in your Account out 
of the Pale of the Catholick Church, without 
which you believe there is no Salvation -, fo that 
3^ou efteem thefe but Hereticks, and for other 
Reafons as effectually loft as the Pagans them- 
felves. 

To this he anfwer'd with abundance of Candor 
and Chriftian Charity thus •, .Sir, I am a Catholick 
of the Roman Church, and a Prieft of the Order 
of St. BenediB, and I embrace all the Principles of 
the Roman Faith : But yet if you will believe me, 
and that I do not fpeah in Compliment to yon, or in 
refpeB to my Circumftances and your Civilities^ I 
fay, neverthelefs, I do not look upon you, who call 
your felves reform'd, without fome Charity : I 
dare not fay, tho' I know it is our Opinion in general •, I 

fey, 



fay, I dare not fay that you cannot be fav'd • I will 
by no Means limit the Mercy of Chrift fo far, as 
to think that he cannot receive you into the 
Bofom of his Church in a Manner to us unpercei- 
vable, and which it is fimpoilible for us to know ^ 
and I hope 3^011 have the lame Charity for us •, I 
pray daily for your being all reftor'd to Chrift's 
Church, by \vhatfoever Methods he, who is All- 
wife, is pleas'd to direct : In the mean Time, fure 
you will allow it to confift with me, as a Roman., 
to diftinguifti far between a Proteftant and a Pa- 
gan •, between one that calls on Jefus Chrift, tho' 
in a Way which I do not think is according to the 
true Faith : and a Savage, a Barbarian, that knows 
no God, no Chrift, no Redeemer at all •, and if 
you are not within the Pale of the Catholick 
Church, we hope you are nearer being reftor'd to 
it than thofe that know nothing at all, of God or 
his Church : I rejoice therefore when I fee this poor 
Man, who you fay has been a Profligate, and al- 
moft a Murderer, kneel down and pray to Jefus 
Chrift, as we fuppofe he did, tho 5 not fully en- 
lightened ^ believing that God, from whom every 
fuch Work proceeds, will fenfibly touch his Heart, 
and bring him to the further Knowledge of the 
Truth in his own Time and if God {hall influence 
this poor Man to convert and inftruft the ignorant 
Savage his Wife, I can never believe that he fhall 
be caft away himfelf •, and have I not Reafon then 
to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the Know- 
ledge of Chrift, tho 5 they may not be brought quite 
home into the Bofom of the Catholick Church, 
jttft at the time when I may deflre it ? leaving it 
to the Goodnefs of Chrift to perfeft his Work in 
his own time, and his own Way : Certainly I would 
rejoice if all the Savages in America were brought 
like this poor Woman to pray to God, tho' they 
K 2 " wef£ 



[ 148] 

were to be all Protectants at firft, rather than they 
ftiould continue Pagans and Heathens •, firmly be- 
lieving, that he that had beftow'd that firft Light 
to them, would further illuminate them with a 
Beam of his heavenly Grace, and bring them in- 
to the Pale of his Church when he fhould fee 
good. 

I was aftonifh'd at the Sincerity and Temper of 
this truly pious Papift, as much as I was opprefs'd 
by the Power of his Reafoning •, and it prefently 
occur'd to my Thoughts, that if fuch a Temper 
was univerfal, we might be all Gatholick Chrifti- 
ans > whatever Church or particular Profeflion we 
join'd to, or join'd in •, that a Spirit of Charity 
would foon work us all up into right Principles *, 
and in a Word, as he thought that the like Charity 
would make us all Catholicks, fo I told him I be- 
liev 5 d,j had all the Members of his Church the like 
Moderation, they would foon be all Proteftants^ 
And there we left that Part, for we never difputed 
at all. 

However, I talk'd to him another way, and ta- 
iling him by the Hand, my Friend, fays I, I wifh all 
the Clergy of the Roman Church were bleft with 
fuch Moderation, and had an equal Share of your 
Charity. I am entirely of your Opinion ^ but I 
muft tell you, that if you Ihould preach fuch Do- 
ctrine in Spain, or Italy, they would put you into 
the Inquijhion. 

It may be fo, faid he, I know not what they 
might do in Spain or Italy, but I will not fay they 
would be the better Chriftians for that Severity, 
for I am fure there is no Herefy in too much Cha- 
rity. 

Well, as Will Atkins and his Wife were gone, our 
Bufinefs there was over •, fo we wept bark our own 
Way^ and when we came back, we found them 

waiting 



C 149 ] 

waiting to be call'd in : Obferving this, I ask'd my 
Clergyman if we fhould difcover to him that we 
had feen him under the Bufh, or no ^ and it was 
his Opinion we fhould not •, but that we fhould 
talk to him firft, and hear what he would fay to 
us •, fo we calPd him in alone, no Body being 
in the Place but our felves •, and I began with him 
thus : 

Will Atlim, faid I, prithee what Education had 
you ? What was your Father > 

W. A. A better Man than ever I {hall be- Sir, 
my Father was a Clergyman. 

R. C What Education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir-, but 
I defpis'd all Education, Inftru&ion, or Correftion, 
like a Beaft as I was. 

R. C. It's true, Solomon fays, he that defpifes Re- 
proof is brutijh. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutifh, indeed, I murder'd 
my Father •, for God's fake Sir, talk no more about 
that, Sir, I murder'd my poor Father. 

Pr. Ha! a Murderer!* 

* Here the Prieft ftarted (for I interpreted every 
Word as he fpoke it) and looVi pale. Itfeems 
he believ'd that Will had really kilVd his own 
Father^ 

R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not underftand him fo ^ 
Will Atkins, explain yourfelf, you did not kill your 
Father, did you, with your own Hands > 

W. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his Throat-, but I 
cut the Thread of all his Comforts, and fhorten'd his 
Days •, I broke his Heart by the moft ungrateful un- 
natural Return, for the moft tender affectionate 
Treatment that ever Father gave, or' Child could 
receive.

R. C Well, I did not ask you about your Father 
to extort this Confeflion •, I pray God give you 
Repentance for it, and forgive you that, and all 
your other Sins j but I asVd you, becaufe I fee, 
that tho' you have not much Learning, yet you are. 
not fo ignorant as fome are, in Things that are 
Good \ that you have known more of Religion a 
great deal than you have practifed. 

If. A. Tho 5 you, Sir, did not extcrt the Con- 
feifion that I make aKmt my Father, Confcience 
does-, and when ever we come to look back up- 
on our Lives, the Sins againft our indulgent Fa- 
rents are certainly the firft that touch us •, the 
Wounds they make lie deepeft, and the Weight 
they leave will lie heavieft upon the Mind, of 
all the Sins we can commit. 

K. C. You talk too feelingly and fenfibly for 
me AtYins-, I cannot bear it. 

W. A. You bear it, Mafter ! I dare fay you know 
nothing of it. 

JR. C Yes, Atkins every Shore, every Hill, nay, 
I may fay, every Tree in this Ifland is witnefs 
to the Anguifh of my Soul, for my Ingratitude 
and bafe Ufage of a good tender Father •, a Father 
much like yours, by your Description •, and I mur- 
dered my Father as well as you, W\\\ Atkins. •, but 
think, for all that, my Repentance is {hort of 
3^ours too* by a great deal. 

* I would have faid more, if I could have 
rejtraht'd my Pajjions •, but I thought this 
poor Man's Repentance was fo much fince- 
rer than mire, that I was going to leave 
off the Difcourfe and retire, for I was 
furpriz'd with what he faid $ and thought, 
that inflead of my going about tQ teach 

and 



[ 1*1 ] 

and inftruB him, the Man was made a 
Teacher and InJlmBer to me, in a mojl 
fiiryrizing and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young Clergyman, 
who was greatly affedted with it, and faid to 
me, Did I not fay, Sir, that when this Man was 
converted, he would preach to us all > I tell you, 
Sir, if this one Man be made a true Penitent, 
here will be no need of me, he will make Chri- 
ftians of all in the Ifland. But having a little 
compos'd my felf, I renew'd my Difcourfe with 
Will Atkins. 

But WILL, faid I, How comes the Senfe of this 
Matter to touch you juft now > 

W. A. Sir, you have fet me about a Work that 
has ftruck a Dart thro* my very Soul •, I have 
been talking about God and Religion to my 
Wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a 
Chriftian of her, and {he has preach'd fuch a 
Sermon to me, as I {hall never forget w r hile I 
live. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your Wife has preach'd 
to you-, but when you were moving religious Ar- 
guments to her, Confcience has flung them back 
upon you. 

W. A. Ay, Sir, with fuch a Force as is not to 
fee refilled. 

R. C Pray Will, let us know what pafs'd be- 
tween you and your Wife, for I know fomething 
of it already. 

W. A. Sir, it is impoffible to give you a full 
Account of it -, I am too full to hold it, and yet 
have no Tongue to exprefs it •, but let her have 
faid what {he will, and tho' I cannot give you an 
Account cf it, this I can tell you of it, that I re* 
folve to amend and reform my Life, 

K 4 R. C 



[ *5V] 

R. C. But tell us fome cf it. How did you be- 
gin Will ? For this has been an extraordinary Cafe, 
that's certain. She has preach'd a Sermon, indeed, 
if Ihe has wrought this upon you. 

W. A. Why, I firft told her the Nature of our 
Laws about Marriage, and what the Reafons were, 
that Men and Women were oblig'd to enter into 
fuch Compacts, as it was neither in the Power of 
one or other to break *, that otherwife, Order and 
Juftice could not be maintained, and Men would 
run from their Wives, and abandon their Chil- 
dren, mix confufedly with one another, and nei- 
ther Families be kept entire, or Inheritances be 
fettled by legal Defcent. 

JR. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will •, could you 
make her underftand what you meant by Inheri- 
tance and Families? they know no fuch Thing, 
among the Savages, but marry any how, without 
regard to Relation, Confanguinity, or Family-, 
Brother and Sifter-, nay, as I have been told-, 
even the Father and Daughter, and Son and the 
Mother. 

W. A. I believe, Sir, you are mifinform'd, and 
my Wife allures me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it •, perhaps, for any farther ReJations they 
may not be fo exa£t as we are •, but {he tells me 
they never touch one another in the near Relations 
you fpeak of. 

R. C Well, what did {he fay, to what you 
told her. 

W. A. She faid, {he lik'd it very well, and it 
was much better than in her Country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what Marriage 
was? 

W. A. Ay, 'ay, there began all our Dialogue. 
I ask'd her If lhe would be marry'd to me our 

Way? 



[ *« ] 

Way ? She ask'd me what Way that was ? I told 
her that Marriage was appointed of God ^ and here 
we had a ftrange Talk together, indeed, as ever 
Man and Wife had I believe. 

N. B. This Dialogue between W. Atkins and 
his Wife, as I took it down in writing, 
juft after he told it me, was as follows. 

Wzfe : Appointed by your God \ why have you 
3 God in your Country > 

W. A. Yes, my Rear, God is in every Coun- 
try. 

Wife. No, your God in my Country -, my Coun- 
try have the great old Benamnckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to fhew you 
who God is-, God is in Heaven, and made the 
Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in 
them is # 

Wife. No makee de Earth-, no, you God make 
Ear no make my Country. * 

* W. A. laughed a little at her Expr$on of 
God not making her Country. 

Wife. No Laugh, why Laugh me? This no 
Thing to Laugh. + 

+ Tie watjnftly reprov'd by his Wife, for fie 
was more ferious than he at frft* 

W. A. That's true indeed, I will not laugh any 
more my Dear. 

Wife. Why you fay, you God make all. 

W. A. Yes, Child, our God made the whole 
World, and you, and I, and all Things -, for he 

is 



[ 154 ] 

is the only true God, there is no God but him, 
he lives for ever in Heaven. 

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true indeed, but I have been a 
wicked Wretch, and have not only forgotten to 
acquaint thee with any Thing before, but have 
lived without God in the World my felf. 

Wife. What have you de great God in you 
Country, you no kno' kno' him ? No fay O to him > 
No do good Thing for him? That no poffible ! 

W. A. It is too true, tho 5 for all that, we live 
as if there was no God in Heaven, or that he had 
no Power on Earth. 

Wife. But why, God let you do fo? Why he 
no makee you good live. 

W. A. It is all our own Fault. 

Wife. But you fay me, he is Great, much Great, 
have much great Power •, can makee kill, when he, 
will •, why he no makee kill when you no ferve 
him ? No fay O to him> No be good Mans. 

W. A. That is true •, he might ftrike me Dead, 
and I ought to expcdt it, for I have been a wick- 
ed Wretch, that is true-, but God is merciful, and 
does not deal with us as we deferve. 

Wife. But then, do no you tell God Tankee 
for that too. 

W. A. No, indeed, I have not thankM God 
for his Mercy, any more than I have fear'd God 
for his Power. 

Wife. Than you God no God-, me no think, 
believe, he be fuch one, great much Power, Strong ^ 
no makee kill you tho 5 you makee him much 
Angry. 

W. A. What > Will my wicked Life hinder you 
from believing in God ! what a dreadful Creature 
am I ! and what a fad Truth is it, that the horrid 
Lives of Chriftians hinders the Conversions of Hea- 
thens? 

Wife; 



[ 155 ] 

Wife. How me tink you have great much God 
•V up there, and yet no do well, no do good Ting ? 
can he tell ? Sure he no tell what you do ? 

t She joints tip to Heaven. 

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and fees all Things •, 
he hears us {peak, fees what we do, knows what 
we think, tho' we do not fpeak. 

Wife. What ! he no hear you fwear, curfe, fpeak 
the great Damn ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

W. Where be then the muchee great Power 
ftrong ? 

W. A. He is merciful, that's all we can fay for 
it -, and this proves him to be the true God •, he is 
God and not Man j and therefore we are not con- 
fum'd. t 

t Here Will Atkins told tis he was ftruck with 
Horror, to think how he could tell his Wife fo 
clearly that God fees, and hears, and knows 
the fecret Thoughts of the Heart, and all that 
we do •, and yet that he had dar'd to do all th& 
vile Things he had done. 

Wife. Merciful ! what you call that ? 
m W. A. He is our Father and Maker, and he pi- 
ties and fpares us. 

Wife, So then he never makee kill, never angry 
when you do wicked ^ then he no good himfelf, or 
no great able. 

W. A. Tes y yes, my Dear, he is infinitely good , 
and infinitely great, and able to punifh too •, and 
fometimes to {hew his Juftice and Vengeance, he 
lets fly his Anger to deftroy Sinners, and make 
Examples j many are cut off in their Sins. 

Wife, 



[ I5<* ] 

Wife. But no makee kill you yet, than he tell 
you way be that he no make you kill, fo you make 
de Bargain with him, you do bad Thing, he no 
be angry at you, when he be angry at other 
Mans. 

W. A. No indeed, my Sins are all Preemp- 
tions upon his Goodnefs \ and he would be infi- 
nitely juft if he deftroy'd me as he has done other 
Men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead, 
what you fay to him for that, you no tell him 
Tankee for all that too ? 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful Dog, 
that's true. 

Wife. Why he no makee ycu much good better, 
you fay he makee you. 

W. A. He made me as he made all the World ^ 
'tis I have deform'd my felf, and abus'd his Good- 
nefs, and made my felf an abominable Wretch. 

Wife. I wilh you makee God know me, 1 no 
makee him angry, I no do bad wicked thing. 

Here Will Atkins faid his Heart funk within 
him, to hear a poor untaught Creature de- 
fire to be taught to know God, and he fitch 
Of wicked wretch, that he could not fay one 
word to her about God, but what the Re- 
proach of his own Carriage would make mofi 
irrational to her to believe ♦, nay, that al- 
ready fie had told him, that fie could not 
believe in God, becaufe he that was fo wick- 
ed was not defirofd. 

W. A. My Dear, you mean, you with I could 
I teach you to know God, not God to know you •, 
for he knows you already, and every Thought in 
your Heart. 

Wife. 



C 157 ] 

Wife. Why then he know what I fay to »you 
now > He know me wifh to know him •, how fhall 
me know who makee me ? 

W. A. Poor Creature, he muft teach thee, 4 I 
cannot teach thee •, 111 pray to him to teach thee 
to know him, and to forgive me that I am un- 
worthy to teach thee. 

The poor Fellow was in fucb an Agony at her 
dejiring him to male her know God, and her 
mfiitig to know him, that, he faid, he fell 
down on his Knees before her-, and prafd to 
God to enlighten her Mind with the faving 
Knowledge of Jefus Chrift^ and to pardon his 
Sins, and accept of his being the unworthy In- 
jlriiment ofinjlruBing her in the Principles of 
Religion •, after which he fate down by her 
again, and their Dialogue went on. N. B. 
This was the Time when we faw him 
kneel down, and lift up his Hands, 

Wife, What you put down the Knee for ? What 
you hold up the Hand for ? What you fay ? Who 
you fpeak to > What is that ? 

W. A. My Dear, I bow my Knees in Token of 
my Submiilion to him that made me 5 I faid O to 
him, as you call it, and as you fay, your old Men 
do to their Idol Benamucfae h that is, I pray'd to 
him. 

Wife. What you fay O to him for > 

W. A. I pray'd to him to open your Eyes, and 
your Underftanding, that you may know him, and 
be accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too > 

W. A. Yes, he can, he can do all Things, 

Wife. But no he hear what you fay > 

IF. A 



[ I<& ] 

tV. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him, and pfo- 
mis'd to hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray ? When he bid you ? How he 
bid you ? What ! you hear him fpeak ? 

W. A. No, we do not hear him fpeak, but he has 
reveafd himfelf many Ways to us. 

Here he was at a great Lofs to make her under- 
ftandy that God has reveaVd himfelf to us 
by his Word, and what his Word was : But 
at lafl he told it her thus* 

W. A. God has fpoken to fome good Men in 
former Days, even from Heaven, by plain Words ; 
and God has infpir'd good Men by his Spirit; 
and they have written all his Laws down in a 
Book. 

Wife. Me no underfland that, where is Book ? 

W. A. Alas, my poor Creature 5 I have not this 
Book ; but I hope I fhall one Time or other get it 
for you to read it. 

Here he embracd her with great AffeBion > but 
with inexpreffible Grief , that he had not a 
Bible. 

Wife But how you makee me know, that God 
teacheethem to write that Book? 

W. A. By the fame Rule that we know him to be 
God. 

Wife. What Rule, what Way you know. 

W. A. Becaufe he teaches and commands no- 
thing but what is good, righteous, and holy ; 
and pretends to make us perfe&ly good, as well as 

per* 



C 159] 



perfectly happy ; and becaufe he forbids and com- 
mands us to avoid all that is wicked, that is evil 
in it felf, or evil in its Confequences. 

Wife* That me would underftand, that me fain 
fee ; it he teachee all good Thing, forbid all wic- 
ked Thing, he reward all good Thing, punifli all 
wicked Thing, he make all Thing, hegiYeall Thing, 
he hear me when I fay O to him, asyougodojuft 
now; he makee me good, If I wifb be good, hefpare 
me, no makee kill me, when I no be good; all this 
you fay he do ; yes he be great God ; me take, think, 
believe him be great God; me fay O to him too 
with you, my Dear. 

Here the poor Man could forbear no longer ; but 
railing her up, made her kneel by him, and he pray'd 
to God, aloud, to inftruft her in the Knowledge of 
himfelf by his Spirit, and that by fome good Provi- 
dence, it poffible, fhe might fometime or other 
come to have a Bible, that (he might read the 
Word of God , and be taught by it to know 
him. 

This was the Time that wefaw him lift her up by 
the Hand, and faw him kneel down by her, as a- 
bove. 

They had feveral other Difcourfes it feems after 
this, too long to fet down here ; and particularly (he 
made him promife, that fince he confeft his own 
Life had been a wicked abominable Courfe of Pro- 
vacation againft God, that he would reform it, and 
not make God angry any more, leaft he fhould make 
him dead, as {he call'd it, and then fhe fhould be 
left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better ; and leaft he fhould be miferable, as he 
had told her wicked Men fhould be after Death. 

This was a ftrange Account, and very aflfe&ing 
to us both, but particularly to the young Clergy- 
man,- he was indeed wonderfully furprizcl with it, 

but 



[ i*>] 

but under the greateft AfRi&ion imaginable, that 
he could not talk to her, that he could not fpeak 
Englijh to make her underftand him , and as the fpoke 
but very broken Englifo, he could not underftand her ; 
However he tuin'd himfelf to me, and told me, that 
he believed there muft be more to do with this Wo- 
man than to marry her : I did not underftand him at 
firft, but at length he explain'd himfelf, (viz,.) that 
fhe ought to be BaptiYd. 

I agreed with him in that Part readily, and was 
for going about it prefently ; No, no, hold S;r, faid 
he, tho' I would have her be Baptiz'd by all Mean*, 
yet I muft obferve, that WW. Atkins, her Husband, 
has indeed brought her in a wonderful Manner to be 
willing to embrace a religious Life, and has given her 
juft Ideas of the Being of a God, of his Power, Ju- 
irice, Mercy; yet I deli re to know of him, if he had 
faid any Thing to her of Jefus Chrift, and of the Sal- 
vation of Sinners, of the Nature of Faith in him^ 
and Redemption, by him; of the holy Spirit, the 
Refure&ion, the laft Judgment, and a future 
State. 

I called Will Atkins again, and as'd him ; but the 
poor Fellow fell immediately into Tears, and told 
us he had faid fomething to her of all thofe things, 
but that he was himfelf fo wicked a Creature, and 
his own Conference fo reproach'd him with his hor- 
rid ungodly Life, that he trembled at the Apprehen- 
fions,that herKnowledge of him, (houldleflenthe At- 
tention Ihe fhould give to thofe Things, and make her 
rather contemn Religion than receive it : But he was 
affur'd he faid that her Mind was fo difpos'd to re- 
ceive due Impreffions of all thofe Things, that if 
I would but difcourfe with her (he would make it 
appear to my Satisfa&ion, that my Labour would 
not be loft upon her* 

Accord- 



t i*i i 

Accordingly I calPd her in, and phcing my felf 
as Incerprecer between my religious Prieft and the 
Woman, I entreated him to begin with her ; but 
fure fuch a Sermon was never preach'd by a popifh 
Prieft in tbefc latter Ages of the World $ and, as I 
told him, I thought he had all the Zeal, al) the 
Knowledge, all the Sincerity of a Chrittian, without 
the Error of a Roman Catholick -, and that I took 
him to be fuch a Clergy man, as the Roman Bifhops 
were before the Church of Rome aflum'd fpiritual 
Sovereignty over the Confciences of Men. 

In a word, he brought the poor Woman to em- 
brace the Knowledge of Chrift, and of Redemption 
by him, not with Wonder and Aftonifhment only, 
as flie did the firft Notions of a God, but with 
Joy and Faith, with an AfFeftion and a furprifing 
Degree of Underftanding, Icarce to be imagined, 
much lefs to exprefs'd $ and at her own Requeft 
(he was baptized, 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreat- 
ed him that he would perform that Office with 
ibme Caution, that the Man might not perceive he 
was of the Roman Church, if poffible, becaufe of 
other ill Conlequences which might attend a Dif- 
ference among us in that very Religion, which we 
were inftru&ing the other in : He told me, that as 
he had no conlecrated Chappel, no proper Things 
for the Office, 1 fhould fee he would do it in a 
Manner that 1 fhould not know by it, that he was 
a Roman Qatholick my felf, if I had not known it 
before ; Arid fo he did * for faying only fome 
Words over to himfelf in Latin , which I could not 
underftand, he pour'd a whole Difh-ful of Water 
upon the Woman's Head, pronouncing in French, 
very loud, MARY, which was the Name, her Huf- 
band dejird me to give her ^ for I was her Godfather, 
I baptize thee in the Nnme of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghoft -, fo that none could 
know any Thing by ir, what Religion he was of : 

L He 



[ 1*2 ] 

He gave the Benedi&ion afterwards in Latin $ but 
either Witt. Atkins did not know but it was in French, 
or elfe did not take Notice of it, at that Time. 

As foon as this was over we married them * and 
after the Marriage was over he turn'd himfelf to 
Witt. Jtkins, and in a very Affe£Honate Manner ex- 
horted him, not only to percevere in that good Di- 
fpofition he was in, but to fupport the Convi£Hons 
that were upon him by a Resolution to reform his 
Life •, told him it was in vain to fay he repented, 
if he did not forfake his Crimes : Reprefented to 
him, how God had honoured him with being the 
Inftrument of bringing his Wife to the Knowledge 
of the Chriftian Religion, and that he fhould be 
careful he did not difhonour the Grace of God, and 
that if he did, he would fee the Heathen a better 
Chriftian than himfelf* the Savage converted, and 
the Inftrument caft away. 

He faid a great many good Things to them both, 
and then recomending them in a few Words to 
God's goodnefs, gave them the Benedi&ton again, I 
repeating every Thing to them in EngliJI), and 
thus ended the Ceremony : 1 think it was the mod 
pleafant agreeable Day to me that ever I paffed in 
my whole Life. 

But my Clergy-man had not done yet ; his 
Thoughts hung continually upon the Converfion of 
the feven and thirty Savages, and fain he would have 
ftay'd upon the Ifland to have undertaken ir 5 but I 
convinced him, firft, that his Undertaking was im- 
prafticable in it felf •, and fecondly, that perhaps I 
would put it into a Way of being done in this Ab- 
lence to his Satisfa&ion •, of which^ by and by. 

Having thus brought the Affair of the Ifland to 
a narrow Compafs, I was preparing to go on board 
the Ship, when the young Man who I had taken out 
of the familh'd Ship's Company came to tine, and 
told me, he underftood I had a Clergy-man with 
me, and that I had cgufed the EngUJb Men to be 

married 



[ t(S 3 1 

married to the Savages, whom they called Wives £ 
that he had a Match too, which he defired might be 
finifh'd before I went, between two Chrittians, which 
he hop'd would not be difagreeable to me. 

I knew this rtiuft be the young Woman who was 
his Mother's Servant, for there was no other Chri- 
ftian Woman on the lfland $ fo I began to perfuade 
him not to do any Thing of that Kind rafhly, or 
becaufe he found himfelf in this folatary Circum- 
ftance: I reprefented to him that he had fome con- 
fiderable Sabftance in the World and good Friends 
as I underftood by himfelf, and by his Maid alfo $ 
that the Maid was not only poor, and a Servant, 
but was unequal to him, fhe being fix or feven and 
twenty years Old, and he not above feventeen of 
eighteen $ that he might very probably with mjr 
jAffiftance, make a remove from this Wildernefs and 
come into his own Country again, and that then it 
wouid be a thoufand to one but he would repent 
his Choice t, and the Diflike of that Circumftance 
might be difadvantageous to both. I was going to 
fay more but he interrupted me, fmiling, and told 
me, with a great deal of Modefty, that I miftook in 
my Gueffes, that he had nothing of that Kind in 
his Thoughts, his prefent Circumltance being me- 
lancholly and difconfolate enough ^ and he was very 
glad to hear that I had Thoughts of putting them 
in a Way to fee their Country again, and nothing 
fhould have put him upon (faying there, but that 
the Voyage I was going was fo exceeding long and 
hazardous, and would carry him quire out of the 
Reach of all his Friends-, that he had nothing td 
defireof me, but that I would fettle him in feme 
little Property in the lfland where he was, give him 
a Servant or two and lbme few NecefTiries, and he 
would fettle himfelf here like a Pointer, v*aHng 
the good Time, when if ever I returned to England^ 
I would redeem him, and hop'd I would not be un- 
mindful of him when I came into Evglemi^ that he 
L 2 would 



[ 1*4 1 

would give me fome Letters to his Friends in Lon- 
don^ to let them know how good I had heen to him, 
and in what Part of the World, and what Circum- 
ftance I had left him in •, that he promifed me, that 
when ever I re&eem'd him, the Plantation and all the 
Improvements he had made upon it, let the Value 
be what it would, fhould be wholly mine. 

His Difcourfe was very prettily delivered, confi* 
dering his Youth, and was the more agreeable to me, 
becaufe he told me politively the Match was not 
for himielf : I gave him all poflible Affurances that 
if 1 liv'd to come fafe to England^ I would deliver 
his Letters and do his Bufineis effe&ually, and that 
he might depend I would never forget the Circum- 
ftance I had left him in * but ftill I was impatient 
to know who was the Perfbn to be married, upon 
which he told me it was my Jack of all 'Trades , and 
his Maid Svfan. 

I was moft agreeably furpriz'd, when he nam'd 
the Match, for indeed I thought it very fui table ^ 
the Character of that Man I have given already ; and 
as for the Maid, (lie was a very honeft, modeft, fo- 
ber and religious young Woman, had a very good 
Shase of Senfe, was agreeable enough in her Perfon, 
ipoke very handfomely and to the Purpofe, always 
with Decency and good Manners, and not backward 
to fpeak when any Thing required it, or imperti- 
nently forward to fpeak when it was not her Bufi- 
nefs •, very handy and houfewifely in any Thing that 
was before her; an excellent Manager, and fit in- 
deed to have been Governefs to the whole Ifland * 
(he knew very well how to behave to all kind of 
Folks (he had about her, and to better, if (lie had 
found any there. 

The Match being propofed in this Manner, we 
married them the fame Day, and as I was Father at 
the Altar, as I may fay, and gave her away, fo I 
gave her a Portion $ for I appointed her and her 
Husband a handfom large Space of Grouud for 

*' their 



[ 1*5 1 

their Plantation •, and indeed this Match and the 
Pfopofal the young Gentleman made to me to give 
him a fmall a Property in the Ifland, put me upon par- 
celling it out amongft them, that they might not 
quarrel afterwards about their Situation. 

This fharing out the Land to them, I left to Will. 
Atkins, who indeed was now grown a moft fober, 
grave, managing Fellow * perfe&ly reform'd, ex- 
ceeding Pious and Religious, and as far as I may be 
allow'd to fpeak pofitively in fuch a Cafe, I verily 
believe, was a true fincere Penitent. 

He divided Things fo juftly , and fo much to eve- 
ry one's Satisfaftion, that they only defired one ge- 
neral Writing under my Hand for the whole, which 
I caufed to be drawn up and fign'd and feal'd to 
them, letting out the Bounds and Situation of every 
Man's Plantation, and teftifying that I gave them, 
thereby feverally a Right to the whole Poffeffion 
and Inheritance of the refpe£Hve Plantations or 
Farms, with their Improvements to them and their 
Heirs, referving all the reft of the Ifland as my own 
Property, and a certain Rent for every particular 
Plantation after eleven Years, if I, or any one from 
me, or in my Name, came to demand it, produc 
ing an attefted Copy of the fame Writing. 

As to the Government and Laws among them, I 
told them I was not capable of giving them better 
Rules, than they were able to give themfelves ; 
only made them promife me to live in Love and 
good Neighbourhood with one another ^ and fo I 
prepared to leave them. 

One Thing I muft not omit, and this is, that 
being now fettled in a Kind of Common- Wealth 
among themfelves, and having much Bufinefs in 
Hand, it was but odd to have feven and thirty J«- 
dians live in a Nook of the Illand, independent, 
and indeed un- employ 'd 5 for excepting the pro- 
viding themfelves Food, which they had Difficulty 
enough in too, fometimes, they had no manner 
L 3 of 



[ \66 1 

of Bufinefs or Property to manage : I proposM 
therefore to the Governour Spaniard, that he fhould 
go to them with Friday's Father, and propofe to 
them to remove, and either plant for themfelves, or 
take them into their leveral Families as Servants to 
be maintain'd for their Labour, but without being 
abfolute Slaves, for I would not admit them to 
make them Slaves by Force by any Means, becaule 
they had their Liberry given them by Capitulation, 
and as it were Articles of Surrender which they 
ought not to breik. 

They moft willingly embraced the Propofal, and 
came all very chearfully along with him ^ fo we 
allotted them Land, and Plantations, which 
three or four accepted of, but all the reft chofe 
to be employed as Servants in the leveral Families 
we had fettled 5 and thus my Colony was in a 
Manner fettled, as follows , The Spaniards pot 
fefs'd my original Habitation, which was the Capi- 
tal Ciry, and extended their Plantations all along 
the fide of the Brook, which made the Creek that 
I have fo often defcrib'd, as far as my Bower $ and 
as they increas'd their Culture, it went always Eaft- 
ward 5 the Englijh liv'd in the North- Haft Part, 
where WiU. Atkins, and his Comrades began, and 
came on Southward, and South Weft, towards the 
back Part of the Spaniards^ and every Plantation 
had a great Addition ot Land to take in, if they 
found Occafion, fo that they need not joftle one 
another for yvant of Room. 

_ All the Weft End of the Ifland was left uninha- 
bited, that if any of the Savages fhould come on 
Shore there, only for their ufual cuftomary Barba- 
rities, they might come and go •, if they difturbno 
Body, no Body would difturb them ^ and no doubt 
but they were often afliore, and went away again y 
for I never heard that the Planters were ever at- 
tacked or difturb'd any more. 

It 



[ 1*7 1 

It now came into my Thoughts, that I had hint- 
ed to my Friend the Clergy-man, that the Work of 
converting the Savages, might perhaps be let on 
foot in his Abfence, to his Satisfattion ; and I told 
him that now I thought it was put in a fair Way ; 
for the Savages being thus divided among the Chri- 
ftians, if they would but every one of them do 
their part with thole which came under their Hands, 
I hop'd it might have a very good Effect. 

He agreed prefently in that, if, faid he, they will 
do their Part ^ but how, fays he, (hall we obtain 
that of them ? I told him, we would call them all 
together, and leave it in Charge with them, or go 
to them one by one, which he thought beft, fo we 
divided it -, he to fpeak ro the Spaniards, who were 
all Papilts, and I to the Euglifi, who were all Pro- 
teftants $ and we recommended it earneftly to them, 
and made them Promife, that they never would 
make any Diftin&ion of Papift or Proteftant, in 
their exhorting the Savages to turn Chriftians •, but 
teach them the general Knowledge of the true God, 
and of their Saviour Jefus Chrilt •, and they like- 
wile promised us, that they would never have any 
Differences or Difputes one with another, about 
Religion, 

When I came to If. Atkinfs Houfe, I may call it 
fo, for fuch a Houfe or fuch a Piece of Basket- 
Work, I believe, was not landing in the World a- 
gain ; I fay, when I came there, 1 found the young 
Woman I have mentlon'd above, and Tf?. AtUmz 
Wife, were become Intimates •, and this prudent re- 
ligious young Woman, had perfected the Work W\ 
Jtkins had begun $ and tho 3 it iyas not above four 
Days after what I have related, yet the new. bap- 
tized Savage Woman was made fuch a Chfiiiivin} a& 
I have feldom heard of any like her ip all my Ob- 
fervation, or Converfation, in the World. 

It came next into my Mind in the Morning be- 
fore I went to them, that amongft all the needful 

L 4 Things, 



[ i*8 ] 

Things I had to leave with them I had not left them 
a Bible, in which, I fhew'd myfelf lefs confidering 
for them, than my good Friend the Widdow was 
for me, when fhe fent me the Cargo of an hundred 
Pounds from Lisbon, where (he pack'd up 3 Bibles, 
and a Prayer-Book : However, the good Woman's 
Charity had a greater Extent than ever fhe ima- 
ging * for they were referv'd for the Comfort and 
Inftruttion of thofe, that made much better life of 
them than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my Poket, and when 
I came to Will, Atkinses Tent or Houfe, and found 
the young Woman, and Atkins's baptiz'd Wife, had 
been difcourfing of Religion together -, for Will. At- 
fans told it me, with a great deal of Joy : I ask'd if 
they were together now, and he faid, Yes * fb I 
went into the Houfe, and he, with me, and we 
found them together very earneft in Difcourfe 5 O 
Sir, fays Will. Atkins, when God has Sinners to re- 
concile to himfelf, and Aliens to bring Home, He 
never wants a Meffenger •, my Wife has got a new 
Inftru&or \ 1 knew I was unworthy, as I was unca* 
pable of that Work * that young Woman has been 
lent hither from Heaven * fhe is enough to convert a 
whole Ifland of Savages-, the young Woman blufh'd, 
and rofe up to go away, but f defied her to fit ftil) $ 
I told her, fhe had a good Work upon her Hands, 
and I hop'd God would blefs her in it. 

We talk'd a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any Book among them, though I did not ask * 
but I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out 
my Bible * here, yip J", to Atkins, I have brought 
you an Afliftant that perhaps you had not before 5 
the Man was fo confounded, that he was not able to 
ipeak for fomeTime^ but recovering himfelf, he 
takes it with both his Hands, and turning to his 
Wife, here, my Dear, fays he 5 did not I tell you, 
our God, tho' He lives above, could hear what we 
faid ? Here's the Book I ptay'd for, when you and I 

kned'd 



I 1*9 3 

kneelM down under the Bufh ; now God has heafd 
us, and fent it 5 when he had faid fo, the Man fell 
into fuch Transports of a paflionate Joy, that be- 
tween the Joy of having it and giving God Thanks 
for it, the Tears run down his Face like a Child 
that was crying. 

The Woman was furprifed, and was like to have 
run into a Miftake, thar none of us were aware of^ 
for (he firmly believ'd God had fent the Book upon 
her Husband's Petition * It is true, that providenti- 
ally it was fo, and might be taken fo in a confe- 
quent Senfe-, but I believ'd it would have been no 
difficult Matter at that Time to have perfuaded the 
poor Woman to have believ'd, that an expieis Mef- 
fenger came from Heaven, on purpofe to bring that 
individual Book ^ but it was to ferious a Matter, to 
fuffer^any Delufion to take Place-, fo I turned to 
the^roung Woman and told her we did not defire to 
impofe upon the new Convert, in her firlt, and 
more ignorant underftanding of Things *, and 
begg'd her to explain to her, that God may be ve- 
ry properly faid to aniwer our Petitions, when in 
the Courfe of his Providence, fuch Things are in 
a particular Manner brought to pafs, as we petiti- 
oned for * but we do not expe£t returns from Hea- 
ven, in a miraculous and particular Manner, and 
that it is our Mercy, that it is not fo. 

This the young Woman did afterwards effe&ual- 
ly 5 fb that there was I a fibre you, no Prieft- craft 
ufed here $ and I fhould have thought it one of the 
moft unjuftifiable Frauds in the World, to have 
had it fo 5 but the Surprife of Joy upon WiU. At- 
Jdns^ is really not to be exprefTed •, and there we 
may be fure, there was no Delufion : Sure, no Man 
was ever more thankful in the World for any Thing 
of its Kind, than he was for this Bible 5 nor I 
believe, never any Man was glad of a Bible from a 
better Principle -, and though he had been a moft 
profligate Creature, defperate, headflrong, outra- 

gious, 



[ i7« ] 

gious, furious, and wicked to a great Degree 5 yet 
this Man is a ftanding Rule to us all, for the well 
inftrufting Children, (viz) that Parents fhould ne- 
ver give over to teach and inftrutt, or ever difpair 
of the Succefs of their Endeavours, let the Chil- 
dren be ever fo obftinate, refra&ory, or to Appear- 
ance, infenfible of Inftru£tion •, for if ever God in 
his Providence, touches the Confciences of fuch, 
the Force of their Education returns upoq them, 
and the early Inftru&ion of Parents is not loft * 
though it may have been many Years laid afleep $ 
but Tome Time or other, they may find the Benefit 
of it. 

Thus it was with this poor Man ^ However igno- 
rant he was, or diverted of Religion and Chriftian 
Knowledge : He found he had fame to do with 
now, more ignorant than himfelf h and that th# 
leaft Part of the Inflruftion of his good Father 
that could now come to his Mind, was of {^fe to 
him. 

Among the relt it occurred to him, he faid, how 
his Father us'd to infill much upon the inexpreflible 
Value of the Bible $ the Privilege and Blefling of 
it to Nations, Families, and Perfbns ■, buc he never 
entertained the leaft Notion of the Worth of it, 
'till now 5 when being to talk to Heathens, Savages, 
and Barbarians, he wanted the Help of *he written 
Oracle for his Affiftance. 

The young Woman was very glad of it alfo for 
the prefent Occafion, tho° (he had one, and fo had 
the Youth on board our Ship among their Goods, 
which were not yet brought on Shore * and now ha- 
ving faid fo many Things of this young Woman, I 
cannot omit of telling; one Story more of her, and 
my felf, which has lomething in it very informing 
and remarkable. 

I have related, to what Extremity the poor young 
Woman was reduced; how her Miftrefs was ftarv'd 
to Death, and did die on board that unhappy Ship 

we 



[ I7i ] 

we met at Sea * and how the whole Ship's Company 
being reduced to the laft Extremity $ the Gentlewo- 
man, and her Son, and this Maid, were firft hardly 
uled as to Provifions ^ and at laft totally negle&ed 
and ftarv'd$ that is to fay, brought to the laft Ex- 
tremity of Hunger. 

One Day being Difcourfing with her upon the 
Extremities they fuffer'd, I ask'd her if fhe could 
defcribe by what (he had felt, what it was to 
ftarve, and how it appeared * fhe told me, fhe 
believ'd fhe could 5 and fhe told her Tale very di- 
ftin&Iy thus, 

" Firft, Sir, faid fhe, we had for fome Days [aril 
" exceeding hard, and fuffer'd very great Hunger $ 
" but now at laft, we were wholly without Food 
" of any Kind, except Sugar, and a little Wine, 
* c and a little Water. The firft Day, after I had 
" received no Food at all, 1 found my felf towards 
" Evening, firft empty and fickifh at my Stomach* 

* and nearer Night mightily enclin'd to yawning 
u and fleepy * I laid down on a Couch in the great 
" Cabin to fleep, and flept about three Hours, and 
" awak'd a little refrefhM 5 having taken a Glafs 
" of Wine when I lay down ^ after being about 
u three Hours awake, it being about five a-Ciock 
" in the Morning, 1 found myfelf empty and my 
u Stomach fickifh, and lay'd down again, but could 
" not fleep at all, being very faint, and ill * and 
" thus I contina'd all the fecond Day, with a 
" ftrange Variety, firft Hungry, thenfick again, with 
" Teachings to vomit ^ the fecond Night being 

* oblig'd to go to Bed again, without any Food, 
iC more than a Draught of fair Water ; and being 
^ c afleep, 1 dream'd I was at Barhadoes, and that the 
" Market was mightily ftcck'd with Provrhons ; 
" that I brought fome for my Miltreis, and went 
" and din'd very heartily. 

" I thought my Stomach was as full after this as 
V any would have been after, ox at good Dinner y 

"■ but 



C 172 ] 

" but when I awak'd, I was exceedingly funk in 
u my Spirits, to find mylelf in the extremity of 
€C Famine : The laft Glafs of Wine we bad, I 
" drank, and put Sugar in it, becaufe, of its ha- 
cc ving fome Spirit to fupply Nourifhmenc •, but 
cc there being no Subftance in the Stomach for the 
cc digefting Office to work upon, I found the only 
c; effeft of the Wine was, to raife difagreeable 
* Fumes from the Stomach, into the Head •, and I 
w lay, as they told me, ftupid, and fenfelefs, as 
" one Dru^^f|j(bme Time. 

" The third Day in the Morning, after a Night 
cc of ftrange and confus'd inconfiftent Dreams-, and 
" rather dozing than fleeping, I wak'd, ravenous 
" and furious, with Hunger $ and 1 queftion, had 
" not my Qnderftanding returned and conquered it > 
<c I fay, I queftion whether if I had been a Mother, 
cc and had had a little Child with ine, its Life would 
" have been fafe or not ? 

" This lafted about three Hours •, during which 
tt Time I was twice raging Mad as any Creature in 
cc Bedlam, as my young Matter told me, and as he 
" can now inform you. 

44 In one of thefe fits of Lunacy or Diftra&ion, 
44 whether by the Motion of the Ship, or fome Slip 
44 of my Foot, I know not ^ I fell down, and ft ruck 
* 4 my Face againft the Corner of a Palat Bed in 
44 which my Miftrefs lay; and with the Blow the 
44 Blood gufh'd out of my Noii'j ^ and the Cabin 
44 Boy bringing me a little Bafon, 1 fat down and 
4C bled into it a great deal •, and as the Blood run 
4C from me, I came to my feif $ and the Violence of 
" the Flame or the Fever, I was in, abated, and fo 
" did the ravenous Parr of the Hunger. 

44 Then I grew fick, and reached to Vomit, but 
44 could not ^ for I had nothing in my Stomach to 
" bring up : After I had bled fome Time, I fwoon'd, 
c< and they all beiiev'd I was dead •, but I came to 
44 myfelf foon after, and then had a moft dreadful 

w Pain 



C «73 ] 

" Pain in my Stomach, not to be defcribed ; nor 
" like the Cholick, but a gnawing eager Pain fot 
" Food* and towards Night it went off with a 
" kind of earneft Wilhing or Longing for Food 5 
cc fomething like, as I fuppofe, the Longing of a 
" Woman with Child. I took another Draught of 
"Water with Sugar in it, but my Stomach loath- 
" ed the Sugar, and brought it all up again $ then 
" I took a Draught of Water without Sugar, and 
" that ftay'd with me* and I laid me down upon 
" the Bed, praying mod heartily, that it would 
" pleafe God to take me eway ; and compofing 
" my Mind in Hopes of it, I flumber'd a while, 
cc and then waking, thought myfelf dying, being 
" light with Vapours from an empty Stomach, I re- 
" commended my Soul then to God, and earneftly 
" wifh'd that fome Body would throw me into 
" the Sea. 

" All this whii£ my Miftrefs lay by me, juft, as I 
" thought expiring, but bore it with' much more 
" Patience than I, and gave the laft bit of Bread 
" fhe had left to her Child, my young Mafter, 
" who would not have taken it, but fhe oblig'd him 
" to eat it 5 and I believe it fav'd his Life. 

" Towards the Morning I flept again, and firft 
CQ when I awak'd, I fell into a violent Paffion of 
" Crying, and afrer that had a fecond Fit of vio- 
" lent Hunger h I got up ravenous, and in a moft 
" dreadful Condition ^ had my Miftrefs been dead, 
" as much as I lov'd her, I am certain, I fhould 
" have eaten a Piece of her Flefh, with as much 
<; Relifh, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the 
" Flefh of any Creature appointed for Food 5 and 
" once or twice 1 was going to bice my own Arm : 
" At laft, I faw the Bafon in which was the Blood 
cc I had bled at my Noife the Day before ^ 1 ran to 
" ir, and fwallow'd it with fuch Hafte, and fuch a 
c ' greedy Appetite, as if I had wonder'd no Body 
cc had taken it before, and afraid it fhould be taken 
<; from me now. " Tho* 



[•74] 



" Tho 5 after it was down, the Thoughts of it 
<c fi'Pd me with Horror, yet it check'd the Fit of 
" Hunger, and I drank a Draught of fair Water, 
Ct and was compos'd and refrefh'd for fome Hours 
u after it : This was the 4th Day, and thus I held 
Ci it, 'till towards Night, when within the Com- 
<c pais of three Hours, I had all thefe feveral Cir- 
cc omittances over again, one after another, (viz.) 
u lick, fleepy, eagerly hungry, Pain in the Sto* 
7 mach, then ravenous again, then fick again, then 
Ci lunatick, then crying, then ravenous again •, and 
** lb every quarter of an Hour, and my Strength 
" wafted exceedingly : At Night I laid me down, 
u having no Comfort, hut in the Hope that I fhould 
u die before Morning. 

" All this Night I had no Sleep •, but the Hun- 
ic ger was now turn'd into a Difeafe 5 and I had a 
c< terrible Cholick and Griping, Wind inltead of 
<c Food, having fciind its Way into the Bowels $ and 
cc in this Condition I lay 'till Morning, when I was 
cc furpnVd a little with the Cries arid Lamentations 
<c of my young Matter, who fcall'd out to me that 
tc his Mother was dead : I lifted my ie'f up a lit— 
cc tie 1 for I had not Strength to rife, but found fhe 
<e was not dead, tho' fhe was able to give very 
cc little Signs of Life. 

" I had then fuch Convulfions in my Stomach, 
" for want of fome fuftenance, that I cannot de* 
u fcribe; with fuch freequent Throws and Pangs 
" of Appetite, that nothing but the Tortures of 
<c Death can imitate •, and in this Condition I was 
iC when I heard the Seamen above cry out a Sai^ a 
cc Sail^ and hallow and jump about, as if they 
" were diftra&ed 

" I was not able to get off froin the Bed, and 
cc my Miftrefs much lefs * and my young Matter 
" was fo fick, that I thought he had been expiring ; 
" fo we could not open the Cabin-Door, or get 
" any Account what it was that occafion'd fuch a 

" Com- 



[ 175 ] 



H Combuftion, nor had we had any Convention 
<r with the Ship's Company for two Days ; they 
* c having told us they had not a Mouthful of any 
u Thing to eat in the Ship $ and they told us after- 
cc wards, they thought we had been dead. 

" It was this dreadful Condition we were in when 
" you were lent to fave our Lives $ and how yott 
" found us, Sir, you know as well as I, and bet- 
" ter too. 

This was her own Relation, and isfuch a diftinft 
Account of ftarving to Death, as 1 confefs 1 never 
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me 5 
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true Ac- 
count, becaufe the Youth gave me an Account of a 
good Part of it •, tho 5 1 muft own, not fo diftinft 
and (b feelingly as his Maid $ and the rather, be- 
caufe it feems his Mother fed him at the Price of 
her own Life : But the poor Maid, tho' her Confti- 
tution being ftronger than that of her Miftrefs, who 
was in Years, and a weakly Woman too, (he might 
ftruggle harder with it$ I fay, the poor Maid 
might be fuppofed to feel the Extremity fomething 
fooner than her Miftrefs, who might be allowed to 
keep the laft Bit fomething longer than (he parted 
with any to relieve the Maid, No Queftion, as the 
Cafe is here related, if our Ship or fome other, 
had not fo providentially met them, a few Days 
more would have ended all their Lives, unlefs they 
had prevented it by eating one another ^ and even, 
that as their Cafe ftood, would have ferv'd them 
but a little while, they being 500 Leagues from any 
Land; or any Poffibility of Relief, other than in 
the miraculous Manner it happened : But this is by 
the Way * I return to my Difpofition of Things 
among the People, 

And, Pirji, It is to be obterv'd here, That for 
many Reafons I did not think fit to let them know 
any Thing of the Sloop I had fram'd, and which I 
thought of letting up among them ; for I found, 

at 



[ i7«] 

at haft at my firft coming y fuch Seeds of Divifions 
among them, that I faw it plainly had I fet up the 
Sloop, and left it among them, they would upon 
every light Difguft have feperated, and gone awajr 
from one another, or perhaps haveturn'd Pirates and 
fo made the Ifland a Den of Thieves,inftead of a Plan- 
tation of fober and religious People, fo as I intended 
it$ nor did I leave the two Pieces of BrafsCannon that 
I had on Board, or the two Qjiarter-Deck Guns, 
that my Nqphew took extraordinarily for the fame 
.Reafon : I thought they had enough to qualify 
them for a defenfive War againft any that fhould in- 
vade them * but I was not to fet them up for an ofc 
fenfive War, or to encourage them to go Abroad to 
attack others, which in the End would only bring 
Ruin and Deftru&ion upon themfelves and all their 
Undertaking : I referv'd the Sloop therefore, and 
the Guns, for their Service another Way, as I fhall 
obferve in its Place. 

F have now done with the Ifland : I left them all 
in good Circumftances, and in a flourifliing Conditi- 
on, and went on board my Ship again the 
of , having been five and twenty Days 

among them $ aiid as they were all refolv'd to ftay 
upon the Ifland 'till I came to remove them, I pro- 
mised to fend fome further Relief from the Brajils, 
if 1 could poffibly find an Opportunity ; and parti- 
cularly I promised to fend them fome Cattel, fuch 
as Sheep, Hogs, and Cows : For as to the two 
Cows and Calves which I brought from England, 
we had been oblig'd by the Length of our Voyage 
to kill them at bea, for want of Hay to feed them. 

The next Day, giving rhem a Salute of five Guns 
at parting, we fet Sail, and arriv'd at; the Bay of 
AU-Saints in the Brafils in about 22 Days * meeting 
nothing remarkable in our Paffage, but this, That 
about three Days after we failed, being becalm'd. and 
the Current fetting ftrong to the E. N. E. running, as 
it were, into a Bay or Gulph on the Land Side, we 

were 



[ *77 ] 

were driven fomething out of our Courfe, and once 
or twice our Men cry'd Land to the Eaftward -, but 
whether it was the Continent or Iflands, we could 
not tell by any Means. 

But the third Day towards Evening, the Sea 
fmooth, and the Weather calm, we faw the Sea, as 
it were, covered towards the Land with fomething 
very black, not being able to difcover what it was, 
'till after ibme Time, our chief Mate going up the 
main Shrowds a little Way, and looking at them 
with a Perfpe&ive, cry'd out it was an Army, I could 
not imagine what he meant by an Army, and fpoke 
a little haftily, calling the Fellow a Fool, or fome 
fuch Word : Nay, Sir, fays he, don't be angry, for 
'tis an Army and a Fleet too $ for I believe there 
are a thoufand Canoes, and you may fee them pad- 
dle along, and they are coming towards us too^ 
apace. 

I was a little furpriz'd then indeed, and fo was 
my Nephew, the Captain *, for he had heard fuch 
terrible Stories of them in the Ifland, and having 
never been in thofe Seas before, that he could not 
tell what to think of it, but faid two or three Times, 
we fhould all be devoured. I muft confefs confider- 
ing we were becaim'd, and the Current fet ftrong 
towards the Shore, I lik'd it the worfe : However, 
I bad him not be afraid, but bring the Ship to an 
Anchor, as foon as we came fo near as to know 
that we muft engage them. 

The Weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us * fo I gave Order to come to an 
Anchor, and furle all our Sails : As for the Savages, 
I told them they had nothing to fear but to Fire* 
and therefore they fhould get their Boats out, and 
fallen them, one clofe by the Head, and the other 
by the Stern, and man them both well, and wait 
the lffue in that Pofture: This I did, that the Men 
in the Boats might be ready with Skeets and Buckets 

M to 



1 178 1 

to put out any Fire, thefe Savages might endeavour 
to fix to the Out-fide of the Ship. 

In this Pofture we lay by for them, and in a little 
while they came up with us •, but never was fuch a 
horrid Sight leen by Chriftians: My Mate was 
much miftaken in his Calculation of their Number, 
I mean of a thoufand Canoes * the moft we could 
make of them when they came up, being about a 
hundred and fix and twenty and a great many ef 
them too -, for fome of them had fixteen or feven* 
teen Men in them, fome more $ and the leaft fix 
or ieven. 

When they came nearer to us they feenrcl to be 
ftruck with Wonder and Aftonifhment, as at a Sight 
which they had doubtlefs never feen before ^ nor 
could they at firft, as we afterwards underftood, know 
what to make of us : They came boldly up however 
very near to us, and feem'd to go about, to row 
round us * but we call'd to our Men in the Boats^ 
not to let them come too near them. 

This very Order brought us to an Engagement 
with them, without our defigning it ; for five or 
fix of their large Canoes came fo near our Long-Boat^ 
that our Men beckon'd with their Hands to them to 
keep back, which they underftood very well, and 
went back $ but at their Retreat, about 50 Arrows 
came on board us from thofe Boats $ and one of our 
Men in the Long-Boat was very much wounded. 

However, I call'd to them not to fire by any 
Means ^ but we handed down fome Deal-Boards in- 
to the Boat, and the Carpenter prefently fet up a 
kind of a Fence like wafte Boards, to cover them 
from the Arrows of the Savages, if they fhould 
(hoot again. 

About half an Hour afterwards they came all up 
in a Body a-ftern of us, and pretty near, fo near 
that we could eafily difcern what they were, tho 3 we 
could not tell their Defign : I eafily found they were 
fome of my old Friends, the fame Sort of Savages 

I that 



[ *79 1 

that I had been ufed to engage with •, and in a little 
Time more they row'd a little farther out to Sea, 
'till they camedire&ly Broad-fide with us, and then 
row'd down ftrait upon us, 'till they came fo near 
that they could hear us fpeak : Upon this 1 orderM 
all my Men to keep ciofe, leaft they fhouid (hoot 
any more Arrows, and made all our Guns ready * 
but being fo near as to be within hearing, 1 made 
Friday go out upon the Deck, and call out aloud to 
them in his Language to know what they meant, 
which accordingly he did $ whether they underftood 
him or not, that I knew not : But as foon as he had 
called to them, fix of them who were in the fore- 
moft or nigheft Boat to us, turns their Canoes from 
us * and ftooping down, fhew'd us their naked Back- 
fides, juft as if in EngUJb, faving your prefence, they 
had bid us kifs — -, whether this was a Defiance or 
Challenge, we know not * or whether it was done 
in meer Contempt, or as a Signal to the reft * but 
immediately Friday cry'd out they were going to 
fhoot, and unhappily for him poor Fellow $ they 
let fly abour 300 of their Arrows, and, to my inex- 
preffible Griei, kiird poor Friday^ no other Man be- 
ing in their Sight. The poor Fellow was (hot with 
no lefs than three Arrows, and about three more 
fell very near him * fuch unlucky Markfmen they 
were. 

I was fo enrag'd with the lofs of my old Servant, 
the Companion of all my Sorrows and Solitudes, 
that I immediately ordered five Guns to be loaded 
with fmali Shot, and four with great, and gave 
them fiich a Broad- fide, as they had never heard in 
their Lives before, to be fure. 

They were not above half a Cable Length off 
when we fir'd and our Gunners took their aim fo well, 
that three or four of their Canoes were overfer, as 
we had reafon to believe, by one Shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare Back- 
fides to us, gave us no great Offence - 7 neither did I 
M 2 know 



[ l8o ] 

know for certain, whether that which would pafs 
for the greateft Contempt among us, might be un- 
derftood lb by them, or not * therefore in Return, 
I had only refolv'd to have fir'd four or five Guns at 
them with Powder only, which I knew would fright 
them fufficiently : But when they (hot at us dire&ly 
with all the Fury they were capable of, and efpeci- 
ally as they had kill'd my poor Friday, who I fo en- 
tirely lov'd and valu'd, and who indeed ib well de- 
ferv'd it ^ I not only had been juftify'd before God 
and Man, but would have been very glad, if I could \ 
to have overfet every Canoe there, and drown'd eve- 
ry one of them. 

I can neither tell, how many we kill'd, or how 
many we wounded at this Broad- fide ^ but fure fiich 
a Fright and Hurry never was feen among Inch a 
Multitude •, there were 13 or 14 of their Canoes 
fplit and overfet in all, and the Men all fet a fwim- 
ming 5 the reft frighted out of their Wits fcour'd 
away as faft as they could, taking but little care to 
fave thofe whofe Boats were fplit or fpoiPd with 
our Shot: So I fuppofe, that they were many of 
them loft : And our Men took up one poor Fellow 
fwimming for his Life, above an Hour after they 
were all gone. 

Our fmall Shot from our Cannon mult needs kill 
and wound a great many 5 but, in fhort, we never 
knew any Thing how it went with them * for they 
fled fo faft, that in three Hours or thereabouts, we 
could not fee above three or four ftraggling Canoes ; 
nor did we ever fee the reft any more ^ for a Breeze 
of Wind fpringing up the fame Evening, we 
weighed and let Sail for the Brajils. 

We had a Prifoner indeed * but the Creature was 
fo fulien, that he would neither eat or fpeak % and 
we all fanfied he would ftarve himfelf to Death : 
But I took a Way to cure him •, for I made them 
take him and turn him into the Long-Boat, and 
make him believe they would tofs him into the Sea 

1 again* 



[ i8i ] 

again, and fo leave him where they found him, if 
he would not fpeak : Nor would that do $ but they 
really did throw him into the Sea, and came away 
from him $ and then he followed them $ for he 
fwam like a Cork, and calFd to them in his Tongue, 
tho 5 they knew not one Word of what he faid : How- 
ever, at laft they took him in again, and then he be- 
gan to be more tradable * nor did I ever defign they 
fhould drown him. 

We were now under Sail again •, but I was the 
moft difconfolate Creature alive, for want of my 
Man Friday, and would have been very glad to have 
gone back to the Ifland, to have taken one of the 
reft from thence for my Occafion, but it could not 
be $ fo we went on. We had one Prifoner, as I have 
faid 5 and 'twas a long while before we could make 
him underftand any thing : But, in time, our Men 
taught him fome Englijb , and he began to be a lit- 
tle tradable ^ afterwards we enquired what Country 
he came from, but could make nothing of what he 
faid ^ for his Speech was fo odd, all Gutturals, and 
fpoke in the Throat, in fuch an -hollow odd manner* 
that we could never form a Word from him * and 
we were all of opinion that they might fpeak that 
Language as well, if they were gagg'd, as other- 
wife : Nor could we perceive that they had any 
Occafion, either for Teeth, Tongue, Lips, or Palate * 
but forrn'd their Words juft as a hunting Horn forms 
a Tune with an open Throat $ he told us however, 
for^e time after, when we had taught him to fpeak a 
little EisgliJI), that they were going with their Kings 
to fight a great Baule. When he laid Kings, we 
as'd him how many Kings > He faid, they were 
FIVE NATION, we could not make him un- 
derftand the PLuria! S. and that they all join'd to go 
againft Two Nation. We ask'd him what imde 
them come up to us ? He faid, tomahe te great Won- 
der look : Where it is to be obferved , That all. thofe 
Natives, as alfo thofe of Africa, when they kirn 

M 5 Ev$A 



[ i8a ] 

Englijh, they always add two Es at the End of the 
Words where we ufe one, and make the Accent up- 
on them, as makee takee, and the like 5 and we could 
not break them of it 5 nay, I could hardly make Fri- 
day leave it off, tho 5 at laft he did. 

And now I name the poor Fellow once more, I 
muft take my laft Leave of him $ poor honeft Fri- 
day ! We buried him with all the Decency and So- 
lemnity poflible, by putting him into a Coffin, and 
throwing him into the Sea : And I caus'd 'em to fire 
eleven Guns for him-, and fo ended the Life of the 
moft grateful, faithful, honeft, and moft afFe&ionate 
Servant that ever Man had. 

We went now away with a fair Wind for Brafil y 
and in about twelve Days Time we made Land in 
the Latitude of five Degrees South of the Line, be- 
ing the North-Eaftermoft Land of all that Part of 
America. We kept on S- by E. in Sight of the Shore 
four Days, when we made Cape St. Avgnftine, and 
in three Days came to an Anchor off of the Bay of 
aU Saints^ the old Place of my Deliverance, from 
whence came both by good and evil Fate, 

Never Ship came to this Part that had lefs Bufi- 
nefs than I had * and yet it was with great Difficul- 
ty that we were admitted to hold the leaft Corre- 
fpondency on Shore, not my Partner himfeif, who 
was alive, and made a great Figure among them * 
not my two Merchants Truftees, nor the Fame of 
my wonderful Prefervation in that Ifland, could ob- 
tain me that Favour : But my Partner remembring, 
that I had given 500 Moidores to the Prior of the 
Monaftery of the Auguftines, and 272 to the Poor, 
went to the Monaftery, and obliged the Prior that 
then was, to go to the Governor, and get leavefor me 
perfonally, with the Captain, and one more, befides 
eight Seamen, to come on Shore, and no more 5 and 
this upon Condition abfolutely capitulated for, that 
we Ihould not offer to land any Goods out of the 
Ship, or to carry any Perfon away without Licence 

They 



1 183] 

They were fo ftri£fc with us, as to landing any 
Goods, that it was with extream Difficulty that I 
got on Shore three Bales of Englijb Goods, fuch as 
fine broad Cloaths, Stuffs, and fome Linnen, which 
I had brought for a Prefent to my Partner. 

He was a very generous broad hearted Man, tho* 
like me, he came from little at firft ; and though he 
knew not that I had the Uift Defign of giving him 
any Thing, he fent me on Board a Prefent of freih 
Provifions, Wine, and Sweet-meats, worth above 
30 Moidores, including fome Tobacco, and three 
or four fine Medals in Gold ; But I was even with 
him in my Prefent, which, as I have faid, confifted 
of fine broad Cloath, Evglifi Stuffs, Lace, and fine 
Hollands : Alfo I delivered him about the Value of 
loo lib. Sterl. in the fame Goods for other Ufes 5 
and I obliged him to fet up the Sloop which I had 
brought with me from England, as I have faid, for 
the Ufe of my Colony, in order to fend the Re- 
frefhments I intended to my Plantation. 

Accordingly, he got Hands, and finifhed the Sloop 
in a very few Days, for fhe was already fram'd, 
and I gave the Matter of her fuch Inftruftions, as 
he could not mifs the Place, nor did he mifi them, as 
I had an Account from my Partner afterwards. I got 
him foon loaded with the fmall Cargo 1 had lent 
them •, and one of our Seamen that had been on 
(hore with me there, offer'd to go with the Sloop, 
and fettle there upon my Letter to the Governour 
Spaniard, to allot him a fufficient quantity of Land 
for a Plantation ^ and giving him fome Cloaths, and 
Tools for his Plan ting- Work, which he faid he un- 
derftood, having been an old Planter at Maryland^ 
and a Buckaneer into the Bargain. 

I encouraged the Fellow, by granting all he defir- 
ed * and as an Addition I gave him the Savage, which 
we had taken Prifoner of War, to be his Slave, and 
ordered the Governour Spaniard to give him hisfliare 
of every thing he wanted with the reft. 

MV When 



[ 1 84 1 

When we came to fit this Man out, my old Part- 
ner told me, there was a certain very honeft Fellow 
a Brafil Planter of his Acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the Difpleafure of the Church; I know not 
what the matter is with him, fays he $ but on my 
Confcience, I think he is an Heretick in his Heart, 
and he has been obligM to conceal himfelf for fear 
of the Inquifition •, that he would be very glad of 
liich an Opportunity to make his Efcape with his 
Wife and two Daughters *, and if I would let them 
go to my Ifland, and allot them a Plantation, he 
would give them a fmall Stock to begin with $ for 
the Officers of the Inquifition had feiz'd all his Ef- 
fefts and Eftate, and he had nothing left but a little 
Houfhold Stuff and two Slaves. And, adds he y 
Tho 3 1 hate his Principles, yet I would not have 
him fall into their Hands -, for he would affuredly 
be burnt alive, if he does* 

I granted this prefently, and join'd my Evglijb 
Maa with them, and we conceaFd the Man, and his 
Wife and Daughters on Board our Ship, 'till the 
Sloop put out, to go to Sea $ and then (having put 
all their Goods on board the Sloop, fome time be- 
fotc) we put them on board the Sloop, after he was 
got out of the Bay. 

Our Seamen was mightily pleas'd with this new 
Partner ^ and their Stock indeed was much alike rich 
In Tools, in Preparations, and a Farm, but nothing 
lo begin with but as above : However, they carried 
over with them, which was worth all the reft, fome 
Materials for planting Sugar Canes, with fome 
Plants of Canes * which he, I mean, the Portugal 
Man, underftood very well. 

Among the reft of the Supplies fent my Tenants 
in the Ifland, I fent therp by this Sloop, three Milch 
Cows, and five Caives,about 2 2Hogs among 3 em,three 
Sows big with Pig, two Mares, and Stone-Horfe. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promife, I en- 
gaged three Portugal Women to go, and recom- 
mended 



t 18s 3 

mended it to them to many them, and life them 
kindly. I could have procured more Women, but 
I remembered, that the poor perfecuted Man had 
two Daughters, and there was but five of the Spani- 
ards thar wanted * the reft had Wives of their own, 
tho' in another Country. 

All this Cargoe arriv'd fafe, and as you may eafi- 
ly fuppofe, very welcome to my old Inhabitants, 
who were now with this Addition between fixty and 
ieventy People, befides little Children * of which, 
there was a great many : I found Letters at London 
from them all by the Way of Lisbon, when I came 
back to England; being fent back to the Brafih by this 
Sloop,of which I (hall take fome Notice in it's Place, 

I have now done with my Ifland, and all Manner 
of Difcourfe about it 5 and whoever reads the reft 
of my Memorandums, would do well to turn his 
Thoughts entirely from it, and expe£t to read only 
of the Follies of an old Man, not warn'd by his own 
Harms, much lefs by thofe of other Men, to beware 
of the like $ not cool'd by almoft forty Years Mife- 
jy and Difappointments, not fatisfy'd with Profpe- 
rity beyond Expettation, not made cautious by Af- 
fli&ion and Diftrefs beyond Imitation. 

I had no more Bufinefs to go to the E aft -Indies, 
than a Man at full Liberty, and having comitted.no 
Crime, has to go to the Turn-key at Newgate, and 
defire him to lock him up among the Prifoners there, 
and fterve him. Had I taken a fmall Veffel from 
England, and went dire&ly to the Ifland; had I 
loaded her, as I did the other Veflel, with all the 
Neceffaries for the Plantation, and for my People, 
took a Patent from the Government here, to have 
fecur'd my Property, in fubjeftion only to that of 
England to be fure I might have obtain'd* had I 
carried over Cannon and Ammunition, Servants and 
People, to plant, and taking poffeffion of the Place, 
fortified and ftrengthen'd it in the Name of England, 
and increas'd it with People, as I might eafily have 

done j 



[ iM] 

done; had I then fettl'd myfelf there, and fent the 
Ship back, loaden with good Rice, as I might alfo 
have done in fix Months time, and ordered my Friends 
to have fitted her out again for our Supply $ had I 
done this, and ftaid there myfelf, I had, at leaft, 
afted like a Man of common Senfe * but I was pof- 
feft with a wandring Spirit, fcorned all Advantages, 
pleafed myfelf with being the Patron of thofe Peo- 
ple I had placed there, and doing for them in a kind 
of haughty majeftick Way, like an old Patriarchal 
Monarch •, providing for them, as if I had keen Fa- 
ther of the whole Family, as well as of the Planta- 
tion : But I never fo much as pretended to plant in 
the Name of any Government or Nation, or to ac- 
knowledge any Prince, or to call my People Subjects 
to any one Nation more than another * nay, 1 never 
fo much as gave the Place a Name $ but left it as I 
found it, belonging to no Man $ and the People un- 
der no Difcipiine or Government but my own ^ who, 
tho 3 1 had influence over them as Father and Benefa- 
ctor, had no Authority or Power, to A£l or Com- 
mand one way or other, farther than voluntary Con- 
fent mov'd them to comply $ yet even this, had I 
ftaid there, would have done well enough $ but as I 
f ambi'd from them, and came there no more, the laft 
Letters I had from any of them, was by my Partners 
means * who afterwards fent another Sloop to the 
Place, and who fent me word, tho' I had not the 
Letter 'till five Years after it was written ^ that they 
went on but poorly, were Male content with their 
long ftay there $ That Will. Atkim was dead * That 
five of the Spaniards were come away, and that tho* 
they had not been much molefted by the Savages, 
yet they had had fome Skirmifhes with them ^ That 
they begg'd of him to write to me, to think of the 
Promife I had made, to fetch 5 em away that they 
might lee their own Country again before they 
dy'd. 

But I was gone a Wild Goofe Chafe indeed •, and 

They 



[ i«7 ] 

They who will have any more of me, muft be con- 
tent to follow me thro 5 a new Variety of Follies, 
Hardships, and Wild Adventures , wherein the Ju- 
ftice of Providence may be duly obferved, and we 
may fee how eafily Heaven can gorge us with our 
own Defires ; make the ttrongelt of our Wifhes to 
be our Affliction, and punifh us moft feverely with 
thofe very Things, which we think, it would be our 
utmoft Happinefs to be allow'd in 

Let no wife Man flatter himfelf, with the Strength 
of his own Judgment, as if he was able to chufe 
any particular Station of Life for himfelf : Man, 
is a fhort lighted Creature, fees but a very little 
Way before him $ and as his Paffions, are none of 
his beft Friends, fo his particular Affe£tions, are 
generally his worft Counfellors. 

I fay this, with Refpeft to the impetuous Defire 
I had from a Youth, to wander into the World ; 
and how evident it now was, that this Principle was 
preferv'd in me for my Punifhment : How it came 
on, the Manner, the Circumftance, and the Conclu- 
fion of it, it is eafy to give you Historically, and 
with its utmcft Variety of Particulars : But the fe- 
cret Ends of Divine Power, in thus permitting us, to 
be hurry'd down to the Stream of our own Defires, 
is only to be underftood of thofe who can Iiften to 
the Voice of Providence, and draw religious Confe- 
quences from God's Juftice and their own Miftakes. 

Be it, I had Bufinefs, or no Bufinefs> away I went; 
'tis no Time now to enlarge any farther upon the 
Reafon, or Abfurdity of my own Conduft ; but to 
come to the Hiftory, I was embark'd for the Voyage, 
and the Voyage I went. 

^ I fbould only add here, that my Honeft and truly 
pious Clergyman left me here ; a Ship being ready 
to go to Lisbon, he ask'd me leave to go thither ; 
being ftill, as be obFerv'd, bound never to finifh any 
Voyage he began : How happy had it been for me, 
if I had gone with him ! 

But 



[ i88 1 

But it was too late now * all things Heaven ap* 
points are beft 5 had I gone with him, 1 had never 
bad fo many things to be thankful for, and you had 
never heard of the fecond Part of the Travels and 
Adventures of Robin. Crvfoe $ fo I muft leave here 
the fruitlefs exclaiming at myfelf, and go on with 
my Voyage. 

From the Brajih, we made dire&ly away over the 
jfttantick Sea, to the Cape de bon Efperance, or as we 
call it, the Cape of Good Hope $ and had a tolerable 
good Voyage, our Courfe generally South-Eaft 5 now 
and then a Storm, and fome contrary Winds, but 
my Difafters at Sea were at an End ^ my future 
Rubs and crofs Events were to befal me op, (hore $ 
that it might appear, the Land was as welt prepared 
to be our Scourge, as the Sea $ when Heaven, who 
directs the Gircumftances of Things, pleafes to ap* 
appoint it to be fo. 

Our Ship was on a Trading Voyage, and had a 
Supra Cargo on board, who was to dire£t all her Mo- 
tions after fhe arrived at the Cape •, only being limit- 
ed to certain Numbers of Days, for ftay, by Char- 
ter-party, at the feveral Ports fhe was to go to : 
This was none of my Bufinefs, neither did 1 med- 
dle with it at all $ my Nephew, ihe Captain, and 
the Supra Cargo, adjufting all thofe things between 
them, as they thought fit. 

We made no ftay at the Cape, longer than was 
needful, to take in frefli Water •, but made the beft 
of our way, for the Coaft of Coremandel * we were 
indeed informed, that a French Man of War of 
fifty Guns, and two large Merchant Ships, were 
gone for the Indies, and as I knew we were at War 
with France, I had (bme Apprehenfions of them ; 
tut they went their own Way* and we heard no 
more of them.

iTian-Diftances, Trade- Winds, Situation of Ports, 
and the like 5 fuch as almoft all the Hiftories of 
long Navigation are full of, and which make the 
reading tirefome enough, and are perfe&ly unprofi- 
table to all that read, except only to thofe, who are 
to go to thofe Places themfelves. 

It is enough to name the Ports and Places, which 
we touched at, and what cccurr'd to us upon our 
palling from one to another. We touch'd firft at the 
Ifland of Madagafcar •, where, tho 5 the People are 
fierce and treacherous, and in particular, very well 
arm'd with Launces and Bows, which they trie with 
inconceivable Dexterity 5 yet we fared very well 
with them a while ^ they treated us very civilly, 
and for fcme Trifles, which we gave them, fuch as 
Knives, Sciffars, &c. they brought us eleven good 
fat Bollocks, middling in Size, but very good in 
Flefh -, which we took in, partly for frefh Provifi- 
ons for our prefent fpending, and the reft, to Sale 
for the Ship's life. 

We were obliged to ftay here fome Time, after we 
had furnifh'd ourfelves with Provifions * and I, that 
was always too curious, to look into every Nook of 
the World where ever I came, was for going on 
Shore as often as I could : It was on the Eaft Side 
of the Ifland that we went on Shore, one Evening, 
and the People, who by the Way are very numerous, 
came thronging about us, and flood gazing at us at 
a Diftance : As we had traded freely with them, 
and had been kindly ufed, we thought ourfelves in 
no Danger ^ but when we faw the People, we cut 
three Boughs out of a Tree, and fluck them up at a 
Diftance from us, which it feems, is a Mark in the 
Country not only of Truce and Friendship, but 
when it is accepted, the other Side fet up three 
Poles or Boughs alfo, which is a Signal, that they 
accept the Truce too-, but then, this is a known 
Condition of the Truce, that you are not to pafs be- 
yond their three Poles towards them, nor they to 

come 



come paft your three Poles or Boughs, towards you i 
To that. you are perfectly fecure within the three 
Poles, and all the Space between your Poles and 
theirs, is allowed like a Market, for free Convsrfe, 
Traffick, and Commerce : When you go there, you 
muft not carry your Weapons with you •, and if 
they come into that Space they flick up their Jave- 
lines and Launces, all at the firft Poles, and come 
on unarmed ; but if any Violence is offered them, 
and the Truce thereby broken $ away they run to 
the Poles, and lay hold of their Weapons, and then 
the Truce is at an End. 

It happened one Evening when we went on Shore, 
that a greater Number of their People came down 
than ufual, all was very friendly and civil : They 
brought with them feveral Kinds of Frovifions, for 
which we fatisfied them, with fuch Toys as we had* 
their Woman alio brought us Milk, and Roots, and 
feveral Things very acceptable to us, and all was 
quiet ; and we made us a little Tent or Hut, of fome 
Doughs of Trees, and lay on Shore all that Night. 

I know not what was the Occafion, but I was 
not fo well fatisfied to lye on Shore as the reft, and 
the Boat lying at an Anchor, about a Stone caft 
from the Land, with two Men in her to take care 
of her 5 I made one of them come on Shore, and 
getting fbme Boughs of Trees to cover us alfo in the 
Boat, I fpread the Sail on the Bottom of the Boar, 
and lay under the Cover of the Branches of Trees 
all Night. 

About two a Clock in the Morning, we heard 
one of our Men make a terrible Noife on the Shore, 
calling out for God's fake, to bring the Boat in, and 
come and help them for they were all like to be 
murther'd * at the fame time, I heard the firing of 
5 Muskets, which was the Number of the Guns 
they had, and that, three times over •, for it leems, 
the Natives here were not fo eafily frighted with 
Guns, as the Savages were in America, where I had 
to do with them. All 



[ ipl ] 

All this while, I knew not what was the Matter * 
but rouzing immediately from Sleep with the Noife, 
I caus'd the Boat to be thruft in, and refolv'd, with 
three Fufils we had on Board, to Land, and affift 
our Men. 

We got the Boat foon to the Shore, but our Men 
were in too much hafte: For being come to the 
Shore, they plunged into the Water, to get to the 
Boar, with all the Expedition they could, being pur- 
fued by between three and four hundred Men : Our 
Men were but Nine in all, and only five of them 
had Fufils with them * the reft indeed had Piftols 
and Swords, but they were of fmall ufe to them. 

We took up feven of our Men, and with Dif- 
ficulty enough too, three of them being very ill 
wounded •, and that which was ftill worfe, was, 
that while we flood in the Boat to take our Men 
in, we were in as much Danger as they were in on 
Shore 5 for they pour'd their Arrows in upon us id 
thick, that we were fain to barricade the Side of 
the Boat up with the Benches, and two or three 
loofe Boards, which to our great Satisfaftion, we 
had by mere Accident, or Providence rather^ in the 
Boat. 

And yet, had it been Day- light, they are it feems 
fuch exa& Marks-men, that if they could have feen 
but the leaft Part of any of us, they would have 
been fure of us $ we had by the Light of the Moon 
a little Sight of them, as they flood pelting us from 
the Shore with Darts and Arrows ; and having got 
ready our Fire-arms, we gave them a Volley, and 
we could hear by the Cries of fome of them, that 
we had wounded feveral ^ however, they flood thus 
in Battle Array on the Shore 'till break of Day, 
which we fupp^fe was, that they might fee the bet- 
ter to take their Aim at us. 

In this Condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh our Anchor, or fet up our Sail, becaufe 
we muft needs ftand up in the Boat, and they were 

as 



[ I?2 ] 

as fare to hit us, as we were to hit a Bird in a Tree 
with fmall Shot $ we made Signals of Diftrefs to 
the Ship, which, tho 5 we rode a League off, yet 
my Nephew the Captain hearing our firing, and by 
Glaffes, perceiving the Pofture we lay in, and that 
we fir'd towards the Shore, pretty well underftood 
us 5 and weighing Anchor, with all fpeed, he flood 
as near the Shore as he durft with the Ship, and 
then fent another Boat, with ten Hands in her, to af- 
fift us -, but we cali'd to them not to come too near, 
telling them what Condition we were in : However^ 
they flood in nearer too us * and one of the Men ta- 
king the End of a Tow-Line in his Hand, and keep- 
ing our Boat between him and the Enemy, fo that 
they could not perfe&ly fee him, fwam on board us, 
and made faft the Line to the Boat $ upon which we 
flipped our little Cable, and leaving our Anchor be- 
hind, they tow'd us out of the reach of the Arrows, 
we all the while lying ciofe behind the Barticado we 
had made. 

As loon as we were got from between the Ship 
and the Shore, that (he could lay her Side to the 
Shore, ftie run along juft by them and we pour'd 
in a Broad-fide among them loaden with Pieces of 
Iron and Lead, fmall Bullets, and fuch fluff, befides 
the great Shot* which made a terrible Havock 
amongft them* 

When we were got on board and out of Danger* 
we had time to examine into the Occafion of this 
Fray $ and indeed our Supra-Cargo who had been 
often in thofe Parts, put me upon it •, for he faid, 
he was fure the Inhabitants would not have touch'd 
us, after we had made a Truce, if we had not done 
fomething to provoke them to it. At length it 
came out (viz.) that an Old Women who had come 
to fell us fome Milk, had brought it within our 
Poles, with a young Woman with her, who alfo 
brought fome Roots or Herbs •, and while the Old 
Woman, whether (he was Mother to the young Wo* 

man. 



[ 1*3 1 

man or no, they could not tell, was felling us the 
Milk, one of our Men offer'd fbme Rudeneis to the 
Wench that was with her, at which the old Woman 
made a great Noife : However, the Seaman would 
not quit his Prize, but carried her out of the old 
Woman's Sight among the Trees, it being almoft 
dark $ the old Woman went away without her, 
and as we fuppofe, made an Out-cry among the 
People (he came from •, who upon Notice, rais'd 
this great Army upon us in three or four Hours -, 
and it was great odds* but we had been all de- 
ftroy'd. 

One of our Men was killed, with a Launce that 
was thrown at him, juft at the beginning of the 
Attack, as he falley'd out of the Tent we had made * 
the nft came off free, all but the Fellow who was 
the Occafion of all the Mifchief, who paid dear 
enough for his black Miftrefs $ for we could not 
hear what became of him, a great while; we lay 
upon the Shore two Days after, tho' the Wind pre- 
sented, and made Signals for him •, made our Boat 
fail up Shore and down Shore, feveral Leagues, but 
in vain* fo we were oblig'd to give him over, and 
if he alone had fuffer'd for it, the Lois had been the 
lefs. 

I could not fatisfy myfelf, however, without 
venturing on Shore once more, to try if I c^uld 
learn any Thing of him, or them ^ it was the third 
Night afcer the A&ion, that I had a great Mind^ 
to learn if I could by any Means, what Mifchief 
we had done, and how the Ga:ne ftood on the In* 
dians Side : 1 was careful to do it in the dark, kit 
we fhould be attacked again $ but I ought indeed to 
have been fure, that the Men I went with, had been 
under my Command, before I engag'J in a Thing fo 
hazardous and mifcirievous as \ was brought into by 
it, without my Knowledge or De%n. 

We took twenty (tout Fellows with us as ary 
in the Ship, befides the Supra Cargo and myfe f, 

N * and 



[ iS>4 ] 

and we landed two Hours before Midnight, at the 
fame Place where the Indians flood drawn up the 
Evening before * I landed here, becaufe my Defign 
as I have faid, was chiefly to fee if they had quit- 
ted the Field, and if they had left any Marks be* 
hind them of the Mifchief we had done them * and 
I thought, if we could furprize one or two of them, 
perhaps we might get our Man again by Way of 
Exchange. 

We landed without any Noife, and divided our 
Men into two Companies, whereof, the Boatfwain 
commanded one, and I the other : We neither 
could fee or hear any Body ftir when we landed, fo 
we march'd up, one Body at a Diftance from the 
other, to the Field of Battle : At firft, we could fee 
nothing it being very dark ; But by and by, our 
Boatfwain that lead the firtt Party, ftumbled and 
fell over a Dead Boy ; this made them halt a while, 
for knowing by the Circumftances that they were at 
the Place were the Indians had flood, they waited 
for my coming up $ here we concluded to halt 'till 
the Moon began to rife, which we knew would be in 
lefs than an Hour $ and then we could eafily difcern 
' the Havock we had made among them $ we told 
two and thirty Bodies upon the Ground, whereof 
two were not quite dead : Some had an Arm, 
and fome a Leg (hot off, and one his Head -, thofe 
that were wounded we fuppos'd, they had carried 
away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full Difco- 
very of all we could come at the Knowledge of, I 
was for going on Board again ^ but the Boatfwain 
and his Party of sen, fent me Word, that they were 
refolv'd to make a Vifit to the Indian Town, where 
thefe Dogs, as they calVd them, dwelt, and defied me 
to go along with them $ and if they could find 
them, as (till they fanfied they (hould, they did not 
doubt they /aid getting a good Booty, and it might 
be, tbev might find Tho. Jeffry there, that was the 
Marts ISame we had loft, . Had 



[ i?5 1 

Had they lent to ask my Leave to go, I knew 
well enough what Anfwer to have given them 5 for 
I would have commanded them inftantly on Board, 
knowing it was not a Hazard fie for us to run •, who 
had a Ship, and Ships loading in our Charge, and 
a Voyage to make, which depended very much up- 
on the Lives of the Men $ but as they lent me 
Word they were refolved to go, and only ask'd me 
and my Company to go along with them •, I pofi- 
tively refus'd it, and rofe up, for I was fitting on the 
Ground^ in Order to go to the Boat 5 one or two of 
the Men, began to importune me to go, and when I 
ftill refus'd pofitively, began to grumble, and fay they 
were not under my Command, and they would go : 
Come Jack, lay s one of the Men, will you go with 
me ? Pll go for one •, Jack faid he would, and ano- 
ther followed, and then another * and in a Word, 
they all left me but one, who with much difficulty 
too, 1 perfuaded to ftay $ fo the Supra Cargo and I, 
with the third Man, went back to the Boat, where 
I told them we would ftay for them, and take Care 
to take in as many of them as fhould be left * for I 
told 'em it was a mad Thing they were going about, 
and fuppofed moft of 'em would run the Fate of 
Tbo. Jetfry, 

They told me, like Seamen, they'd warrant it they 
would come off again, and they vvoald take care, 
fffc. So away they went : I entreated 'em to confider 
the Ship and the Voyage* that their Lives were 
not their own, and that they were entrufted with 
the Voyage in fome meafure h that if they mifcar- 
ry'd, the Ship might be lolt for want of their Help, 
and that they could net anfwer it to God or Man : 
I faid a great deal more to 'em on that Head, but 
I might as well have talk'd to the Main Matt of the 
Ship, they were mad upon their Journey, only 
they gave me good Words, and begg'd 1 would not 
be angry-, Said, they would be very cautious, and 
they did not doubt but they would be back again in 

N 2 about 



about an Hour at fartheft •, for the Indian Town, 
they faid, was not above half a Mile off : Tb<? 
the) found it above two fciles before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away, as above ; and tho' 
the Attempt was defperate, and fuch, as none but 
mad Men would have gone about, yet to give 'em 
their due, they went about it warly as well as bold- 
ly : They were galantly armed, that's true -, for 
they had every Man a Fuzee or Musket, a Bayonet, 
and every Man a Piftol 5 feme of theta had broad 
Cutlafles, foitie of them Hangers and the Boarfwaiii 
arid Two more had Pole Axfes: Befides all which, 
they had among them Thirteen Hand-Grenados. 
Bolder Fellows, and better provided, never went 
about any wicked Work in the World. 

When they went out, their chief Defign was 
Plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding 
Gold there ^ but a Circumltance which none of 
them were aware of, fet therii on fire with Revenge, 
and made Devils of them all. When they came to 
the few Indian Houfes, which they thought had 
been the Town, which was not above half a Mile 
off} they were under a great Difappointment ^ for 
there were not above 12 or thirteen Houfes 5 and 
where the Town was, or how big, they knew not 1 
They confulted therefore what to do, and were 
fome time before they could refolve : For if they 
fell upon thefe, they muft cut all their Throats, 
and it was ten to one but fome of them might 
efcape, it being in the Night, tho' the Moon was 
up 5 and if one efcaped, he would run away, and 
raife all the Towns, ib they fhould have a whole 
Army upon them : Again, on the other hand, if 
they went away and left thofe untouched (for the 
People were ail alleep) they could not tell which 
Way to look for the Town. 

However, the laft was the beft Advice 5 fo they 
refolved to leave thofe Houfes, and look for the 
Town as well as they could : They went on a little 



* way* 



[ 197 ] 

way, and found a Cow tied to a Tree *, this they 
prefently concluded, would be a good Guide to 
them * for they faid, the Cow certainly belonged t$ 
the Town before r bem, or the Town behind them $ 
and if they untied her, they fhoi Id lee which Way 
(he went; if (he went back they had nothing to 
fay to her •, but if (he went forward, they had no- 
thing to do but to follow her : So they cut the Cord, 
which was made of twilled Flags, and the Cowwent 
on before them $ in aWord,theCowled them dire&ly 
to the Town, which as they report, confifted* of 
above 200 Houfes, or Hues ; and in fome of thefe, 
they found feveral Families living together. 

Here they found all in Silence $ as profoundly 
fecure, as Sleep, and a Country that had never 
feen an Enemy of that Kind, could make them * 
and firft, they calPd another Council to confider 
what they had to do * and in a Word, they re- 
folvM to divide themfelves into three Bodies, and 
to fet three Houfes on Fire in three Parts of the 
Town 1 and as the Men came out, to fetee th§m 
qnd bind them j, if any refifted, they need not tie, 
ask'd what to do then, and fo to fearch the reft of 
the Houfes for Plunder 5 but they refolv'd to march 
filently firft, thro 5 the Town, and fee what Dimen- 
$ons it was of, and if they might venture upon it 
or no, 

They did fo, and defperatety refolv'd that they 
would venture upon them •, but while they were 
animating one another to the Work, three of them 
that were a little before the reft, call out aloud, and 
told tKem they had found Thorn. Jefry •, they ail 
ran up to the Place, and fo it was indeed j for 
there they found the poor Fellow, hang'd up naked 
by one Arm, and his Throat cut •, there was an In- 
dian Houfe juft by the Tree, where they found fix- 
teen or feventeen of the principal Indians who had 
been concerned in the Fray with us before ^ and two 
or three of them wounded with our Shot j and our 



t i?8 ] 

Men found they were awake, and talking one to 
another in that Houfe, but knew not their Num- 
ber. 

The Sight of their poor mangled Comrade fo 
enrag'd 'em* as before, that they fwore to one ano- 
ther they would be reveng'd, and that not an Indi- 
an who came into their Hands fhould have Quarter, 
and to work they went immediately ^ and yet not fo 
madly as by the Rage and Fury they were in might 
be exps&ed. Their firft Care was to gee fomething 
that would foon take Fire ^ but after a little fearch, 
they found that would be to no purpofe 5 for molt 
of the Houfes were low, and Thatch'd with Flags 
or Rufhes, of which the Country is full h fo they 
prefently made fome wild Fire, as we call it r by wet- 
ting a little Powder in the Palms of their Hands, 
and in a quarter of an Hour they fet the Town on 
fire in four or five Places * and particularly that 
Houfe where the Indians were not gone to Bed. As 
foon as the Fire began to blaze, the poor frighted 
Creatures began to rufh out to fave their Lives * but 
met with their Fate in the Attempt, and efpecially 
at the Door, where ihey drove them back, the Boat- 
fwain himfeif kiOing one or two with his Pole- Ax \ 
The Houfe being large, and many in it, he did not 
care to go in, but caii'd for a Hand-Grenado, and , 
threw it among 'em, which at firft frighted 'em \ 
but when it burft, made fuch Havock among *em, 
that they cried out in a hideous manner. 

In fhort, mod of the Indians who were in the 
open Part of the Houfe, were killed or hurt with 
the Grenado, except two or three more who prefs'd 
to the Door, which the Boatfwain and two more 
kept with their Bayones in the Muzzles of their 
Pieces, and difpatch'd all who came that Way. 
But there was another Apartment in the Houle where 
the Prince or King, or whatfoever he was and feve- 
n\ others were, and thefe they kept in till the Houfe, 
which was by this time all of a light Flame, fell in 

fcpon 



[ *99 ] 

upon them, and they were fmother'd or burnt to- 
gether. 

All this while they fir'd not a Gun, becaufe they 
would not waken the People fafter than they could 
matter them ; but the Fire began to waken them fall 
enough, and our Fellows were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies $ for the Fire grew fo raging, all 
the Houfes being made of light combuftible Stuff, 
that they could hardly bear the Street between them, 
and their Bufinefs was to follow the Fire for the 
furer Execution : As fait as the Fire either forc'd 
the People out of thofe Houfes which were burning, 
or frighted them cut of others, our People were 
ready at their Doors to knock them on the Head, 
ftill calling and hallowing to one another to remem- 
ber Tho. Jeffvys. 

While this was daing, I muft confefsl was very 
uneafie, and efpecially when I faw the Flames of 
the Town, which, it being Night, feem'dto bejuft 
by me. 

Ny Nephew, the Captain, who was rcuzM by 
his Men too, feeing fuch a Fire, was very uneafie, 
not knowing what the Matter was, or what Danger 
I was in ; efpecially hearing the Guns too 5 for by 
this time they began to ufe their Fire- Arms •, a thou- 
fand Thoughts oppreft his Mind concerning me, 
and the Supra Cargo, what fhould become of us : 
And at laft, tho' he could ill fpare any more Men, 
yet not knowing what Exigence we might be in, he 
takes another Boat, and with 13 Men and himfel£ 
comes on Shore to me. 

He was furprte'd to fee me and the Supra-Cargo 
in the Boat with no more than two Men, for One 
had been left to keep the Boat $ and tho 3 he was glad 
that we were well, yet he was in the fame Impati- 
ence with us to know what was doings for the 
Noife continued and the Flajne encreas'd : I Con- 
fefs, it was next to an ImpoOlbiliry for any Men in 
the World to reftrain their Curiofity of knowing, 
N 4 vhajt 



[ 200 ] 

what had happeird, or their Concern for the Safety 
of the Men : In a Word, the Captain told me, he 
would go and help his Men. let what would come, 
I argu'd with him as 1 did before with the Men $ 
the Safety r the Ship, and the Danger of the 
Voyage, the Intereft of the Owners and Merchant, 
£fc, and told him, 1 would go and the two Men, and 
on fee if we could at a Diftance learn what was 
like co be the Event, and come back and tell him. 

It was all one, to talk to my Nephew, as it^was 
to talk to the reft before $ he would go befaid, and 
he only wifh'd he had left but ten Men in the Ship ; 
foi he couid not think of having his Men loft for 
want of Help,he had rather loofe theShip, the Voyage, 
and his Life and ail ; and fo, away went he. 

Nor was I any more able to ttay behind now, 
than I was to perfuade them noj to go before ; fo in 
fhort, the Capatin orderM two Men to row back 
the Pinnace, and fetch twelve Men more from the 
Sh!p, leaving the Long Boat at an Anchor, and that 
when they came back, fix Men fhould keep the two 
Boats and fix *?iore come after us * fo that he left 
only 1 6 Men in the Ship ^ for the whole Ship's 
Company confided of 65 Men, whereof two were 
loir in the firft Quarrel, which brought this Mi£ 
chief on. 

Being now on the March, you may he fure we 
felt little of the Ground we trode on •, and being 
guided by the Fire, we kept no Path, but went di- 
rettly to the Place of the Flame : If the Noife of 
the Guns was furprizing to us before, the Cries of 
the poor People were now of quite another Nature, 
and fiii'd us with Horror. I muft confefs I never was 
at the fackidg of a City, or at the taking of a 
Town, by ftorm. I have heard of Oliver CrGmwell 
taking Drogbeda in Ireland, and killing Man, Wo- 
man and Child : And I had read of Count TiBy t 
fack'pg of the City of Magdehurgh, and cutting the 
Throats of 32000 of all Sexes ; But I never had an 

Idea 



[ 201 ] 

Idea of the Thing itfelf before, nor is it poffible to 
defcribe ir, or the Horror which was upon our 
Minds at heaving it. 

However, we <vent on, and at length came to the 
Town, iho 3 there was no entring the Streets of ic 
for the Fire The firft Objeft we met with, was 
the Ruins of a Hut or Hcufe, or rather the Afhes of 
it, for the Houle was conlum'd ^ and juft before ir, 
plain now to be feen by the Light of the Fire, lay 
four Men and three Women kilPd * and as we 
thought, one or two more lay in the Heap among 
the Fire. In fliort, there were fuch lnttances of a 
Rage altogether barbarous, andof a Fury, fornething 
beyond what was human, that we thought it impof- 
fible our Men could be guilty of it ^ or if they 
were the Authors of it, we thought they every one 
of 5 em ought to be put to the worft of Deaths. 
But this was not all, we faw the Fire encreas'd for* 
ward, and the Cry went on juft as the Fire went on 5 
fo that we were in the utmoft Confufion. We ad- 
vanced a little Way farther, and behold, to our A- 
ftonifhment, three Women naked, and crying in a 
molt dreadful Manner, come flying, as if they had 
indeed had Wings, and after them iixteen or feven- 
teen Men, Natives, in the fame Terror, and Con- 
sternation with three of our EngliJI) Butchers, for I 
can call them w better \ in their Rear 5 who, when 
they could not overtake them, fir'd in among them, 
and one that was kilFd by their Shot fell down in 
our Sight ^ when the reft faw us, believing us to be 
their Enemies, and that we would Murther them as 
well as thofe that purfued them, they fet up a moft 
dreadful Shreik, efpecially the Women ^ and t,wo of 
them fell down as if already dead with the Fright. 

My very Soul fhrunk within me, and my Blood 
run chii in my Veins, when I faw this 5 and 1 believe, 
had the three Mvgllfh Sailors that purfu'd them come 
on, I had made our Men kill them all : However, 
we took fome Ways to let the poor flying Creatures 

know. 



[ 202 ] 

know, that we would not hurt them, and immedi- 
ately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with 
their Hands lifted up, made piteous Lamentation to 
us ta fave them, which we let them know we would ; 
whereupon they kept altogether in a Huddle clofe 
behind us for Protection. I left my Men drawn up 
together, and charged them to hurt no Body, but if 
poflible to get at fome of our People, and lee what 
.Devil it was pofleft them, and what they intended 
to do ^ and in a Word, to command them off; af- 
furing them, that if they ftay'd 'till Day-light, the/ 
would have an hundred thoufand Men about theis 
Ears : I fay, I left them, and went among thole fly- 
ing People, taking only two of our Men with me * 
and there was indeed a piteous Spectacle among 
them; Some of them had their Feet terribly burnt 
with trampling and running thro' the Fire, others 
their Hands burnt * one of the Women had fallen* 
down in the Fire, and wasalmoft burnt to Death be- 
fore (he could get out again ; two or three of the 
Men had Cuts in their Backs and Thighs from our 
Men parfuing $ and another wasfhot thro' the B.ody, 
and died while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the Occalion of 
all this was, but I could not underftand one Word 
they laid * tho 5 by Signs I perceived that fome of 
them knew not what was the Occalion therafelves. 
I was fo terrified in my Thoughts at this outrageous 
Attempt, that I could not ftay there $ but went back 
to my own Men, I told them my Refolution, and corn^ 
Branded them to follow me, when in the very Mo- 
ment came four of our Men with the Boatfwain at 
their Head, roving over the Heaps of Bodies they 
had killed, afl cover'd with Blood and Duft, as if 
they wanted more People to mafTacre, when oiif 
Men hallow'd to them as loud as they could hallow, 
and with much ado one of them made them hear; 
fo that they knew who we were, and came up to 
us. 

As 



1 C 203 ] 

As foon as the Boatfwain faw us, he fet up a 
Hallow like a Shout of Triumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come, and without bearing to 
hear me, Captain, fays he, Noble Captain, I am 
glad you are come ; we have not half done yet 5 
Villains, Hell-hound Dogs ! Til kill as many of them 
as poor Tom. has Hairs upon his Head. We have 
fworn to ipare none of them, we'll root out rhe ve- 
ry Nation of 'em from the Earth, and thus he run 
on, out of Breath too with A&ion, and would not 
give us leave to fpeak a Word. 

At laft, raiting my Voice, that I might filence him 
a little ? Barbarous Dog ! [aid J, what are you do- 
ing ? I won't have one Creature touched more, upon 
pain of Death. / charge yon upon your Life, to ftop 
your Hands, andJlandfliUhzi^ or you are a dead Man 
this Minute. 

Why, Sir, fays he, Do you know what you do, or 
what they have done ? If you want a Reafon for what 
we have done, come hither-, and with that he (hew'd 
me the poor Fellow hanging upon the Tree with his 
Throat cut. 

I confefs, I was urged then myfelf, and at another 
time fhould have been forward enough $ but I 
thought they had carried their Rage too far, and 
thought of Jacob's Words to his Sons Simeon and 
Levi ; Cnrfed be their Anger, for it was fierce ; and their 
Wrath, for it was cruel : But I had now a new Task 
upon my Hands $ for when the Men I carried with 
jne faw the Sight as I had done, I had as much to 
do to reftrain them, as I fhould have had with the 
other * nay, my Nephew himfelf fell in with them, 
and told me in their hearing that he was only con- 
cerned for fear of the Men being overpower'd $ for 
as to the People, he thought not one of 'em ought 
to live $ for they had all glutted themfelves with the 
Murther of the poor Man, and that they ought to 
be ufed like Murtherers. Up6n thefe Words, away 
run eight of my Men with the Boatfwain and his 

Crew, 



f 2Q4 } 

Crew, to compleat their bloody Work ^ and I fee- 
ing it quite out of my Power to reftrain them, came 
away penfive and fad ^ for I could not bear the Sight, 
much iefs the horrible Noife and Cries of the poor 
Wretches that fell into their Hands 

I got no Body to come back with me but the Su- 
pra-Cargo and two Men ^ and with thefe I walk'd 
back to the Boats. It was a very great Piece of Fol- 
ly in me, I confefs, to venture back, as it were 
alone 5 for as it began now to be almoft Day, and 
the Alarm had run over the Country, there (food 
about 40 Men arm'd with Launces and Bows at the 
little Place where the 1 2 or 1 3 Houfes Itood menti- 
oned before $ but by Accident I mifs'd the Place* 
and came dire&ly to the Sea-fide, and by the Time 
I got to the Sea-fide it was broad- Day ^ immediate- 
ly I took the Pinnace, and went aboard, and fent her 
back to afiitt the Men in what might happen. 

I obferv'd that about the Time that I came to the 
Boat- fide, that the Fire was pretty well out, and' 
the Noife abated ^ but in about half an Hour after 
I got on Board, I heard a Volley of our Mens Fire^ 
arms, and faw a great Smoak 5 this, as I underftood 
afterwards was our Men falling upon th§ forty 'Meo^ 
who, as I faid, ftood at the few Houfes on the Way I 
of whom they kilFd fixtcen or feventeen, and fet all" 
thofe Houfes on Fire, but did not meddle with the 
Women or Children. 

By that Time the Men got to the Shore again 
with the Pinnace, our Men began to appear * they 
came dropping in fome, and fome, not in two Bo* 
ddes,and in Form as they went out, but alt in Heaps, 
flraggling here, and there, in fuch a Manner, that a 
fmall Force of refolute Men might have cut them 

But the Dread of them was upon the whole 
Country : The People were amaz'd, and furpriz'd, 
and fo frighted, that I believe a hundred of 'em 
would have fled at the Sight of but five of our 

Men« 



[ 205 ] 

&len. Nor in all this terrible A&ion was there fc 
ftdan who made any confiderable Defence -, they were 
fo furpriz'd between the Terror of the Fire, and the 
fudden Attack of our Men in the Dark, that they 
knew not which Way to turn themfelves $ for if 
they fled one Way, they were met by one Parry $ 
If back again, by another : So that they were every 
where knocked dfcwn : Nor did any of our Men re- 
ceive the leaft hurt ^ e&cept one who firain'd his 
Foot, and another had one of his Hands very much 
burnt. 

1 was very angry with my Nephew the Captain* 
and indeed with all the Men in my Mind, but with 
him in particular ^ as well for his a£ling fo out <o£* 
his Duty as Commander of the Ship, and having 
the Charge of the Voyage Upon him, as In his 
prompting, rather than cooling the rage of his Men, 
In fo bloody and cruel an Enterprise. My Nephew 
anfwer'd me very refpeEtfully •, but told me, that 
when he faw the Body of the poor Seaman, whom 
they had murther'd in fuch a cruel and barbarous 
manner, he was not Matter ofhimfelf, neither could 
he govern his Paffion. He own'd, he fhould not 
have done fo^ as he was Commaricter of the Ship 5 
but as he was a Man, ard Nature mcvM Mm, he 
tould not bear it. As for the reft of the Men, they 
were not fubjeft to me at al), and they knew k 
well enough $ fo they took no notice of my DiP- 
like. 

The next Day we fet fail, fo we never heard any 
more of it : Our Men differ d in the Account of the 
Number they kilFd : Some laid one Thing form ano- 
ther $ but according to the belt of their Actotrnts 
J)ut altogether, they kilPd or deftroy'd about 150 
People, Men, Women, and Children, and left not 
a Houfe ftanding in the Town. 

As for the poor Fellow Tho. Jeffry^ as he was 
quite dead,forhisThj[jat was fo cut,that his Head was 
half off, it would do him no Service to bring him 

away. 



[ 206 1 

away, fo they left him where they found him, only 
took him down from the Tree where he was hang'd 
by one Hand. 

However juft our Men thought this A£tion, I was 
againft them in it $ and I always after that Time, 
told them God would blaft the Voyage $ for I look'd 
upon all the Blood they fhed that Night to be Mur- 
ther in them : For tho 5 it is true, that they had killed. 
Jho. Jefrys, yet it was as true that Jejfrys was the 
Aggfeflbr, had broken the Truce, and had violated 
or debauched a young Woman of theirs, who came 
to our Camp innocently $ and on the Faith of their 
publick Capitulation. 

The Boatfwain defended this Quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board : He faid, It was true that 
we feem'd to break the Truce, but really had not, 
and that the War was begun the Night before by 
the Natives themfeives, who had (hot us, and kilPd 
one of our Men without any juft Provocation •, fo 
that as we were in a Capacity to fight them then, 
we might alfo be in a Capacity to do ourfelves Ju- 
ftice upon them, in an extraordinary Manner, that 
tho 3 the poor Man had taken a little Liberty with a 
Wench, he ought not to have been murther'd, and 
that in fuch a villanous Manner : And that they did 
nothing but what was juft, and what the Laws of 
God allow'd to be done to Murtherers. 

One would think this fhould have been enough to 
have warn'd us, againft going on Shore among Hea- 
thens and Barbarians : But it is impoffible to make 
Mankind wife, but at their own Expence, and their 
Experience feems to be always of moft life to them, 
when it is deareft bought. 

We were now bound to the Gulph of Ferfa, and 
from thence to the Coaft of Coremandel, only to 
touch at Surrat : But the chief of the Supra-Cargo's 
Defign lay at the Bay of Bengale^ where if he mifs'd of 
his Bufinefs outward bound, he was to go up to China, 
and return to the Coaft as he came Home. 

The 



[ 207 ] 

The firft Difafter that befel us, was in the Gulpk 
of Perfia, where five of our Men venturing on Shore, 
on the Arabian Side of the Gulph, were furroun- 
ded by the Arabs, and either all kill'd, or carry'd 
away into Slavery ; the reft of the Boats Crew were 
not able to refcue them, and had but juft Time to 
get off their Boat. I began to upbraid them with 
the juft Retribution of Heaven in this Cafe : But 
the Boatfwain very warmly told me, he thought I 
went farther in my Cenfures, than I could (hew any 
Warrant for in Scripture, and referr'd to the 13 St. 
Luke, Verfe4th. where our Saviour intimates, that 
thofe Men, on whom the Tower of Sitcom fell, were 
not Sinners above all the Galileans : But that which 
indeed put me to Silence in the Cafe, was that none 
of thefe five Men, who were now loft, were of the 
Number of thofe who went on Shore to the Maffa- 
ere of Madagafcar 5 (fo I always caWd it, tb<? our Mtn 
could not bear the Jford MafTacre with any Patience z ) 
And indeed, this laft Circumftance, as I have foid> 
put me to Silence for the prefent. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this Sub- 
je&, had worie Confluences than I expe&ed $ and 
the Boatfwain, who had been the Head of the At- 
tempt, came up boldly to me one Tim?, and told 
me, he found, that I continually brought that Affair 
upon the Stage, that I made unjuft Reflexions upon 
it, and had ufed the Men very ill on tnat Account, 
and himfelf in particular * that as I was but a Paf- 
fenger, and had no Command in the Ship, or Con- 
cern in the Voyage they were not oblidg'd to bear 
it 5 that they did not know, but I might have fomc 
ill Defign in my Head, and perhaps to call them to 
Account for it, when they came to England-, and 
that therefore, unlefs I would refolve to have done 
with it * and alio, not to concern myfelf any far- 
ther with him, or any of his Affairs, he would leave 
the Ship *, for he did not think it was fafe to iail 
with me among them. 

I heard 



t 208 ] 

I heard him patiently enough 'till he had done, 
and then told him, that 1 did confefs I had all along 
oppos'd the Majfacre of Madagascar, for fuch I would 
always call it $ and that \ had on all Occafions fpo- 
ken my Mind freely about it, tho' not more upon 
him than any of the reft : That as to my having no 
Command in the Ship, that was true : nor did I ex- 
ercife any Authority, only took my Liberty of fpeak- 
ing my Mind in Things which publickly concerned 
us all 5 and what Concern 1 had in the Voyage was 
none of his Bufinefs $ that I was a confiderable Owner 
of the Ship •, and in that Claim 1 conceived I had a 
Right to fpeak even farther than I had yet done, 
and would not be accountable to him or any one elfe, 
and begun to be a little warm with him : He made 
but little Reply to meat that Time, and I thought 
that Affair had been over. We were at this Time in 
the Road at Bengale, and being willing to fee the 
Place, I went on Shore with the Supra-Cargo in the 
Ship's Boat, to divert myfelf, and towards Evening, 
was preparing to go on Board, when one of the 
Men came to me, and told me, he would not have 
me trouble myfelf to come down to the Boar, for 
they had Orders not to carry me on Board* Any one 
may guefs what a Surprize 1 was in at fv infolent a 
Meffage ; and 1 ask'd the Man who bad him deliver 
that Errand to me > He toJdme, theCockfwain. I 
faid no more to the Fellow, but bad him Ier them 
know he had delivered his Meffage, and that I had 
given him no Anfwer to it. 

I immediately went and found cut the Supra-Car- 
go, and told him the Story, adding what I prefemly 
forefaw (viz ) That there would certainly bes Mu- 
tiny in the Ship, and entreared him to go immedi- 
ately on Board the Ship in an Indian Bo^r, and ac- 
quaint the Captain of it : But I might ha'fbar'd this 
Intelligence ^ for before I had ipoken to him on 
Shore, the Matter was eftected on Board. The Boat- 
fwain, the Gunner, the Carpenter •, and in a Word, 

alj 



[ 205> ] 

all the Inferiour Officers, as foon as I was gone off 
in the Boat, came up to the Quarter- Deck, and de- 
fied to fpeak with the Captain, and there the Boat- 
fwain making a long Harangue for the Fellow talked 
very well, and repeating all he had faid to me, told 
the Captain in few Words, That as I was now gone 
peaceably on Shore, they were loth to ufe any Vio- 
lence with me ♦, which, if I had not gone on Shore, 
they would otherwife have done, to bblidge me to 
have gone : They therefore thought fie to tell him, 
That as they fhipp'd themfelves to ferve in the Ship 
under his Command, they would perform it faith- 
fully : But if 1 would not quit the Ship, or the 
Captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave 
the Ship, and fail no farther with him $ and at that 
W6rd, ALL, he turn'd his Face about towards 
the Main-malt, which was it feems the Signal agre- 
ed on between them * at which, all the Seamen be- 
ing got together, they cry'd out, One and A L L, 
One and ALL. 

My Nephew, the Captain, was a Man of Spirit, 
and of great Prefence of Mind * and tho 3 he was 
furpriz'd, you may be fure, at the Thing, yet he 
told them calmly, that he would confider of the 
Thing, but that he could do nothing in it, 'till he 
had fpoken to me about it. He us'd fome Argu- 
ments with them, to fhew them the Qnreafonable- 
nefs and Injuftice of the Thing : But it was all in 
Vain, they iwore and fhook Hands round, before his 
Face, that they would go all on Shore, unlefs he 
would engage to them, not to fuffer me to come any 
ftiore on Board the Ship. 

This was a hard Article upon him, who knew his 
Obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it ^ fo he began to talk cavalierly to them, told 
them that I was a very confiderable Owner of the 
Ship, and that in Juftice he could not put me out 
of my own Houle * that this was next Door to ferv- 
ing me, as the famous Pirate Kid had done, who 

O made 



[ 210 ] 

made the Mutiny in a Ship, fet the Captain on 
Shore in an uninhabited Ifland, and run away with 
the Ship ^ that let them go into what Ship they 
would, if ever they came to England again, it would 
coft them dear * that the Ship was mine, and that 
he would not put me out of it ^ and that he would 
lather looie the Ship and the Voyage too, than dif 
oblige me ib much $ fo they might do as they piea- 
fed : However, he would go on Shore, and talk with 
me on Shore, and invited the Boatfwain to go with 
him, and perhaps they might accommodate the 
Matter with me. 

But they all rejected the Propofal * and faid, they 
would have nothing to do with me any more, nei- 
ther on Board, or on Shore $ and if I came on 
Board, they would all go on Shore* Well, faid 
the Captain, if you are all on this Mind, let me go 
on Shore and talk with him •, fb away he came to 
me with this Account, a little after the Meffage had 
been brought to me from the Cockfwain. 

I was very glad to fee my Nephew, I muft con- 
fefs 5 for 1 was not without Apprehenfions, that 
they would confine him by Violence, fet fail, and 
fun away with the Ship, and then I had been ftripp'd 
naked in a remote Country, and nothing to help my 
felf : In fhort, I had been in a worfe Cafe, than 
when I was all alone in the Ifland. 

But they had not come that length, it feems, to 
my great fatisfa£Hon $ and when my Nephew told 
me what they had faid to him, and how they had 
fworn, and fhook Hands, that they would one and 
all leave the Ship, if I was fufFer'd to come on 
Board, I told him, he fhould not be concerned at 
it at all, for I would ftay on Shore. I only defir'd 
he would take Care and lend me all my neceffary 
Things on Shore, and leave ,me a fufficient Sum of 
Money, and I would find my Way to England^ as 
well as I could. 

This 



[ 2» ] 

This was a heavy Piece of News to my Nephew; 
hut there was no Way to help it, but to comply 
with it : So, in fhort, he went on Board the Ship 
again, and fatisfy'd the Men, that his Uncle had 
yielded to their Importunity, and had fent for his 
Goods from on Board the Ship ; fo the Matter was 
over in a very few Hours, the Men return'd to their 
Duty, and I began to confider what Courfe I fhould 
fleer. 

I was now alone in the remoteft Part of the 
World, as I think I may call it $ for I was near three 
thoufand Leagues by Sea farther off from England, 
than I was at my Illand * only it is true, I might 
travel here by Land over the Great Mogul's Coun- 
try to Suratte, migh go from thence to Bafora by 
Sea, up the Gulph oi?erJia y and from thence might 
take the Way of Caravans, over the Defarts of 
Arabia to Aleppo and Scanderoon ^ from thence by 
Sea again into Italy, and fb over Land into France, 
and this put together might be at leaft a full Diame- 
ter of the Globe •, but if it were to be meafur'd, I 
fuppofe it would appear to be a great deal more. 

1 had another Way before me, which was to 
wait for fbme Englijf) Ships, which were coming 
to Fengale from Achin on the Ifland of Sumatra, 
and get Paflage on Board them for England: But 
as I came hither without any Concern with the £«- 
glijh EaJlJndia Company, fo it would be difficult to 
go from hence without their Licenfe, unlefs with 
great Favour of the Captains of the Ships, or of 
the Companies Fa&ors, and to both, I was an utter 
Stranger 

Here I had the particular Pleafure, fpeaking by 
Contraries, to fee the Ship fet Sail without me $ a 
Treatment I think a Man in my Circumftances 
force ever met with, except from Pirates running 
away with a Ship, and fetting thofe that would not 
agree with their Villany, on Shore : Indeed this 
was next Door to it, both Ways % however, my 
O 2 Nephew 



[ 2ia ] 

Nephew left me two Servants, or rather, one Com- 
panion, and one Servant, the firft was Clerk to the 
Furfer, who he engagg'd to go with me, and the 
other was his own Servant •, I took me alfo a good 
Lodging in the Houfe of an Englifi Woman, where 
feverai Merchants lodg'd •, fome French, two Itali- 
ans^ or rather Jews, and one Englijb Man : Here I 
was handfomely enough entertained ^ and that I 
might not be faid to run rafhly upon any Thing, I 
ftay'd here above nine Months, conlidering what 
Courfe to take, and how to manage myfelf, I had 
ibme EngliJIi Goods with me of Value, and a confi- 
derable Sum of Money, my Nephew furnifhing me 
with a thoufand Pieces of Eight, and a Letter of 
Credit for more, if I had Occafion, that I might 
not be ftraiten'd whatever might happen. 

I quickly difpos'd of my Goods, and to Advan- 
tage too i and, as I originally intended, I brought 
here fome very good Diamonds, which, of all 
other Things, was the moft proper for me, in my 
Circumftances, becaufe I might always carry my 
Whole Eftate about me. 

After a long Stay here, and many Propofals made 
for my return to England, but none falling out to 
ifly Mind, the Engliflj Merchant who lodged with 
me, and with whom I had contracted an intimate 
Acquaintance, came to me one Morning : Country- 
man, fays he, I have a Projeft to communicate to 
you, which, as it fuits with my Thoughts, may for 
ought I know, fuit with youfs alfo, when you fhall 
have thoroughly confidered it. 

Here we are potted, fays be^ you hy Accident, and 
I by my own Choice, in a Part of the World very 
remote from our own Country 5 but it is in a Coun^ 
try, where, by us who underftood Trade and Buli- 
nefs, a great deal of Money is to be got : If you 
will put a thoufand Pound to my thoufand Pound, 
we will hire a Ship here, the firft we can get to our 
Minds ; you fhall be Captain, Fll be Merchant, 

and 



C 2i3 3 

and we will go a Trading Voyage to Chim ; for 
what fhould we ftand (till for ? The whole World 
is in Motion, rouling round and round $ all the 
Creatures of God, heavenly Bodies and earthly, are 
bufy and diligent, Why (hculd we be idle > There 
are no Drones, fays he living in the World but MeiV 
Why fhould we be of that Number ? 

I lik'd his Propofal very well, and the more, be- 
caule it feem'd to be exprefs-d with fo much good 
Will, and in fo friendly a Manner: I will not fay, 
but that I might by my loofe and unhing'd Circum- 
ftances be the fitter to embrace a Propofal for Trade, 
and indeed for any Thing elfe $ or, otherwife, 
Trade was none of my Element : However, I might 
perhaps fay with fome Truth, that if Trade was 
not my Element, Rambling was $ and no Propofal 
for feeing any Part of the World which I had never 
feen before, could poflibly come amifs to me. 

It was however, fome time before we could get 3 
Ship to our Minds * and when we had got a VefTel, 
it was not eafy to get Evglijh Sailors ^ that is to fay, 
fo many as were necefhry to govern the Voyage, 
and manage the Sailors which we fhould pick up 
there : After fome time we got a Mate, a Boat- 
fwain, and a Gunner, EngliJI) 5 a Dutch Carpenter, 
and three Portuguese Fore*maft Men * with thefe we 
found, we could do well enough, having Indian 
Sea men, fuch as they are, to make up. 

There are fo many Travellers, who have wrote 
the Hiftory of their Voyages and Travels this Way, 
that it would be very little Diverfion to any Body, 
to give a long Account of the Places we went to, 
and the People who inhabit there : Thofe Things I 
leave to others, and refer the Reader to thofe Journ- 
als and Travels of EngliJI}, Men, of which, many I 
find are publifh'd, and more promis'd every Day $ 
'tis enough to me to tell you, that we made the 
Voyage to dchin, in the Ifland of Sumatra firft, 
and from thence to Siam. where we exchanged fome 

O 3 <$ 



[ 214 ] 

of our Wares for Opium, and for fome Arrack, the 
firft, a Comodity which bears a great Price among 
the Chinefe, and which at that Time, was very much 
wanted there \ in a Word, we went up to Smkan^ 
made a very great Voyage ^ was eight Months out, 
and returned to Bengah^ and 1 was very well fatif- 
fy'd with my Adventure: 1 obferve that cur People 
in England, often admire how the Officers which 
the Company fend into India, and the Merchants 
which generally ftay there, get fuch very great fi- 
liates as they do, and fometimes come Home worth 
6o, to 70 and 100 thoufand Pound at a Time. 

But it is no Wonder, or at leaft we fhall fee fo 
much farther into it, when we confider the innume- 
rable Ports and Places where they have a free Com- 
merce, that it will then be no Wonder ; aid much 
lefs will it be fo, when we confider, that at all thofe 
Places and Ports where the Evglifi Ships come, 
N there is fo much, and Inch conttant Demand for 
the Growth of all other Countries, that there is a 
certain Vent for the Returns, as well as a Market 
abroad, for the Goods carried out. 

In fhort, we made a very good Voyage, and I got 
lb much Money by the firft Adventure, and fuch an 
Inlight into the Method of getting more, that had 
I been twenty Year younger, I fhould have been 
tempted to have ftaid here and fought no farther, 
for making my Fortune $ but what was all this, to 
a Man on the wrong Side of threefcore ? That was 
f ich enough, and came abroad mere in Obedience to 
a reftlefs Defire of feeing the World, than a cove- 
tuous Defire of getting in it $ and indeed 1 think, 
'tis with great Juitice, that I now call it a reftlefs 
Defire, for it was fo -, when I was at home, i was 
reftlefs to go abroad 5 and now I was abroad 
I was reftlefs to be at Home : J fay, what 
was this gain to me ? I was rich enough already, 
nor had I any unealy Defires about getting more 
Money 5 and therefore, the Profits of the Voyage 

to 



[215 1 

to me, were Things of no great Force, for the 
prompting me forward to farther Undertakings * 
Hence I thought, that by this Voyage, I had made 
no Progrefs at all * becaufe I was come back as I 
might call it, to the Place from whence I came, as 
to a Home ^ whereas, my Eye, which like that, 
which Solomon fpeaks of, was never fatisfed with 
Seefag, was ftill more defirous of Wand'ring and 
Seeing $ I was come into a Part of the World, which 
I was never in before •, and that Pare in particular, 
which I had heard much of-, and was refolv'd to 
lee as much of it as I could ^ and then I thought, I 
might fay, I had feen all the World, that was worth 
feeing. 

But my Fellow Traveller and I, had different 
Notions ; I do not name this, to infift upon my 
own, for I acknowledge his was the moft ju# and 
the moft fuited to the end of a Merchants Life ; 
who, when he is abroad upon Adventures, 'tis his 
Wifdom to ftick to that, as the beft Thing for him, 
which he is like to get the moft Money by : My 
new Friend kept himfelf to the Nature of the 
Thing, and would have been content to have gone 
like a Carrier's Horfe, always to the fame Inn, back- 
ward and forward, provided he could, as he calFd 
it, find his Account in it $ on the other Hand, mine 
as old as I was y was the Notion of a mad ramb- 
ling Boy, that never cares to fee a Thing twice 
over. 

But this was not all * I had a Kind of Impatience 
upon me to be nearer Home, and yet, the moft un- 
fettled Refolution immaginable, which Way to go ; 
in the Interval of thefe Confutations, my Friend, 
who was always upon the Search for Bufinefs, pro. 
pos'd another Voyage to me, (viz.) among the 
Spice Iflands* and to bring Home a Loading of 
Cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts $ Places 
where indeed the Dutch do Trade, but the Iflands, be*' 
longing partly to the Spaniards j tho* qre went not fo 

O 4 far* 



[ *«« ] 

far, but to fome other, where they have not the 
whole Power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon^ &c. 
We were not long in preparing for this Voyage ; 
the ch^ef Difficulty was in bringing me to come in- 
to it -, however, at laft nothing elfe offering, and 
finding that really ftirring about and Trading, the 
Protr being fo great, and as I may lay certain, had 
more ^leafure in it, and more Satisfaftion to the 
Mind, than fitting 'ftill, >hich to me efpecially, was 
the unhappieft Part of Life : I refolv'd on this Voy- 
age tOo, which we made very fiiccefsfully, touching 
at Borvcv, a -.id (everal Iflands, whofe Names 1 do 
not remember, and ume Home in about five 
Months 5 we fold our Spice, which was chiefly 
Cloves, and fome Nutmegs, to the Perjian Merch- 
ants, who carried them away for the Gulph ^ rd 
making near five of one, we. realty got a great deal 
of Money. 

My Friend, when we made up this Account 
fmil'd at me -, weil now, faid he, with a forr of 
agreeib'e infult upon my indolent Temper 5 is not 
this better than walking about here, like a Man of 
nothing to do^ and fpending our Time in flaring at 
the Nonfenfe and Ignorance of the Pagans? Why 
trulv, fays 1 my Friend, I think it is -, and I begin 
to be a Convert to the Principles of Merchandizing ^ 
but I mult tell you, faid I, by the Way, you do 
not know what I am a doing, for if once I conquer, 
my backwardnefs, and imbark heartily ; as old as I 
am, I (hall harrafs you up and down tfie World, 'till 
I tire you 5 for I (hall puifue it fo eagerly, I (hall 
never let you lye ftill. 

But to be (hort with my Speculations, a little 
while after this, there came in a Dutch Ship from 
Batavia h fhe was a Coafter, not an European Trader, 
and of about two hundred Tun Burthen : The Men, 
as they pretended 'having been fo fickly, that the Cap* 
tain had not Men enough to go to Sea with * he lay 
fcy at Bengal, and as if having got Money enough, 



[ *i7 ] 

or being willing for other Reafons, to gafor Europe, 
h~ gave pubiick Notice, that he would fell his Ship : 
This came to my Ears before my new Partner heard 
of it * and I h ad a great Mind to buy it, fo I goes 
Home to him, and told him of it •, he confiders a 
while for he was no rafhMan neither •, but mufing 
fome T*me, he reply 5 d, fhe is a little to big, but 
however, we will have her : Accordingly we bought 
the Ship, and agreeing with the Mafter, we paid for 
her, and took Poffeflion $ when we had done fo, 
we refblv'd to entertain the Men if we could, to 
join them with thofe we had, for the purfuing our 
Bufinefs •, but on a fudden, they having received 
not their Wages, but their (hare of the Money, as 
we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to be 
found : We enquir'd much about them, and at length 
were told, that they were all gone together by Land 
to Agra^ the great City of the Moguls Refidence 5 
and from thence were to travel to Suratte, and fo by 
Sea, to the Gulph of Perjia. 

Nothing had fo heartily troubled me a good 
while •, as that I mifs'd the Opportunity of going 
with them * for fuch a Ramble I thought, and in 
inch Company as would both have guarded me, and 
diverted me, would have fuited mightily with my 
great Defign $ and I fhould both have feen the 
World, and gone homewards too $ but I was much 
better fatisfied a few Days after, when I came to 
know what fort of Fellows they were $ for in Jfwt 9 
their Hiftory was, that this Man they calFd Captain 
was the Gunner only, not the Commander * that 
they had been a Trading Voyage, in which, they 
were attack'd on Shore, by fome of the Mallayans y 
who had kilPd the Captain and three of his Men y 
and that after the Captain was kili'd, thefe Men, 
Eleven in Number, had refolv'd to run away with 
the Ship, which they did \ and had brought her in 
at the Bay of Bengale^ leaving the Mate and five Men 
niore on Shore, of whom, we (hall hear farther. 

Well 



[ ai8 ] 

Well, let them come by the Ship how they would, 
we came honeftly by her, as we thought h tho' we 
did not, lconfefs examine into Things fo exa£Uy as 
we ought, for we never enquired any Thing of the 
Seamen ; who, if wfe had examined, would certain- 
ly have faulter'd in their Accounts, contradifted 
one another, and perhaps contradi&ed themfelves ^ 
or one how or other, we fhould have feen Reafon 
to have fufpe&ed them ; but the Man fhew'd us a 
Bill of Sale for the Ship, to one Emanuel Clofterjko- 
ven, or fome fuch Name •, for I fuppofe it was all 
a Forgery, and calPd himfelf by that Name, and 
we could not contradiQ him * and being withal, a 
little too unwary, or at leaft, having no Sufpicion of 
the Thing, we went thro 5 with our Bargain. 

We pick'd up fome more Englifl? Seamen here af- 
ter this, and fome Dutch j and now we refolved for 
a fecond Voyage, to the South Eaft for Cloves, &c. 
that is to fay, among the Philippine and MoUucco 
Ifles 5 and in fhort, not to fill this Part of my Story 
with Trifles, when what is yet to come, is fo re- 
markable 5 I fpent from firft to laft, fix Years in 
this Country, trading from Port to Port, backward 
and forward, and with very good Succefs * and was 
now the laft Year with my Partner, going in the 
Ship above-mention'd, on a Voyage to China $ but 
defigning firft to Siam to buy Rice. 

In this Voyage, being by contrary Winds oblgi'd 
to beat up and down a great while in the Straits of 
MaHacca, and among the Iflands •, we were no foon- 
er got clear of thole difficult Seas, but we found 
our Ship had fprung a Leak, and we were not able 
by all our Induftry to find out where it was : This 
forc'd us to make for fome Port, and my Partner, 
who knew the Country better than I did* dire&ed 
the Captain to put into the River of Cambodia, for 
I had made the Englifh Mate one Mr, Thomfon, Cap* 
iain^ not being willing to take the Charge of the Ship 

upon 



[ 2Ip 1 

tipon myfelf : This River lies on the North Side of 
the great Bay or Gulph, which goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on Shore 
for Retrefhment, there comes to me one Day an 
EngliJIi Man, and he was it feems a Gunner's Mate, 
on board an ErgliJI) Eajl- India Ship, which rode in 
the fame River, up at, or near the City of Cambo- 
dia ; what brought him hither we knew not 5 but 
he conies up ro me, and fpeaking EvgliJI) : Sir, fays 
he. u re a Stranger to me, and 1 to you •, but I 
fr' - rnething to tell you, that very nearly Cott- 
er u 

k'd fteadily at him a good while, and 
th ught at fiilt I had known him, but I did not ; if 
i very nearly concerns me, faid I, and notycurfelf, 
what moves you to tell it me ? 1 am moved, fays he, 
by the eminent Danger you are in, and for ought I 
fee, you have no knowledge of it 5 1 know no Dan- 
ger lam in, faid I, but that my Ship is leaky, and 
I cannot find it out * but 1 propofe to lay her a- 
Ground to Morrow, to fee if I cjn find it ; but Sir, 
fays he, leaky, or not leaky, find it, or not find it, 
you will be wiler than to lay your Ship on Shore to 
Morrow, when you hear what 1 have to fay to you 5 
do you know Sir, faid he, the Town of Cambodia^ 
lyes about fifteen Leagues up this River > and there 
are two large EvgliJI) Ships about five Leagues on 
this Side, and three Dutch $ well faid I, and what is 
that to me ? Why Sit, faid be, is it for a Man that 
is upon fuch Adventures as you are upon, to come 
into a Port, and not examine firft what Ships there 
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them ? 
I fuppofe you don't think you are a Match for them: 
I was amufed very much at his Difcourfe, but not 
amaz'd at it, for I could not conceive what he meant; 
and I turn'd fhort upon him and faid, Sir, I wifh 
you would explain yourfelf $ I cannot imagine what 
Reafon I have to be afraid of any of the Company's 
Ships or Dutch Ships $ I am no Interloper, what can 
they have to fay to me ? He 



[ 220 ] 

He look'd like a Man half angry, half pleased, 
and pauling a while, but fmiling ^ well Sir, fays he, 
if you think yourfelf fecure, you muft take your 
Chance ; I am forry your Fate fhould blind you, 
againft good Advice ^ but aflure yourfelf if you do 
not put to Sea immediately, you will the very next 
Tide be attacked by five Long- Boats full of Men, 
and perhaps if you are taken, you'll be hang'd for a 
Pirate, and the Particulars be examined afterwards : 
1 thought Sir, added he, I fhould have met witjh a 
letter Reception than this, for doing you a Piece of 
Service of fuch Importance : lean never be ungrate- 
ful, faid /, for any Service or to any Man that of- 
fers me any Kindnefs, but it is paft my Comprehen- 
sion laid I, what they fhould have fuch a Defigti 
wpon nie for * however, jinca yon fay, there is no 
Time to be loft, and that there is fome villainous 
Defign in Hand againft me -, 111 go on board this 
Minute, and put to Sea immediately, if my Men 
can ftop the leak, or if we can fwim without (top- 
ping it * But, Sir, faid I, (hall I go away ignorant 
of the Reafon of all this ? Can you give me no far- 
ther Light into it > 

I can tell you but Part of the Story, Sir, fays he, 
fcut I have a Dutch Seamen herewith me, and I be- 
lieve I could purfuade him to tell you the reft ; but 
there is fcarce time for it. But the fhort of the 
Story is this, the firft Part of which, I fuppofe, you 
know well enough, (viz.) that you was with this 
Ship at Sumatra •, that there your Captain was mur- 
ther'd by the MaUayam, with three of his Men ; 
and that you, or fome of thofe who were on Board 
with you, ran away with the Ship, and are fince 
turn'd URATES ; this is the Sum of the Story, 
and you will be all fete'd as Pirates I can aflure you; 
and executed with very little Ceremony •, for you 
know, Merchants Ships fhew but little Law to Pf- 
rates y if they get them in their Power. 

Now 



[ 221 ] 

Now you fpeak plain EngUJf), fa id I, and I thank 
you •, and tho' I know nothing, rhat we have done, 
like what you talk of, but am fure we came honeft- 
ly and fairly by the Ship, yet feeing fuch Work is a 
doing as you hy, and that you feem to mean honeit- 
ly, I'll be upon my Guard $ nay, Sir, fays he, do 
not talk of being upon your Guard ^ the beft De- 
fence is to be out of the Danger; if you hav« any 
Regard to your Life, and the Life of all your Men$ 
put out to Sea without fail at High Water, and as 
you have a whole Tide before you, you will be gone 
too far out before they can come down, for they 
will come away at High Water * and as they have 
twenty Miles to come, you get near two Hours of 
them, by the Difference of the Tide, not reckoning 
the length of the Way 5 befides, as they are only 
Boats, and not Ships, they wil) not venture to follow 
you far out to Sea, efpecially if it blows. 

We\\fays J, you have been very kind in this, what 
fhall I do to you, for make you amends ? Sir, fays 
he, you may not be fo willing to make me any 
amends, becaufe you may not be convinced of the 
Truth of it : I'll make an offer to you 5 1 have nine- 

teen Months Pay due to me, on board the Ship — 

which I came out of England in, and the Dutch 
Man that is with me, has feven Months Pay due to 
him * if you will make good our Pay to us, we will 
go along with you $ if you find nothing more in it; 
we will defire no more 5 but if we do convince you, 
that we have fav'd your Lives, and the Ship, and 
the Lives of ail the Men in her, we will leave the 
reft to you. 

I confented to this readily, and went immediately 
on board, and the two Men with me ^ as foon as f 
came to the Ship Side, my Partner who was on 
board, came out on the Quarter-Deck, and cali'd 
to me with a great deal of Joy, ho! O ho I we 
have flopped the leak ! we have flopped the leak ! Say 
you fo, /aid J, thank God 5 but weigh the Anchor 

then 



[ 222 ] 

then immediately : Weigh ! Say he : What do ycu 
mean by that ? What is the Matter, fays he ? Ask 
no Queftions fays J, but all Hands to work, and 
weighs without looting a Minute : He was furpriz'd, 
but however, he cali'd the Captain, and he immedi- 
ately ordered the Anchor to be got up -, and tho* 
the Tide was not quite done, yet a little Land 
Breeze blowing, we ttood out to Sea •, then I call'd 
him into the Cabin and told him the Story at large, 
and we calFd in the Men, and they told us the reft 
of it 5 but as it took us up a great deal of Time, 
fo before we had done, a Sea-man comes to the Ca- 
bin Door, and calls out to us, that the Captain bad 
him tell us, we were chas'd $ ch^d fays J, by who, 
and by what ? By five Sloops or Boats, fays the 
Fellow, full of Men ; very well, faid /, then it is 
apparent there is fomething in it ^ in the next Place 
I ordered all our Men to be calFd up, and told 
them, that there was a Defign to feize the Ship, 
and to take us for Pirates, and ask'd them, if they 
would ftand by us, and by one another * the Men 
anfwered chearfully, that one and all, they would 
live and die with us : Then I ask'd the Captain, 
what Way he thought beft for us to manage a 
Fight with them * tor refill them I refolved we 
would, and that to the laft drop-, he faid readily, 
That the Way was to keep them off with our great 
Shot, as long as we could, and then to fire at them 
with our in\all Arms to keep them from boarding 
us 5 but when neither of thefe would do any long- 
er, we fhould retire to our clofe Quarters ; perhaps 
they had not Materials to break open our Bulk- 
Heads, or get in upon us. 

The Gunner had in the mean Time Order, to 
bring two Guns to bear fore and aft, out of the 
Steerage, ro clear the Deck, and loaded them with 
Mufquit- Bullets and fmall Pieces of old Iron, and 
whpt next came to Hand, and thus we made ready 
for Fight i but all this while we kept out to Sea, 

with 



C 223 ] 

with Wind enough ; and could fee the Boats at a 
Diltance, being five large Long-Boats, following us, 
with all the fail they could make. 

Two of thefe Boats, which by our Glafles we 
could fee were Englifa had out failed the reft, were 
near two Leagues a Head of them, and gain'd upon 
us confiderably •, fo that we found they would come 
up with us ^ upon which, we fired a Gun without 
a Shot, to intimate, that they fhould bring too, 
and we put out a Flag of Truce, as a Signal for 
Parley * but they kept crowding after us, 'till they 
came within Shot : Upon this we took in our white 
Flag, they having made no Anfwer to it, hung out 
a red Flag, and fired at them with a Shot : Not- 
withftanding this, they came on, 'till they were 
near enough to call to them with a fpeaking Trum- 
pet, which we had on Board •, fo we calPd to them, 
and bid them keep off at their Peril. 

It was all one, they crowded after us, and endea- 
voured to come under our Stern, fo to board us on 
our Quarter •, upon which, feeing they were refo- 
lute for Mifchief, and depended upon the ftrength 
that followed them, 1 ordered to bring the Ship too, 
fo that they lay upon our Broad-fide, when immedi- 
ately we fir'd five Guns at them * one of which, 
had been levelled fo true, as to carry away the Stern 
of the hindermoft Boat, and bring them to the Ne- 
ceffity of taking down their Sail, and running all to 
the Head of the Boat to keep her from finking * fo 
fhe lay by, and had enough of it * but feeing the 
foremoft Boat crowd on after us, we made ready to 
fire at her in particular. 

While this was doing, one of the three Boats 
that was behind, being forwarder than the other 
two, made up to the Boat which we had difabled, to 
relieve her, and we could afterwards fee her take 
out the Men ^ we calPd again to the foremoft Boar, 
and ofFer'd a Truce to parley again, and to know 
what was her Bufinefs with us j but had no Anfwer, 

only 



[ 224 r 

only (he crowded clofe under our Stern ; upon this 
out Gunner, who was a very dexterous Fellow, ruri 
out his two Chafe-Guns and fired again at her * 
but the fhot miffing, the Men in the Boat (homed, 
wav'd their Caps, and came on 5 but the Gunner 
getting quickly ready again, fir'd among them the 
fecond Time "5 one Shot of which, tho 5 it mifs'd 
the Boat itfel£ yet fell in among the Men, and we 
could eafily fee, had done a great deal of Mifchief 
among them * but we taking no notice of thar, 
war'd the Ship again, and brought our Quarter to 
bear upon them * and firing three Guns more, we 
found the Boat was fplit almoft to Pieces $ in parti- 
cular, her Rudder, and a Piece of her Stern was 
(hot quite away, fo they handed their Sail immedi- 
ately, and were in great Diforder $ but to compleat 
their Misfortune, our Gunner let fly two Guns at 
them again * where he hit them we could not tell, 
but we found the Boat was finking, and fome of the 
Men already in the Water $ upon this, I immedi- 
ately man'd out our Pinnace, which we had kept 
clofe by our Side, with Orders to pick up fome of 
the Men if they could and fave them from drown- 
ing, and immediately to come on board with them 5 
becaufe we faw the reft of the Boats began to come 
up * our Men in the Pinnace followed their Orders, 
and took up three Men * one of which, was juft 
drowning, and it was a good while before we could 
recover him * as foon as they were on Board, we 
crouded all the Sail we could make, and flood far- 
ther out to Sea, and we found that when the other 
three Boats came up to the firft two, they gave over 
their Chace 

Being thus delivered from a Danger, which tho* 
I knew not the Reafon of it, yet feem'd to be much 
greater than I apprehended * I took Care that we 
would change our Courfe, and not let any one ima- 
gine whither we were going * fo we flood out to 
Sea Eaft ward, qjrite out of the Courfe of all Euro- 
pean 



[ 225 ] 

pean Ships, whether they were bound to China, or 
any where elfe, within the Commerce of the Euro- 
pean Nations. 

When we were now at Sea, we began to confult 
with the two Seamen, and enquire firft what the 
meaning of all this fhould be, and the Dutch Man 
let us into the fecret of it at once ^ telling us that 
the Fellow that fold us the Ship, as wefaid, Was no 
more than a Thief, that had run away with her: 
Then he told us, how the Captain, whofe Name 
too he told us, tho D I do not remember it now, Was 
treacheroufly murthered by the Natives on the 
Coaft of Mallaca, with three of his Men, and that 
he, this Dutch Man, and four more got into the 
Woods, where they wandred a brut a great while ; 
'till at length, he in particular, in a miraculous 
manner made his Efcape, and fwam off to a Dutch 
Ship, which failing near the Shore, in its Way from 
China^ had fent their Boat on Shore for frefti Water 5 
that he durlt not come to that Part of the Shore 
where the Boat was, but made fhift in the Night, 
to take into the Water farther off, and fwimtninga 
great while, at laft the Ship's Boat took him up. 

He then told us, that he wenr to Battavia, where 
two of the Sea- men belonging to the Ship arriv'd, 
having deferted the reft in their Travels, and gave an 
Account th3t the Fellow who had run away with 
the Ship, fold her at Bevgale, to a Set of Pirates, 
which were gone a Cruifing in her ^ and that they 
bad already taken an Ehgli/b Ship and two Dutch 
Ships very richly laden. 

This later Part, we found to Concern us dire£Hy, 
and tho' we knew it to be falfe 5 yet as my Partner 
faid very vvell, if we had fallen into their Hands, 
and they had had fuch a Prepofition again us before- 
hand, it had been in vain for us to have defended 
ourfeives, otto hope fot any good Quarters at their 
Hands ; efpectally confidering that our Actufers had 
been our Judges, and that we could have expe&ed 
P nothing 



[ 22$ ] 

nothing from them, but what Rage would have di- 
ctated, and ungoverned Paflion have executed $ and 
therefore it was his Opinion, we (hould go dire&ly 
back to Betigale, from whence we came, without 
putting in at any Port whatever * becaufe there, we 
could give a good Account of ourfelves, and could 
prove where we were when the Ship put in, who 
we bought her of, and the like ^ and which was 
more than all the reft, if we were put to the Ne- 
ceflity of bringing it before the proper Judges, we 
fhould be fure to have fome Juftice, and not be 
hang'd firft, and judg'd afterward. 

I was fbmetime of my'* Partner's Opinion •, but 
after a little more ferious thinking, I told him, I 
thought it was a very great Hazard for us to attempt 
returning to Betigale, for that we were on the wrong 
fide of the Straits of Malacca $ and that if the A- 
larm was given, we fhould be fure to be Way- laid 
on every fide, as well by theDntch of Battavia^ as the 
EngliJI) elfe-where$ that if we fhould betaken, as 
It were, running away, we fhould even condemn 
ourfelves, and there would want no more Evidence 
to deftroy us •, I alfo ask£d the EngliJI) Sailor's Opini- 
on, who faid, he was of my Mind, and that we 
fhould certainly be taken. 

This Danger, a little ftartled my Partner and all 
the Ship's Company •, and we immediately refolved 
to go away to the Coaft of Tojiquin^nd fb on to Chi- 
m> and from thence purfuing the firft Defign as to 
Trade, find fome Way or other to difpofe of the 
Ship, and come back in fome of the Veflels of the 
Country, fuch as we could get : This was approved 
of as the beft Method for our^Security •, and accord- 
ingly we fleered away N. N. %. keeping above fifty 
Leagues off from the ufual Courfe to the Ealtward. 

This however put us to fome Inconveniences $ for 
firft the Winds, when we came to that Diftance 
from the Shore, feem'd to be more fteadily againft 
us, blowing almoft Trade, as we call it 7 from the 

Eait* 



[ 227 1 

Eaft, and E N. E. fo that we were a long while 
upon our Voyage, and we were but ill provided 
with Viftuals for fo long a Run ; and which was 
(till worfe, there was fome Danger that thofe Engliffj 
and Dutch Ships, whofe Boats purfued us, whereof 
fome were bound that Way, might be got m before 
us ; and if nor, fome other Ship, bound fo China 
might have Information of us from them, and pur- 
fue us with the fame Vigour. 

I muft confefs, I was now very uneafy and 
thought my felf, including the late Efcape from the 
Long-Boats, to have been in the molt dangerous 
Condition that ever I was in, thro 5 all my paftLife- 
for whatever ill Circumftances I had been in, I was' 
never purfu'd for a Thief before ; nor had' I ever 
done any Thing that merited the Name of Difhoneft 
or Fraudulent, much lefs Thievifh : I had chiefly- 
been my own Enemy \ or as I may rightly fay, I had 
been no Body's Enemy but my own: But' now I 
was embarrafs'd in the worft Condition immagina- 
ble ; for tho' I W3s perfectly innocent, I was in no 
Condition to make that Innocence appear : And if 
I had been taken it had been under a fuppofed guilt 
of the wo>ft Kind ; at lealt, a Crime elteem'd fo 
amoijg the People ! had to do with. 

This made me very anxious to make an Efcape, 
tho , which Way to do ir, I knew not -, or what 
Port or Place we fliouid go to : My Partner feeing 
methusdejeaed, tho' he was the moft cencern'd at 
firit began to encourage me ; and defcribing to me 
the ievera! Ports of that Coait, told me he would 
put in, on the Coalt of Chochivcbina, or the Bay 
of Tonqiiln • intending to go afterwards to Macao 
a Town once in the Poffemon of the Portugveze, and' 
where ftill a great many European Families reHded 
and particularly the nvflionary Priefts ufually went 
thither, m order to their going forward to China. 

Hither then we refolv'd to go ; and accordingly, 

tho after a tedious and irregular Courfe, and very 

P 2 much 



[ 228 ] 

much ftraited for Provifions, we came within Sight 
of the Coaft very early in the Morning h and upon 
Refle&ion upon the paft Circumftances we were in, 
and the Danger if we had not efcaped, we refolvM 
to put into a fmall River, which, however had a 
Depth enough of Water for us, and to fee if we 
could, either over Land, or by the Ship's Pinnace, 
come to know wh^t Ships were in any Port therea- 
bouts. This happy Step, was indeed our Delive- 
rance ; for tho 5 we did not immediately fee any Eu- 
ropean Ships in the Bay of Tonquin, yet the next 
Morning, there came into the Bay two Dutch Ships, 
and a third without any Colours ipread out,but which 
we believ'd to be a Dutch Man, pafs'd by at about 
two Leagues Diftance, fleering for the Coaft of Chi- 
na 5 and in the Afternoon went by two EngUJb Ships 
fleering the fame Courfe h and thus, we thought, 
we faw ourfelves befet with Enemies, both one Way 
or other. The Place we were in was Wild and Bar- 
barous, the People Thieves, even by Occupation or 
Profeflion •, and tho 3 it is true, we had not much to 
feek of them, and except getting a few Provifions, 
car'd not how little we had to do with them, yet it 
was with much Difficulty, that we kept ourfelves 
from being infulted by them feveral Ways* 

We were in a fmall River of this Country, with- 
in a few Leagues of it's utmoft Limits Northward $ 
and by our Boat we coafted North-Eaft to the Point 
of Land, which opens the great Bay of Totiquin h 
and it was in this beating up along the Shore, that 
ive difcover'd as above, that in a Word, we were 
furroiinded with Enemies. The People we were 
among, were the moft barbarous of all the Inhabi- 
tants of the Coaft * having no Correfpondence with 
any other Nation, and dealing only in Fifh, and 
Oil, and fuch grofs Commodities * and it may be 
particularly feen, that they are, as If aid, the moft 
barbarous of any of the Inhabitant's ( viz. ) that 
among other Cuftoms they have this as one, (viz.) 

That 



[ 22p ] 

That if any Veffel have the Misfortune to be Ship- 
wrecked upon their Coaft, they prefently make their 
Men all Prifbners, that is to fay Slaves $ and it was 
not long before we found a fpice of their Kindnefs 
this Way, on the Occafion following. 

I have obferved above, that pur Ship fprung a 
Leak at Sea, and that we could not find it out 5 and 
however, it happened, that as t have faid it was 
ftopp'd unexpectedly in the happy Minute of our 
being to be feiz'd by the Dutch and Englijf) Ships in 
the Bay of Siam $ yet as we did not find the Ship fo 
perfe&ly tight and found as we defied, we refolv'd, 
while we were in this Place, to lay her on Shore, 
take out what heavy Things we had on Board, 
which were not many, and to wafh, and clean her 
Bottom ; and, if poffible, to find out where the 
Leaks weYe. 

Accordingly, having lighten'd the Ship, and 
brought all cur Guns, and other moveable Things to 
one fide, we try'd to bring her down, that we might 
come at her Bottom 5 for on fecond Thoughts, we 
did not care to lay her dry, a Ground, neithercould 
we find out a proper Place for it. 

The Inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with fuch a fight, came wondering down the Shore, 
to look at us ^ and feeing the Ship lie down on one 
fide in fuch a manner, and heeling in towards the 
Shore $ and not feeing our Men, who were at Work 
on her Bottom with Stages and with their Boats on 
the off-fide, they prefently concluded, that the Ship, 
was caft away and lay fo vqry faft on the Ground. 

On this Suppofition, they came all about us in two 
or thr^e Hours time, with ten or twelve large Boats, 
haying fome of them eight, fome ten Men in a Boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on Board, and 
plundered the Ship 5 and if they had found us there, 
to have carry'd us away for Slaves to their King, or 
whatever they call him^ for we knew nothing, who 
was their Governour. 

P ? When 



[ 230 1 

When they came up to the Ship, and began to 
row round her, they difcover'd us all hard at Work, 
on the Out fide of the Ship's bottom and fide, waffl- 
ing, and graving, and flopping, as every feafaring 
Man knows how. 

They ftood for a while gazing at us, and we, 
who were a little furpriz'd, could not imagine 
what their Defign was -, but being willing to be fure^ 
we took this Opportunity, to gee fome of us into 
the Ship, and others to hand down Arms and Am- 
munition to thofe that were at Work, to defend 
themfelves with if there fhould be Occifion ; and it 
was no more than Need ^ far in lefs than a quarter 
of an Hour's Confutation, they agreed, it feems, 
that the Ship was really a Wreck, that we were all 
at Work endeavouring to fave her, or to fave our 
our Lives by the Help of cur Boats, and when we 
hand our Arms into the Boats, they concluded, by 
that Motion, that we were endeavouring to fave 
fome of our Goods •, upon this they took it for 
granted, we al] belonged to them ^ and away they 
came Dire£lly upon our Men, as if it had been in a 
Line of Battle. 

Our Men, feeing fo many of them, began to be 
frighted ^ for we lay but in an ill Pofture to fight, 
and cry'd out to us, to know what they fhould do : 
I immediatly call'd to the Men who work'd upon the 
Stages, to flip them down, and get up the fide into 
the Ship i and bad thofe in the Boat to row round 
and come on Board * and thofe few of us, who were 
on Board, work'd with all the ftrength and hands we 
had, to bring the Ship to Rights $ but however, 
neither the Men upon the Stages, or thofe in the 
Boats, could do as they were ordered, before the 
Cocbinchineffes were upon them ^ and two of their 
Boats boarded our Long Boat, and began to lay hold 
of the Men as their Prifoners. 

The firft Man they laid hold of, was an Englijh- 
Seaman, a (tout ftrong Fellow, who having a Mus- 
ket 



I 231 ] 

ket in his Hand, never offer'd to fire it, but laid it 
down in the Boat like a Fool, as I thought: But he 
underftood his Bufinefs better than I could teach him 
for he grappled the Pagan, and dragg'd him, by 
main Force, out of their own Boat into ours $ where, 
taking him by the two Ears, he beat his Head fo 
againft the Boat's Gunnel, that the Fellow dy'd in- 
ftantly in his Hands 5 and in the mean time, a Dutch 
Man, who flood next, took up the Musket, and 
with the But-end of it, fo laid about him, that he 
knocked down five of them, who attempted to en- 
ter the Boat $ But this was doing little towards re- 
fitting thirty or forty Men, who fearieis, becaufe ig- 
norant of their Danger, began to throw themfelves 
into the Long-Boat, where we had but five Men in 
all to defend it : But one Accident gave our Men a 
compleat Viftory, which deferv'd our Laughter ra- 
ther than any Thing elfe, and that was this : 

Our Carpenter, being preparing to grave the Out- 
fide of the Ship, as well as to pay the Seams, where 
he had caulk'd her to flop the Leakes, had got two 
Kettles juft let down into the Boat ; one fill'd with 
boiling Pitch, and the other with Rofin, Tallow, 
and Oil, and fuch Stuff, as the Ship* Wrights ufe foe 
that Work ^ and the Man that tended the Carpenter, 
had a great Iron Ladle in his Hand, with which he 
fupply'd the Men that were at Work with that hot 
Stuff ; two of the Enemies Men entred the Boat juft 
where this Fellow ftood, being in the Fore-fheets ^ 
he immediately faluted them with a Ladle full of 
the Stuff, boiling hot, which fo burnt, and fcalded 
them, being half naked, that they roar'd out like 
two Bulls, and enrag'd with the Fire, leap'd both 
into the Sea : The Carpenter faw it, and cry'd our, 
Well done, Jack^ give them fome more of it ^ when 
ftepping forward himfel^ he takes one of their 
Mops, and dipping it in the Pitch-Pot^ he and his 
Man threw it among them fo plentifully, that, in 
fliort, of all the Men in three Boats, there was not 

P 4 one 



[ 2^2 ] 

one that was nof fcalded, and burnt with it in a moft 
frightful pitiful Manner, and made fuch a Howling 
and Crying, that I never heard a worfe Noife, and 
indeed nothing like it ^ for it is worth obferving, 
That tho' Pain Naturally makes all People cry out, 
yet every Nation have a particular Way of Excla- 
mation, and make Noifes as different from one ano- 
ther, as their Speech ^ I cannot give the Noife, thefe 
Creatures made, a better Name than Howling, nor 
a Name more proper to the Tone of it h for I never 
heard any Thing more like the Noife of the Wolves, 
which as I have faid, I heard howl in the Foreft on 
the Frontiers of Lavgnedoc. 

I was never pleas'd with a Vi£torv better in my 
Life * not only as it was a perfeft furprize to me, 
and that our Danger was imminent before : But as 
we got this Viftory without any Blood fhed, except 
of that Man the Fellow kilPd with his naked Hands, 
and which 1 was very much concerned at : for I was 
lick of killing fuch poor Savage Wretches, even 
tho'it was in my own Defence, knowing they came 
on Errands, which they thought jult, and knew no 
better * and that tho 5 it may be a juft Thing, becaufe 
neceffary, for there is no nec.flfary Wickednefs in 
Nature * yet I thought it was a fad Life, when we 
muft be always obliged to be killing our Fellow. 
Creatures to preferve ourfelves, indeed I think fo 
ftill * and I would even now fuffer a great deal, ra- 
ther than I would take away the Life, even of the 
wroft Perfon injuring me : I believe alfo, all cenfide- 
ring People, who know the Value of Life* would be 
of my Opinion, if they entred ferioufly into the con- 
fideration of it". 

But to return to my Story •, all the while this was 
doing, my Partner and I, who manag'd the reft of 
the Men on Board, had with great Dexterity 
brought the Ship almoft to Rights $ and having got- 
ten their Guns into their Places again, the Gunner 
call'd to me, to bid our Boat get out of the Way, 
* " for 



[233] 

for he would let fly among them. I calPd back 
again to him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the 
Carpenter would do the Work without him * but 
bad him heat another Pitch-Kettle, which our Cook, 
who was on Board, took Care of: But the Enemy 
was fo terrify'd with what they had met with in 
their firft Attack, that they would not come on 
again $ and ibme of them that were fartheft cff, fee- 
ing the Ship fuim, as it were upright, begun, as 
we iuppofed, to fee their Miftake, and give over 
the Enterpnze, finding it was not as they expe£led : 
Thus we got clear of this merry Fight ^ and having 
gotten fome Rice, and fome Roots, and Bread, 
with about fixteen good big Hogs on Board, tuo 
Days before h we refolv'd , to ftay here no longer, 
but go forward whatever came of it $ for we made 
no Doubt but we fhould be furrounded the next Day 
with Rogues enough, perhaps more than our Pitch- 
Kettle would difpofe of for us. 

We therefore got all our Things on Board the fame 
Evening, and the next Morning was ready to fail ; 
in the mean time, lying at an Anchor fome Diftance 
from the Shore, we were not fo much concerned, 
being now in a fighting Pofture, as well as in a fail- 
ing Pofture, if any Enemy had prefented : The next 
Day having finifhed our Work within Board, and 
finding our Ship was perfettly heafd of all her Leaks, 
we fet fail ^ we would have gone into the Bay of 
Tonquin h for we wanted to inform ourfelves of what 
was to be known concerning the Dutch Ships that 
had been there, but we durft not ftand in there $ 
becaufe we had feen feveral Ships go in, as we fup- 
pos'd, but a little before * fo we kept on N. E. to- 
wards the Ifle of Formofa, as much afraid of being 
feen by a Dutch or EngliJI) Merchant Ship, as a 
Dutch or EngliJI) Merchant Ship in the Mediteranean 
is of an Jlgerine Man of War. 

When we were thus got to Sea, we kept on N. E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Pbittippine 

Iflands 



[ 254 ] 

Iflands 5 and this we did that we might not fall into 
the Way of any of the European Ships •, and then 
we fteer'd North again, Yill we came to the Latitude 
of 22 Degrees, :o Minutes \ by which means we 
made the Ifland Formofa dire&ly, where we came to 
an Anchor, in order to get Water, and frefh Provi- 
fions, which the People there, who are very courte- 
ous and civil in their Manners, fupply'd us with 
willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually with 
us in all their Agreements and Bargains •, which is 
what we did not find among orher People ^ and may 
be owing to the Remains of Chriftianity, which 
was once Planted here by a Dutch Miffionary of Pro- 
teftants, and is a Teftimony of what I have often 
obferv'd, viz. That the Ghriftian Religion always 
civilizes the People, and reforms their Manners, 
where it is received, whether in Works faying Ef- 
fefts upon them or no. 

From hence we failed ftiii North, keeping the 
Coaft of China at an equal Diftance, *till we knew 
we were beyond all the Ports of China, where our 
European Ships ufuilly come •, being refolv'd, if pof- 
fible, not tc fall into any of their Hands, efpecially 
in this Country, where, as our Circumftances were, 
we could not fail of being entirely ruin'd ^ nay, fo 
great was my Fear in particular, as to my being ta- 
ken by them, that I believe firmly, I would much 
father have chofen to fall into the Hands of the 
Spanifi Inquifition. 

Being now come to the Latitude of 30 Degrees, 
we refolv'd to put into the firft trading Port we 
fhould come at 5 and Handing in for the Shore, a 
Boat came off two Leagues to us, with an old Par- 
ttigueze Pilot on Board, who knowing us to be an 
European Ship, came to offer his Service, which in- 
deed we were very glad of, and took him on Board ^ 
upon which, without asking us whether we would 
go, he difmifs'd the Boat he came in, and fent it 
back, 

I thought 



[ 235 ] 

I thought it was now (o much in our Choice, to 
make the old Man carry us whither we would •, that 
I began to talk with him about carrying us to the 
Gulph of Nanquin, which is the moft Northern 
Part of the Coaft of China : The old Man faid he 
knew the Gulph of Nanquin very well ^ but imiling, 
ask'd us what we would do there > 

I told him, we would fell our Cargo, and pur- 
chafe C&fwtf-Wares, Callicoes, Raw-Silks, Tea, 
Wrought-Silks, 2fc. and fo would return by the fame 
Courfe we came : He told us our belt Port had 
been to have put in at Macao, where we could not 
have faiPd of a Market for our Opium, to our Sa- 
tisfaction, and might for our Money have purchased 
all Sorts of CHw<*-Goods, as cheap as we could at 
Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old Man out of his 
Talk, of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, 
I told him, we were Gentlemen, as well as Merch- 
ants, and that we had a Mind to go and fee the 
great City of Pecking, and the famous Court of the 
Monarch of China. Why then, fays the old Man, 
you fhould go to Ningpo, where, by the River 
which runs into the Sea there, you may go up with- 
in five Leagues of the Great Canal. This Canal is a 
navigable made Stream, which goes thorow the 
Heart of that vaft Empire of China, crofles all the 
Rivers, paffes fome confiderable Hills by the Help 
of Sluices and Gates, and goes up to the City of 
Pecking, being in Length near 270 Leagues. 

Well, faid I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not 
our Bufinefs now : The great Queftion is, if you 
can carry us up to the City of Nanquin, from 
whence we can travel to Pecking afterwards ? Yes, 
he faid, he could do lb very well, and that there was 
a great Butch Ship gone up that Way juft before. 
This gave me a little Shock * a Butch Ship was now 
our Terror, and we had much rather have met the 
Devil j at leaft, if he had not come in too fright- 
ful 



[ 236 1 

fkl a Figure; we depended upon it, that a Dutch 
Ship would be our Deftru&ion, for we were in no 
Condition to fight them ; all the Ships they trade 
with into thofe Parts being of great Burthen, and 
of much greater Force than we were. 

The old Man found me a little confus'd, and un- 
der fome Concern, when he nam'd a Butch Ship, 
and faid to me, Sir you need be under no Apprehen- 
ftonsof the Dutch , I fuppofe they are not now at War 
with your Njtion : No, fays I, that's true $ but I 
feiow not what Liberties Men may take when they 
are out of the Reach of the Laws of their own 
Country ; Why, fays he, you are no Pirates, what 
iieod you fear > They will not meddle with peacea- 
Me Merchants fure. 

if I had any Blood in my Body that did not fly 
up into my Face at that Word, it was hinder'd by 
fome Stop in the Veflels, appointed by Nature t6 
circulate it ^ for it put me inco the greateft Difor- 
der and Confufion imaginable : Nor was it poffible 
for me to conceal it fo, but that the o\d Man eafily 
perceivM it. 

Sir, fays he, I find you are in fome Diforder in 
your Thoughts at my talk, pray be pleas'd to go 
which Way you think fit, and depend upon it, Til 
do you all the Service I can. Why, Seignior, faid 
J* it is true, I am a little unfettled in my Refoluti- 
on at this Time, whither to go in particular -, and [ 
am ibmething more fo, for what you faid about P£- 
rates, I hope there are no Pirates in thefe Seas ^ we 
are but in an ill Condition to meet with them, for 
you fee we have but a fmali Force, and but very 
weakly mann'd. 

O Sir, fays he, do not be concerned, I do not 
know that ;here has been any Pirates in thefe Seas 
thefe fifteen Years, except one which was feen, as I 
hear, in the Bay ofSiam, about a Month fince * but 
you may be affured fhe is gone to the Southward $ 
nor was file a Ship of any great Force, or fit for 

the 



£ 237 1 

the Work} fhe was not built for a Privateer, but 
was run away with by a Repribate Crew that were 
on Board, after the Captain and fome of his Men 
had been murther'd by the Malayans, at or near 
the Ifland oi Sumatra. 

What ! SAID 1, fieming to know nothing of the 
Matter, Did they murther the Captain ? No, /aid he^ 
I do not underttand that they murther'd him •, but 
as they afterwards run away with the Ship, it is ge- 
nerally believed they betrayed him into the Hands of 
the Malayans, who did murther him, and perhaps 
they procured them to do it : Why then, /aid /, 
they deferve Death as much as if they had done it 
themfelves : Nay, fays the old Man, they do deferve 
it, and they will certainly have it> if they light up- 
on any Englifi or Butch Ship 5 for they have all a- 
greed together, that if they meet that Rogue, the/ 
will give him no Quarter. 

But, faid I to him, you fay the Pirate is gone out 
of thefe Seas, how can they meet with him then ? 
Why, that is true, fays he, they do fay fo 5 but he 
was. as I tell you, in the Bay of Siam, in the River 
Cambodia, and was difcover'd there by fbme Dutch 
Men who belonged to the Ship, and who were left 
on Shore when they run away with her •, and fome 
Englifi and Dutch Traders being in the River, they 
were within a little of taking him : Nay, faid be, 
if the foremoft Boats had been well feconded by the 
reft, they had certainly taken him •, but he finding 
only two Boats within Reach of him, tack'd about, 
and fir'd at thefe two, and difabled them, before the 
other came up, and then (landing off to Sea, the 
other were not able to follow him, and fo he got 
away : But they have all fo exaft a Defcription of 
the Ship, that they will be fure to know him •, and 
where-ever they find him, they have vow'd to give 
no Quarter to either the Captain, or the Seamen, 
but to hang them all up at the Yard- Arm. 

What! 



t 238 3 

What ! fays I, will they execute them right or 
wrong, hang them firft, and judge them afterwards? 
O Sir ! fays the old Pilot, there's no Need to make 
a formal Bufinefs of it with fuch Rogues as thofe, 
let them tye them Back to Back, and fet them a div- 
ing $ 'tis no more than they richly deferve. 

I knew I had my old Man fait aboard, and that 
he could do me no Harm, fo that I turn'd fhort up- 
on him : Well now, Seignior, faid I, and this is 
the very Reafon, why I would have you carry us up 
to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao^ or to 
any other Part of the Country, where the EvgliJI) or 
Dutch Ships come $ for be it known to you, Seigni- 
or, thofe Captains of the EvgliJI: and Dutch Ships, 
are a Parcel of rafh, proud, inlblent Fellows, that 
neither knows what belongs to Juftice, nor how 
to behave themfelves, as the Laws of God and Na- 
ture dire£l $ but being proud of their Offices, and 
not underftanding their Power, they would a£t the 
Murtherers to punifh Robbers -, would take upon 
them to infultMen falflyaccufed,and determine them 
guilty without due Enquiry $ and perhaps I may 
live to call fome of them to an Account for it, 
where they may be taught how Juftice is to be exe- 
cuted, and that no Man ought to be treated as a 
Criminal, 'till fome Evidence may be had of the 
Crime, and that he is the Man. 

With this I told him, that this was the very Ship 
they attack'd, and gave him a full Account of the 
Skirmifh we had with their Boats, and how fool- 
ifhly and coward-like they behav'd. I told him all 
the Story of our buying the Ship, and how the 
Dutch Men ferved us. I told him the Reafons I had 
to , believe that this Story of killing the Matter by 
the Malayans was true •, as alfo the running away 
with the Ship $ but that it was all a Fi&ion of their 
own, to fuggeft that the Men were turn'd Pirates $ 
and they ought to have been fure it was fo, before 
they had ventured to attack us by Surprize, and 

* oblige 



C 239 ] 

oblige us to refift them 5 adding that they would 
have the Blood of thofe Men, who we kill'd there 
in our juft Defence, to anfwer for. 

The old Man was amaz'd at this Relation, and 
told us, we were very much in the Right to go away 
to the North, and that if he might advife us, it 
fhould be to fell the Ship in China, which we might 
very well do, and buy or build another in the 
Country 5 and, faid he, tho 5 you will not get fo 
good a Ship, yet you may get one able enough to 
carry you and all your Goods back again to Ben- 
gale, or any where elfe. 

I told him, I would take his Advice, when I 
came to any Port where I could find a Ship for my 
Turn, or get any Cuftomer to buy this : He reply'd, 
I (hould meet with Cuftomers enough for the Ship 
at Nanquin, and that a Chinefe Junk would ferve 
me very well to go back again •, and that he would 
procure me People, both to buy one, and fell the 
other. 

Well, but Seignior, fays I, as you fay they know 
the Ship fo well, 1 may perhaps, if 1 follow your 
Meafures, be inftrumentai to bring fome honeft in- 
nocent Men into a terrible Broil, and perhaps to be 
murtherM in cold Blood •, for wherever they find the 
Ship, they will prove the Guilt upon the Men, by 
proving this was the Ship, and fo innocent Men 
may probably be overpowered and murther'd : Why, 
fays the old Man, I'll find out a Way to prevent 
that alfo 1 for as 1 know ail thofe Commanders you 
fpeak of very well, and fhall fee them all as they 
pafs by, i will be fure to fet them to Rights in the 
Thing, and let them know that they had been fb 
much in the Wrong j that tho' the People, who 
were on board at firif, might run away with the Ship, 
yet it was not true chat they had turned Pirates $ 
and that in particular, rhefe were not the Men that 
firft went off with the Ship, but innocently bought 
her for their Trade , and I am purfuaded they will fo 

far 



[ 24° 1 

far believe me, as at leaft to aft more cautioufly for 
the Time to come. Well, fays J, and will you de- 
liver one Meffage to them from me ? Yes, I will, 
fays he, if you will give it under your Hand in Writ- 
ing, that I may be able to prove it came from you, 
and, not out of my own Head. I anfwered, That I 
would .readily give it him under my Hand •, fo I 
took a Pen, and Ink, and Paper, and wrote at large 
the Story of aflaulting me with the Long Boats, 
&c. the pretended Reafonof it, and the unjult cruel 
Defign of it ^ and concluded to the Commanders, 
that they had done what they not only fhould have 
been afham'd of, but alfb, that if ever they came to 
England, and I liv'd to fee them there, they fhould 
all pay dearly for it, if the Laws of my Country 
were not grown out of life before I arriv'd there. 

My old Pilot read this over and over again, and 
ask'd me feveral Times if I would ftand to it ? I an- 
fwer'd, I would ftand to it as long as I had any 
Thing left in the Word, being fenfible that 1 fhould 
one Time or other find an Opportunity to put it 
home to them : But we had no Occafion ever to let 
the Pilot carry this Letter ^ for he never went back 
again : While thofe Things were paffing between us, 
by Way of Difcourfe, we went forward, dire£Uy 
for Nanquin, and in about thirteen Days Sail came 
to an Anchor at the South Weft Point of the great 
Gulph of Nanqmn, where, by the Way, I came by 
Accident to underftand, the two Dutch Ships were 
gone that length before me, and that I fhould cer- 
tainly fall into their Hands $ I confulted my Partner 
again in this Exigency, and he was as much at a 
Lofs as I was, and would very gladly have been fafe 
on Shore almoft any where ^ however, I was not in 
fuch Perplexity neither, but I ask'd the old Pilor, 
if there was no Cteek or Harbour, which I might 
put into, and purfue my Bufinefe with the Chinefe 
privately, and be in no Danger of the Enemy : He 
told me if I would fail to the Southward about two 

and

and forty Leagues, there was a little Port calPd 
ghiincbavg, where the Fathers of the Million ufual- 
ly landed from Macao , on their Progrefs to teach the 
Chriftian Religion to the Chinefes^ and where no 
European Ships ever put in 5 and if I thought to put 
in there, 1 might confider what farther Courfe to 
take when 1 was on Shore : He confefs'd, he laid, 
it was not a Place for Merchants, except that at 
fome certain Times, they had a kind of a Fair there, 
when the Merchants from Japan came over thither 
to buy lYizChinefe Merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this Place $ the 
Name of the Port, as he call'd it, I may perhaps 
fpel] wrong ^ for I do not particularly remember it, 
having ioit this, together with the Names of many 
other Places, fet down in a little Pocket-Book, which 
was fpoilM by the Water, on an Accident, which I 
fhall relate in its Order h but this I remember, that 
the Chinefe^ or Japovefe Merchants we correfponded 
with, caDM it by a differing Name from that which 
our Portugueze Pilot gave it, and pronoune'4 it as 
above, JiHtinchavg. 

As we were unanimous in our Refolutions, to go 
to this Place, we weigfrU the next Day, having 
only gone twice on Shore, where we were to get 
frefli Water * on both which Occafions, the People 
of the Country were very civil to us, and brought 
us abundance of Things to fell to us $ Imean^ of 
btovijwm^ Plants, Roots, Tea, Rice, and fome Fowls; 
but nothing without Money. 

Wecame to the other Port, ("the Wind being con- 
trary) not 'till five Days, but it was very much to 
our Satisfaction $ and 1 was joyful, and I may fay, 
thankful, when I fet my Foot fafe on Shore 5 re- 
volving, and my Partner too, that if it was poffible 
to difpofe of ourfelves and Effects, any other Way, 
tho' not every Way to our Satisfaction, we would 
never fet one Foot on board that unhappy VefTel 
more 5 and indeed I muft acknowledge, that of all 

Q, the 



[ 242 ] 

the Circumftances of Life, that ever I had any Ex- 
perience of, nothing makes Mankind fo compleatly 
miferableas that, of being in conftantFear: Well 
does the Scripture fay, the Fear of Man brings a 
Snare $ it is a Life of Death, and the Mind is fo 
entirely fupprefs'd by it, that it is capable of no 
Relief * the animal Spirits fink and all the Vigour 
of Nature, which ufiially fupports Men tinder 
other Affii&ions, and is prefent to them in the great- 
eft Exigencies, fails them here. 

Nor did it fail of it's ufual Operations upon the 
Fancy, by heightening every Danger, reprefenting 
the Englijk and Butch Captains, to be Men uncapa- 
ble of hearing Reafbn, or of diftinguifhing between 
honeft Men and Rogues $ or between a Story calcu- 
lated for our own Turn, made out of nothing, on 
Purpofe to deceive ^ and a true genuine Account of 
our whole Voyage, Progrefe, and Defign $ for we 
might many Ways have convinc'd any reafonable 
Creature, that we were not Pirates $ the Goods we 
had on board, the Courfe we fteer'd, our frankly 
(hewing ourfelves, and entting into fuch and fuch 
Ports ; even our very Manner, the Force we had, 
the Number of Men, the few Arms, little Ammu- 
nition, fhort Provifions •, all thefe would have ferv'd 
to convince any Men, that we were no Pirates 5 the 
Opium, and other Goods we had on board, would 
make it appear the Ship had been at Bengale ; the 
Dutch Men, who it was fa id, had the Names of all 
thfe Men that was in the Ship, might eafily fee that 
we were a Mixture of EngUJI), Portugueze, and Inii* 
an*) and but two Dutch Men on board : Thefe, and 
many other particular Circumftances, might have 
made it evident to the Underftanding of any Com* 
mander, whofe Hands we might fall into, that we 
were no Pirates. 

But Fear, that blind ufelefs Paffion, worked ano- 
ther Way, and threw us into the Vapours 5 it be* 
wildred our Underftandings, and fet the Imagination 



[243 ] 

at Work, to form a thoufand terrible Things, that 
perhaps might never happen •, we firft fuppos'd, as 
indeed every Body had related to us, that the Sea- 
men on board the EngliJI) and Dutch Ships, but 
efpecially the Dutch, were fo enraged at the Name 
of a Pirate, and efpecially at our beating of their 
Boats, and efcaping, that they would not givfe 
themfelves leave to enquire, whether we were Pi- 
rates or no ^ but would execute us off Hand, as we 
call it, without giving us any Room for a Defence; 
we refle£led that there was really fo much apparent 
Evidence before them, that they would fcarce en* 
quire after any more •, as firft, That the Ship was 
certainly the fame, and that fome of the Seamen 
among them knew her, and had been on board her* 
and fecondly, That when we had intelligence at the 
River of Cambodia, that they were coming down to 
examine us, we fought their Boat and fled $ To that 
we made no doubt but they were as fully fatisfy'4 
of our being Pirates, as we were fatisfy'd of the 
contrary * and as I often faid, I knew not but I 
fhould have been apt to have taken thefe Circum- 
ftances for Evidence, if the Tables were turn'd, and 
my Cafe was theirs, and have made no Scruple of 
cutting all the Crew to Pieces, without believing, 
or perhaps confidering, what they might have to 
offer in their Defence. 

But let that be how it will, thole were our Ap- 
prehensions ^ and both my Partner and I too, fcarce 
flept a Night, without dreaming of Halters, and 
Yard- Arms ^ that is to fay, Gibbets, of fighting, 
and being taken • of killing, and being kill'd $ and 
one Night I was in fuch a Fury in my Dream, fan- 
cying the Dutch Men had boarded us, and I was 
knocking one of their Seamen down that I (truck 
my double Fift againlt the Side of the Cabin I lay 
in, with fuch a Force, as wounded my Hand moft 
grievoufly, broke my Knuckles, and ctu and bruited 
the Fiefh 5 fo that it not only wakM me out of my 
a 2 Sleep, 



[ *44 ] 

Sleep, but I was once afraid I fhould have loft two 
of my Fingers. 

Another Apprehenfion I had, was of the cruel 
Ufage we might meet with from them, if we fell 
into their Hands ; then the Story of Amboyna came 
into my Head, and how the Dutch, might perhaps 
torture us, as they did our Country-men there •, and 
make fome of our Men by extremity of Torture, 
confefs thofe Crimes they never were guilty of; 
own themfelves, and all of us to be Pirates, and fo 
they would put us to Death, with a formal Appear- 
ance of Juftice •, and that they might be tempted 
to do this, for the Gain of our Ship and Cargo, 
which was worth four or five thoufand Pound, put 
altogether. 

Thefe Things tormented me and my Partner too,. 
Night and Day •, nor did we confider that the Cap 
tains of Ships have no Authority to a£l thus ; and 
if we had furrender'd Prifoners to them, they coiild 
not anfwer the deftroying us, or torturing us, hut 
would be accountable for it, when they came in 
their own Country : This 1 fay, gave me no Satisfa- 
ction; for if they will a& thus with us, what Ad- 
vantage would it be to us, that they would be 
call'd to an Account for it; or if we were firft to 
be murthered, what Satisfaction would it be to us f 
to have them punifh'd when they came Home ? 

I cannot retrain taking Notice here, what Refie- 
ftions I now had upon the pait Variety of my par- 
ticular Circumftances 5 how hard I thought it was, 
that I who had fpent forty Years in a Life of conti- 
nued Difficulties, and was at laft come as it were to 
the Port of Haven, which all Men drive at, (viz,) 
to have Reft and Plenty, fhould be a Vohintier in 
new Sorrows* by my own nnhappy Choice $ and 
that I, who had efcaped fo many Dangers in my 
Youth, fhould now come to be hang'd in my old 
Age, and in fo remote a Place, for a Crime i was 
not in the leaft inclin'd to, much lefs guilty of ; 

and 



[ 245 3 

and in a Place and Circumftance, where Innocenc c 
was not like to be any Proteftion at all to me. 

After thefe Thoughts, fomething of Religion 
would come in * and I fhould be confidering, that 
this feem'd to me to be a Difpofition of immediate 
Providence, and I ought to look upon it, and fub- 
mit to it as fuch •, that although I was innocent as 
to Men, I was far from being innocent as to my 
Maker ^ and I ought to look in and examine, what 
other Crimes in my Life, were molt obvious to me; 
and for which, Providence might juftly intiifl: this 
Punifhment, as a Retribution , and that I ought to 
fubmit to this, juft as I would to a Ship- wreck, if 
it had pleafed God to have brought fuch a Difafter 
upon me. 

In its Turn, Natural Courage would fometimes 
take it's Place ^ and then I would be talking myfelf 
up to vigorous Refolutions, that I would not be ta- 
ken, to be barbiroufly ufed by a Parcel of mercy- 
lefs Wretches, in cold Blood ^ that it were much 
better to have fallen into the Hand of the Savages, 
who were Man-Eaters, and who, 1 was fure, would 
feaft upon me, when they they had taken me -, than 
by thole, who would perhaps glur their Rage upon 
me, by inhuman Tortures and Barbarities •, that 
in the Cafe of the Savages, I always refolv'd to die 
fighting, to the laft Gafp, and why fhould I not 
do fb now, feeing it was much more dreadful to me 
at leafi^ to think of falling into thefe Mens Hands, 
than ever it was to think of being eaten by Men $ 
for the Savages, give them their due, would not eat 
a Man 'till he was dead, and kiil'd them firft, as 
we do a Bullock 5 but that thefe Men had many 
Arts beyond the Cruelty of Death ; When ever thefe 
Thoughts prevaiPd, I was fure to put myfelf in a 
kind of Fever, with the Agitations of a fuppofed 
Fight ^ my Blood would boil, and my Eyes fparkle, 
3$ if I was engaged * and I always refolv'd that 1 
would take no Quarter at their Hands j but even at 



[ «4* 3 
laft, if I could refill no longer, I would blow up 
the Ship and all that was in her, and leave them but 
little Booty to boaft of 

By how much the greater Weight, the Anxieties 
and Perplexities of thefe Things were to our 
Thoughts while we were at Sea, by fo much the 
greater was our Satisfa&ion, when we law ourfelves 
on Shore $ and my Partner told me he dream'd, 
that he had a very heavy Load upon his Back, which 
he was to carry up a Hill, and found that he was 
not able to ftand long under it * but that the Por- 
tuguese Pilot came and took it off his Back, and 
the Hill diiappear'd, the Ground before him (hew- 
ing all fmooth and plain, and truly it was fo, we 
were all like Men, who had a Load taken off their 
Backs. 

For my Part, T had a Weight taken off from my 
Heart, that I was not able any longer to bear 5, 
and as I faid above, we refolv'd to go no more to 
Sea in that Ship : When we came on Shore, the old 
Pilot, who was now our Friend, got us a Lodging 
and a Ware- Houfe for our Goods, which by the 
Way, was much the fame •, it was a little Houfe or 
Hut, with a large Houfe joy ning to it, all built with 
Canes, and palliladoed round with large Canes, to 
keep out pilfering Thieves, of which, it feems 
there were not a few in that Country *, however, the 
Magistrates allowed us alfo a little Guard, and we 
had a Soldier with a kind of Halberd, or Half pike, 
who Rood Sentinel at our Door ; to whom we al- 
lowed a Point of Rice, and a little Piece of Money 
about the Value of three Pence per Day, fo that our 
Goods were kept very fafe. 

The Fair or Mart, ufually kept in this Place, had 
fceen over fome Time * however, we found that there 
were three or four Junks in the River, and two Ja- 
patiners $ I mean, Ships from Japan, with Goods 
which they had bought in China, and were not gone 
away, having Japonefe Merchants on Shore. 

Th? 



[ 247 1 

The firft Thing our eld Portugueze Pilot did for 
us, was to bring us acquainted with three mifliona- 
ry Romijb Priefts, who were in the Town, and who 
had been there fome Time, converting the People 
to Chriftianity * but we thought they made but 
poor Work of it, and made them but forry Chri- 
ftians when they had done $ however, that was 
none of our Bufinefs : One of thefe was a French 
Man, who they call'd Father Simon ; he was a jolly 
well conditioned Man, very free in his Converfation, 
not feeming fo ferious and grave as the other two 
did 5 one of whom was a Portugueze, and the 
other a Genoefe-, but Father Simon was courteous, 
eafy in his Manner, and very agreeable Company * 
the other two were more referv'd, feem'd rigid and 
auftere, and apply'd ferioufly to the Work they 
came about, (viz. 9 ) to talk with, and infinuate 
themfelves among the Inhabitants, where ever they 
had Opportunity •, we often eat and drank with 
thofe Men, and tho 5 1 mutt confefs, the Converfion 
as they call it, of the Chine fes to Chriftianity, is lb 
far from the true Converfion requifd, to bring Hea- 
then People to the Faith of Chrift, that it feems to 
amount to little more, than letting them know the 
Name of Chrift, and fay fome Prayers to the Virg- 
in Mary, and her Son, in a Tongue which they un- 
derftand not, and to crofs themfelves and the like ; 
yet it muft be confefs'd that thefe Religious, who 
we call Miflionaries, hare a firm Belief that thefe 
People (hall be fav'd, and that they are the Inftru- 
ments of it 5 and on this Account, they undergo 
not only the Fatigue of the Voyage, and Hazards 
of living in fuch Places, but oftentimes Death it- 
felf, with the moft violent Tortures, for the Sake 
of this Work ^ and it would be a great want of 
Charity in us, whatever Opinion we have of the 
Work itfelf, and the Manner of their doing it, if 
we fhouid not have a good Opinion of their Zeal, 
who undertake it with fo many Hazards, and who 

Q 4 have 



[ 2 4 8 ] 

have no Ptofpeft of the leaft Temporal Advantage 
to themfelves. 

But to return to my Story * this French Prieft Fa- 
ther Simon, was appointed it feems, by Order of 
the Chief of the Miffion, to go up to Peking, the 
Royal Seat of the Chinefe Emperor, and waited on- 
ly for another Prieft, who was ordered to come to 
him from Macao, to go along with him $ and we 
fcarce ever met together, but he was inviting me to 
go that Journey with him, telling me, how he 
would fhew me all the glorious Things of that 
mighty Empire $ and among the reft, the greatelt 
City in the World $ a City, faid he, that your Lon- 
don and our Paris put together cannot be equal to : 
This was the City of Peking, which I confefs is ve- 
ry great, and infinitely full of People $ but as I 
look'd on thofe Things with different Eyes from 
other Men, fo I fhall give my Opinion of them \n 
few Words, when I come in the Courfe of my Tra- 
vels, to fpeak more particularly of them. 

But firft, I come to my Fryar or Miflionary ^ di- 
ning with him one Day, and being very merry to- 
gether, I fhew'd fome little Inclination to go with 
him, and he prefs'd me and my Partner very hard, 
and with a great many Perfwafions to confent •, why 
Father Simon, fays my Partner, why fhould you de- 
fire our Company fo much : You know we are He- 
reticks, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us 
Company with any Pleafure ? O ! fays he, you 
may perhaps be good Catholicks in Time; my Bu- 
finefshere is to convert Heathens, and who knows 
but I may convert you too > Very well, Father faid 
I, fo you will Preach to us all the Way * I won't be 
troublefome to you, fays he, our Religion does not 
diveft us of good Manners ; befides, fays he, we 
are here like Country-men, and fo we are, compa- 
red to the Place we are in ^ and if you are Hugo- 
nots, and I a Catholick, we may be all Chriftians 
at Jaft j at leaft, faid he, we are all Gentlemen, 

and 



[ 24? ] 



and we may converfe fo, without being uneafy to 
one another. I lik'd that Part of his Difcourfe ve- 
ry well, and it began to put me in Mind of my 
Prieft, that 1 had left in the Brajils ; but this Fa- 
ther Simon did not come up to his Character, by a 
great deal * for tho' Father Simon had no appearance 
of a Criminal Levity in him neither, yet he had 
not that Fund of Chriftian Zeal, ftri£t Piety, and 
fincere AfFe&ion to Religion, that my other good 
Ecclefiaftick had, of whom 1 have fa id io much. 

But to leave him a little, tho' he never left us, 
nor foliciting us to go with him $ but we had fome- 
thing elfe before us at that time -, for we had all 
this while our Ship, and our Merchandize to dif- 
pofe of, and we began to be very doubtful what 
we fhould do, for we were now in a Place of very 
little Bufinefs $ and once I was about to venture to 
fail for the River ofKilam i and the City of K'anquin : 
But Providence feem'd now more vifible as I 
thought, than ever, to concern itfelf in our Affair $ 
and I was encouraged from this very Time, to 
think, I fhould one Way or other get out of this 
tangled Circumftance, andte brought Home to my 
own Country again, tho 5 I had not the leaft View 
of the Manner: And when I began fometimes to 
think of it, could not imagine by what Method it 
was to be done* Providence, I fay, began here to 
clear up our Way a little ^ and the fir ft Thing that 
offered was, that our old Portuguese Pilot brought a 
Japan Merchant to us, who began to enquire what 
Goods we had * and in the firlt Place, he bought 
all our Opium, and gave us a very good Price for it 
paying us in Gold by Weight, fome in fmall Pieces, 
of their own Coin, and fome in fmall Wedges, of 
about ten or eleven Ounces each. While we were 
dealing with him for our Opium, it came into my 
Head, that he might perhaps deal with us for the 
Ship too, and I ordered the Interpreter to propofe 
it to him ^ heflirunk up his Shoulders at it, when 
t it 



[ 250 ] 

it was firft proposed to him * but in a few Days af- 
ter, he came to me with one of the miffionary 
Priefts for his Interpreter, and told me, he had a 
Propofal to make to me, and that was this $ he had 
bought a great Quantity of Goods of us, when he 
had no Thoughts for Propofals made to him) of buy- 
ing the Ship j and that therefore, he had not Mo- 
ney enough to pay for the Ship 5 but if I would 
let the fame Men who were in the Ship navigate her, 
he would hire the Ship to go to Japan, and would 
fend them from thence to the Philippine Illands 
with another Loading, which he would pay the 
Freight of, before they went from Japan ; and 
that at their Return he would buy the Ship : I be- 
gan to Men to his Propofal, and fo eager did my 
Head ftill run upon Rambling, that I could not but 
begin to entertain a Notion myfeif of going with 
him, and fo to fail from the Philippine Iflands, away 
to the South Seas •, and accordingly I ask'd the Ja- 
ponefe Merchant, if he would not hire us to the 
Philippine Iflands, and difchargeus there * he faid, 
no he could not do that, for then he could not 
have the Return of his Cargo •, but he would di£ 
charge us in Japan, he faid, at the Ship's Return. 
Well, ftill I was for taking him at that Propofal, 
and going myfeif ^ but my Partner, wifer than my- 
feif, perfuaded me from it reprefenting the Dangers 
as well of the Seas, as of the Japonefes, who are a 
falfe, cruel, and treacherous People $ and then of 
the Spaniards at the Pbilippbtes, more falfe, more 
cruel, more treacherous than they. 

But to bring this long Turn of our Affairs to a 
a Conclufion •, the firft Thing we had to do, was to 
confult with the Captain of the Ship, and with his 
Men, and know if they were willing to go to Ja. 
fan h and while I was doing this, the young Man, 
who, as I faid, my Nephew had left with me as 
my Companion for my Travels, came to me, and 
told me, that he Thought that Voyage promifed 

very 



t *5« ] 

very fair, and that there was a great Profpeft of 
Advantage, and he would be very glad if I under- 
took it -, but that if I would not, and would give 
him leave, he would go as a Merchant, or how I 
pleas'd to order htm 5 that if ever he came to Eng- 
land, and I was there, and alive -, he would render 
me a faithful Account of hisSuccefs, and it fhould 
be as much mine as I pleas'd. 

1 was really loth to part with him, but confider- 
ing the Profpe& of Advantage which was really 
confiderable, and that he was a young Fellow, as 
likely to do well in it$ as any I knew, I inclined to 
let him go •, but firft I told him, I would confulc 
my Partner, and give him an Anfwer the next Day* 
my Partner and I difcours'd about it, and my Part- 
ner made a molt generous Offer ; he told me, you 
know it has been an unlucky Ship, and we both re- 
folve not to go to Sea in it again $ if your Steward* 
fo he calTd my Man, will venture the Voyage, I'll 
leave my Share of the Veffei to him and let him 
make his beft of it $ and if we live to meet in Zfyg? 
land, and he meets with Succefs abroad, he (hall ac- 
count for our Half of the Profits of the Ship's 
Freight to us, the other (hall be his own. 

If my Partner, who was no Way concerned with 
my young Man, made him fuch an Offer, I could 
do no left than offer him the fame * and all the 
Ship's Company being willing to go with him, we 
made over Half the Ship to him in Property, andl 
took a Writing from him, obliging him to account 
for the other and away he went to Japan. The 
Japan Merchant prov'd a very pun&ual honeft 
Man to him, protected him at Japan, and got him 
a Licenfe to come on Shore, which the Europeans 
in general have not lately obtained * pay'd him 
his Freight very pun£hially, fent him to the Philip- 
pines, loaded with Japan and China Wares, and a 
Supra-Cargo of their own, who trafficking with 
the Spaniards* brought back European Goods again, 



[ 2^2 ] 

and a great Quantity of Cloves, and other Spice § 
and there he was not only pay'd his Freight very 
well, and at a very good Price, but being not wil- 
ling to fell the Ship then, the Merchant furnifh'd 
him with Goods, on his own Account ^ that for 
ibme Money, and feme Spices of his own, which 
he brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, 
to the Spaniards, where he fold his Cargo very well : 
Here having gotten a good Acquaintance at Manilla, 
he got his Ship made a free Ship $ and the Govern- 
our of Manilla hired him, to go to Acccpulco, in 
America, on the Coaft of Mexico, and gave him a 
Licenfe to Land there, and travel to Mexico, and to 
pafs in any Spani//) Ship to Europe, with all his Men. 

He made the Voyage to dccapulco very happily, 
and there he fold his 5>hip $ and having there alfo 
abtained Allowance to travel by Land to Porto Bello 9 
he found Means fome how of other, to g£t to Ja- 
maica, with all his Treafure ^ and about eight Years 
after, came to England exceeding Rich: Of the 
the which, I fhall rake Notice in its Place •, in the 
mean Time, I return to our particular Affairs. 

Being now ta>part with the Ship, and Ship's Com- 
pany $ it came before us of Courfe, to confider 
what Recompence we (hould give to the two Men, 
that gave us fuch timely Notice of the Defign 
againft us in the River of Cambodia : The Truth 
was, they had done us a confiderable Service, and 
deferv'd well at our Hands * tho' by the Jfay, they 
were a Couple of Rogues too -, for as they believ'd 
the Story of our being Pirates, and that we had re- 
ally run away with the Ship, they came down to 
us, not only to betray the Defign that was form'd 
againft us, but to go to Sea with us as Pirates $ and 
one of them confefs'd afterwards, that nothing 
elfe but the Hopes of going a Rouging, brought 
him to do it -, however, the Service they did us 
was not the lefs •, and therefore as I had promised 
to be grateful to them, I firft order'd the Money tQ 

be 






[ «53 1 

be pay'd to them, which they faid was due to them 
on board their refpeftive Ships -, that is to fay, the 
Evglijh Man nineteen Months Pay, and to the Dutch 
Man feven ^ and over and above that, I gave them, 
each of them, a fmall Sum of Money in Gold, 
and which contented them very well •, then I made 
the Ettglifb Man Gunner in the Ship, the Gunner 
being now made Second Mate, and Purler^ the 
Dutch Man 1 made Boatfwain *, fo they were both 
very well pleas'd, and pfov'd very ferviceable, be- 
ing both able Seamen, and very flout Fellows. 

We were now on Shore in China * if I thought 
myfelf banifh'd, and remote from my own Country 
at Bevgale, where I had many Ways to get home for 
my Moneys what could I think of myfelf now ? 
When I was gotten about a thoufand Leagues far- 
ther off from Home, and perfe&ly deititute of all 
manner of Profpeft of Return. 

All we had for it was this, that in about four 
Months Time, there was to be another Fair at the 
Place where we were , and then we might be able 
to purchafe all forts of the Manufa&ures of the 
Country, and withal, might poffibly find fomeCM- 
nefe Jonks or Veffels from Tonquin, that would be 
to be fold, and would carry us and our Goods, whi- 
ther we pleasM ^ this I lik'd very well, and refolv'd 
to wait •, befides, as our particular Perfbns were 
not obnoxious, fo if any Evglifi or Dutch Ships 
came thither, perhaps we might have an Opportu- 
nity to load our Goods, and get Paflage to fome 
other Place in India nearer Home. 

Upon thefe Hopes we refolv'd to continue here * 
but to divert ourfelves, we took two or three Jour- 
neys into the Country $ firft we went ten Days Jour- 
ney to fee the City of Nmquin^ and a City well 
worth feeing indeed ; they fay it has a Million of 
People in it \ which however, I do nor believe $ it 
is regularly built, the Streets all exaftly Itrair, add 
crofs one another, in dire& Lines, which gives the 
Figure of it great Advantage. But 



£ 254 1 

But when I come to compare the miferable Peo- 
ple of thefe Countries with ours, their Fa bricks, 
their manner of Living, their Government, their 
Religion, their Wealth, and their Glory, (as fome 
call it) I muft confefs, I do not fo much as think 
it is worth naming, or worth my while to write of, 
or any that fhall come after me to read. 

It is very obfervable that we wonder at the Gran- 
deur, the Riches, the Pomp, the Ceremonies, the 
Government, the Manufa&ures, the Commerce, and 
the Conduft of thefe People $ not that it is to be 
wonder'd at, or indeed in the leaft to be regarded $ 
but becaule, having firft a true Notion of the Bar- 
barity of thofe Countries, the Rudenefs and the 
Ignorance that prevails there, we do not expeQ: tQ 
find any fuch things fo far off. 

Otherwife, what are their Buildings to the Pala- 
ces and Royal Buildings of Europe ? What their 
Trade, to the univerfal Commerce of England^ HoU 
tand^ France and Spain} What their Cities to ours, 
for Wealth, Strength, Gaiety of Apparel, rich 
Furniture, and an infinite Variety ? What are their 
Ports, fupply'd with a few Jonks and Barks, to our 
Navigation, our Merchants Fleets, our large and 
powerful Navys ? our City of London has more 
Trade than all their mighty Empire : One Englijb % 
or Dutch \ or French Man of War of 80 Guns, 
would fight with, and deftroy all the Shipping of 
China : But the Greatnefs of their Wealth, their 
Trade, the Power of their Government, and Strength 
of their Armies, is furprifing to us, becaufe, as I 
have faid, confidering them as a barbarous Nation 
of Pagans, little better than Savages, we did not 
fexpeft fuch Things among them •, and this indeed 
Is the Advantage with which all their Greatnefs and 
Power is reprefented to us * otherwife it is in itfeif 
nothing at all 5 for as I have faid of their Ships, fo 
may be faid of their Armies and Troops •, all the 
Forces of their Empire, tho 9 they were to bring 

mo 






[ 2$5 ] 

two Millions of Men into the Field together, would 
be able to do nothing but rain the Country, and 
ftarve themfelves : If they were to befiege a ftrong 
Town in Flanders, or to fight a difciplin'd Army, 
one Line of German Curiaftiers, or of French Caval* 
ry, would overthrow all the Horfe of China ^ A Mil* 
lion of their Foot could not ftand before one embat- 
tled Body of our Infantry, pofted fo as not to be 
iiirrQunded,tho' they were not to be One to Twenty in 
Number-, nay, I do not boaft, if I fay that 30000 
German or Englijl) Foot, and 10000 French Horfe, 
would fairly beat all the Forces ©f China • And fo 
of our fortified Towns, and of the Art of our En- 
gineers in affauhing and defending Towns ^ there's 
not a fortified Town in China, could hold out one 
Month againlt the Batteries and Attacks of an Eu- 
ropean Army * and at the fame time all the Armies 
of China could never take fuch a Town as Dunkirk^ 
provided it was not ftarvM $ no, not in a ten Years 
Siege. They have Fire-Arms, 'tis true, but they 
are awkward clumfy and uncertain in going off: 
They have Powder, but it is of no Strength : They 
have neither Difcipline in the Field, Exercife to 
their Arms, Skill to Attack, or Temper to Retreat ; 
and therefore, I muft confefs, it feem'd ftrange to 
me, when I came home, and heard our People fay 
fuch fine Things of the Power, Riches, Glory, 
Magnificence, and Trade of the Chinefe ^ becaufe I 
faw, and knew, that they were a contemptible Herd 
or Crowd of ignorant fordid Slaves, fubje&ed to a 
Government qualified only to rule fuch a People 5 
and in a word, for I am now launched quite befide 
my Defign, I fay, in a word, were not its Diihnce 
inconceivably great from Mufcovy^ and was not the 
Advfcovite Empire almoft as rude, impotent, and ill 
governed a Crowd of Slaves as they, the Czar of 
jMufcovy might with much Eafe drive them all out 
of their Country, and conquer them in one Cam- 
paign 5 and had the Czar, who 1 fince hear is a 

grow- 



[ astf ) 

growing Prince, and begins to appear formidable in 
the World, fallen this Way, inftead of attacking the 
Warlike Swedes, in which Attempt none of the 
Powers of Europe would have envy'd or interrupted 
him-, he might by this time have been Emperor of 
China, inftead of being beaten by the King of Sweden 
at Narva, when the latter was not One to Six in 
Number. As their Strength and their Grandeur, 
fo their Navigation, Commerce, and Husbandry, is 
imperfe&and impotent, compared to the fame Things 
in Europe ; alfo in their Knowledge, their Learning, 
their Skill in the Sciences * they have Globes and 
Spheres, and a Smatch of the Knowledge of the 
Mathermticks $ but when you come to inquire into 
their Knowledge, how fhort-fighted are the wifeft 
of their Smdients ! they know nothing of the Mo- 
tion of the Heavenly Bodies •, and fo grofly abfurdly 
ignorant, that when the Sun is eclips'd, they think 
'tis a great Dragon has affaulted and run away with 
it, and they fall a clattering with all the Drums 
and Kettles in the Country, to fright the Monfter 
away, juft as we do to hive a Swarm of Bees. 

As this is the only Excurfion of this kind which 
I have made in all the Account I have given of my 
Travels, fo I fhall make no more Defcriptions of 
Countrys and People, 'tis none of my Bufinefs, or 
any part of my Defign -, but giving an Account of 
my own Adventures, through a Life of inimitable 
Wandrings, and a long Variety of Changes, which 
perhaps few that come after me will have heard the 
like of the mighty Places, defart Country's, and nu- 
merous People, I have yet to pafs thro' more than re- 
lates to my own Story, and which my Concern among 
them will make neceflary. I was now, as near as I 
can compute, in the heart of China, about the La- 
titude of thirty Degrees North of the Line, for we 
were returned from Nanquin $ I had indeed a mind to 
fee the City of tekin, which I had heard fo much of, 
and Father Simon ijnportun'd me daily to do it * at 

length 



[ 257 ] 

length his Time of going away being fet, and the o- 
ther Miffionary, who was to jgo with him, being ar- 
rived from Mdcao^ it was neceffary that we fhould re- 
folve, either to go, or no to go* fo I referred him to 
tny Partner, and left it wholly to his Choice, who at 
length refolvM it in the Affirmative, and we prepared 
for our Journey. We fet out with very good Advan- 
tage, as to finding the Way, for we got leave to travel 
in the Rerinue of one of their Mandarins, a kind of 
Viceroy, or principal Magiftrate in the Province where 
they refide, and who take great State upon them, 
travelling with great Attendance, and with great 
Homage from the People, who are fometimes great- 
ly impoverifh'd by them, becaufe all the Countries 
they pals thro' are obliged to furnifh Provifions for 
them and all their Attendance : That which I par- 
ticularly obferved, as to our travelling with his Bag- 
gage was this, that tho' we received fufficient Provi- 
sions, both for our felves and our Horfes, from the 
Country, as belonging to the Mandarin, ye we were 
obliged to pay for every thing we had, after the 
Market Price of the Country, and the Mandarin's 
Steward, at Commiffaty of the Provifions, colle&ed 
it duly from us ^ fo that our travelling in the Re- 
tinue of the Mandarin, tho' it was a very great Kind- 
neis to us, was not fuch a mighty Favour in him, 
but was indeed a great Advantage to him, confider- 
ing there were about thirty other People travelled in 
the fame Manner befides us, under the Protection of 
his Retinue, or as we may call ir, under his Convoy ; 
This, I fay, was a great Advantage to him, for the 
Country furnilhM all toe Provifions for nothing, and 
he took all our Nlopey for them. 

We were five and twenty Days travelling to Peking, 
through a Country L finitely populous, but mifera- 
bly cultivated $ the Husbandry, the Oeconomy, and 
the Way of living, all very miferable, tho' they boaft 
fo much of the Induftry of the People^ I fay, mife- 
rable j and fo it is, if we who underftand how to 

R live 



[ 2 5 8 1 

live were to endure it, or to compare it with otir 
own, but not io to thefe poor Wretches who know 
no other: The Pride of thefe People is infinitely 
great, and exceeded by nothing, but their Poverty, 
which adds to that which I call their Mifery. I muft 
needs think the naked Savages of America live much 
more happy, becaufe, as they have nothing, fo they 
defire nothing-, whereas thefe are proud and infolent, 
3nd in the main are meer Beggars and Drudges * 
their Oftentation is inexpreifible, and is chiefly 
fhew'd in their Cloaths and Buildings, and in the 
keeping Multitudes of Servants or Slaves, and, which 
is to the laft Degree ridculous, their Contempt of 
all the World but themfelves. 

I muft confefs, I travelled more pleafantly after- 
wards in the Defarts and vaft Wildernefles of Grand 
Tartary, than here ; and yet the Roads here are well 
pav'd, and well kept, and very convenient for Tra- 
vellers; but nothing was more aukward to me, than 
to iee fuch a haughty, imperious, infolent People, 
in the mid ft of the grofeft Simplicity and Ignorance, 
for all their fam'd Ingenuity is no more : My Friend 
Father Simon and I us'd to be very merry upon thefe 
Occ^fions, to fee the beggarly Pride of thofe People $ 
for Example: Coming by the Houfe of a Country 
Gentleman, as Father Simon cali'd him, about ten 
Leagues off of the City otNanquin, we had firft of 
all the Honour to ride with the Matter of the Houfe, 
about two Mdes : The State he rode in, was a per- 
fe& Don ghtixotifm, being a mixture of Pomp and 
Poverty, 

The Habit of this greafy Don was very proper 
for a Scaramouch, or Merry-Andrew, being a dirty 
Callicoe, with all the Tawdry Trappings of a FooPs- 
Coat, fuch as Hinging Sieves, Toffels, and Cuts and 
Slafhes almoft on every Sidej it cover'd a TafFaty 
Velt, as greafy as a Butcher, and which teftify'd, 
that his Honour muft needs be a moft exquifite 
Sloven, 

His* 



C 25* ] 

His Horfe was a poor, lean, ftarv'd , hobbling Crea- 
ture, fuch as in England might fell for about 30 or 
40 Shillings, and he had two Slaves follow'd him 
on Foot, to drive the poor Creature along-, he had a 
Whip in his Hand, and he belaboured the Beaft as 
faft about the Head, as his Slaves did about the Tail * 
and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve Ser- 
vants, and we were told he was going from the City 
to his Country Seat, about half a League before us: 
We travell'd on gently, but this Figure of a Gentle- 
man rode away before us, and as we ttop'd at a Vil- 
lage about an Hour to refrelh us, when we came by 
the Country Seat of this great Man, we faw him in 
a little Place, before his Door, eating hisRepaftj 
it was a kind of a Garden, but he was eafy to be 
feen, and we were given to underftand that the more 
we look'd on him, the better he would be pleased. 

He fat under a Tree, fomething like the Palmet- 
to Tree, which effe&ually (haded him over the Head, 
and on the South Side^ but under the Tree alfo, was 
plac'd a large Umbrella, which made that Part look 
well enough ^ he fat lolling back in a great Elbow- 
Chair, being a heavy corpulent Man, and his Meat 
being brought him by two Woriien Slaves; he had 
two more, whofe Office, I think, few Gentlemen in 
Europe would accept of their Service in, (viz.) One 
fed the Squire with a Spoon, and the other held the 
Difh with one Hand, and fcrap'd off what he let fall 
upon his Worfhip's Beard and Taftaty Veft, with the 
other ; while the great fat Brute thought it below 
him to employ his own Hands in any of thofe fami- 
liar Offices, which Kings and Monarchs would ra^ 
ther do, than be troubled with the clumfy Fingers 
of their Servants, 

I took this Time to think what Pain Mens Pride 
puts them to-, and how troublefome a haughty 
Temper, thus ill-ma nag'd, mult be to a Man of 
common Senfe ^ and leaving the poor Wretch to 
pleafe himfelf with our looking at him, as if we 

R 2 admir' 



[ 2*0 1 

adfairM his Pomp, whereas we really pity'd arid con- 
temn'd him, we purfu'd cur Journey * only Father Sz- 
mon had the Curiofitytoftay to inform him felf what 
Dainties the Country Juftice had to feed on^ in all his 
State $ which he (aid he had the Honour totafte of, 
and which was,l think* aDofe that an EtigUfo Hound 
would fcarce have eaten, if it had been offer'd him, 
(viz.) a Mels of boiPdRice, with a great piece cf Gar- 
lick in it, and a little Bag filPd with Green Pepper, and 
another Plant which they have there, fomething like 
our Ginger but fmelling like Musk, and tafting like 
Muftard * all this was put together, and a fmall 
Lump or Piece of lean Mutton boii'd in it $ and 
this was his Worlhip's Repaft, four or five Servants 
more attending at a Diliance. If he fed them 
meaner than he was fed himfelf, the Spice except- 
ed, they muft fare very coarfely indeed. 

As for our Mandarin, with whom we travelPd, 
lie was refpe&ed like a King ; furroimded always 
with his Gentlemen, and attended in all his Ap- 
pearances with fuch Pomp, that I faw little of 
him but at a Diftance $ but this 1 obferv'd, that 
there was not a Horfe in his Retinue, but that our 
Carriers Pack-Hories in England feem to me to look 
much better, but they were fo covered with Equi- 
page, Mantles, Trappings and fuch like Trumpery, 
that you cannot fee whether they are fat or lean* 
in a Word, we could fee fcaice any thing but their 
Feet and their Heads. 

I was now light hearted, and all my Trouble and 
Perplexity that I have given an Account of being 
over^ 1 had no Anxious Thoughts about me, which 
tnade this Journey much the pleafanter to me $ nor 
had I any ill Accident attended me, only in the pafc 
fing of fording a fmall River, my Horfe fell, and 
made me free of the Country, as they call it $ that 
is to fay, threw me in* the Place was not deep, biit 
it wetted me all over * I mention it becaufe it fpoil'd 
my Pocket- Bock, wherein i had fet down the Names 

of 



I 



[ 2*1 ] 

of feveral People and Places which I had Occafion 
to remember, and which, not taking due Care of, 
the Leaves rotted, and the Words were never after 
to be read, to my great Lofs, as to the Names of 
fome places which I touched at in this Voyage. 

At length we arriv'd at Peking ^ I had no Body 
with me but the Youth, who my Nephew, the 
Captain, had given me to attend me as a Servanr, 
and who proved very trufty and diligent $ and my 
Partner had no Body with him but one Servant, who 
was a Kinfman : As for the Portu$ueze Pilot, he 
being defirous to fee the Court, we gave him his 
Paffage, that is to fay, bore his Charges, for his 
Company ^ and to ufe him as an Interpreter, for he 
underftood the Language of the Country, and (poke 
good French, and a little Etiglijb 5 and indeed, this 
old Man was a moft ufefui Impliment to us every 
where 5 for we had not been above a Week at Pe- 
king, when he came laughing, Ah, Seignior Ingiife, 
fays he, / have fomething to tell you will make your 
Heart glad. My Heart glad, fays I, What can that be? 
Idont hnw any thing in this Country can either give 
me Joy or Grief to any great Degree. Tes, yes y faid 
the oli Man in broken EvgliJI^ make you glad, me 
forrow •, forry he would have faid. This made me 
more inquifitive. Why, faid f, will it make you forry > 
Becaufe, faid he, you have brought me here 25 days 
Journey^ and will leave me to %o back alone, and which 
way f)aU I get to my PuYt afterwards without a Ship, 
without a Horfe, without Pecune > So he called Mo- 
ney, being his broken Latin, of which he had a- 
bundance to make us merry with. 

In fhort, he told us there was a greai Caravan of 
Mufcovite and PoliJIi Merchants in the City, and 
they were preparing to fet out on their Journey by 
Land to Mufcovy within four or five Weeks, and he 
was fure we would take the Opportunity to go with 
them, and leave him behind to go back all alone : 
I confefs, I was furpris'd with his News $ a fecret 

R 1 H 



[ 262 ] 

Joy fpread itfelf over my whole Soul, which I can- 
not defcribe, and never felt before or fince, and I 
had no power for a good while to fpeak a Word to 
the old Man ; but at laft I turn'd to him •, How do 
you know this, faid I, are you fure it is true ? Yes, 
fays he, I met this Morning in the Street an old 
Acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one you 
call a Grecian, who is among them, he came laft 
from AJiracan, and was defigning to go to Tonquin, 
where 1 formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, 
and is now refolv'd to go with the Caravan to Muf- 
cow t and fo down the River of Wulha to AJiracan. 
Well, Seignior, fays I, do not be uneafy about be- 
ing left to go back alone, if this be a Method for 
my return to England, it fhail be your Fault, if 
you go back to Macao at all. We then went to con- 
futing together what was to be done, and I ask'd 
my Partner what he thought of the Pilot's News, 
and whether it would fitit with his Affairs ? He 
told me he would do juft as I would, for he had 
fettled all his Affairs fo well at Bevgale, and left his 
Effe&s in luch good Hands, that as we had made a 
good Voyage here, if he could veft it in China Silks, 
wrought and raw, fuch as might be worth the Car- 
riage, he would be content to go to England, and 
then make his Voyage back to Ber.gale, by the Com- 
pany's Ship. 

Having refolv'd upon this, we agreed, that if our 
Fortvgal Pilot would go with us, we would bear 
his Charges to Mufcow, or to England if he pleas'd; 
nor indeed were we to be efteem'd over generous in 
that Part neither, if we had not rewarded him far- 
ther, for the Service he had done us was really worth 
all that, and more ^ for he had not only been a Pi* 
lot to lis at Sea, but he had been like a Broker for 
Os on Shore •, and his procuring for us the Japan 
Merchant, was fome hundreds of Pounds in our 
Pocket : So we confulted together about it, and be* 
ing willing to gratify him, which was indeed but 

doing 



[ 2*3 ] 

doing him Juftice, and very willing alfo to have 
him with us befides, for he was a moft neceffary 
Man on all Occafions, we agreed to give him a 
Quantity of coin'd Gold, which, as I compute it, 
came to about 175 Pounds Sterling between us, 
and to bear all his Charges, both for himfelf 
and Horfe, except only a Horfe to carry his 
Goods. 

Having fettled this among ourfelves, we call'd 
him to let him know what we had refblv'd 5 I told 
him, he had complained of our being to let him go 
back alone, and I was now to tell him we was re- 
folv'd he fhould not go back at all : That as we 
had refolv'd to go to Europe with the Caravan, we 
refolv'd alfo he fhould go with us, and that we 
calFd him to know his Mind. He (hook his Head, 
and faid, it was a long Journey, and he had no Pe- 
cune to carry him thither, or to fubfitt himfelf when 
he came there. We told him, we believ'd it was 
fo, and therefore we had refolv'd to do fomething 
for him, that fhould let him fee how fenfible we 
were of the Service he had done us, and alfo how 
agreeable he was to us; and then I told him what 
we had relbiv'd to give him here, which he might 
lay out as we would do our own $ and that as for 
his Charges, if he would go with us, we would 
iet him fafe a fhore, (Life and Cafuaities excepted) 
either in Mufcovy or England, which he would, at 
our own Charge, except only the Carriage of his 
Goods. 

He received the Propofal like a Man tranfported, 
and told us he would go with us over the whole 
World * and fo, in fhort, we all prepar'd ourfelves 
for the Journey : However, as it was with us, fo it 
was with the other Merchants, they had many 
things to do, and inftead of being ready in five 
Weeks, it was four Months and fome odd Days, 
before all Things were got together. 

R 4 It 



[ 2*4 1 

It was the Beginning of February, our Stile, 
when we let from Peking •, my Partner and the old 
Pilot had gone exprefs back to the Port where we 
had firft put in, to difpofe of fome Goods which we 
had left there; and I with a Chinefe Merchant, 
who I had fome Knowledge of at Nanquin, and 
who came to Peking on his own Affairs, went to 
Nanquin, where I bought ninety Pieces of fine Da- 
masks, with about two hundred Pieces of other 
very fine Silks, of feveral Sorts, fome mix'd wirh 
Gold, and had all thefe brought to Pelting againft 
my Partner's Re' urn •, befides this, we bought a ve- 
ry large Quantity of Raw Silk, and fome other 
Goods, our Cargo amounting in thefe Goods only 
to about three thoufand five hundred Pounds Ster- 
ling, which, together with Tea, and fome fine Cal- 
licoes, and three Camels Loads of Nutmegs and 
Cloves, loaded in all eighteen Camels for cur Share, 
befides thofe we rode upon •, which with two or 
three fpare Horfes, and two Hories loaded with Pro- 
vifions, made us in fhort 26 Camels and Horfes in 
our Retinue. 

The Company was very great, and, as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hun- 
dred Korfe, and upwards of a hundred and twenty 
Men, very well armed and provided for all Events : 
For as the Eaftem Caravans are fubjefl: to be at- 
tacked by the Arabs, fo are thefe by the Tartars $ but 
they are not altogether fo dangerous as the Arabs, 
nor fo barbarous when they prevail. 
^ The Company confided of People of feveral Na- 
tions, fuch as Mufcovites chiefly, for there were a- 
bove Sixty of thtm who were Merchants or Inhabi- 
tants of Mitfcow, tho' of them fome were Livonians, 
and to our particular Satisfa&ion, Five of them 
were Scots, who appeared alfo to be Men of great 
Experience in Bufinefs, and Men of very good 
Subftance. 

When 



[ %H ] 

-When we had travelled one Days Journey, th£ 
Guides, who were Five in Number, called all the 
Gentlemen and Merchants, that is to fay, all the 
PafTengers, except the Servants, to a great Council, 
as they call it : At this great Council, every one de- 
pofited a certain Quantity of Money to a common 
Stock, for the neceflary Expence of buying Forage 
on the Way, where it was not otherwife to be had 
and for fatisfying the Guides, gerting Horles, and 
the like : And here they constituted the Journey, 
as they call it, (viz.) They named Caprains and Of- 
ficers, to draw us all up, and give the Command in 
cafe of an Attack, and gave every one their turn of 
Command ; Nor was this forming us into Order any 
more than what we found needful upon the Way, as 
[hall be obferved in its Place. 

The Road all on this Side of the Country is very 
populous,, and is full of Potters: And Earth makers, 
that is to fay, People that tampered the Earth for 
the China Ware $ and as I was coming along, our 
Portugal Pilot, who had always fbmethingor other 
to fay to make us merry, came fneering to me, and 
told me he would fhow me the greateft Rarity in all 
the Country, and that I fhould have this to fay of 
China, after all the ilMiumour'd things I had faid 
of it, that I had feen one Thing which was not to 
be feen in all the World befide. I was very impor- 
tunate to know what it was : At laft he told me it 
was a Gentleman's Houfe built all with China Ware. 
Well, fays I, are not the Materials of their Build- 
ing the Produft of their own Country •, and fo it 
is all China Ware, is not it ? No, no, fays he, I 
mean, it is a Houfe all made of China Ware, fuch 
£s you call it in England •, or as it is caiPd in our 
Country, Porcellain. Well, fays I, fuch a Thing 
may be ^ how big is it > Can we carry it in a Box 
upon a Camel ? If we can, we will buy it. Upon a 
Camel ! fays the old Pilot, holding up both his 
Hands, why there is a Family of Thirty People lives in 
it. 1 was 



[ a«] 

1 was then curious indeed to fee it, and when I 
I eame to it, it was nothing but this ; it was a 
Timber-Houfe, or a Houfe built, as we call it in 
England^ with Lath and Plaifter, but ail the Plaif- 
tering was really China Ware, that is to fay, it was 
fdaifter'd with the Earth that makes China Ware. 

The Outfide, which the Sun (hone hot upon, was 
glazed, and look'd very well, perfeft white, and 
painted with blue Figures, as the large China Ware 
in England is painted, and hard, as if it had been 
feurnt : As to the Infide, all the Walls, inftead of 
Wainlcot, were lined up with hardenM and painted 
Tiles> like the little fquare Tiles we call Galley-Tiles 
in England, all made of the fineft China, and the 
Figures exceeding fine indeed, with extraordinary 
¥ariety of Colours mix'd with Gold, many Tiles 
making but one Figure, but join'd fo artificially, 
the Mortar being made of the fame Earth, that it 
was very hard to fee where the Tiles met : The 
Floors of the Rooms were of the fame Composition, 
and as hard as the earthen Floors we have in ufe in 
ieveral Parts of England^ efpecially Lincohjbire, 
Utiottinghamjime, Leicefterflrire, &c. as hard as Stone, 
and fmooth, but not burnt and painted, except fome 
Imaller Rooms, like Clofets, which were all as it 
were paved with the fame Tile ^ the Cielings, and 
in a Word, all the plaiftering Work in the whole 
Houfe were of the fame Earth $ and after all, the 
Roof was cover'd with Tiles of the fame, but of a 
deep fhining black. 

This was a China Ware houfe indeed, truly and 
litterally to be call'd fo $ and had I not been upon 
the Journey, I could have ftaid fome Days to fee 
and examine the Particulars of it ; They told me 
there were Fountains and Fifh-ponds in the Garden, 
all paved at the Bottom and Sides with the fame, 
and fine Statutes fet up in Rows on the Walks, en- 
tirely form'd of the Porcellain Earth, and burnt 
whole. 

As 



1 267 ] 

As this is one of the Singularities of China, fo 
they may be allow'd to excel in it $ but I am very 
fure they excel in their Accounts of it 5 for they 
told me fuch incredible things of their Performance 
in Crockery-Ware, for fuch it is, that I care not to 
relate, as knowing it could not be true ^ they told 
me in particular of one Workman that made a Ship 
with all its Tackle, and Mafts, and Sails, in Earth- 
en Ware, big enough to carry fifty Men : If he had 
told me he launched it, and made a Voyage to Ja- 
pan in it, I might have faid fomething to it indeed 5 
but as it was, I knew the whole Story, which was 
in fhort, asking Pardon for the Word, that the 
Fellow lyed •, fo I fmiled, and faid nothing to it. 

This odd Sight kept me two Hours behind the 
Caravan, for which, the Leader of it for the Day, 
fined me about the Value of three Shillings, and 
told me, if it had been three Days Journey without 
the Wall, as it was three Days within, he mutt have 
fined me four times as much, and made me ask Par- 
don the next Council Day ^ fo I promifed to be more 
orderly •, for indeed I found afterward the Orders 
made for keeping altogether, were abfolutely necef- 
fary for our common Safety. 

In two Days more, we pafs'd the great China 
Wall, made for a Fortification againft the Tartars^ 
and a very great Work it is, going over Hills and 
Mountains in a needlefs Track, where the Rocks 
are impaflible, and the Precipices fuch as no Enemy 
could poflibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where 
if they did, no Wall could hinder them : They tell 
us, its Length is near a Thoufand Eng lifi Miles, but 
that the Country is five Hundred in a Itrait meafured 
Line, which the Wall bounds, without meafuring the 
Windings and Turnings it takes ^ 'tis about four 
Fathom high, and as many thick in fome Places. 

I flood ftill an Hour or thereabout^ without tret 
paffing our Orders, for fo long the Caravan was in 
$<*Jling the G 'ate ; I fay, I flood ftill an Hour to look 

,f at 



[ 2*8 ] 

at it on every Side, near, and far ofF, I mean, that 
was within my View ^ and the Guide of our Cara- 
van, who had been extolling it for the Wonder of 
the World, was mighty eager to hear my Opinion 
of it •, 1 told hitn it was a moft excellent thing 
to keep off the Tartars $ which he happened not to 
underftdnd as I meant it, and fo took it for a Com- 
pliment; bat the old Pilot laughM : O Seignior ht- 
glefe, fays he, you fpeak in Colours : In Colours, 
faid J, what do you mean by that > Why, you 
Ipeik what looks White this way, and Black that 
way$ gay one way, and dull another way: you tell 
him it is a good Wall to keep out Tartars * you tell 
me by that, it is good for nothing but to keep out 
Tartars, or it will keep out none but Tartars h I 
underftand ycu> Seigneur Inglefe^ 1 underltand you, 
lays he Joking, buc Seigneur Chinefe underftood 
you his own way. 

Well, fays I, Seignior, do vou think it would 
ftand out an Army of our Country People, with 
a good Train of Artillery $ or our Engineers, with 
two Companies of Miners ♦, would not they batter 
it down in ten Days, that an Army might enter in 
Battalia, or blow it up in the Air, Foundation and 
all, that there fhould be no Sign of it left ? Ay, ay, 
fays he s I know that. The Chinefe wanted mightily 
to know what I faid, and I gave him leave to tell 
him a few Days after, for we was then almoft out 
of their Country, and he was to leave us in a little 
time afterward ; but when he knew what I had 
faid, he w js dumb all the reft of the wav, and we 
heard no more of his fine Story, of the Chinefe Pow- 
er and Greatnefs, while he ftay'd. 

After we had pafs'd this mighty Nothing calFd a 
Wall, fomething like the Pi3s Wall, fo famous in 
Northumberland^ and bu It by the Romans^ we began 
to find the Country thinly inhabited, and the People 
rather confined to live in fortified Towns and Cities, 
as being fubjeft to the Inroads and Depredations cf 

the 



[ 269 ] 

the Tartars , who rob in great Armies, and therefore 
are nor to be refitted by the naked Inhabitans of an 
open Counrry. 

And here I began to find the Neceffity of keeping 
together in a Caravan as we travelled $ for we faw 
feveral Troops of Tartars roving about •, but when I 
came to fee them diftinOly 1 wonder'd more that 
the Chmefe Empire could be conquered by fuch con- 
temptible Fellows $ for they are a meer Hoord or 
Crowd of wild Fel'ows •, keeping no Order, 
and underftanding no Difcipline, or manner of 
Fight. 

Their Horfes are poor lean ftarved Creatures, 
taught nothing and fit for nothing * and this we 
found the firft Day we faw them, which was after 
We entred the wilder Part of the Country ; our 
Leader for the Day, gave Leave for about fixteen of 
us to go a hunting, as they call it $ and what was 
this, but hunting of Sheep $ however, it may be 
call'd hunting too $ for the Creatures are the wild- 
eft and fwifteft of Foot that ever I faw of their 
Kind 5 only they wiil not run a great way* and 
you are fore of Sport when you begin the Chace; 
for they appear generally thirty or forty in a Flock, 
and like true Sheep, always keep together when 
they fly. 

In purfuit of this odd fort of Game, it was our 
hap to meet with about forty Tartars •, whether they 
were hunting Mutton as we were, or whether they 
look'd for another kind of Prey, I know not 5 but 
as foon as they faw us one of them blew a kind of a 
Horn very loud, but with a barbarous Sound, thar I 
had never heard before, and by the way, never care 
to hear again : We all fuppos'd this was to call their 
Friends about them, and lb ic was $ for in lefs than 
Half a Quarter of an Hour, a Troop of forty or fif- 
ty more appeared, at about a Mile difUnce* but 
our Work was over firft, as it happened* 

On© 



C 270 ] 

One of the Scots Merchants of Mufcow, happened 
to be amongft us, and as foon as he heard the Horn, 
he told us in fhort, that we had nothing to do r but 
to charge them immediately without lofs of Time \ 
and drawing us up in a Line, he ask'd if we were re- 
folv'd ? we told him we were ready to follow him 5 
fo he rode dire&ly up to them : They flood gazing 
at us like a meer Crowd, drawn up in no Order^ 
nor (hewing the Face of any Order at all * but as 
foon as they faw us advance, they let fly their Ar- 
rows, which however mifs'd us very happily $ it 
feems they miftook not their Aim, but their Di- 
ftance ^ for their Arrows all fell a little fhort of us, 
fcut with fo true an Aim, that had we been about 
twenty Yards nearer, we mutt have had feveral Men 
wounded, if not kill'd. 

Immediately we halted, and tho' it was at a great 
Diftance, we fir'd, and fent them Leaden Bullets, 
for Wooden Arrows, following our Shot full Gal- 
lop, refolving to fall in among them Sword in Hand, 
for fo our bold Scot that led us dire&ed : He was 
indeed but a Merchant, but he behav'd with that 
Vigour and Bravery on this Occafion, and yet, with 
fuch a cool Courage to, that I never faw any Man 
in Aftion fitter for Command. As foon as we came 
up to them, we fir'd our Piftois in their Faces, and 
then drew, but they fled in the greateft Confufion 
imaginable •, the only ftand any of them made, was 
on our Right, where three of them flood, and 
by figns calFd the reft to come back to them, hav- 

J*ng a kind of Symiter in their Hands, and their 
Jows hanging at their Backs. Our brave Com- 
mander, without asking any body to follow him, 
gallops up ciofe to them, and with his Fuzee knocks 
one of them off his Horfe, kill'd the fecorid with 
his Piftol, and the third ran away, and thus ended 
our Fight ; but we had this Misfortune attending ir, 
{viz.) that all our Mutton that we had in chace, got 
away : We had not a Man kili'd or hurt i but as 



I 



[ 271 ] 

for the Tartars, there was about five of them kill'd; 
how many were wounded, \we knew not ^ but this 
we knew/ that the other Party was fo frighted with 
the Noife of our Guns, that they made off, and 
never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Cbinefe Dominion, 
and therefore the Tartars were not fo bold as after- 
wards * but in about five Days we enter'd a vaft 
great wild Defart, which held us three Days and 
Nights March * and we were obliged to carry our 
Water with us in great Leather Bottles, and to en- 
camp all Night, juft as I have heard they do in the 
Defarts of Arabia. 

I ask'd our Guides whofe Dominion this was ia, 
and they told me, this was a kind of Boarder, that 
might be called no Maris Land •, being a Part of the 
Great Karakatbay, or Grand Tartary, but that how- 
ever it was all reckoned to China $ that there was 
no Care taken here, to preferve it from the Inroads 
of Thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the word 
Defart in the whole March $ tho' we were to go 
over fome much larger. 

In paffing this Wildernefs, which I confefs was 
at the firft View very frightful to me, we faw two 
or three times little Parties of the Tartars, but they 
feem'd to be upon their own Affairs, and to have 
no Defign upon us 5 and fo, like the Man who met 
the Devil, if they had nothing to fay to us, we 
had nothing to fay to them 5 we let them go. 

Once however, a Party of them came fo near, as 
to Hand and gaze at us-, whether it was to confider 
what they fhould do, (viz.) to attack us, or not at- 
tack us, that we knew not 5 but when we were 
pafs'd at fome diftance by them, we made a Rear- 
Guard of forty Men, and ftood ready for them, let- 
ting the Caravan pals half a Mile, or thereabouts, 
before us * after a while they march'd off, only we 
found they affaulted us with five Arrows at their 
parting ; one of which, wounded a Horfe, fo that 

it 



[ 272 ] 

it difabled him 5 and we left him the next Day, poor 
Creature, in great need of a good Farrier 5 we fup- 
pofe they might fhoot more Arrows, which might 
fall fhort of us, but we faw no more Arrows or 
Tartars , that time. 

We travelled near a Month after this, the Ways 
feeing not fo good as at firft, tho 5 (till in the Domi- 
nions of the Emperor of China, but lay for the moft 
Part in Villages^ fome of which were fortified, be- 
caufe of the Incurfions of the Tartars. Wnen we 
came to one of thefe Towns, (it was about two 
Days and a Halt's Journey before we were to come 
to the City Nairn ) I wanted to buy a Camel, of 
which there are plenty to be fold all the Way upon 
that Road, and of Horfes alfo, fuch as they are^ 
becaufe fb many Caravans coming that way, they 
are often wanted : The Perfon that 1 fpoke to to get 
me a Camel, would have gone and fetch'd it for 
me, but I like a Fool muft be officious, and go my- 
felf along with him : The Place was about two 
Miles out of the Village, where, it feems, they kept 
the Camels and Horfes feeding under a Guard* 

I walk'd it on Foot with my old Pilot in Compa- 
ny, and a Cbinefe, being very defirous, forfooth, of 
a little Variety : When we came to this Place, it 
was a low marfhy Ground, walFd round with a 
ftone Wall, piled up dry, without Morter or Earth 
among it, like a Park with a little Guard of Chinnefe 
Soldiers at the Door. Having bought a Camel, and 
agreed for the Price, I came away, and the Chinefe 
Man that went with me, led the Camel , when on 
a fudden came up five Tartars on Horfe-back \ two 
of them feized the Fellow, and took the Camel 
from him, while other three ftep'd up to me ; and 
my old Pilot: Seeing us as it were unarmed, for I 
had no Weapon about me but my Swore, which 
could but ill defend me againft three Horfe-men ; 
the firft that came up, ftop'd fhort upon my draw- 
ing my Sword j ("for they are errant Cowards,) but a 

Second 



[ 275 3 

Second coming upon my Left, gave me a Blow on 
the Head, which I never felt till afterward, and 
wondered when I came to myfelf, what was the 
matter with me, and where I was for he laid me flat 
on the Ground •, but my never failing old Pilot, the 
Portugueze (To Providence Uniooked for direfts De- 
liverances from Dangers, which to us are unfore- 
ieenj had a Piftol in his Pocket which I knew no- 
thing of, nor the Tartars neither* if they had, I 
fuppofe they would not have attacked us : But Cow- 
ards are always boldeft when there is no Danger. 

The old Man feeing me down, with a bold Heart 
Itep'd up to the Fellow that had ftruck me, and 
laying hold of his Arm with one Hand, and pulling 
him down by main Force, a little towards him with 
the other, fhot him into the Head, and laid him 
dead upon the Spot $ he then immediately ftep'd up 
to htm who had ftop'd us, as I laid, and before he 
could come forward again, (for it was all done as 
as it were in a moment} made a Blow at him with 
a Scymeter which he always wore, but miffing the 
Man, cut his Horfe inro the Side of his Head, cut 
one of his Ears off by the Root, and a great Slice 
down the Side of his Face 5 the poor Beaft enraged 
with the Wound, was no more to be governed by 
his Rider, tho 5 the Fellow fat well enough too ^ but 
away he flew, and carried him quite out of the Pi- 
lot's Reach, and ac fbme dittance rifing up upon his 
hind Legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon 
him. 

In this Interval the poor Chinefe came in, who had 
loft the Camel, but he had no Weapon •, however, 
feeing the Tartar down, and his Horfe fallen upon 
him, he runs to him, and feiziog upon an ugly ill- 
favoured Weapon he had by his Side, fomething like 
a Pole-ax, but not a Pole-ax neither $ he wrench'd 
it from him, and made fhift to knock his Tartarian 
Brains out with it. But my old Man had the third 
Tartar to deal with Itill, 3nd feeing he did not fly, 

S as 



[ 274 1 

as he expe&ed, nor come on to fight him, as he 
apprehended, but flood flock ftill, the old Man 
flood ftill too, and falls to work with his Tackle to 
charge his Piftoi again -, but as foon as the Tartar 
faw the Piftoi, whether hefuppofed it to be the 
fame or another, I know not •, but away he fcower. 
ed, and left my Pilot, my Champion I call'd him 
afterward, a compleat Vi&ory. 

By this time I was a little awake, for I thought 
when fir ft I began to wake, that I had been in a 
fweet Sleep j but as I laid above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the Ground, and what was 
the matter : In a word, a few moments after, as 
Senfe returned, I felt Pain, tho' I did not know 
where * I clap'd my Hand to my Head, and took it 
away bloody •, then I felt my Head ach, and then 
in another Moment, Memory returned, and every 
thing was prefent to me again. 

I jump'd up upon my Feet inftantly, and got 
hold of my Sword, but no Enemies in View : I 
found a Tartar lie dead and his Horfe ftanding very 
quietly by him * and looking farther, I law my 
Champion and Deliverer, who had been to fee what 
the Cbinefe had done, coming back with his Hanger 
in his Hand * the old Man feeing me on my Feet, 
came running to me and embraced me with a great 
deal of Joy, being afraid before that I had been kil- 
led, and feeing me bloody, would fee how I was 
hurt, but it was not much, only what we call a 
broken Head * neither did I afterwards find any 

freat Inconvenience from the Blow, other than the 
lace which was hurt, and which was well again in 
two or three Days. 

We made no great Gain however by this Vi&ory, 
for we loft a Camel, and Gained a Horfe 5 but that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
Village, the Man demanded to be paid for the Ca- 
tnel 5 I difputed it, and it was brought to a hearing 
before the Cbinefe Judge of the Place , that is to 

fay, 



[ 275 ] 

lay, in Englljh^ we went before a Juftice of the 
Peace : Give him his due, he a&ed with a great 
deal of Prudence and Impartiality; and having 
heard both Sides, he gravely ask'd the Cbinefe Man, 
that went with me to buy the Camel, whole Servant 
he was ? t am no Servant, fays he, but went with 
the Stranger. At whofe Requeft, fays the Juftice ? 
At the Stranger's Requeft, fays he. Why then, fays 
the Juftice, you were the Stranger's Servant for the 
Time, and the Camel being deliver'd to his Ser- 
vant, it was delivered to him, and he muft pay 
for it. 

I confefs the Thing was fo cleat, that I had not a 
Word to fay * but admiring to fee fuch juft Reafon- 
ing upon the Cohfequence, and fo accurate Hating 
the Caufe, I pay'd willingly for the Catnel, and 
fent for another * but you may obferve, I fent for 
it, I did not go to fetch it myfelf any more $ I had 
enough of that. 

The City of Namn is a Frontier of the Chinejb 
Empire $ they call it fortified, and fo it is as Forti- 
fications go there •, for this 1 will venture to affirm, 
that all the Tartar* in Karakathaie, which I believe, 
are fome Millions, could not batter down the Walls 
with their Bows and Arrows * but to call it ftrong, 
if it were attacked with Cannon, would be to make 
thofe who underftand it, laugh at you. 

We wanted as 1 have faid, above two Days Jour- 
ney of this City, when Meflengers were fent Exprefs 
to every^Part of the Road, to tell all Travellers and 
Caravans, to halt 'till they had a Guard fent lor 
them* for that anunufai Body of Tartars, making 
ten thoufand in all, had appear'd in the Way, about 
thirty Miles beyond the City. 

This was very bad News to Travellers ^ however, 
it was carefully done of the Governour, and we 
were very glad to heat we fhould have a Guard * 
accordingly, two Days after, we had two hundred 
Soldiers fent us from a Garrifon of the Chinefes, on 

S 2 our 



[ 27<n 

our left, and three hundred mote from the City of 
Naum, and with thofe we advanced boldly 5 the 
three hundred Soldiers from Nairn, march'd in ofcr 
Front, the two hundred in our Rear, and our Men on 
each fide of our Camels with our Baggage, and the 
whole Caravan in the Center 3 in this Order, and 
well prepared for Battle* we thought ourfelves a 
Match for the whole ten thoufand Movgttl Tartar^ 
if they had appeared •, but the next Day when they 
did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the Morning, when marching 
from a little well fituated Town call'd Change «re 
had a River to pafs, where we were obliged to ferry $ 
and had the Tartars had any Intelligence, then had 
been the Time to have attack'd us, when the Ca- 
ravan being over, the Rear Guard was behind $ but 
they did not appear there* 

About three Hours after, when we were enter'd 
upon a Defart of about fifteen or fixteen Miles over* 
behold, by a Cloud of Duft they rais'd, we faw an 
Enemy was at Hand, and they were at Hand indeed, 
Tot they came on upon the Spur. 

The Cblnefes, our Guard on the Front, who had 
talk'd fo big the Day before, began to ftagger, and 
the Soldiers frequently look'd behind them, which 
is a certain Sign in a Soldier, that he is juft ready to 
rGn away ; my old Pilot was of my Mind, and 
being near me, he calFd out, Seignior Inglefe, fays 
he, thofe Fellows muft be encourag'd, or they will 
ruin us all •, for if the Tartars come on, they will 
never ftand it ; I am of your Mind, /aid I y but what 
Courfe muft be done ? Done \fays he y let fifty of our 
Men advance, and flank them on each Wing, and en* 
courage them, and they will fight like brave Fellows 
in brave Company $ but without it, they will every 
Man turn his back $ immediately I rode up to out 
Leader, and told him, who was exattly of our mind 5 
and accordingly, fifty of us march'd to the right 
Wing, and fifty to the left, and the reft made a 

Line 



[ *77 1 

Line of Refcue * and fo we march'd, leaving the 
laft two hundred Men to make another Body by 
themfelves, and to guard the Camels •, only that 
if need were, they fhould fend a hundred Men. to 
affitt the laft fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innume- 
rable Company they were-, how many, we could 
not tell, but ten Thoufand we thought was the leaft : 
A Party of them came on firft, and view D d our 
Pofture, traverfing the Ground in the Front of our 
Line ^ and as we found them within Gun-lhot, our 
Leader ordered the two Wings to advance fwiftly, 
and give them a Salvo on each Wing with their 
Shot, which was done* but they went off, and I 
fuppofe back to give an Account of the Recep ion 
they were like to meet with : And indeed that Sa- 
lute clogg'd their Stomach, for they immediately 
halted, [food a while to confider of it, and wheel- 
ing off to the left, they gave over the Defign, and faid 
no more to us for that time* which was very agree- 
able; to our Circumftances, which were but very in* 
different for a Battle with fuch a Number. 

Two Days after this, we came to the City Nann^ 
or Naum 5 we thank'd the Governour for his Care 
jfor us, and colle&ed to the Value of a hundred 
Crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the 
Soldiers fent to guard us \ and here we retted one 
Day. This is a Garrifon indeed, and there were 
nine hundred Soldiers kept here-, but the Reafon of 
it Was, that formerly the Mufcovite Frontiers lay 
nearer to them than they do now, the Mnfcovites 
having abaridon'd that Part of the County (which 
lies from this City Welt, for about two hundred 
Miles,) as defolate and unfit for life •, and more 
efpecially, being fo very remote, and fo difficult to 
fend Troops thither for its Defence * for we had 
yet above two thoufand Miles td MnfcQvy } properly 
^o call'd, 

S 5 After 



1 278 1 

After this, we pafs'd feveral great Rivers, and 
two dreadful Defans, one of which we were fix- 
teen Days pafling over, and which, as I faid, was 
to be calFd no Marts Land $ and on the 13th of 
April we came to the Frontiers of the Mufcovite Do- 
minions : I think the firft City, or Town, or For- 
trefs, whatever it might be call'd, that belong'd 
to the Czar of Mufcovy, was calPd Argun^ being on 
the Welt Side of rhe River Argun 

I could not but diicover an infinite Satisfa&ion, 
that I was fo foon arrived in, as I calFd it, a Chri- 
ftian Country, or at loft in a Country governed by 
Chriftians \ for tbo 3 the Mufcovites do, in my Opi* 
won, but juft deierve rhe Name of Chriftians, yet 
fuch they pretend to be, and are very devout in 
their Way : It would certainly occur to\ any Man 
who travels the World as I have done, and who 
had any Power of Refle&ion * May, it would oc- 
cur to him, to refleft what a Bleffing it is to be 
brought into the World, where the Name of God, 
and of a Redeemer is known, worfhip'd and ador'd $ 
and not where the People given up by Heaven to 
firong Delufions, woifliip the Devil, and proftrate 
themfelves to Stocks and Stones * worfhip Monfters, 
Elements, horrible fhaped Animals, and Statues, or 
Images of Monfters : Not a Town or City we 
pafs'd thro 5 , but had their Pagod% their Idols, and 
their Temples, and ignorant People worlhipping, 
even the Works of their own Hands. 

Now we came where at leaft a Face of the 
Chriftian Worfhip appeared, where the Knee was 
foowM to Jefusv an( * whether ignoyantly or not, yet 
the Chriftian Religion was own'd, and the Name 
of the true God was calFd upon, and adored * and 
it made the very Recedes of my Soul rejoice to lee 
it : I faluted the brave Scots Merchant 1 mentioned 
above, with my firft acknowledgment of this * and 
taking him by the Hand, I faid to him, Bleffed be 
God, we are once again come among Chriftians: He 

fmiledj 






[ 27? ] 

fmiled, and anfwered, do not rejoice too fbon Coun- 
try-man, thefe Mufcovites are but an odd fort of 
Chriftians ; and but for the Name of it, you may- 
fee very little of the Subftance, for fome Months 
farther of our Journey. 

Well, fays I, but (till 'tis better than Paganifm, 
and worfhipping of Devils. Why, Fll tell you, 
fays he, except the Ruffian Soldiers in Garrifons, 
and a few of the Inhabitants of the Cities upon the 
Road, all the reft of this Country, for above a tho^ 
fand Miles farther, is inhabited by the worft, and 
moft ignorant of Pagans * and fo indeed we found 
it. 

We were now launch'd into the greateft Piece of 
folid Earth, if I underftand any thing of the Surface 
of the Globe, that is to be found in any Part of the 
World 5 we had at leaft twelve hundred Miles to 
the Sea, Eaftward $ we had at leaft two, tboufand 
to the Bottom of the Baltick Sea, Weftward * and 
above three thoufand Miles, if we left that Sea, 
and went on Weft to the Britifi and French, Chan- 
nels : We had full five thoufand Miles to the IniU 
an, or Perjian Sea, South ; and about eight hundred 
Miles to the Frozen Sea, North * nay^ iff fome : 
People may be believed, there might He, no Sea 
North^Eaft, 'till we came round the Pole, andfcon- 
fequently into the North- Weft, and fo had a Cpqti- 
nent of Land into America, no Mortal knows wliere£ 
tho 5 1 could give fome Reafons, why I believe thai;? 
to be a Miftake too. 

As we enter'd into the Mvfcovhe Dominions, a 
good while before we came to any confiderable 
Towns, we had nothing to obferve there but this * 
firft, That all the Rivers run to the Eaft : As I un- 
derftood by the Charts which fome in our Caravan 
had with them, it was plain, that all thofe Rivers 
ran into the Great River Tamour, or Gammour : This 
River, by the natural Courfe of it muft run into 
Ihe Eaft Sea, or Cbintfe Ocean. The Story they tell 



[ *8o ] 

us, that the Mouth of this River is choak'd up with 
BulLrufhes of a monftruous Growth, (viz.) three 
Foot about, and twenty or thirty Foot high, I mult 
be allow'd to fay, 1 believe nothing of 5 but as its 
Navigation is of no life, becaufe there is no Trade 
that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it belongs, 
dealing in nothing but Cattle, fo no Body that ever 
I heard of, has been curious enough, either to go 
down to the Mouth of it in Boats, or come up from 
the Mouth of it in Ships •, but this is certain, that 
this River running due Eaft, in the Latitude of 
carries a vaft Concourfe of Rivers along 
with it, and finds an Ocean to empty itfelf in that 
Latitude •, fo we are fure of Sea there. 

Some Leagues to the North of this River, there 
are feveral confiderable Rivers, whole Streams run 
as due North as the Tamour runs Eaft, and theft are 
all found to join their Waters with the Great River 
Tartarus, nam'd fo, from the northernmoft Nations 
cf the Movgtd Tartars^ who the Chinefefay, were 
the firft Tartars in the World ^ and who, as our Ge- 
ographers ailed ge, are the Gog and Magog, menti- 
on'd in facred Story, 

Thefe Rivers running all Northward, as well as 
all the other Rivers, I am-yet to fpeak of make it 
evident, that the Northern Ocean bounds the Land 
alfo on that fide *, fo that it does not feem rational 
in the leaft to think, that the Land can extend itlelf 
to join with America on that fide, or that there is 
not a Communication between the Northern and 
the EaRern Ocean \ but of this I fhall fay no more, 
It was my Oblervation at that Time, and therefore 
I take Notice of it in this Place. We now advanc- 
ed from the River Jrguna by eafy and moderate 
Journeys, and were very vifibly oblig'd to the Care 
the Czar of Mufcovy has taken to have Cities and 
Towns built in as many Places as are poffible to 
place them, where his Soldiers keep Garrifon fome- 
liung like the Stationary Soldiers plac'd by tjie Ro? 

mam 



[ 281 3 

mans in the remoteft Countries of their Empire, 
fome of which I had read particularly were plac'd 
in Britain for the Security of Commerce, and for 
the lodging Travellers •, and thus it was here $ for 
where-ever we came, tho'at thefe Towns and Stati- 
ons, the Garrifons and Governour were Ruffians, and 
profels'd Chriftians, yet the Inhabitants of the 
Country were meer Pagans, facrificing to Idols, 
and worfhipping the Sun, Moon, and Stars, or all 
the Hoft of Heaven, and not only fo, but were of 
all the Heathens and Pagans that ever I met with, 
the moft barbarous, except only that they did not 
eat Man's Flefli, as our Savages of America did. 

Some Inftances of this we met with in the Coun- 
try between Axguna, where we enter the Mufcovite 
Dominions, and a City of Tartars and Ruffians toge- 
ther, call'd Nortziuskoy •, in which Space is a conti- 
nue Defart or Foreft, which coft us twenty Days 
to travel over it : In a Village near the laft of thofe 
Places I had the Curiofity to go and fee their Way 
of Living, which is moft brutifti and unfufferabie $ 
they had I fuppofe a great Sacrifice that Day, for 
there flood out upon an old Stump of a Tree, an 
Idol made of Wood, frightful as the Devil, at leaft 
as any Thing we can think of to reprefent the Devil, 
can be made $ it had a Head certainly not fo much 
as refembling any Creature that the World ever faw -, 
Ears as big as Goats Horns, and as high ^ Eyes as 
big as a Crown* Piece ^ a Nofe like a crooked Ram's 
Horn, and a Mouth extended four corner'd, like 
that of a Lion, with horrible Teeth, hooked like a 
Parrot's under Bill * it was dreffed up in the filchi- 
eft manner that you could fuppofe $ its upper Gar* 
ment was of Sheep-Skins, with the Wool outward, 
a great Tartar Bonnet on the Head, with two Horns 
growing through it ; it was about eight Foot high, 
yet had no Feet or Legs, or any other Proportion of 
Farts. 

This 



[ 282 ] 

This Scare crow was fet up at the outer Side of 
the Village, and when I came near to it, there were 
fixteen or feventeen Creatures, whether Men or Wo- 
men, I could not tell for they make no Deftin£Kon 
by their Habits, either of Body or Head : Thefe 
lay all flat on the Ground, round this formidable 
Block of fhapelefs Wood : I faw no Motion among 
them any more, than if they had been all Logs of 
Wood like the Idol, at firft, I really thought they 
had been fo ^ but when I came a little nearer, they 
ftarted up upon their Feet, and rais'd a howling 
Cry, as if it had been fo many deepmouthM Hounds, 
and walk'd away as if they were difpleas'd at our 
disturbing them : A little way off from this Monfter 
and at the Door of a Tent or Hutt, made all of 
Sheep Skins and CowSkins, dry*d, flood three But- 
chers, / thought they were fuch •, for wh$n I came 
nearer to them, I found they had long Knives in 
their Hands, and in the middle of the Tent ap- 
peared three Sheep kill'd, and one young Bullock or 
Steer ; Thefe it feems, were Sacrifices to that fen£ 
lefs Log of an Idol, and thefe three Men, Priefts, 
belonging to it * and the feventeen proftrated 
Wretches, were the People who brought the Offer- 
ing, and were making their Prayers to that Stock. 

I confefs I was more mov'd at their Stupidity and,

envying ("to his Maker) the Homage and Adoration 
of his Creatures, had deluded them into fuch grofs, 
furfeiting, fordid and brutifh things, as one would 
think (hould fhock Nature itfelf. 

But what fignify'd all the Aftonifhment and Re- 
fle&ion of Thoughts * thus it was and I faw it be- 
fore my Eyes, and there was no room to wonder at 
it, or think it impoflible * all my Admiration turn'd 
to Rage, and I rid up to the Image, or Monfter, call 
it what you will, and with my Sword cut the Bon- 
net that was on its Head in two in the middle, fo 
that it hung down by one of the Horns •, and one 
of our Men that was with me took hold of the 
Sheep Skin that covered it, and pulFd at it, when 
behold a moft hideous Outcry and Howling run 
thro* the Village, and two or three hundred People 
came about my Ears, fo that I was glad to fcour 
for it $ for we faw fome had Bows and Arrows $ 
but I refolved from that Moment to vifit them 

Our Caravan refled three Nights at the Town, 
again. 

which was about four Miles off, in order to provide 
fome Horfes which they wanted feverai of the Hor- 
fes having been lam'd, and jaded, with the badnefs 
of the Way and long March over the laft Defart ; 
fo we had fome Leifure here to put my Defign in 
Execution : I communicated my Projeft to the Scots 
Merchant of MuJcow y of whofe Courage I had had 
fufficient Teftimony, as above : I told him what I 
had feen, and with what Indignation I had fince 
thought that human Nature could be fo degenerate : 
I told him, I was refolv'd if \ could get but four or 
five Men well arm'd to go with me, I was refolv'd 
to go and deftroy that vile, abominable Idol ; to lee 
them fee that it had no Power to help itlelf, and 
confe quently could not be anObje£tof Worfhip, 
or to be pray'd to, much lefs help them that effer'd 
Sacrifices to it. He 



[ 284 ] 

He laugh'd at me * fays he, Your Zeal may be 
good, but what do you propofe to yourfelf by it ? 
Propofe, faid J, to vindicate the Honour of G<*d y 
which is infulted by this Devil Worfhip. But how 
will it vindicate thp Honour of God, faid he ? 
While the People will not be able to know what 
you mean by it, unlefs you could fpeak to th^tn 
too, and tell them fo, and then they will fight you, 
and beat you too, ill affure you, for they are de- 
iperate Fellows, and that efpeciajly in Defence of 
their Idolatry. Can we nor/fatd I, do it in the 
Kight, and then leave them the Reafonsand Caufes 
m Writing in their own Language >' Writing ! faid 
&e> why there is not 3 Man in five Nations ofthetri 
that know any thing of a Letter, or ho^r to read at 
Word in any Language, or in their ownf Wretch- 
ed Ignorance? faid I to him ^ however | have a 
gjeat mind to do it$ perhaps Nature may draw In- 
ferences from it to them, to let them fee how brutiHi 
they are, to worfhip fuch horrid Things. Look yoif % 
Sir, faid he, if your Zeal prompts you to it fa 
warmly, you muftdoit^ but in the next place I 
would have you confider, thefewild Nations of Peo- 
ple are fubje&ed by Force to the Czar of Mufcovfs 
Dominions, and if you do this, 'tis ten to one but 4 
they will come by Thoufinds to the Governour of 
ffiertfimkay, and complain, and demand Satisfa&ion * 
and if he cannot give them Satisfaction, 'tis ten to 
©ne but they revolr, and it will occafion a new War 
with all the Tartars in the Country. 

This, I confefs, put new Thoughts into my Head 
for a while •, but I harp'd upon the fame String ftill, 
and all that Day I was uneafy to put my ProjeQ: irt 
Execution : Towards the Evening the Scots Mer- 
chant met me by Accident in our Walk about the 
Town, and defir'd to fpeak with me * I believe, faid 
lie, I have put yon off of your good Defign-, I 
lave been a little concerned about it fince, for I ab- 
hot the Idol and Idolatry as much as you can do i 

Truly, 



I 



[ 285 ] 

Yruly, fays I, you have put it off a little as to the 
Execution of it, but you have not put it at all out 
of my Thoughts, and I believe I (hall do it (till 
before I quit this place ; tho D I were to be delivered 
up to them for Satisfaction. No, no, fays be, God 
forbid they fhould deliver you up to fuch a Crew 
of Montters * they (hall not do that neither, that 
would be murdering you indeed, Why, fays J, howr 
would they ufe me ? life you / fays he 5 1 11 tell 
you how they (erved a poor Rn$an, who affronted 
them in their Wor(hip juft as you did, and who 
they took Prifoner •, after they had lam'd him with 
an Arrow that he could not run away, they took 
him and ftripp'd him Hark naked, and fet him up 
on the top of the Idol Monfter, and flood all round 
him, and (hot as many Arrows into him as would 
flick over his whole Body, and then they burnt 
him and all the Arrows (ticking in him ^Sacri- 
fice to the Idol. And was this the fame Idol > 
Yes, fays he, the very fame. Wei], fays J, Fil tell 
you a Story $ fo I related the Story of our Men at 
Madagafcar, and how they burnt and fack'd the Vil- 
lage there, and kill'd Man, Woman and Child, for 
their murdering one of our Men, juft as it is related 
before ^ and when I had done, I added, that I thought 
we ought to do fo to this Village. 

He liften'd very attentively to the Story; but when I 
talk'd of doing (0 to that Vil]ageJijj&e,You miftake 
verymuch, it was not this Village,itwas almofta hun- 
dred Mile from this place, but it was the farneIdol,for 
they carry him about in Proceffion all over the Coun- 
try : Well, fays I, then that Idol ought to be punifhM 
for it, and it (hall* fays I, if I live this Night out. 

In a word, finding me refolute, he lik'd the De- 
fign, and told me I fhould not go alone, but he would 
go with me, and bring a ftout Fellow, one of his 
Countrymen, to go alfo with us* and one, fays he, 
as famous for his Zeal as you can defire any one 
to be, againft fuch Devililh things as thefe 2 In a

word, he brought me his Comrade, a Scots Man, 
who he call'd Captain RicbarAfon, ahd I gave him 
a full account of what I had feen 5 and alfo of what 
I intended •, and he told me readily, he would go 
with me if it coft him his Life; fo we agreed to 
go only us Three. I had indeed proposed it to my 
Partner, but he declined it $ he faid, he was ready to 
affift me to the utmoft, and upon all occafions for 
my defence; but that this was an Adventure quite 
out of his way ; fo, I fay, we refolv'd upon our 
Work only us Three and my Man-Servant, and to 
put it in Execution that Night about Midnight, 
with all the Secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon fecond Thoughts, we were will* 
ing to delay it till the next Night becaufe the Ca* 
tavan being to fet forward in the Morning, we fup- 
pos'd the Governour could not pretend to give 
them any Satisfa&ion upon us when we tvere out 
of his Power- The Scots Merchant, as fteady in his 
Refolution for Enterprize it, as bold in executing, 
brought me a Tartar's Robe or Gown of Sheep Skins, 
and a Bonnet, with a Bow and Arrows, and had 
provided the fame for himielf and his Count *y-man, 
that the People, if they faw us fhould not be able 
to determine who we were. 

All the firtt Night we fpent in mixing up fome 
combuttible Matter with Aqua-vita:, Gun-powder, 
and fuch other Materials as we could get, and ha- 
ving a good Quantity of Tar in a little Pot, about 
an Hour after Night we fet out upon our Expedition, 

We came to the Place about Eleven a Clock at 
Night, and found that the People had not the leaft 
Jealoufy of Danger attending their Idol-, the Night 
was cloudy, yet the Moon gave us Light enough 
to fee that the Idol flood juft in the fame Pofture 
and Place that it did before: The People feemed to 
be all at their Rett, only, that in the great Hutt, or 
Tent, as we called it, where we faw the three Priefts, 
who we miftook for Butchers, we law a Light, and 

going 



[ *8 7 ] 

going up clofe to the Door, we heard People talking, 
as if there were five or fix of them* we concluded 
therefore, that if we fet Wild fire to the Idol, thefe 
Men would come out immediately, and run up to 
the Place to refcue it from the Dettruftion that we 
intended for it, and what to do with them we knew 
not * once we thought of carrying it away and let- 
ting Fire to it at a Diftance * but when we came to 
handle it, we found it too bulky for our Carriage, 
fo we were at a Lofs again : The fecond Scots Man 
was for letting Fire to the Tent or Hutt, and knock- 
ing the Creatures that were there on the Head when 
they came out* but 1 could not joyn with that* I 
was againft killing them, if it was poflible to be 
avoided : Well then, faid the Scots Merchant, F1I 
tell you what we will do, we will try to take them 
Prifoners, tye their Hands behind them, and make 
them ftand ftill, and fee their Idol deltroy'd. 

As it happened, we had Twine or Packthread 
enough about us, which was uled to tye our Fire- 
Works together with * fo we refolved to attack 
thefe People firft, and with as little Noife as we 
could : The firft Thing we did, we knocked at the 
Door, which iffued juft as we defired it •, for one 
of their Idol Priefts came to the Door : We imme- 
diately feized upon him, ftop'd his Mouth, and ty'd 
his Hands behind him, and led him to the Idol, 
where we gagg'd him, that he might not make a 
Noife *.ty'd his Feet alfo together, and left hirn 
on the Ground. 

Two of us then waited at the Door, expeEHng 
that another would come out to fee what the 
Matter was * but we waited fo long 'till the third 
Man came back to us * and then no Body coming 
out, we knocked again gently, and immediately 
out came two more, and we ferved them jult in 
the fame manner, but was oblig'd to go all with 
them, and lay them down by the Idol fome Di- 
ftance from one another * when going back, we 

found 



[ 2 88] 

found two mote were come out to the Door, 
and a third flood behind them within the Doors 
We feiz'd the two, and immediately ty'd them, 
when the third ftepping back, and crying out, my 
Sots Merchant went in after him, and taking out t 
Compofition we had made, that would only Smoak 
and Stink, he fet Fire to it, and threw it in among 
them 5 by that time the other Scots Man and rriy 
Man taking Charge of thfe two Men who were al- 
ready bound, and ty'd together aifo by the Arm, 
led them away to the Idol, and left them there, to 
fee if their Idol would relieve them, making haft 
back to us. 

When the Fu£e we had thrown in had fill'd the 
Hutt with fb much Smoak, that they were almoft 
fuffocated, we then threw in a fmall Leather Bag 
of another kind, which flam'd like a Candle, and 
following it in, we found there was but four People 
left, who, it feems, were two Men and two Women, 
anck as we fuppofed, had been about fome of their 
Diabolick Sacrifices : They appeared, in fhort, fright, 
ed to Death, at leaft fo as to fit trimbling and ftiipid, 
and not able to fpeak neither, for the Smoak. 

In a Word, we took them, bound them as we 
had the other, and all without any Noife ; I fhould 
have faid, we brought them out of the Houfe of 
Hutt firft i for indeed we were not able to bear the 
Smoak any more than they were. When we had 
done this, we carry 'd them all together to the Idol : 
When we came there, we fell to work with him $ 
and firft we daub'd him all over, and his Robes alfo, 
with Tar and fuch other Stuff as we had, which 
was Tallow mix'd with Brimftone $ then we ftopp'd 
his Eyes, and Ears, and Mouth full of Gun-powder, 
then we wrapp'd up a great piece of Wild-fire in 
his Bonnet, and then flicking all the Combuftibles 
we had brought with us upon him, we look'd about 
to fee if we could find any thing elfe to help to 
burn him, when my Scots Man remembredj that by 

the 



[ **9 ] 

the Tent or Hutt where the Men were, there lay a 
heap of dry Forage, whether Straw or Rufhes I do 
not remember h away he and the other Scots Man 
run, and fetch'd their Arms full of that : VVhen we had 
done this, we took all our Prifoners, and brought them, 
having unty'd their Feet, andungagg'd their Mouths, 
and made them ltand up, and fet them juft before 
their monftrousldol, and then fet fire to the whole. 

We ftay'd by it a quarter of an Hour, or therea- 
bouts, 'till the Powder in the Eyes, and Mouth, 
and Ears of the Idol blew up, and as we could per- 
ceive had fplit and deformed the Shape of it 5 and in 
a Word, 'till we faw it burn into a meer Block or 
Log of Wood, and then fetting the dry Forage to 
it, we found it would be foon quite confiim'd, fb 
we began to think of going away * but the Scot;* 
Man faid no, we muft nor go, for thefe poor delud- 
ed Wretches will all throw themfelves into the Fire, 
and burn themfelves with the Idol $ fo we refolved 
to ftay 'till the Forage was burnt down too, and 
then we came away and left them. 

In the Morning we appeared among our Fellow 
Travellers, exceeding bufy, in getting ready for our 
Journey *, nor could any Man fuggeft that we had 
been any where but in our Beds, as Travellers might 
be fuppos'd to be, to fit themfelves for the Fatigues 
of that Day's Journey. 

But it did not end fo y for the next Day came a 
great Multitude of the Country People, not only of 
this Village, but of a hundred more, for ought I 
know, to rhe Town-Gates, and in a molt outragious 
manner, demanded Satisfa£lion of the Ruffian Gov- 
ernor, for the infulting their Priefts, and burning 
their Great Cbam-Chi-Tbauvgi^ fuch a hard Name 
they gave the monftrous Creature they worfhip'd* 
the People of Nertfimkay, were at firft in agreacCon- 
flernation, for they faid, the Tartars were no lefs than 
thirty thoufand, and that in a few days more, would 
be one hundred thoufand ftrong, 

T The 



[ 290 ] 

The Ruffian Governour fent out MefTengers to ap- 
peafe them, and gave them all the good words ima- 
ginable : He allured them, he knew nothing of ir, 
and that there had not a Soul of his Garrifon been 
abroad : That it could not be from any Body there 5 
and if they would let him know who it was, they 
fhould be examplarily punifhed. They returned 
haughtily, that all the Country reverenced the Great 
Cbam-CbhThamgii) who dwelt in the Sun, and no 
Mortal would have decreed to offer Violence to his 
Image, but fome Chriftian Mifcfeant, fo they cali'd 
them it feems $ and they therefore denounced War 
againft him, and all the Rujjiam y who, they faid, 
were Mifcreants and Chriftians. 

The Governour ftill patient, and unwilling to 
make a Breach, or to have any Caufe of Wat alledg- 
ed to be given by him*, The Czar having ftraitly 
charged them to treat the conquer'd Country with 
Gentlenefs and Civility, gave them ftill all the good 
Words he could y at laft he told them, there was a 
Caravan gone towards Rujfia that Morning, and per- 
haps it was fome of them, who had done them this 
Injury •, and thatif they would be fatisfied with that* 
he would fend after them, to enquire into it : This 
feem'd to appeafe them a little 1 and accordingly 
the Governour fent after us, and gave us a particu- 
lar Account how the Thing was , intimating withal, 
that if any in our Caravan had done it, they fhould 
xriake their Efcape y but that whether they had done 
It or no, we fhould make all the haft forward that 
was pofiible y and that in the mean time, he would 
keep them in play as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the Governour $ how- 
ever, when it came to the Caravan, there was no 
Body knew any Thing of the Matter •, and as for 
u$ that were guilty, we were the lealt of all fufpe- 
£led * none fo much asask'd us the Queftion , how- 
ever, the Captain of the Caravan for the Time, 
took the Hint that the Governour gave us, and we 

marchCcl 



[ 25>i ] 

marched or travelled two Days and two Nights, 
without any confiderable Stop ; and then we lay at 
a Village called Pktbus $ nor did we make any long 
Stop here, but haflen'd on towards Jarawena^ ano- 
ther of the Czar of Mufcovfs Colonies, and where 
we expe&ed we fhould be fafe ; but it is to be ob- 
ferv'd, that here we began for two or three Days 
march, to enter upon a vaft namelefs Defart, of 
which I fhall fay more in its Place ^ and which, if 
we had now been upon it, 'tis more than probable, 
we had been all deitroy'd : It was the fecond Day's 
march from Plothus^ that by the Clouds of Duft be- 
hind us at a great Diftance, (ome of our People be- 
gan to be fenfible we were purfued * we had enter'd 
the Defart, and had pafled by a great Lake calPd 
Scbaks Ofer when we perceiv'd a very great Body of 
Horfe appear on the other Side of the Lake to the 
North, We travelling Weft : We obferv'd they went 
away Welt as we did, but had fuppofed we would 
have taken that Side of the Lake, whereas, we very 
happily took the South-Side •, and in two Days 
more we faw them not, for they believing we were 
ftili before them, pufh'd on, 'till they came to the 
River Udda 5 this is a very great River when it pafles 
farther North * but where we came to it, we found 
it narrow, and ford able. 

The third Day they either found their Miftake, 
or had intelligence of us, and came pouring in up- 
on us, towards the Dusk of the Evening : We had, 
to our great Satisfa&ion, juft pitch'd upon a Place 
for our Camp, which was very convenient for the 
Night ^ for as we were upon a Defart, tho' but at 
the beginning of it, that was above five hundred 
Miles over, we had no Towns to Lodge at, and in- 
deed expefted none but the City Jarawena^ which 
we had yet two Days march to ♦, the Defart however, 
had fome few Woods in it on this Side, and little 
Rivers, which ran all into the great River Udda : 
It was in a narrow Strait between two little, but very 

T 2 thick 



[ 2p2 ] 

thick Woods, that we pitched our little Camp for 
that Night, expe&ing to be attacked in the Night, 

No body knew but curfelves, what we were pur- 
fued for $ but as it was ufuai for the Monptl Tartars 
to go about in Troops in that Defart. fo the Cara- 
vans always fortify themfelves every Night againft 
them, as againft Armies of Robbers $ and it was 
therefore no new thing to be purfued. 

But we had this Night, of all the Nights of out 
Travels, a moft advantageous Camp 5 for we lay 
between two Woods, with a little Rivulet running 
juft before our Front * fo that we could not be fur- 
founded, or attacked any way, but in our Front or 
Rear $ we took care alfo to make our Front as 
ftrong as we could, by placing our Packs, with our 
Camels and Horfes, all in a Line on the Infide of 
the River, and felling fome Trees in our Rear. 

In this Pofture we encamp'd for the Night, but 
the Enemy was upon us before we had finifli'd our 
Situation : They did not come on us like Thieves as 
we expe£ted, but fent three Meffengers to us, to de- 
mand the Men to be delivered to them, that had 
abus'd their Priefts, and burnt their God, Cham- 
Chi-Thanngu with Fire, that they might burn them 
with Fire * and upon this, they faid they would go 
away, and do us mo further harm, otherwife, they 
would burn us all with Fire. Our Men look'd very 
blank at this Meflage, and began to ttare at one ano- 
ther, to fee who look'd with moft Guilt in their 
Faces 5 but no Body was the Word, no Body did it. 
The Leader of the Caravan fent Word, he was well 
affur'd, it was not done by any of our Camp 5 that 
we were peaceable Merchants, travelling on our Bu* 
finefs 5 that we had done no harm to them, or to 
any one elfe $ and that therefore they muft look 
farther for their Enemies who had injur'd thern^ for 
tore were not the People h fo defir d them not to 
difturb us, for if they did, wefliould defend our- 
felves. 

They 




H.CruJb e wifliyMufcovite Ca ravan pafsmg y T)efarts are 



C 2*3 ] 

They were fir from being fatisfy'd with this for 
an Anfwer, but a great Crowd ot them came down 
in the Morning by break of Day to our Camp* but 
feeing us in fuch an unaccountable Situation, they 
durtt come no farther than the Brook in our Front, 
where they flood and fhew'd us fuch a Number, that 
indeed terrify 'd us very much •, for thofe that ipoke 
leatt of them, fpoke of ten thoufand : Here they 
flood and look'd at us a while, and then fetting up 
a great Howl, they let fly a Cloud of Arrows among 
us 5 but we were well enough fortified for that * 
for we fhelter'd under our Baggage, and I do not 
remember that one Man of us was hurt. 

Some Time after this, we fee them move a little 
to our Right, and expefted them on the Rear, when 
a cunning Fellow, a CoJJach, as they call them, of 
Jarawena^ in the Pay of the Mufcovites, calling tot 
the Leader of the Caravan, faid to him, Fli go fend 
all thefe People away to Siheilka$ this was a City, 
four or five Days Journey at leaft to the Sou h, J and 
rather behind us: So he takes his Bow and Arrows, 
and getting on Horfe-back, be rides away from our 
Rear direftly, as it were back to Nertsjinskay ^ after 
this, he takes a great Circuit about, and comes to 
the Army of the Tartars, as if he had been fent 
Exprefs to tell them a long Story 5 that the People 
who had burnt ihsCham Chilhaimgu, were gone to 
Siheilka, with a Caravan of Mifcreants, as he calFd 
them, that is to fay, Chriftians ; and that they had 
refoiv'd to burn the God Scbal-Ifar, belonging to thf 
Tovgiiefes. 

As this Fellow was himfeif a meet Tartar, and 
perfe&iy fpoke their Language, he counterfeited fo 
well, that they all took it from him, and away they 
drove in a moft violent Hurry to Siheilka, which it 
feems was five Days Journey to the North, and in 
lefs than three Hours, they were entirely out of our 
Sight, and we never heard any more of them 5 nor 

T 3 ever 



[ 2?4 1 

ever knew whether they went to that other Place 
called Sibeilka^ or no. 

So we pafs'd fafely on to the City of Jarawena^ 
where there was a Garrifon of Mvfcovites, and there 
we retted five Days, the Caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the la It Days hard match, and with 
want of Reft in the Night. 

From this City we had a frightful Defart, which 
held us three and twenty Days march : We fur- 
nifh'd our felves with fome Tents here, for the bet- 
ter accommodating our felves in the Night j and 
the Leader of the Caravan, procured fixteen Car- 
riages or Waggons of the Country, for carrying our 
Water and Provifions, and thefe Carriages was our 
Defence every Night round our little Camp ^ fo 
that had the Tartars appeared, unlefs they had been 
very numerous indeed, they would not have begn 
able to hurt us. 

We may well be fuppofed to want Reft again after 
this long Journey •, for in this Defart we faw neither 
Houfe or Tree, or fcarce a Bufh $ we faw abundance 
of the Sable-Hunters, as they calfd them: Thefe 
are all Tartars of the Movgul Tcrtaty, of which this 
Country is a part, and they frequently attack fmall 
Caravans, but we law no Numbers of them together : 
I was curious to fee the Sable Skins they catched, 
but could never fpeak with any of them, for they 
durft not come near us, neither durft we ftraggle from 
our Company, to go near them. 

After we had pafs'd this Delart, we came into a 
Country pretty well inhabited % that is to fay, we 
found Towns and Caftles, fettled by the Czar of 
Mufcovy y with Garrifons of Stationary Soldiers to 
prottft the Caravans, and defend the Country a- 
gainft the Tartars^ who would otherwtfe mal&e it 
very dangerous travelling-, and his Cxarijh Majefty 
has given fuch ftrift Orders for the well guarding the 
Caravans and Merchants, that if there are any Tar- 
tars heard of in the Country, Detachments of the 

Garrifons 



I 



[ 2p5 1 

Garrifons are always fent to fee the Travellers fife 
from Station to Station. 

And thus the Govemour of Adinskoy, who I had 
Opportunity to make a Vilit to, by means of the 
Scots Merchant who was acquainted with him, of- 
fered us a Guard of 6fty Men, if we thought there 
was any Danger to the next Station. 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer 
to Europe we fhould find the Country better peo- 
pled, and the People more civiliz'd, but I found my 
fclf miftaken in both, for we had yet the Nation of 
the Tovguefes to pafs thro 5 ^ where we faw the fame 
Tokens of Paganifm and Barbarity, or worfe, than 
before, only as they were conquered by the Mufcovir 
tes, and entirely reducM, they were not fo dange- 
rous ; but for Rudenefs of Manners, Idolatry, and 
Multitheifm no People in the World ever went be- 
yond them : They are cloath'd all in Skins of Bealts, 
and their Houfes are built of the fame : You know 
not a Man from a Woman, neither by the Rugged- 
neft of their Countenances or their Cloaths 5 and 
in the Winter, when the Ground is covered with 
Snow, they live under Ground in Houfes like Vaults^ 
which have Cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cbam-Cbi-Thauvgvi for a 
whole Village or Country, thefe had Idols in every 
Hutt and in every Cave 5 befides they Worfhip the 
Stars, the Sun, the Water, the Snow, and in a word* 
everything that they do not underfland, and they un- 
d&ritancl but very little •, fo that almoft every Ele- 
ment, every uncommon thing, fers them a facrificing. 

But I am Ho more to defcribe People than Coun- 
tries, any farther than my own Story comes to be 
concerned ip them ; 1 met with nothing peculiar to 
my felf in all this Country, which I reckon was 
from the Defart which 1 fpoke of laft, at leaft 400 
Miles, half of it being another Defart, which took 
us up twelve Days fevere travelling, without Houfe, 
or Tree, or Bufh, but Were oblig'd again to cany,

our own Provifions, as well Water as Bread. After 
we were out of this Defarr, and had travell'd two 
Days, we came to Jamzay, a Mufcovite City or Sta- 
tion, on the great River Janezay : This River they 
told us parted Europe from Afa^ tho' our Map ma- 
kers, as I am told, do not agree to it 5 however, it 
is certainly the EaRern Boundary of the ancient Si- 
beria, which now makes up a Province only of the 
vaft Mufcovite Fmpire, but is Ir felf equal in Bignefs 
to the whole Empire of Germany. 

And yet here 1 obferv'd Ignorance and Pjganifm 
ftill prevailed, except in the Mufcovite Garriions $ 
all *he Country between the River Ob) and the Ri- 
ver Janezay is as entirely Pagan, and the People as 
barbarous, as the remoteft of the Tartars, nay, as 
any Nation for ought i know in Jjia or America : I 
alfo found which I obferv'd to the Mufcovite Govern- 
ours who 1 had Opportunity to converfe with, that 
the poor Pagans are not much the wiier or the near- 
er Chriftianity for being under the Mufcovite Go- 
vernment ^ which they acknowledged was true 
enough, but, as they faid, was none of their Bufi- 
nefs : That if the Czar expelled to convert his Sibe- 
rian^ or Tonguefe i or Tartar Subjefts, it fhould be 
done by fending Clergymen among them, not Sol- 
diers ^ and they added, with more Sincerity than I 
expefted, that they found it was not fo much the 
Concern of their Monarch to make the People Chri- 
ftians, as it was to make them SubjeSs. 

From this River to the great River Oby^ we crofs'd 
a wild uncultivated Country 5 I cannot fay 'tis a bar- 
ren Soil $ 'tis only barren of People, and good Ma- 
nagement, otherwife it is in itfelf a moft pleafanr, 
fruitful and agreeable Country : What Inhabitants 
we found in it are all Pagans, except fuch as are 
fent among them from Rujia ^ for this is the Coun- 
try I mean on both Sides the River Oby, whither the 
Mufcovite Criminals, that are not put to Death, are 
banifh'd, and from whence it is next toimpoffible they 
fhould ever come away, I have 



[ *97 ] 

I have nothing material to fay of my particular 
Affairs, til] I came to Jobolski, the Capital City of 
Siberia, where I continued fome time on the fol- 
lowing Occalion. 

We had been now almoft feven Months on our 
Journey, and Winter began to come on apace 5 
whereupon my Parmer and I calPd a Council about 
our particular Affairs, in which we found it proper, 
confidering that we were bound for England and not 
for Mujcow, to confider how to difpofe of ourfelves : 
They told us of Sledges and Raine Deer to carry us 
over rhe Snow in the Winter time •, and indeed they 
have fuch things, that it would be incredible to re- 
late the Particulars of, by which means the Ruffians 
travel more in the Winter than they can in Summer, 
becaufe in thefe Sleds they are able to run Night and 
Day •, the Snow being frozen, is one univerfal Co* 
vering to Nature, by which the Hills, the Vales, the 
Rivers, the Lakes, all are fmooth, and hard as a 
Stone, and they run upon the Surface, without any 
regard to what is underneath. 

But I had no occafion to pufh at a Winter Jour- 
ney of this kind : 1 was bound to England, not to 
Mufcow, and my Rout lay two Ways, either I mult 
go on as the Caravan went 'till I came to Jerojlaw, 
and then go off Weft for Narva and the Guiph of 
Finland • and fo either by Sea or Land to Dantzick, 
where I might poffibly fell my China Cargo to good 
Advantage, or I muft leave the Caravan at a little 
Town on the Dmina, from whence I had bur 
fix Days by Water to Arch-Angel, and from thence 
might be fure of Shipping, either to England, Hol- 
land, or Hamburgh. 

Now to go any of thefe Journeys in the Winter, 
would have been prepofterous , for as to Dantzick y 
the Baltick would be frozen up, and I could not gee 
PafTage, and to go by Land in thofe Countries, 
was far left fafe than among the Mongul Tartars y 
likewife to go to Arch- Angel in OSober^ all the Ships 

would 



[ *5>8 ] 

would be gone from thence, and even the Merchants 
who dwell therein Summer, retire South to Mufcom 
in the Winter when the Ships are gone ; fo that I 
fhould have nothing bur Extremity of Cold to en- 
counter, with a Scarcity of Provisions, and muft 
lie there in an empty Town all the Winter : So that 
upon the whole 1 thought it much my better way to 
let the Caravan go, and to make Provifion to Win- 
ter where 1 was, (viz) at Tobokki in Siberia, in the 
Latitude of Degrees, where I was fure of three 
Things to wear out a cold Winter with, (viz.) Plenty 
of Provifion fuch as the Country afforded $ a warm 
Houfe, with Fuel enough, and excellent Company * 
of all which I (hall give a full Account of in its Place. 

I was now in a quite different Climate from my 
feelov'd Ifland, where I never felt Cold' except when 
I had my Agile $ on the contrary, 1 had much to do 
to bear any Cloaths on my Back, and never made 
any Fire but without doors, and for my neceflity in 
drefling myFood,£?V.Now 1 made me three good Vefts, 
with large Robes or Gowns over them to hang down 
to the Feet,and button clofe to the Wrifts, and all thefc 
lin'd with Furs to make them fufficiently warm. 

As to a warm Houfe, I muft contefs 1 greatly dif- 
lik'd our way in England of making Fires in every 
Room in the Houfe, in open Chimneys, which when 
the Fire was out, always kept the ^ir in the Room 
cold as the Climate : But taking an Appartment in a 
good Houfe in the Town, I order'd a Chimney to be 
built like a Furnace, in the Center of fix feveral 
Rooms, like a Stove, the Funnel\ro carry theSmoak 
went up one Way, the Door to come at the Fire 
went in another, and all the Rooms were kept 
equally warm, but no Fire feen ^ like as they heat 
the Bagnios in England. 

By this means we had always the fame Climate in 
all the Rooms, and an equal Heat was preferv'd* 
and how cold foe ver it was without, it was always^ 
warm within, and yet we faw no Fire, nor was ever 
incommoded with any Smoak. The 



[ *99 ] 

The moft wonderful thing of all was, that it 
fhould be poffible to meet with good Company 
here, in a Country fo barbarous as that of the moft 
Northerly Parts of Europe, near the frozen Ocean, 
and within but a very few Degrees of Nova Zcmbla^ 

But this being the Country where the State Cri- 
minals of Mvfcovy, as I obferv'd before, are all ba- 
nifh'd, this City was full of Noblemen, Princes, Gen- 
tlemen, Colonels, and in fhort all Degrees of the No- 
bility, Gentry, Soldiery and Courtiers of Mvfcovyi 
Here was the famous Prince Gallftozen, the old Ge- 
neral Roboflisk^ and feveral other Perfons of note, 
and fome Ladies. 

By means of my Scots Merchant, who neverthe- 
Iefs I parted with here, I made an Acquaintance 
here with feveral of thefe Gentlemen, and fome of 
them of the firft Rank, and from thele in the long 
Winter Nights in which I ftay'd here, I received fe- 
veral very agreeable Vifits : It was talking one Night 

with Prince one of the banifh'd Minifters 

of State belonging to the Czar of Mnfcovy, that my 
Talk of my particular Cafe began : He had been tel- 
ling me abundance of fine Things of the Greatnefs, 
the Magnificence, the Dominions, and the abfblute 
Power of the Emperor of the Ruffians. I interrupt- 
ed him, and told him I was a greater and more 
powerful Prince than ever the Czar of Mnfcovy was, 
tho' my Dominions were not fo large, or my Peo- 
ple fo many. The Ruffian Grandee look'd a little 
furpiz'd, and fixing his Eyes Iteddily upon me, be- 
gan to wonder what I meant. 

I told him, his Wonder would ceafe when I had 
explain'd myfelf : Firft, J t old him, I had the abfo- 
lute Difpofal of the Lives and Fortunes of all my 
Subje&s : That notwithftanding my abfoiute Power, 
I had not one Perfon difaffe£ted to my Govenment, 
or to my Perfon, in all my Dominions. He fhook 
his Head at that, and faid, there indeed I outdid the 
C?ar of Mnfcovy. I told him, That all the Lands in 

my 



[ 3oo ] 

my Kingdom were my own, and all my Subjefts 
were not only my Tenants, but Tenants at Will : 
That they would all fight for me to the lalt Drops 
and that never Tyrant, for fitch I acknowledged myfelf 
to be^ was ever Co univerfally beloved, and yet fb 
horribly feared by his Subje&s. 

After amufing them with thefe Riddles in Go- 
vernment for a while, I open'd the Cafe, and told 
them the Story at large of my living in the Ifland, 
and how I managed both myfelf and the People 
there that were under me, juft as I have fince mi- 
nuted it down. They were exceedingly taken with 
the Story, and efpecially the Prince^who told me 
with a Sigh, that the true Greatnels of Life was to 
be Matter cf ourfelves: That he would not have ex- 
changed fuch a State of Life as mine, to have been 
Czar of Mufcovy^ and that he found more Felicity 
in the Retirement he feem'd to be banifh'd to there, 
than ever he found in the highelt Authority he en^ 
joy'd in the Court of his Matter the Czar : That 
the Heighth of human Wifdom was to bring our 
Tempers down to our Circumfiances-, and to make 
a Calm within, under the Weight of the greateft 
Storm without. When he came firft hither, hefaid 
he ufed to tear the Hair from his Head, and the 
Cloaths from his Back, as others had done before 
him $ but a little Time and Confideration had made 
him look into, himfelf, as well as round himfelf, to 
things without $ That he fouud the Mind of Man, 
if it was but once brought to reflett upon the State 
of univerfal Life, and how little this World was 
concern'd in its trud Felicity, was perfectly capable 
of making a Felicity for itfelf, fully fatisfying to 
itfelf, and fuitable to its own heft Ends and De- 
fires, with but very little Affiftance from the World : 
That Air to breath in, Food to fuftain Life, Cloaths 
for Warmth, and Liberty for Exercife in order to 
Health, compleated, in his Opinion, all that the 
World cpuld do for us* and tho 5 the Greatnefs, the 

Authority, 



f 301 ] 

Authority, the Riches, and the Pleafures which 
fome enjoy'd in the World, and which he had en- 
joyed his Share of, had much in them that was agree- 
able to us, yet he obferved that all thofe things 
chiefly gratify'd the coarfeft of our Affe&ions h fuch 
as our Ambition, our particular Pride, our Avarice, 
our Vanity, and our Senfuality 5 all which were 
indeed the meer Produft of the worft part of Man, 
were in themfelves Crimes, and had in them thg 
Seeds of all manner of Crime, but neither were re- 
lated to, or concern'd with any of thofe Virtues 
that conftituted us wife Men, or of thofe Graces 
which diftinguifh'd us as Chriftians : That being 
now deprived of all the fancy 'd Felicity, which he 
enjoy'd in the full Exercile of all thofe Vices, he 
faid he was at leifure to look upon the dark Side 
of them, where he found all manner of Deformity; 
and was now convinced, that Virtue only makes a 
Man truly Wife, Rich, and Great, and preferves 
him in the way to a fuperior Happinefs in a fu- 
ture State. And in this, be faid, they were more 
happy in their Banifhment, than all their Enemies 
were, who had the full Pofleflion of all the Wealth 
and Power that they (the BanifL'd) had left behind 
them. 

Nor, Sir, fays fo, do ( bring my Mind to this 
politically, by the Neceflity of my Circumftances, 
which fome call miferable ; but if I know any thing 
of my felf, I would not now go back, no not tho* 
the Czar, my Matter, fhould call me, and offer to 
re-inftate me in all my former Grandeur -, I fay, I 
would no more go back to it, than I believe my 
Soul, when it fhall be delivered from this Prifon 
of the Body, and has had a Tafte of the glorious 
State beyond Life, would come back to the Jayl of 
Flelh and Blood it is now inclos'd in, and leave 
Heaven to deal in the Dirt and Crime of human 
Affairs. 

He 



[ 302 } 

He fpoke this with fo much Warmth in his 
Temper, fo much Earneftnefs and Motion of his 
Spirits, which were apparent in his Countenance, 
that it was evident it was the true Senfe of his 
Soul : And indeed there was no room to doubt his 
Sincery. 

I told him, I once thought myfeif a kind of a 
Monarch in my old Station, of which I had given 
him an Account, but that I thought he was not a 
Monarch only, but a great Conqueror •, for that he 
that has got a Vi&ory over his own exorbitant De- 
fires, and has the abfolute Dominion over himfelf, 
whole Reafon entirely governs his Will, is certainly 
greater than he that conquers a City But, my Lord, 
/aid J, (hall I take the Liberty to ask you a Quefti- 
on ? With all my Heart, fays he, If the Door of 
your Liberty was open'd, /aid I, would you not 
take hold of it to deliver yourfelf from this 
Exile. 

Hold, /aid he, your Queftion is fubtle, and re- 
quires fome ferious juft Diftin&ions, to give it a fin- 
cere Anfwer $ and I'll give it you from the Bottom 
of my Heart. Nothing that I know of in this 
World would move me to deliver myfeif from this 
State of Banifhment, except thefe two, Firft, the 
Enjoyment of my Relations, and Secondly, a little 
warmer Climate •, but I proteft to you, that to go 
back to the Pomp of the Court, the Glory, the Pow- 
er, the Hurry of a Minifter of State, the Wealth, 
the Gaiety, and the Pleafures, that is to fay, Follies 
of a Courtier $ if my Matter ftiould fend me Word 
this Moment, that he reftores me to all he banifh'd 
me from $ I proteft, If I know ?nyfelf at all, I would 
not leave this Wildernefs, thefe Defarts, and thefe 
frozen Lakes, for the Palace at Mufcom. 

But, my Lord, faid I, perhaps you not only are 
banifh'd from the Pleafures of the Court, and from 
the Power, and Authority, and Wealth you enjoy'd 
before j but you may be abfent too from fome of che 

Con- 



[ 3°3 1 

Conveniences of Life, your Eftate perhaps confifcat- 
ed and your Effe&s plundered, and the Supplies left 
you here may not be fuitable to the ordinary De- 
mands of Life. 

Ay, fays he, that is as you fuppofe me to be a 
Lord, or a Prince, iffc. So indeed I am * but you 
are now to consider me only as a Man ; a human 
Creature, not at ail diftinguifh'd from another^ and 
fo I can fuffer no Want, unlels I fhould be vifited 
with Sicknefs and Diftempers. However, to put 
the Queflion out of Difpuce; you fee our Manner ; 
we are in this Place five Perfons of Rank we live per- 
fectly retir'd, as fuited to a State of Banifhtnent * 
we have fomething refcu'd from the Shipwreck of 
our Fortunes, which keeps us from the meer Necef- 
iity of hunting for our Food * but the poor Soldiers 
who are here, without that Help, live in as much 
Plenty as we, who go into the Woods and catch Sa- 
bles and Foxes * the Labour of a Month will main- 
tain them a Year •, and as the Way of living is not 
expenfive, fo it is not hard to get fiifficient to our- 
felves. So that Obje&ion is out of Doors* 

I have not room to give a full Account of the moft 
agreeable Convention I had with this truly great 
Man i in ail which he fliew'd, that his Mind was 
fo infpu'd with a fuperior Knowledge of Things, fo 
fupported by Religion, as well as by a vaft Share 
of Wifdom * that his Contempt of the World was 
really as much, as he had expreis'd, and that he 
was always the fame to the lalt, as will appear in 
the Story I am going to tell. 

I had been here 8 Months, and a dark dreadful 
Winter I thought it to be, the Cold fo intenfe that 
I could not fo much as look abroad without being 
tvrapt in Furs, and a Mask of Fur before my Face, 
or rather a Hood with only a Hole for Breath, and 
two for Sight : The little Day-light we had, was, 
as we reckoned, for three Months, not above five 
Hours a day, and fix at moft j only that the Snow 

lying 



[ 304 ] 

lying on the Ground Continually, and the Weather 
clear, it was never quite dark : Our Horfes were kept 
("or rather ftarv'd) under Ground, and as for our 
Servants, for we hir'd three Servants here, to look 
after our Horfes and felves, we had every now and 
then their Fingers and Toes to thaw and take care of, 
left they fhould mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within Doors we were warm, the Hou- 
fes being clofe, the Walls thick, the Lights fmall, 
and the Glafs all double: Our Food was chiefly the 
Flefh of Deer dry'd and cur'd in the Seafon 5 good 
Bread enough, but bak'd as Biskets ; dry'd Fifh of 
ieveral Sorts, and fome Flefh of Mutton, and of 
the Buffeloes, which is pretty good Beef: All the 
Stores of Provifion for the Winter are laid up in the 
Summer, and well cur'd $ our Drink was Water 
mix'd with Aqua-vitae inftead of Brandy, and for 4 
Treat, Mead inftead of Wine, which, however, they 
have excellent good :TheHunters,who venture abroad 
all Weathers, frequently brought us in frefh Venif- 
on, very fat and good, and fometimes Bears Flefh, 
but we did not much care for the laft : We had a 
good Stock of Tea, with which we treated our 
Friends, as above $ and in a word, we liv'd very 
chearfully and well, all things confider'd. 

It was now Marcb^ the Days grown confiderably 
longer, and the Weather, at leaft, tolerable • 16 
other Travellers began to prepare Sleds to carry them 
over the Snow, and to get things ready to be going * 
but my Meafures being fix'd, as I have faid, for 
jfrcb- 4figel) and not for Mufcovy or the Baltzck, I 
made no Motion •, knowing very well that the Ships 
from the South do not fet out for that Part of the 
World till May or June, and that if I was there by 
the beginning of Auguft, it would be as foon as any 
Ships would be ready to go away $ and therefore, I 
fay, I made no hafte to be gone, as others did ; in a 
word, I faw a great many People, nay, all the Tra- 
vellers go away before me : It Jeems every Year they 



C 3°5 ] 

go from thence to Myfcow for Trade, (viz.) to car- 
ry Furs, and buy NecefTaries with them, which 
they bring back to furnifh their Shops-, alfo 
others went of the fame Errand to Arch-Angel, but 
then they alfo being to come back again above 800 
Miles, went all out before me. 

In Ihort, about the latter End of May I began to 
make all ready to pack up * and as I was doing this, 
it occurred to me, that feeing all thefe People were 
banifli'd by the Cz3r of Aiufcovy to Siberia, and yet 
when they came there, were left at Liberty to go 
whither they woiild * why did they not then go 
away to any Part of the World wherever they thought 
fit? and I began to examine what fhould hinder 
them from making fuch an Attempt. 

But my Wonder was over, wheri I entered upon 
that Subject with the Perfon I have mentioned, who 
anfwer'd me thus : Confider, Firft, Sir, faid he, the 
Place where wis are$ and Secondly, the Condition we 
are in$ efpecially, faid hetheGenerallity of thePeople 
who are banifhM hither $ we are furrounded, faid he, 
with ftronger Things than Bars and Bolts-, on the 
North Side an unnavigable Ocean, where Ship never 
faiPd, and Boat never fwam * neither, if we had 
both, could we know where to go with them : Eve- 
ry other Way, faid he, we have above a thoufarid 
Miles to pafs thro' the Czar's own Dominions, and 
By Ways utterly unpaffable, except by the Roads 
made by the Government, and thro 5 the Towns gar- 
rifon'd by his Troops ^ fo that we could neither 
pafs undifcover'd by the Road, or fubfift any btber 
Way ; fo that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I was filenc'd indeed ac once, and found that they 
were in a Prifon, every Jot as feture as if they had 
beenlock'dup in the Cattle at Mnfcow*, However, ic 
came into my Thoughts, that I might tetrainly be 
made an Inftrument to procure the Efcape of this 
excellent Perfon, and that whatever Hazard 1 run, I 
would certainly try if I could carry him off; Upon 

U this 



[ 3 o6 ] 

this I took an Occafion one Evening to tell him my 
Thoughts : I reprefented to him, that it was ve- 
ry eafy for me to carry him away, there being no 
Guard over him in the Country $ and as I was not 
going to Mufcow, but to Arch-Angel y and that I 
went in the nature of a Caravan, by which I was 
nor oblig'd to lye in the ftationary Towns in the 
Defart, but could encamp every Night where I 
would, we might eafily pafs uninterrupted, to 
Arch- Angel, where 1 would immediately fecure him 
on board an Englifi or Dutch Ship, and carry him 
off fafe along with me $ and as to his Subfiftence, 
and other Particulars, that fhould be my Care, 'till 
he could better fupply himfelf. 

He heard me very attentively, and look'd earnefl> 
ly on me all the while I fpoke 5 nay, I could fee in 
his very Face, that what I faid put his Spirits into 
an exceeding Ferment * his Colour frequency 
chang'd, his Eyes look'd red, and his Heart flut- 
tered, that it might be even perceiv'd in his Counte- 
nance 5 nor could he immediately anfwer me : When 
I had done, and as it were expefred what he would 
fay to it 5 and after he had paus'd a little he em- 
brac'd me, and faid how unhappy are we ! unguard- 
ed Creatures as we are, that even ourgreatefts A£b 
of Friendfhip are made Snares to us, and we are 
made Tempters of one another! My dear Friend, 
faid be, your Offer is fo fincere, has fuch Kindnefs 
in it, is fo difinterefted in itfelf, and is fo calculated 
for my Advantage, that I muft have very little* 
Knowledge of the World, if I did not both won- 
der at it, and acknowledge the Obligation 1 have 
upon me to you for it : But did you believe I was 
fincere in what I have fo often faid to you of my 
Contempt of the World ? Did you believe I fpoke 
my very Soul to you, and that I had really obtain'd 
that Degree of Felicity here, that had plac'd me a- 
bove all that the World could give me, or do for 
me ? Did you believe I was fincere^ when I told 

you 



[ 307 3 

you I would not go back, if I was re-call'd even 
to be all, that once I was, in the Court and with 
the Favour of the Czar my Matter > Did you believe 
me, my Friend, to be an honeft Man, or did you 
think me to be a boafting Hypocrite ? Here he flop- 
ped, as if he would hear what I would fay, but in- 
deed, I foon after perceived, that he ftopp'd becaufe 
his Spirits were in Motion, his great Heart was full 
of Struggles, and he could not go on : I was, I con- 
fefs, aftonifh'd at the thing as well as at the Man, 
and I us'd fome Arguments with him to urge him to 
fet himfelf free : That he ought to look upon jthis 
as a Door open'd by Heaven for his Deliverance •, and 
a Summons by Providence, who as the Care and 
Difpofition of all Events, to do himfelt good, and 
to render himfelf ufeful in the World. 

He had bv this time recovered himfelf : How do 
you know Sir, fays he warmly, that inftead of a 
Summons from Heaven, it may be a Feint of ano- 
ther Iniirument > Representing in all the alluring 
Colours -to me the Shew of Felicity as a Deliverance* 
whiqh may in itfelf be my Snare, and tends direftly 
to my Ruin : Here I am free from the Temptation 
of returning to my former miferableGreatnefs $ there 
I am not fure, but that all the Seeds of Pride, Am- 
bition, Avarce and Luxury, which I know remain 
in Nature, may revive and take Root, and in a 
Word, again overwhelm me, and then the happy 
Pfifoner, who you lee now Matter of his Soul's Li- 
berty, fhall be the miferahle Slave of his own Sen- 
fes, in the Full of all perfonal Liberty : Dear Sir, 
let me remain in this bleffed Confinement, banifh'd 
from the Crimes of Life, rather than purchafe a 
Shew of Freedom, at the Expence of the Liberty 
of my Reafon, and at the Expence of the future 
Happinefs which now I have in my View, but fhall 
then, I fear, quickly lofe Sight of it h for 1 am brit 
Flefh, a Man, a meer Man, have Paflions and Af- 
fettions as likely to poffefs and overthrow me as

any Man : O be not my Friend, and my Tempter 
both together ! 

If I was furpriz'd before, I was quite dumb now, 
and flood filent, looking at him, and indeed admir'd 
at what I faw •, the Struggle in his Soul was fo great, 
that tho 5 the Weather wa$ extreamly cold, it put 
him into a moll violent Sweat, and I found he 
wanted to give Vent to his Mind * fo 1 laid a Word 
or two, that I would leave him to confider of it, 
and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my 
own Apartment. 

•Abotlt two Hours after I heard fome Body at, of 
near, the Door of my Room, and I was going to 
open the Door, but he had open'd it, and came in : 
My dear Friend, fays &e, you had alm©ft overfet me, 
but I am recover'd * do not take it ill that I do not 
tlofe with your Offer, I affure you, 'tis not for want 
of a Senfe of the Kindnefs of it in you, and I catae 
to make the moft fincere Acknowledgment of it to 
you $ but I hope I have got the Victory over myfelf. 

My Lord, faii J, I hope you ars fully fatisfy'd 
that you do not refift the Call of Heaven. Sir, faii 
he y if it had been from Heaven, the fame Power 
would have influenc'd me to accept it ; but I hope, 
and am fully fatisfy'd, that it is from Heaven that I 
decline ir, and I have an infinite Satisfaction in the 
Parting, that you (hall leave me an honeft Man ft ill, 
tho 5 not a free Man. 

I had nothing to do but to acquiefce, and makfc 
Profeffions to him of my having no End in it, but a 
fincere Defire to ferve him : He embraced me very 
paffionately, and aflur'd me, he was fenfible of that; 
and fhould always acknowledge it, and with that he 
offer'd me a very fine Prefent of Sables, too much 
indeed for me to accept, from a Man in his Circum- 
ftances, and I would have avoided them, but he 
would not be refus'd. 

The next Morning I fent my Servant to his Lord* 
fliip, with a fmall Prefent of Tea, two IVv .of 

China 



C 309 1 

China Damask, and four little Wedges of JapoP 
Gold, which did not all weigh above fix Ounces* 
or thereabout, but were far fhort of the Value of 
his Sables, which, indeed, when I came to England^ 
I found worth near 200 /. He accepted the Tea, 
and one Piece of the Damask, and one of the Pieces 
of Gold, which had a fine Stamp upon it, of the 
Japan Coinage, which 1 found he took for the 
Rariety of it, but would not take any more •, and fenc 
Word by my Servant that he defired to fpeakwith me. 
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what 
had pafs'd between us, and hop'd I would not 
move him any more in that Affair •, but that fince I 
made fuch a generous Offer to him, he ask'd me, 
if I had Kindnefs enough to offer the fame to an- 
other Perfon that he would name to me, in whom he 
had a great Share of Concern* I told him, that I could 
not fay I enclin'd to do fo much for any one but him- 
felf, for whom I had a perticular Value, and fhould 
havebeen glad to have been the Inftrument of his De- 
liverance * however, if he would pleafe to name the 
Perfon to me, I would give him my Anfwer, and 
hop'd he would not be difpleafed with me, if he was 
with my Anfwer : He told me, it was only his Son^ 
who, tho 5 1 had not feen, yet was in the fame Condi- 
tion with himfelf, and above two hundred Miles 
from him, on the other Side the Oby •, but that if I 
confented, he would fend for him. 

I made no Hefitation, but told him I would do 
it : I made fome Ceremony in letting him under- 
fland that it was wholly on his Account, and 
that feeing I could not prevail on him, I would 
fliew my Refpeft to him, by my Concern for his 
Son •, but thefe Things are to tedious to repeat 
here : He fent away the next Day for his Son, and 
in about Twenty Days he came back with the 
Meffenger, bringing fix or feven Horfes, loaded 
with very rich Furs, and which in the whole, 
amounted to a very great Value, 

U 3 His, 



p [ 3fo ] 

His Servants brought the Horfes into the Town 
but left the young Lord at a Diftance, till Night 
when he came incognito into our Apartment, and 
his Father prefented him to me^ and in fhort, we 
concerted there the manner of our travelling, and 
every Thing proper for the Journey. 

I had bought a confiderable Quantity of Sa- 
bles, black Fox Skins, fine Ermines, and fuch 
other Furs as are very rich; 1 fay, I had bought them 
in that City in Exchange for fome of the Goods 
brought from China ; in particular for the Cloves 
and Nutmegs, of which, I fold the greateft Part 
here, and the reft afterwards at Arch Angel, for a 
much better Price than I could have done at Lon- 
don 5 and my Partner who was fenfible of the Profit, 
and whofe Bufinefs more particularly than mine 
was Merchandife, was mightily pieas'd with our 
Stay, on Account of the Traffick we made here. 

It was the beginning of June, when I left this 
remote Place, a City, I believe, little heard of in 
the World ^ and indeed it is fo far out of the 
Road of Commerce, that I know not how it fhould 
be much talk'd of We were now come to a very 
fmall Caravan, being only thirty two Horfes and 
Camels in all, and all of them pafs'd for mine, tho 3 
my new Gueft was Proprietor of eleven of them * 
it was moft natural alfb that I fhould take more 
Servants with me than I had before, and the young 
Lord pafs'd for my Steward ^ what great Man I 
pafs'd for my felf, I know nor, neither did it con- 
cern me to enquire •, we had here, the worlt and the 
largeft Defart to pafs over that we met with in all 
the Journey ^ indeed I call it the worft, becaufe 
the Way was very deep in fome Places, and very 
uneven in others ^ the beft we had to fay for it, was, 
that we thought we had no Troops of Tartars and 
Robbers to fear, and that they never came on this 
Side the River GZ% or at leaft, but very feldomj 
but we found it otherwife. 

My 



C 3ii 1 

My young Lord had with him, a faithful Mnfco- 
vite Servant, or rather a Siberian Servant, who was 
perfe&ly acquainted with the Country * and who, 
led us by private Roads, that we avoided coming 
in to the principal Towns and Cities, upon the great 
Road, fuch as Tumen^ Soly Kamskoi, and feveral 
others -, becaufe the Mufcovite Garrifons which are 
kept there, are very curious and drift in their Ob- 
fervation upon Travellers $ and ferching leaft any 
of the banifh'd Perfbns of Note fhould make their 
Efcape that Way into Mufcovy * but by this means 
as we were kept out of the Cities, fo our whole 
Journey was a Defert, and we were oblig'd to en- 
camp and lye in our Tents, when we might have 
had very good Accommodation in the Cities on 
the Way : This the young Lord was fo fenfible of, 
that he would not allow us to lye abroad, when we 
came to feveral Cities, on the Way, but lay abroad 
himfelf with his Servant in the Woods, and met 
us always at the appointed Places. 

We were juft enter'd Europe^ having pafs'd the 
River Kama^ which in thefe Parts, is the Boundary 
between Europe and /[ia, and the firft City on the 
European Side was calFd Soloy-Kamaskoy, which is 
as much as to lay, the great City, on the River 
Kama $ and here we thought to have feen fome evi- 
dent Alteration in the People, their Manner, their 
Habit, their Religion, and their Bufinefs * but we 
were miftaken, for as we had a vaft Defart to pafs, 
which by Relation, is near feven hundred Miles long 
in fome Places, but not above two hundred Miles 
over where we pafs'd it 5 fo till we came paft that 
horrible Place 4 we found very little Difference be- 
tween that Country and the Mogul Tartary $ the Peo- 
ple, moftly Pagans, and little better than the Sava-^ 
ges of America h their Houfes and Towns full of 
Idols, and their Way of Living wholly barbarous, 
except in the Cities as above, and the Villages near 
them 5 where they are Chriftians as they call thenn 
U 3 " felves* 



[ 3** 1 

felves, of the Greek Church § but even thefe have 
their Religion mingled with fo many Reliques of 
Superftition, that it is fcarce to be known in fome 
Places from meer Socery and Witchcraft. 

In 'patting this Forreft, I thought indeed we muft, 
after all our Dangers were in our Imagination 
efcap'd, is before, have been plundered and robb'd, 
and perhaps murther'd by a Troop of Thieves * of 
what Country they were, whether the roving Bands 
of the Oftiachi, a Kind of Tartan, or wild People 
on the Bank of the Obi, had rang'd thus far, or 
whether they were the Sable-Hunters of Siberia, I 
am yet at a Lofs to know * but they were all on 
Horfeback, carry'd Bows and Arrows, and were at 
firft about five and forty in Number •, they came 
fo near to us, as within about two Mufquet Shot, 
and asking no Queftions, they furrounded us with 
their Horfe, and look'd very earneftlv upon us twice* 
at length they plac'd themfelves jutt in our Way, 
upon which, we drew up in a little Line befour our 
Camels, being not above fixteen Men in all* and 
being drawn up thus, we halted and fent out the 
Siberian Servant, who attended his Lord, to fee who 
they were * his Mafter was the more willing to let 
him go, becaufe he was not a little apprehenfive, 
that they were a Siberian Troop fent out after him: 
The Man came up near them with a Flag of 
Truce, and call'd to them * bur tho' he fpoke fe- 
veral of their Languages or Diale&s of Languages 
rather, he could not underftand a Word they faid * 
however, after fome Signs to him, not to come 
nearer to them at his Peril* fo he laid he under- 
ftood them to mean offering to (hoot at him if he 
?dvanc 5 d * the Fellow came back no wifer than he 
went, only that by their Drefs, he faid, be bsliev'd 
them to be feme Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Cir- 
cajfian Hoords * and that there mult be more of them 
ppon the great Defart, tho' he never heard that 
$ny of them ever were feen fo far North before. 



[ 3*3 ] 

This was fmall Comfort to us ; however, we had 
no Remedy -, there was on our left Hand at about 
a Quarter of a Mile's Diftance, a little Grove or 
Clump of Trees which flood clole together, and 
very near the Road * I immediately refolv'd we 
would advance to thofe Trees, and fortify ourfelves 
as well as we could there $ for firit I confidered, 
that the Trees would in a great Meafure cover us 
from their Arrows, and in the next Place, they could 
not come to charge us to a Body ^ it was indeed my 
old Portugueje Pilot who propofed it, and who had 
this Excellency attending him, namely, that he was 
always read ie ft and moft apt to direft and encourage 
us in Caies of the moft Danger ; we advanced 
immediately with what Speed we could, and gain'd 
that little Wood, the Tartars or Thieves,for we knew 
not what to call them, keeping their Stand, and 
not attempting to hinder us: When we came thi- 
ther, we found to our great Satisfa&ion, that it 
was a fwampy fpringy Piece of Ground, and on 
the one Side, a very great Spring of Water, which 
running out in a little Rill or Brook, was a little 
farther, join'd by another of the like Bignefs, and 
was in (nort, the Head or Source of a confiderable 
River, call'd afterwards the Whuka $ the Trees 
which grew about this Spring, were not in all above 
two hundred, but were very large, and flood pretty 
thick $ fo that asfoon as we got in, we faw ourfelves 
perfectly fafe from the Enemy, unlefs they alighted 
and attacked us on Foot, 

But to make this more difficult, our Portugueze y 
with indefatigable Application, cut down great Arms 
of the Trees, and laid them hanging not cut quite off 
from one Tree to another, fo that he made a conti- 
nued Fence almoft round us. 

We ftay'd here waiting the Motion of the Enemy 
fome Hours, without perceiving they made any of- 
fer to ftir ^ when about two Hours before Night, 
they came down dire&ly upon us, and tho 5 we had 

not 



[3*4] 

not perceiv'd it, we found they had been join'd by 
fome more of the fame, io that they were near 
fourfcore Horfe, whereof however, we fancy 5 d fome 
were Women : They came on till they were within 
half Shot of our little Wood, when we fir'd one 
Mufquet without Ball, and calPd to them in the 
Ruffian Tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid 
them keep off * but as if they knew nothing of 
what we faid they came on with a doable Fury di- 
re£lly up to the Wood fide, not imagining we were 
fb barricado'd that they could not break in * our old 
Pilot was our Captain, as well as he had been our 
Engineer * and defir'd of us, not to fire upon them 
till they came within Piitol-Shot, and that we might 
fee fure to kill, and that when we did fire, we fhould 
be fure to take good Aim •, we bad him give the 
Word of Command 5 which he delayed fo long, 
that they were fome of them within two Pikes 
length of us when we fir'd. 

We aim'd fo true, Cor Providence directed our 
Shot fo furej that we kilPd fourteen of them, at 
the firlt Volley^ and wounded feverai others, as alfo 
fcveral of their Horfes^ for we had all of us loadedjour 
Pieces with two or three Bullets a peice at leaft. 

They were terribly furpriz'd with our Fire, and 
retreated immediately about one Hundred Rods 
from us * in which Time, we loaded our Pieces 
again, and feeing them keep that Diftance, we fal- 
ly'd out and catch'd four or five of their Horfes, 
whofe Riders we fuppos'd, werekill'd, and coming 
up to the dead, we could eafily perceive they were 
Tartars^ but knew not from what Country, or how 
they came to make an Excurfion fuch an unufual 
Length. 

About an Hour after they made a Motion to at- 
tack us again, and rode round our little Wood, to 
fee where elfe they might break in •, but finding us 
always ready to Face them, they went off again, and 
we refolv'd not to ftir from the Place for that Night. 

We 



C 3*5 ] 

We flept little you may be fure, but fpent the 
moft Part of the Night in ftrengthning our Situati- 
on, and barricadoing the Entrances into the Wood, 
and keeping a ftri& Watch, we waited for Day- 
Light, and when it came, it gave us a very unwel- 
come Difcovery indeed $ for the Enemy, who we 
thought were difcouraged with the Reception they 
had met with, were now encreas'd to no lefs than 
three hundred, and had fet up e?even or twelve Huts 
and Tents, as if they were refblv'd to befiege us ; 
and this little Camp they had pitch'd upon the open 
Plain, at about three Quarters of a Mile from us. 
We were indeed furpriz'd at this Difcovery ^ and 
now I confefs, I gave my felt over for loft, and all 
that I had, The Lofs of my EfFefts did not lye fo 
near me, (tbd* they were very corjiderable) as the 
Thoughts of falling into the Hands of fuch Barbaric 
ans^ at the latter End of my Journey, after fo many 
Difficulties and Hazards as I had gone thro' h and 
even in Sight of our Port, where we expe&ed Safe- 
ty and Deliverance ^ as for my Partner, he was ra- 
ging i he declared, that to lofe his Goods would be 
his Ruin •, and he would rather die than be ff arv'd -, 
and he was for fighting to laft the Drop. 

The young Lord, as gallant as ever Flefh fhewM 
itfelf, was for fighting to the laft alfo •, and my old 
Pilot was of the Opinion we were able to refill them 
all, in the Situation we then were in -, and thus we 
fpent the Day ip Debates of what we fhould do $ but 
towards Evening, we found that the Number of our 
Enemies ftill encreas'd, perhaps as they were 
abroad in feveral Parties for Prey * the firft had fenc 
out Scouts to call for Help, and to acquaint them 
of the Booty, and we did not know, but by the 
Morning they might ftill be a greater Number $ fo 
I began to enquire of thofe People we had brought 
from Tobolsk^ if there was no other, or more pri- 
vate Ways by which we might avoid them in the 

Nighr, 



[ 3t6 ] 

Night, and perhaps either retreat to fome Town, oar 
get Help to guard us over the Defart. 

The Syberiatt, who was Servant to the young Lord^ 
told us, if we defign'd to avoid them and not fight, 
he would engage to carry us off in the Night, to a 
Way that went North towards the River Petrou, by 
which he made no Queftion, but we might get a- 
way, and the Tartars never the wifer $ but he faid, 
his Lord had told him, he would not retreat, but 
would rather chufe to fight. I told him, he mis- 
took his Lord, for that he was too wife a Man to 
love fighting for the fake of it •, that I knew his 
Lord was brave enough by what he had fhew'd al- 
ready 5 but that his Lord knew better, than to de- 
fire to have feventeen or eighteen Men fight five hun- 
dred, unlefs an unavoidable Neceffity forc'd them to 
it 5 and that if he thought it pofllble for us to efcape 
in the Night, we had nothing elfe to do but to at- 
tempt it. He anfwer'd if his Lord gave him fuch 
Orders, he would lofe his Life if he did not per- 
form it ; we foon brought his Lord to give that Or- 
der, tho' privately, and we immediately prepaid 
for the putting it in Pra&ice. 

And firft, as foon as it began to be dark, we kind- 
led a Fire in our little Camp, which we kept burn- 
ing, and prepared fo as to make it burn all Nighr, 
that the Tartars might conclude we were ftill there $ 
hut as foon as it was dark, (that is to fay) fo as we 
could fee the Stars (for our Guide would not ftir 
before) having all our Horfes and «CameIs ready 
loaden, we followed our new Guide, who i foon 
found fteer'd himfelf by the Pole, or North Star, all 
the Country being level for a long Way. 

After we had travelPd two Hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter ftill, not that it was quite dark 
all Night, but the Moon began to rife, fo that in 
fhort, it was rather lighter than we wifh'd it to be ; 
but by fix a Clock the next Morning we were gotten 
near forty Miles, tho 5 the Truth is, we almoft 

fpoil'd 



[ 3*7 1 

fpoiFd our Horfes. Here we found a RvJJian Village 
named Kirmazimkoy, where we refted, and heard 
nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that Day -, about 
two Hours before Night we fet out again, and tra- 
velFd till eight the next Morning, tho' not quite fo 
Haftily as before, and about feven a Clock ue pa£ 
fed a little River call'd Kirtza, and came to a good 
large Town inhabited by RuJJiam^ and very popu- 
lous, call'd Ozomoys, there we heard that feveral 
Troops or Hoords of Calmnch had been abroad up- 
on the Defart, but that we were now compleatly out 
of Danger of them, which was to our great Satif- 
faftion you may be fure. Here we were oblig'd to 
get fome frelh Horfes, and having need enough of 
Rett, we ftay'd five Days •, and my Partner and I 
agreed to give the honeft Syberian, who brought us 
thither, the Value of ten Piftoles, for his conduc- 
ing us. 

In five Days more we came to Veujlima, upon the 
River Witzogia^ which running into the Dwitia, we 
were there very happily near the end of our Travels 
by Land, that River being navigable in feven Days 
Paflage to Arch- Angel: From hence we came to 
Lawrenshy where the River joins the 3^ of July t% 
and provided ourfelves with two Luggage Boats, 
and a Barge for cur own Convenience, we embark'd 
the 7th, and arrived all fafe at Arch- Angel the 1 8th, 
having been a Year, five Months and three Days 
on the Jctirney, including our Stay of eight Months 
and odd Days at Tobohki. 

We were oblig'd to ftay at this Place fix Weeks 
for the Arrival of the Ships, and muft have tarry'd 
longer, had not a Hamburgher come in above a 
Month fooner than any of the Evglifl) Ships 5 when 
after fome Confideration, that the City of Hamburgh 
might happen to be as good a Market for our Goods 
as London^ we all took Freight with him, and hav- 
ing put my Good on board, it was moft natural for 
tne to put my Steward on board to take care of 

th€07$

them, by which means my young Lord had a fuffi- 
cient Opportunity to conceal himfeif, never coming 
on Shore again in all the time we ftay'd there •, and 
this he did, that he might not be feen in the City, 
where fbme of the Miifcow Merchants would cer- 
tainly have leen and difcover'd him. 

We faiTd from Arch- Angel the 20th of Augitfl the 
fame Year, and after no extraordinary bad Voyage, 
arriv'd in the Elbe the i^tb of September. Here my 
Partner and I found a very good fail for our Goods, 
as well thole of China as the Sables, &c. of Syberia $ 
and dividing the Produce of our Effe£b, my Share 
amounted to 3475— 17 — ?i. notwithftanding To 
many Lofles we had fuftainM, and Charges we had 
been at $ only remembring that I had included in 
this, about fix hundred Pounds worth of Diamonds 
which I had purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young Lord took his leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe in order to go to the Court of 
Vienna, where he refolv'd to feek Prote&ion, and 
where he could correfpond with thofe of his Fa- 
ther's Friends who were left alive: He did not 
part without all the Teftimonies he could give 
me of Gratitude for the Service I had done him, and 
his Sence of my Kindnefs to the Prince his Father. 

To conclude, having ftay'd near four Months 
in Hamburgh, I came from thence over Land to the 
Hague, where I embark'd in the Pacquer, and 
arrived in London the icth of January, 1705, having 
been gone from England ten Years and nine Months. 

And here, refolving to harrafs myfelf no more, 
I am preparing for a longer Journey than all thefe, 
having liv'd 72 Years a Life of infinite Variety, 
and leam'd fufficiently to know the Value of Retire- 
ment, and the Bleffing of ending our Days in Peace,
